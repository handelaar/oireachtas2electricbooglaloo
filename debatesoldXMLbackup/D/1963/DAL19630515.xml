      <P>I have received a proposal that I should make a grant of 50 per cent of the cost of a scheme for the improvement and equipment of farm buildings at St. Finian's Hospital, Killarney, but I have not received plans as mentioned in the question.  The scheme was estimated to cost £10,500.</P>
      <P>I have recently informed the health authority that I could not make a grant available and have suggested to them that they should reconsider their scheme in the light of considerations which I have put to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if the BAC 111 jet aircraft sanctioned for order by the Government have the automatic safety landing device; and, if not, if such equipment can be installed in these aircraft for the greater safety of the passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) (for the Minister for Transport and Power) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as an automatic landing device designed mainly for safety and, accordingly, there is no fully automatic landing system approved for use in civil aircraft.  Automatic landing devices are therefore primarily devices to improve regularity and punctuality rather than to improve safety.  The design of the BAC One-Eleven jet aircraft provides for the introduction of an automatic flight control system in progressive stages following the proving and certification of equipment and procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> Aer Lingus have, over the years, taken every precaution to ensure safety in the operation of their aircraft. The company was represented at the recent International Air Transport Association Technical Conference in Lucerne which discussed the problem of all-weather operation of aircraft. All-weather landings and takeoffs can only be introduced in step with development of suitable air and ground equipment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to infer from the Minister's reply that there is no automatic landing safety device available in any aircraft today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated in the reply, there is no such thing as an automatic landing device designed mainly for safety.  There are automatic landing devices which do not take safety considerations into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that there is an automatic safety landing device in aircraft today and that the BAC 111 has not got that automatic safety landing device?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I am informed that the installation of automatic landing devices for safety purposes in aircraft is not a practical proposition just now because there is no corresponding device and equipment on the ground at airports at which Aer Lingus aircraft, or indeed any other aircraft, would be landing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the fact that there is an up-to-date aircraft with an automatic safety landing device whereby the plane can take off in fog and land in fog and that this particular plane has not got that type of device?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Lingus would prefer to rely on the ordinary safety standards which take into account certain minima of visibility and other atmospheric conditions.  I think that is a far safer landing device by which to operate than the one the Deputy suggests.  I do not know if the plane <Col N="1507" /> the Deputy has in mind has that type of device but, if it has, my advice is that it is not functionable in present airfield conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Before a practicable proposal to extend the Arigna generating station can be formulated, it is necessary to establish that the coal reserves, which are of poor quality and are in thin seams, can be extracted at a cost which would make the use of the coal economic.  An investigation to that end is proceeding and will, I hope, be concluded this year.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the extent to which pupils of vocational schools may have found difficulty in attending classes during the recent bus strike but I appreciate that such difficulties may have arisen in some instances.</P>
      <P>However, under the Apprenticeship Act of 1959, I have no function in relation to the fixing of educational qualifications for apprentices.

      <P>I shall try to refer to as many items as possible, and to the more important aspects mentioned by Deputies in this debate.</P>
      <P>There was a query as to the use to which the Garda Depot in the Phoenix Park will be put when the new Depot is opened in Templemore.  It is anticipated that the present Depot will be used as the new Garda headquarters. It will be converted into a new headquarters for the Garda, including a headquarters for the Dublin Metropolitan Division, which, I understand, is at present in Kilmainham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was raised in regard to the National Library.  It is proposed to <Col N="1518" /> erect a new National Library on a site of about two acres which has been purchased by the State at Morehampton Road, Donnybrook.  The project is at the preliminary stage, and sketch plans have not yet been prepared. Naturally an estimate of the cost would not be available at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary when he says that a new National Library is to be erected, does he mean that an annexe will be built?  The library will not be moved away from where it is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am not the most competent person to deal with this matter in detail.  We get our instructions and we carry them out. The intention is that a completely new National Library will be erected.  Space will be left, and naturally the National Museum will be anxious to acquire it. I understand that an inter-departmental committee has been sitting on this whole question of the Arts, the National Gallery, the National Library, and so forth, for some time. To answer Deputy Dillon's question, it will be a completely new National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Deputy Desmond inquired about the new Garda station in Kinsale.  Some time ago, we invited tenders for the erection of a new station and married quarters, and the response was so poor &mdash;as a matter of fact, we got only one tender&mdash;that it has been decided to re-advertise.</P>
      <P>Deputy A.  Barry mentioned the building scheme at Shannon Airport. As he is now aware, the Office of Public Works have no responsibility for that building, nor do they maintain courthouses or the railings around courthouses.  Those are matters for another Department.  The Department of Transport and Power are responsible for the building at Shannon Airport, and the county councils are charged with the maintenance of county courthouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> Deputy Dillon referred to the proposed statue to Thomas Davis and asked for details of the bronze reliefs which form part of the scheme.  Details have not yet been worked out.  If Deputies so wish, I can make available in the Library the maquette of the statue.  I am sure it will meet with the approval of the House.</P>
    <P>Dungarvan Post Office was referred to by Deputy Kyne.  The site for the new post office building has been selected by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and legal formalities in connection with its acquisition are in hand.  Sketch plans of the new building are being prepared.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Brennan referred to the delay in securing a site for the new Garda station at Ashford.  As he said, efforts to secure a suitable site have been proceeding for some years past. Six sites have been investigated, all of which were unsuitable or unattainable for one reason or another.  Yet another is now being investigated, and it is our hope that at long last an amicable solution will be arrived at, and the erection of the station can go ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy S. Dunne inquired about Portmarnock school.  This contract was placed early in January.  Good progress has been made.  The foundations and rising walls are up and it is expected that it will be completed by May of next year.</P>
    <P>With regard to school improvement generally, I have to thank the Deputies for the various suggestions made.  The Planning Section will certainly bear them in mind.  It is invaluable to our Office to have these constructive suggestions made by Deputy Jones, who has practical experience of schools, and by members of local bodies who also have intimate knowledge of the position in regard to school buildings.  It is very helpful to our architects who study these debates that these suggestions should be made.</P>
    <P>I may say that the Minister for Education is very much alive to the desirability of providing water in every school and is considering how best that can be done.  He is also considering the question of increasing the space allocated per pupil.</P>
    <Col N="1520" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary mean the provision of water for old schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>For all schools.  Our Office is alive to the need to experiment with new ideas and new materials. Investigation of that matter is one of the functions of the Special Development Section set up some time ago in the Office.</P>
      <P>I had not proposed to deal with the question of new systems of building referred to by Deputy McQuillan and Deputy A. Barry.  Deputy McQuillan's remarks contained a great deal of sound commonsense with regard to the economics of prefabrication.  He is quite right in pointing out that the success of the prefabrication system depends on continuity.  In other words, to order one unit could be very expensive whereas if an agreed number of such prefabricated schools were ordered from the contractors over a period of years it would enable them to quote much more attractive terms.  It is only a matter of time until a very large portion of the school building programme will be carried out by prefabricated methods.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;prefabricated&rdquo; is rather a misnomer and suggests to the man-inthe-street a temporary timber structure. Some months ago the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> ran a competition inviting better names for this type of building.  One of the judges for the purposes of the competition was Sir Keith Josephs, Minister of Works in Britain.  The name chosen as the most suitable was &ldquo;Modular System&rdquo;, in which case an agreed unit is the basis for all design. It connotes building of a more permanent nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan asked what progress had been made with regard to the provision of a new type of school.  In my opening statement I cited the new school at Clondalkin and another school which show improvement in design.  The schools mentioned in my introductory remarks represent merely an approach to prefabrication.  We did send a mission last year to Britain comprised of members of my Office and an outside consultant on costings. They did a lot of good work.  They <Col N="1521" /> saw what were considered the best systems over there, the class-system, in particular, and since then we have been studying those systems.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to say that one particular system is the one that should be adopted in Ireland, having regard to our peculiar problems.  First of all, we have to ensure that Irish materials are used, such as cement, concrete roofing tiles and so on.  Then we have to pay particular attention, as mentioned by Deputy A. Barry, to the aesthetic qualities of the school.  I thoroughly agree with the Deputy that there could be nothing more appalling than to have a repetition all over rural Ireland of a stereotype school.  It is possible, of course, to have prefabricated schools produced according to the modular system, whereby the designers can produce variations on a theme, providing for different finishes of concrete, different finishes on the walls, concrete roofing tiles, all Irish materials and no imported materials.  That is the question which is occupying our minds at the present time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the necessity to have an agreed design, an agreed programme and continuity of work, we have received every encouragement from the Minister for Education.  Of course, the only solution is to put up for tender an agreed minimum number of schools for a minimum period of, say, five to seven years.  The capital cost of setting up a factory that would prefabricate is very high.  To ensure success, continuity and a minimum number of schools must be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education made a rather interesting suggestion, namely, that we should start on a section of the country.  I think it was Deputy Corish or Deputy Kyne who last year asked what happens the rest of the school building programme while this prefabricated system is in the embryonic stage and would there be an upset to the planned programme.  That is a problem.  It would appear that the proper method, as the Minister suggested and asks us to consider, is to take a section of the country, say, a diocese or two dioceses.  That would have obvious advantages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> It is quite true, as Deputy McQuillan pointed out, that building costs could be reduced substantially by changing over to prefabrication, but not to the extent he mentioned.  A saving of ten per cent to 15 per cent might be achieved on the orthodox school, but certainly not 66? as he mentioned. As Deputies who study the Book of Estimates will appreciate, such a saving would be very great.  Deputy Jones advocated that, with such a saving, it should be possible to improve conditions, furniture, and so on in these schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>More colour, perhaps. But that is not dependent on prefabrication.  We will bear the suggestion in mind.  The big advantage in this type of building is, of course, the speed of erection.  Deputy Treacy and others were interested in this aspect. There again, however, the improvement in speed would not be anything like what Deputy McQuillan suggested; he visualised the orthodox school normally built in nine months erected in a few weeks.  The nine to twelve months school could certainly, with proper planning and co-ordination, be erected in 12 to 14, or 16, weeks.</P>
      <P>Deputies may ask why we have in mind the dioceses.  It is a matter of economics.  There would be no point in putting a factory in Clonmel and starting the first contracts in Donegal. The radius of operation must be an economic one of 60 to 80 miles.  The idea would be to complete contracts in one area, such as Clonmel, and then move on to Athlone, and from there down to Tralee, and so on.  The reason I devote so much time to this matter is that I regard this as an exciting new experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone will this system of construction be important from the point of view of schools; it will also be important from another point of view.  One of the big problems confronting the Minister for <Col N="1523" /> Local Government&mdash;it is a problem he has been studying for some months now&mdash;is that of supplying rural cottages, of which we need 14,000 to 15,000 at the moment.  It is impossible to get contractors and, even if one is successful in getting contractors, they are not anxious to undertake this work.  There is a readymade case for prefabrication.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to drainage, the priority list was not drawn up by me. It was based on the information available at the time it was drawn up as to the need for drainage in the different areas and the Parliamentary Secretary of the day got the best technical advice possible.  Successive Governments have stuck to these <Col N="1524" /> priority lists, with one notable exception.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A very slight one that everyone would forgive.  It did not occur in my time.  When these lists were drawn up, local conditions and geographical conditions were taken into consideration.  Deputies on both sides can argue <i>ad nauseam</i> as to why certain rivers in their constituencies are not being drained and as to why it will be so many years before they are drained.  I admit Deputies are in an embarrassing position when they go out to meet their farmer constituents and try to explain to them that, because of the method and procedure adopted, the surveys and the publishing of the statutory requirements, and so on, it will be many years before their problems as far as drainage is concerned are solved.</P>
      <P>I have had a certain experience in this matter.  I subjected my very capable predecessor, Deputy J. Brennan, to a great deal of pressure. In Limerick, there is the huge catchment area of the Mulcair which drains some hundreds of thousands of acres. I could not understand why that area should not be drained.  I have been in the Office of Public Works now for nearly two years.  The first week I went in there, I sent for the file on the Mulcair and I said to the very able Commissioners: &ldquo;Let us get down to this now and get work started.  My constituents expect me to make an announcement about this shortly,&rdquo; but it had to take its place on the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is still on the list but we are fast approaching these areas for survey. As for bouncing or hopping the list, it would not be very smart.  Politically, it would be most unwise for any Government because if I jumped the list in Limerick, a colleague of mine in my own Party from Cork or somewhere else would create trouble.  There is great credit due to successive Governments for agreeing that these lists should be prepared by conscientious and independent technical <Col N="1525" /> advisers and for sticking to these lists rigidly since.</P>
    <P>The intermediate river schemes were mentioned.  Four of these are selected every year.  There are 400 possible schemes which are based on geographical distribution having regard to other large-scale schemes carried out, in progress or in contemplation. Schemes have been selected for the following counties: Cork, Sligo-Leitrim, Dublin, Waterford, Wexford, Donegal, Roscommon, Tipperary, Clare and Mayo.  The Roscommon catchment selected is the Knockcroghery or Ballyglass and the scheme is now at the design stage.  The County Cork scheme is the Upper Lee and the survey is starting shortly.  As I pointed out already, a survey of the Boyne catchment has been carried out and a scheme is being designed. I also mentioned that the Suir is being surveyed.  Surveys of the Boyle, which includes the Lung, will commence in the current year.  The Dromore, mentioned by Deputy Dillon, is included in the portion of the Erne catchment for which a scheme is at present being designed. So far as the Suck scheme is concerned, as has been frequently indicated, this is linked with the major scheme for the relief of the Shannon flooding with no possible let-out clauses.</P>
    <P>The Government have announced that the surveys recommended in the published joint report of the ESB and the Office of Public Works engineers, commonly known as the Rydell Report, will be commenced as soon as the staff required is available.  That is not being evasive.  I think the number of engineers mentioned was 30.  If any Deputy would like to have an appreciation of our problem in regard to certain technical staff, I shall be only too glad either to explain it to him personally with my officials or to write to him in detail.  It is not an easy problem.  It is easy for Deputy McQuillan to stand up here and slag my Office for not getting this Shannon drainage under way before now but those are the facts.</P>

      <P>I think the contract was signed.  On this question of the shortage of engineers and the length of time required to complete a survey, to minimise the difficulties resulting from the inadequate supply of engineers, a scheme for the training of engineering technicians is being instituted. Deputies will recall that last year I mentioned architectural trainees. Even if we had a university in Limerick, in Clonmel, in Waterford, Athlone or in other cities, there is a high percentage of children whose parents cannot afford to send their children to such universities and even if they could, they might not be able to allow them to stay on for that length of time.  I am talking about matters that obtain at the present time.  This pilot scheme of ours started last year in respect of 20 architectural trainees has been quite successful.  Last year, they were picked on the Leaving Certificate results.  We have changed that this year.  Last year maybe we were wrong because it was too high a standard.  We have also reduced the age.</P>

In regard to these 20 architectural trainees who were selected on the results of the Leaving Certificate examination and personal interview, we have received <Col N="1527" /> great co-operation from the Bolton Street College of Technology.  These trainees also get practical experience not only in the drawing office in the Office of Public Works but out on the job with one of the architects.  The beauty of it is that they are paid on a yearly rising scale from the first week they take up employment with us.  Therefore, instead of a parent having to pay digs for his child in Dublin, these children are being paid.</P>

However, they can ultimately&mdash;I do not believe many of those 20 will&mdash;sit for the examinations of the professional body, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland.  The interesting point is that the State guarantees each one of these employment.  I have digressed. I was speaking about similar courses which are starting this year for engineering technicians.  A scheme for the training of engineering technicians is being instituted and we sincerely hope that when these technicians are available after a while&mdash;these young lads do not have to have served their full time&mdash;the survey programme can be accelerated.  Some of our engineers are being used at present doing work it was never contemplated a professional engineer should do, such as plotting monotonous work that goes on month after month, year after year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We have consulted the professional bodies and the Chairman and Commissioners have always had the happiest relations with professional bodies.  Our top technical advisers keep in constant touch with the professors in the appropriate Faculties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey of a major catchment is an enormous task, involving hundreds <Col N="1528" /> of miles of channel, embankments and bridges, consideration of interference with property and rights of various kinds.  I dwell on this in order to try to educate Deputies and explain it to them as I myself learned it.  Since 1954, while in Opposition, I did not appreciate the difficulties involved and I now admit that my criticism was really unfounded to some extent.  If Deputies go to the Library and read the debates on the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, they will see that on all sides it was urged that we should hasten slowly and, above all, preserve the rights of the small man as well as the big man when property was being drained and give him every opportunity to see what was happening and if his property was in danger, and to provide arbitration clauses and so on.</P>
    <P>It takes quite a while to survey small plots to lay out labourers' cottages but in a major catchment hundreds of miles of channel are involved.  Then there is the plotting of the survey, making the ordinary human errors, going back and checking.  Then there is the designing of bridges, calculating the heights of arches and culverts and several hydraulic and other problems that have to be solved.  The increased flow when the channel is cleared must be calculated and 101 other problems tackled.</P>
    <P>With the object of increasing productivity on drainage work, it was decided to introduce as an experiment an incentive bonus related to outputs in the Broadmeadow scheme in County Dublin.  In September-October, 1962, we applied the bonus scheme for the first time to men engaged in excavation work and in the period from November, 1962 to April, 1963 we extended it to manual labour gangs mainly engaged on bridge work.  Last month, it was extended to the foremen and indirect staff, the fitters, the store staff, vehicle drivers and so on.  More than 80 men are employed at Broadmeadow. The broad basis of the bonus scheme is the setting of agreed&mdash;that is the operative word in any bonus scheme &mdash; standard performances for the usual excavation and construction operations and the payment of standard <Col N="1529" /> bonuses to those who achieve standard performances.  Standard bonuses vary from 27½ per cent.  of the basic wage to 20 per cent. in the case of indirect staff.  Where performances are above or below the standard, payments are increased or reduced as the case may be.  If the performance does not reach a certain minimum level, bonuses are not payable.  Bonuses for the indirect staff are related to the output of excavator and manual labour gangs.</P>
    <P>The operation of this system is kept under close observation because it is an interesting exercise and Deputies will be interested to see how it works in this pilot scheme.  No doubt Deputies will have in mind making representations that it should in time be extended to other areas where work has started.  There has been an increase in the output of work and the workers will agree that they have got an appreciable amount in their weekly pay packets.  We hope that the final result will be such as to justify the extension of the system throughout the country.  This would not be a simple matter because, apart from the special training of personnel required to operate the system, the experience gained on the Broadmeadow scheme has been limited in scope.  The work required in the catchment is relatively simple and does not require all the operations that would be required on a larger scheme.</P>
    <P>Other points mentioned by Deputies I shall try to refer to but the Ceann Comhairle has ruled that the policy of improving Dun Laoghaire harbour is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power.  I want to explain to Deputies what has been done.  Since 1957, the improvement of the mailboat pier has been done in stages.  The point made by Deputy Lynch was that he asked if this new car ferry service comes into being, why should the Government provide the facilities?  I mention this because I think the details I am giving will satisfy Deputy Lynch and so I am going into more detail.  I was actually anxious to get the answer myself.  The improvement of the mailboat pier was done in stages and up to 31st March last, £175,000 had been spent.  A high level <Col N="1530" /> enclosure has been erected along the east side of the pier, around the nose of the pier and along about two-thirds of the west side.  Two cranes for handling cars have been provided and improvements are being carried out to the approach road to the pier.  A concourse is being provided at the entrance to the pier.  A permanent shelter and new toilet accommodation have been erected on the landward side of the east approach road.  A left luggage office and a new ESB substation have been erected at the landward end of the pier.</P>

      <P>My information is that the port of Fishguard was created by the Great Western railway company. The same applies to the port of Rosslare.  I pointed out to the Parliamentary Secretary last night that these installations were paid for by the transport companies previously.  I am not opposed to the improvement of our harbours.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and he was interested in finding the answer himself&mdash;why the Government should have to pay 100 per cent of the cost of such installations. The transport companies using these places should pay a proportion of the cost, as well as paying their dock dues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy stated that Fishguard and Rosslare were provided by the Great Western Railway. They were leased, and other lands were purchased by the railway company in certain areas.  That property acquired by them was paid for by them.  I have pointed out that Dún Laoghaire is a State harbour.  That is an important point to bear in mind.  Apart from the car ferry or anything like that, <Col N="1531" /> there is the question of the passengers coming in on the mailboat.  An outcry has arisen&mdash;we have all read about it, particularly in the evening papers&mdash; about the conditions in Dún Laoghaire for passengers, particularly in the summer period &mdash; toilet accommodation, waiting rooms and the improvement of facilities generally for the passengers. That answers the Deputy's point that all this money is being spent by the State for a contemplated car ferry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot argue that point.  My personal opinion is that Dún Laoghaire has a tremendous impact on the tourist industry.  Visitors get their first impression of the country when they arrive there, and it was very necessary therefore to improve these facilities.  We intend to do further work there.  There is the extension landward of the two-storey covered way on the west side of the pier to the exit gates with footbridge at end of pier; concourse at west exit gate; improvements to west approach road; completion of east approach road; construction of spring fendering at seaward end of mailboat pier; installation of heating system on pier.  Some of these are subject to further conferences.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary gave me some hope when he said that the State must be responsible for State-owned piers.  I am aware the State own the pier at Dunmore East. That is some aid and comfort to me now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been complaints for many years about transport conditions between here and England, about the boats, the trains, the piers, and everything else.  It was decided we would put our own house in order and improve those facilities at Dún Laoghaire which came within our own control, while pressing for improvements in other directions Deputies are aware of.  A very good job has been done in Dún Laoghaire. I do not think there is any necessity <Col N="1532" /> to make any apologies for it.  We should be proud of it.  It certainly has transformed the approach there.  Last Saturday night week, there were letters from two people who had not been in Ireland for four years.  They wrote back congratulating the people who carried out the improvements there.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned that the work proposed for Duncannon, Wexford, is a scheme of improvement for berthage. It will be done by the county council, who will bear half the cost.  The improvement scheme at Enniscrone will commence next week.  In regard to Kilmore Quay, there has been a model investigation to determine the most effective scheme for the improvement of the harbour.  The investigation is nearing completion and it is hoped a report will be available before the end of next month.</P>
      <P>That investigation was carried out by Trinity College.  Along with the Minister for Finance and some of our officials, I went to Trinity one day to look at the way they do these model investigations.  It is quite fascinating. The simulation of the actual conditions in a harbour, the approaches, the different levels taken from the soundings, and the effect of the tides are all most enlightening.  The information is invaluable to our designers when they come to prepare the actual scheme.</P>
      <P>The improvement at Kilronan pier will be provided for from the Vote for Roinn na Gaeltachta.  They have authorised the Office of Public Works to arrange for a boring survey and other preparatory works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the salaries of engineers. Deputy McQuillan spoke about it at length in regard to drainage.  I presume he is aware that the engineers in the recruitment grade went to arbitration last year and that the salaries now offered are as awarded by the arbitrator? At present something like £50 million a year is required to meet the salaries of State-paid personnel.  I would be loath to ask the Government to add to that burden.  Improvements in regard to certain conditions, increments allowed for experience and age, <Col N="1533" /> have vastly improved the income position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been any improvement in the intake of men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Somewhat.  We will be seeking more staff again shortly. As the Deputy says: &ldquo;It is not by bread alone...&rdquo; There is the social aspect as well.  For instance, one knows an engineer in London and he says he would love to come back but where is he to get a house?  There are all these domestic problems.  There is more in it than the salary scales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of them want to come back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who has ever left Ireland wants to come back. I should say we cannot consider drainage engineers in isolation from the other categories.  The question of recruitment was mentioned.  Recruitment is through the Civil Service Commissioners in accordance with the Civil Service Regulation Act and there is nothing I or any Deputy can do about it here.  The question of recruitment is one of agreed policy.  Even so, our Chief Engineer, Mr. Cross, is in constant touch with the professors in the engineering faculties of the constituent colleges of NUI and of Trinity College on matters affecting the training of engineers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They can, and they are.  They have been very helpful and have themselves learned quite a lot. Each year a number of engineering students are employed during the vacation and some of them are thus induced to make their careers later on with the Office of Public Works.  It is not an easy task at times to get a young man coming out of college, with ambitions to stay in Ireland if he can, to start off in the Board of Works.  To copy a phrase of my colleague, Deputy Lenihan, the &ldquo;image&rdquo; of the Board of Works has become a kind of music hall joke.  I saw in <i>Time</i> magazine recently the same criticism of the US <Col N="1534" /> State Department on the matter of the maintenance of public buildings.  We are no better or no worse than any Government Department.  We have our faults and we have our tribulations. Our Commissioners and our staff are only human.</P>

      <P>After all, it is the public in the final analysis who pay for these things&mdash;for the preservation of national monuments, for such things as the Thomas Davis Statue, the National Gallery, the National Library and the matter I mentioned rather casually earlier, the inter-Departmental Committee on the Arts.  There are one hundred and one other items relating to public buildings under our aegis and in respect of which there is great need for some kind of liaison with the public&mdash;someone who could talk to the public and to whom the public could talk and get information from. In other words, there is this need for a public relations officer.</P>

      <P>I was about to use that word but I was not too sure of its pronunciation.  I am very glad to be able to tell the House that a very high percentage of our staff recruitment in the recent past has been made up of Irish engineers who have been abroad and who have decided for themselves and their families to come back permanently here.  They have been a tremendous acquisition from our point of view because of the experience they have gained elsewhere.</P>

      <P>They can also be of great benefit to the young lads <Col N="1535" /> coming out of college who wish to make their career with us.</P>
      <P>Going from drainage to the matter of our national monuments, a number of Deputies referred to particular monuments which they considered should be cared for in some way.  Of course, a number of those could never be taken in State care at all because they would not be architecturally or aesthetically worthy of consideration. I get letters from time to time from obscure corners in my constituency, from persons whom we would term locally as thorny wires, the sort of individuals who have a kind of hankering after these things.  A number of the matters I have looked into&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The conservation of monuments is not simply ordinary building work.  Special skill is needed in the handling of the stone and the work is necessarily slow of execution. The best tribute one can pay to a completed job is that it will not be obvious any work has been done on it at all.  The suitable men available for this type of highly-skilled work are hard to recruit and, accordingly, our programme on national monuments is full for the next few years.  Additional monuments are taken in from time to time but these, of course, will not be embarked on at once.  We are all aware of proposals for the setting up of a National Monuments Advisory Council and I have no hesitation in telling the House that the Government wholeheartedly agree with it.  It would be presumptuous of me to anticipate the action or the decision of the Government but this question is crying out to high heaven for rectification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important question covering our national heritage. This new proposal, of course, involves the provision of finance but when all matters are agreed, there will be revolutionary changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a few words generally&mdash;I regret I have no notes on <Col N="1536" /> it&mdash;on the question of national monuments.  I do not think there is a Deputy, from the youngest to the oldest, who has not got a very vital interest in national monuments.  I should like to pay a particular tribute to the articles published in the four daily newspapers, the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> the <i>Independent,</i> the <i>Press</i> and the <i>Times.</i> They have gone into great detail in illustrated articles on ancient monuments and old houses, of both historical and architectural merit, and the interest with which the man-in-the-street followed these articles is quite fantastic.  To be interested in such matters is no longer the prerogative of what we used look upon as an old fogey, an archaeologist.  The matter is of such vital interest.</P>
    <P>Many, of course, agree that more would be done for the preservation of the Irish language, and inculcating in our children a love of Ireland, by the restoration and preservation of these monuments than by a lot of other measures.  Fortunately, the Minister for Education has been most interested in this matter and has given us every encouragement.  I know that he hopes to have films made of the treasures in the National Museum which can be shown not only on Telefís Éireann but in Europe, the United States of America and Canada.  Not only will these depict the treasures in the National Museum but treasures in other places such as the Book of Kells and pictures in our galleries and also they will show, in this cultural series, so to speak, our outstanding national monuments such as Clonmacnoise, Clonfert, Bunratty, Cashel and so on. His first anxiety, of course, is to show these films in our schools in Ireland to our own children.  However, I do stress this point because I think there is a tremendous amount of interest in it and the press has played a noble part in this campaign.  It is a most delightful section of a newspaper nowadays, to get away from a lot of things, and to read these very well written and beautifully illustrated articles in our daily newspapers which are to be highly commended.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay particular tribute to my own Monuments Advisory <Col N="1537" /> Council whose praises have been unsung and who have done such tremendous work down the years, with very limited resources and also, of course, to those members of local authorities and archaeological societies in the country.  They have done an enormous amount of good.  Of course, this does not stop at television and films in the school.  I have always been anxious that the study of our national treasures should be considered as an extra-mural subject, that the children of Limerick, Clonmel, Cork and all other places would know something about their own area before they left school.  I do not think that any of us who were at school in Limerick were ever told about King John's Castle. Recently a member of the Council of Education asked me if I knew that Robert Bruce was crowned in King John's Castle.  Did Deputy Barry know that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just giving an example of my abysmal ignorance of one of the historic monuments in my own city.  Children know about the Treaty Stone and that the date was 1691 but that is all.  They are never taken on an excursion.  I think there was one such proposal in relation to the Ballyneety area where Sarsfield blew up a siege train.  There is great scope with regard to this matter and I am glad that the Minister for Local Government has consulted us about the new Town Planning Bill.  We hope there will be close co-operation because I think that is a very good thing when we are talking about the preservation of ancient monuments and ancient Ireland and trying to impart to our children, as Deputy Barry said, an appreciation and love of trees and <Col N="1538" /> inculcate in them an abhorrence of the destruction of trees, or anything beautiful.  The Town Planning Bill might seem a long way away from national monuments but we must remember that while we are anxious to preserve what has been left to us from the past, Deputies and members of local authorities and committees can be a very influential force with regard to some buildings of an aesthetically doubtful character erected in modern Ireland in our cities.  I have seen, without mentioning any area, some buildings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  When we get this authorisation shortly it could then be a question of the magic casements, for the interested parties, opening on the faery lands not so forlorn.  When I came into office first my Chairman showed me an interesting proposition with regard to the <i>son et lumière</i> of Dublin Castle.  The capital cost was high but the potential was higher.  I think Mr. Vincent Dowling, the eminent actor and producer, and Senator Eoin Ryan got together on that and it was a tremendous concept.  Then, again, even with the assistance of Bord Fáilte, our National Monuments Advisory Council did not get as far as we should like. A new vista immediately presents itself. I hope this question will be referred to again and not only in relation to <Col N="1539" /> Dublin Castle.  Think of floodlighting and <i>son et lumière in Cashel.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Bunratty has been mentioned from time to time.  There is no possibility of reproducing so many Bunrattys annually, first of all, from the point of view of cost, but certainly an approach to that type of finish could be considered.  It should not cost an awful lot of money.</P>
      <P>Then there comes to mind the floodlighting of many of our old castles. Some of them are in good condition and have been maintained and some have been restored by the Office of Public Works.  The floodlighting of these old castles, particularly those standing on a hill with a view from the distance, could be very effective. We need not necessarily look at all these things from the point of view of the tourist.  There is our own enjoyment to be considered as well.  These old castles are one of the very many attractions we have in Ireland.  I am just pointing out what we can hope for.</P>
      <P>I have a note here about the reroofing of Cashel.  I think Deputy A. Barry mentioned it.  There was a controversy between Frank O'Connor and other eminent writers and people interested in these things as to whether Cashel should or should not be reroofed.  I have not any opinion on that.</P>

    <P>Deputy Crinion mentioned silt deposit <Col N="1540" /> in the Boyne and some of its tributaries as a result of bog development work by Bord na Móna.  That is correct.  I understand an arrangement has been made between Bord na Móna and the county council responsible for the maintenance of the affected rivers which are in existing drainage districts under which Bord na Móna make some contribution towards annual maintenance.  Our engineers are aware of this siltation and will take it into consideration when designing the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy mentioned the River Suir.  I think I have already dealt with the question generally of how a priority list was prepared many years ago.  He may rest assured that there is no intention to alter the plan or to replace the River Suir on the priority list.  It will not be passed over or deferred in any way.  The engineering survey of the Suir catchment is in progress.  The engineers have been on the ground since 1960.  It is a very large catchment area and the collection of all the data necessary for the design of an arterial drainage scheme takes time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Treacy spoke about the Suir.  I told Deputy Davern the same thing before about the position.  I pointed out to both of these Deputies that so much remains to be done on that scheme that I should not like to commit myself to a <Col N="1541" /> prophecy as to when the works will actually commence.  I told Deputy Davern and Deputy Treacy that I proposed to see what could be done on the Suir by increasing some of the engineering staff.  I promise I shall do the best I can.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon was pressing me about the Boyle.  As a matter of fact, he was not so much pressing me about the Boyle as inquiring about the Boyle and when the digging would start. What was the name of the book&mdash;<i>When The Kissing Had To Stop?</i> Deputy Dillon wanted to know when the digging would start.  He was also pressing me about the Erne.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Boyle, a scheme of works was carried out by the office of Public Works acting as agents for the Minister for Agriculture under the Land Reclamation Scheme.  The scheme was limited to the Boyle river, the outfall from Lough Gara, the channel through Lough Gara, particularly a link between the two sections which would provide an outfall in respect of the Lung and the Breedogùe which flow into Lough Gara.  There is no question of the work being stopped at any stage.  The work was completed but it was always recognised that it was not a complete scheme and that the full benefit could not accrue until the Lung and the Breedogue were dealt with.  They are all part of the Boyle catchment area.</P>
      <P>What is now required is to proceed with the survey of the entire Boyle area.  That survey will commence this year.  I could not say when the digging will start.  It was announced only a short time ago.  The survey will start this year.  If I say &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;, that means nothing.  I could not say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are enough people in trouble with the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> lately and I do not want to get into trouble there.  The remarks by Deputy Jones were most constructive. He referred to the recruitment of labour.  We have to recruit&mdash;it is not a question of what we should like to do&mdash;our labour from the employment exchanges.  The local engineer notifies the exchange that he wants to take on a certain number of men.  The exchange gives him a list of men, and he must select suitable men from that list.  That is all about it.  How the list is based is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.  It is the same all over the country.  We must follow the exchange list and I do not think there is anything to be done about that.</P>
      <P>Each year Deputy Dillon refers to the Dromore river on this Estimate.  It has been decided that the Dromore river will form part of the Erne catchment scheme which has been surveyed and for which a scheme is being designed. It is quite true, as Deputy Dillon said, that when he was Minister for Agriculture, an <i>ad hoc</i> scheme was prepared for the Dromore river, even though it was part of the Erne catchment scheme, using as he said, two lakes as a balancing effect, to create a balancing reservoir.</P>
      <P>It was proposed that our Office should do that scheme as agents for the Minister for Agriculture.  That was a most unusual proposal.  However, that does not matter.  It was suggested that we should do it as agents for the Minister for Agriculture, not under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act but under the Land Rehabilitation Scheme.  That is a major job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy talked about the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That is not within my province and I do not want to argue its merits or demerits.  We reported to the Department of Agriculture on the scheme, and we pointed out that it would undoubtedly give partial benefits, but that the main point was that maintenance would be necessary.  That was the point stressed by our experts in the report to the Department of Agriculture. There was no provision in the Land Rehabilitation Scheme for maintenance. There were schools of thought on these lines: &ldquo;This is a very high capital expenditure.  It will give partial relief.  It will, in time, form part of the Erne catchment scheme, but all that capital expenditure will come to nought if there is no provision for maintenance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was decided by Deputy Dillon's successor not to proceed with the special scheme but to wait for the catchment scheme.  So far as our portion in the 26 Counties is concerned, preparation of the scheme is proceeding normally, and can be carried out without the active cooperation of the authorities of the Six Counties.  I may say in passing that they have been most cooperative at all times in regard to drainage and other State endeavours. We have had discussions with them on these matters and, as Deputy Dillon said, there is no reason to expect that they will not cooperate in the secondary part of the Erne catchment covering the rivers and streams which go over the Border, and which will follow on the scheme now in preparation but confined to the 26 Counties.  The Dromore river will be dealt with in the present scheme.</P>

      <P>In regard to the architectural trainees, the recruitment was done by the Civil Service Commissioners. There were 600 applications from which 20 trainees were selected.

      <P>This problem is not peculiar to Cork.  The same difficulties have arisen in several places down the years.  The Department of Education through their inspectors, in consultation with the school managers, make the best estimate they can of the size of school required and we design that <Col N="1547" /> school.  There are cases where the estimate of the number of rooms required proves to be inadequate.  That is the exception rather than the rule.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my Office would certainly be most sympathetic towards that idea but in the first instance, it is a matter for the manager to put that proposal to the Department of Education.  There is the question of the cost and the local contribution and there is the inevitable argument with regard to finish and what is contained in the school.  As Deputy Lynch is aware, the Minister for Education, is most sympathetic, as Deputy Barry agrees, to any of these innovations which would help to brighten school surroundings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

      <P>In regard to the criticism expressed by some Deputies of the increase in the number of civil servants, when I was speaking on the Budget recently I pointed out that in the main the reason for the increase was the increased activity of certain <Col N="1548" /> Departments of Government, according as new proposals arose and that numbers were absorbed in that way. The 20 architectural technicians we took on last year are classified as civil servants but as far as my Office is concerned it would be well to remember that apart from the architects and engineers, we have not taken on one more civil servant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;since 1950.  That is a policy with which I totally disagree and I hope the Minister for Finance will sanction an increase in my staff. We have got a tremendously increased responsibility since 1950.  A great many things have been transferred to us.  We have to give a great deal of advice.  We are the advisers for every Department of State in certain respects.  We have the fishery harbours as our responsibility now and we shall have to implement the new Coast Protection Bill. A great many things have devolved on us in the past 13 years.  That in itself shows the tremendous increase there has been in productivity in the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I could do with a great many more civil servants and I hope I shall not be subjected to any criticism if I succeed in convincing the Minister for Finance of the necessity for increasing the staff in the Office of Public Works. I do not hold any brief, any more than anybody else, for civil servants; we all have our own ideas about them.  They are a much maligned body.  I think it is grossly unfair to have quite a number of men doing excessive overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have our problems and many of the criticisms made from time to time are justifiable.  On the whole, we have in the Office of Public Works a very capable outfit.  Improvements are required and we are constantly striving to achieve them.  The standard of our professional people is very high indeed. As I said some time ago, it was a revelation to me to find the Dutch, the Americans and the British sending their engineers to us for advice on arterial drainage and other projects. That is a tribute to the Irish universities <Col N="1549" /> and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the House for the manner in which the Estimate was received and for the kind remarks Deputies made.

I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that we should put our own house in order; we have a very good cleaning staff here but the instruments of their care are primitive.  I draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to that.</P>

      <P>The Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes makes provision for the annual programme of employment schemes to give work to men in receipt of unemployment assistance in urban and rural areas, including towns with a population of 200 and over and for other services not directly concerned with UA recipients, such as bog development, rural improvements and miscellaneous schemes, including minor marine works and archaeological excavations.  The Vote also makes provision for the salaries, travelling and other incidental expenses of the staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office who are responsible for the administration of the Vote.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that as recently as last November I gave a very detailed statement of the work of the Special Employment Schemes Office including what it was proposed to do in 1962/63.  This will be found in volume 197, No. 6 of the 13th November, 1962, columns 1030-45 and 1072-76.  The provision for 1963/64 shows a small increase of £5,970 compared with 1962/63, and with the exception of administrative expenses the figures are, in fact, identical.  I do not consider it necessary, therefore, to repeat all the details I gave on the last occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last November I made available to <Col N="1551" /> Deputies a statement giving particulars of the expenditure under the various subheads of the Vote for the six years 1956/57 to 1961/62 inclusive.  I have brought these details up to date in the new statement which I have circulated. It includes the estimated expenditure for 1962/63 and the provision for 1963/64.  The figures include payments from the National Development Fund in addition to the Vote up to and including the financial year 1960/61, when the last of the Fund money was expended.  The audited expenditure figures for 1962/63 will not be available until about the end of May and the figures in the table represent the best estimate that can be given at this date.  It may be seen that we expect that over 99 per cent of the Vote provision will be expended.  At the peak period of employment in mid-December, 1962, a total of 4,556 men were employed on the schemes&mdash;549 in urban areas, 375 in non-urbanised towns and 3,632 in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Grants for urban, rural and minor employment schemes are, as most Deputies are now aware, related to the number of men in receipt of unemployment assistance in each area.  A geographical census is specially taken for this purpose annually by the Special Employment Schemes Office in the third week of January of the number of UA men as well as the number of men in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit resident in the various areas.  To these figures of UA and UIB there is added for each area the number of men who formerly drew such payments but who were working on schemes financed from the Vote during that particular week.  The census this year was taken for week ended 19th January, 1963; and, in accordance with the 1961 census of population, the figures for which are now available, the Special Employment Schemes Office census will this year give particulars in respect of each of the 60 urban areas, 484 non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 and over, instead of 477 as formerly, and 2,874 rural electoral divisions in the country.</P>
    <P>These figures show a gross total of 23,357 UA men compared with 22,656 <Col N="1552" /> in the corresponding date for 1962: an increase of 3.1 per cent.  The increase was almost entirely in the urban areas; the figures for 1963 being 6,677 compared with 6,066 in 1962, an increase of 10.1 per cent.  For the rural areas including non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 and over the figures were practically unchanged, 16,680 in 1963 compared with 16,590 in 1962. Including UIB the over-all percentage increase was 8.5.  In the urban areas it was 11.5 and in the rural areas 7.25. As the census date coincided with the peak period of the very severe winter weather, it may be assumed that the increase was largely due to that cause.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the individual subheads of the Vote, there is an increase of £5,970 in the administrative subheads which provide for the salaries and for the travelling and office expenses of the Special Employment Schemes Office.  The increase of £5,960 in the salaries subhead is mainly due to the balance of the eighth round increases in pay which amount to £3,900.  Increments, as the staff get a year older, account for a further £1,500 and the balance is made up of minor items.</P>
    <P>The provision for urban employment schemes is the same as last year, viz. £200,000.  These schemes provide for works in the four county borough areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford; the Borough of Dun Laoghaire and the 55 other urban districts.  The grants are conditional on the local authorities making contributions towards the cost and submitting suitable work schemes through the Department of Local Government for approval by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Including local contributions the total cost of the new works sanctioned amounted to £234,875.  In general the schemes are carried out in the winter period, but in Dublin they are proceeded with the whole year round&mdash;each UA man there getting a 12-week spell of work.</P>
    <P>A State grant of £92,000 was available for Dublin in 1962-63 which with the contribution by the Corporation of one-fifth made £115,000 available for new work schemes.  The schemes sanctioned included two amenity works, <Col N="1553" /> viz., a grant of £6,320 for the continuation of the culverting of the Wad river and £22,400 for further development work in St. Anne's Park, Dollymount. The remainder of the schemes were for road construction works including £19,680 in Cappagh, £16,240 in Crumlin, £18,656 in Cabra and £7,920 for the resurfacing of Orwell Road.</P>
    <P>The average number of men employed weekly on the Dublin schemes up to the end of February, 1963, was 80 of whom 63 were UA recipients. As the men are rotated at the end of each 12 weeks period it will be seen that some 250 fathers of families have each got a spell of 12 weeks work over the period.  Priority in employment is given to men with the largest number of dependants, and the labour exchange records for the 12 months ending January last show that of the men engaged in that period 140 had each seven or more dependants; 46 had some five&mdash; six dependants each and 51 had some three-four dependants.  Apart from the value of the schemes in themselves as necessary and useful public works, the schemes have value from the social welfare point of view in that they afford an opportunity of employment to men with heavy family responsibilities for whom alternative work is not readily available.</P>
    <P>The allocation for Cork in 1962/63 was £17,500 State grant, £3,500 local contribution, £21,000 total.  Schemes were sanctioned to absorb the full amount of the allocation.  They included £13,685 for development work at Fitzgerald's Park, Mardyke, an open space at Mayfield and a playground at Grattan Hill; £5,510 for the widening of Curragh Road and footpaths at Centaur Park and Monaghan Road and the remainder £1,805 was for the widening of portion of Assumption Road.</P>
    <P>The allocation for Limerick in 1962/63 was £14,000 State grant, £2,800 local contribution, £16,800 total.  Road works absorbed £13,700 of the total, £5,700 being in respect of works at Corkanree and the other £8,000 for road works at Rosbrien, Cathedral Place, Lower O'Curry Road and Roxborough Road and footpaths <Col N="1554" /> at Greenmount Avenue and James Court.  The balance £3,100 was in respect of amenity schemes, £2,500 for a passageway and fencing at Coolraine quarry and £600 for the completion of drainage work at Janesboro.</P>
    <P>The allocation for Waterford was £7,500 State grant, £1,250 local contribution, £8,750 total.  The full amount was duly sanctioned mainly for road works of which £4,065 was for the widening of Peter's Street, £4,100 for the widening of roadways at Stephen's Street, Newgate Street and Ozanam Street and the balance £585 was to demolish Murray House at High Street.</P>
    <P>The allocation for Dun Laoghaire was £4,000 State grant, £1,000 local contribution, total £5,000.  The full amount was absorbed in amenity schemes including £1,000 for footpaths in Killiney Hill Park, £3,440 for the development of an open space at the Martello Tower, Seapoint, and £560 for the development of an open space at Avoca Avenue, Blackrock.</P>
    <P>The allocation for the 55 other urban districts in 1962/63 was £60,000 which with the local contribution of £8,325 made £68,325 available for new works.  The full amount was duly sanctioned and the State grant for the approved work included £30,000 for road works and £18,000 for footpaths. The remaining £12,000 was utilised for various types of amenity schemes such as improvements of parks in Youghal, Trim, Monaghan, Clonakilty, Templemore and Carlow; a promenade at Kinsale; an open space at Longford; a promenade at Ferrybank, Wexford; clearance of derelict sites at Cornmarket, Wexford and Holborn, Sligo; and improvement of Fairgreen, Ceanannus Mór, Riverside Walk at Wicklow and the sea-wall at Dungarvan.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the estimated expenditure on these urban schemes last year amounted only to £182,000 against the provision of £200,000.  For a number of reasons grants have not matured for payments as quickly as expected.  The principal saving is in Dublin which is largely due to delay in submitting schemes to absorb the full amount of the allocation.  It will <Col N="1555" /> be necessarily some time yet before the amounts of the allocations for the new financial year can be determined. Grants as heretofore will be allocated to the individual urban areas in relation to the number of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance in the various areas.  As stated earlier the increase of 600 in the total number of unemployment assistance recipients in these urban areas is mainly due to the exceptionally inclement weather in January when the census was taken.  Having regard to the increased demand on the Exchequer in other directions as set out in the Book of Estimates and also to the substantial allocations from the Road Fund for road works in the larger urban areas it was considered that the sum of £200,000 was the most that could be allocated for this service in 1963/64.</P>
    <P>The provision in the next subhead, Rural Employment Schemes, for 1963-64 is £35,000, the same as in the last six years.  These works are confined to non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 and over.  There were 477 of these towns according to the 1956 census of population.  There are 484 such areas according to the 1961 census of population which is now available.  Last year 125 towns in each of which there were not less than nine registered unemployed (UA and UIB) and in which 2,872 of the total of 3,665 unemployed were concentrated got grants, and no grants were available for the other 352 towns with 792 unemployed (UA and UIB) in all.  On the 19th January, 1963, there were 1,154 UA and 3,474 UIB resident in the 484 towns with a population of 200 and over according to the 1961 census of population&mdash;a total of 4,628.</P>
    <P>Grants for these town areas are made available to the County Councils concerned, who are required to contribute one quarter of the cost so that a total of £46,665 is available for expenditure on the schemes.  The full amount was duly allocated last year, and the works consisted mainly of footpaths in the towns and environs. Minor road works in the immediate vicinity of towns were also included. About £2,000 of the £35,000 was <Col N="1556" /> allocated for various amenity schemes, including further work on the Fairgreen at Cootehill, a playground at Whitegate; parking spaces in Loughrea, County Galway, and Duagh, Dooega and Keel in Achill, County Mayo; and the clearance of a derelict site at Fethard.  As in the case of urban areas it will be necessarily some time yet before the allocations for the individual towns in the new financial year can be determined.  The works will not be due to start until next November.</P>
    <P>Minor Employment Schemes (Subhead E) are primarily intended to give employment to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance in rural electoral divisions, and are carried out in the winter period from November to March.  The works consist of the repair and reconstruction of noncounty accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs.  They are confined to what was formerly known as the congested districts, and are done only in parts of the twelve counties of Cavan, Clare, Cork West, Donegal, West Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo where substantial numbers of men in receipt of unemployment assistance are concentrated. The unit of distribution is the district electoral division of which there are 2,874 in the whole country.</P>
    <P>In 1962/63 grants were given in 354 electoral divisions in which 13,116 of the total 15,675 UA men were resident, and no grants were given in the other 2,520 electoral divisions in which the remaining 2,559 UA men were scattered. 880 schemes costing £125,475 nett were sanctioned and it is anticipated that expenditure will amount to £136,000.  There were 15,526 UA men resident in rural areas according to the census taken on 19th January, 1963 and as the provision for 1963/64 is £130,000&mdash;the same as in recent years &mdash;it may be anticipated that there will be relatively little change in the allocation of these monies in the new financial year.  As in recent years, it is proposed to ear-mark £10,000 of the £130,000 for extra bog road grants in the areas in which Minor Employment Schemes grants will fall to be made on the basis of the UA figures.  The works <Col N="1557" /> will, of course, not start until November next.</P>
    <P>The provision in 1963/64 for Subhead F, development works in bogs used by landholders and other private producers, is £160,000, the same as in each of the last six years.  This subhead makes provision for drainage works in bogs in all parts of the country which are carried out in the summer and autumn periods as well as for bog road works in non-UA areas.  In areas with large numbers of unemployment assistance recipients the bog road works are financed by Minor Employment Schemes grants and the road works in the Bog Development Subhead are confined to the 2,500 electoral divisions in which no Minor Employment Schemes grants are authorised.  In 1962/63, 1,370 grants in all were authorised representing an expenditure of £159,100 of which 700 schemes costing £71,750 were drainage works and 670 costing £87,350 were road works.</P>
    <P>The Bog Development subhead is not related at all to the unemployment position even though it does provide employment for a number of UA men and UIB men in the areas in which grants fall.  The available funds are distributed having regard to the amount of turf produced in the different bogs, the number of families served and the cost of the relevant development works. In cases where the development works are too costly to permit of a full cost grant being given under Bog Development Schemes, the beneficiaries have the alternative Rural Improvements Scheme available to them, provided they are prepared to pay the necessary contribution.  We have, as explained last November, many more applications for full cost grants than the Bog Development funds available to the office will permit us to sanction.  In 1962/63 we had reports on 3,060 drainage proposals costing £310,000 for examination in the summer programme, but it was possible to sanction only 700 schemes, costing £71,750. In the main winter road programme 3,070 proposals were examined costing approximately £496,000 of which 647 schemes, costing £76,550 were sanctioned.  Including road schemes <Col N="1558" /> authorised up to March, 670 schemes, costing £87,350 were sanctioned last year as already stated.  The sum of £160,000 available for the new financial year will as heretofore be distributed on the more important drainage and road proposals available.  It is, however, only right to say that there is little prospect of full cost grants being available for any new roads or extensions into bogs, which invariably are required to be dealt with under the contributory scheme.</P>
    <P>The Rural Improvements Scheme makes provision for grants towards the cost of carrying out works to benefit the lands of two or more farmers such as small drainage schemes, bridges and the repair and reconstruction of noncounty accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs.  It is a contributory scheme, and applies to all parts of the country.  It is the only scheme under which land drainage as distinct from bog drainage can be undertaken by the Special Employment Schemes Office; and it is also the only scheme in which the road works can be undertaken to the houses and lands of farmers in the 2,500 electoral divisions where there are few or no unemployment assistance recipients.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme, subject to the necessary contribution being forthcoming, works of a better and more durable standard can be carried out; and it continues to be a very popular scheme.  In the year ended 31st March, 1963, grants were sanctioned for 797 schemes to absorb the full amount of the allocation, £225,000.  Taking into account commitments in respect of uncompleted schemes at the beginning of the year, it is anticipated that the total expenditure will amount to £235,000. As most Deputies are aware, the demand for grants last year outran the available provision; and from December onwards it was necessary to defer the sanction of all subsequent cases in which the appropriate contribution was lodged by the benefiting farmers. At the end of the financial year 287 cases had accumulated representing a total commitment of £84,730.  These, of course, will be a first charge on the provision for this service in 1963-64; and if the demand for new grants continues <Col N="1559" /> at the same rate as last year there will have to be a closedown at an earlier date.  It could well be argued that in these circumstances increased provision should be made for this service in 1963/64.  Due consideration was given to this problem but it was not possible to do more than repeat last year's provision which was, of course, an increase of £25,000 on the amount made available in 1961-62.</P>
    <P>In mid-March, 1963, there were over one thousand applications under the Rural Improvements Scheme awaiting inspection and report.  I am well aware from the letters that I receive that the delay in making inspections is a cause of concern to Deputies and others.  I need hardly say that it is also a cause of concern to me and to the Office.  The prime cause of this difficulty is the shortage of engineering inspectors in the staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Of the three vacancies two arose in September, 1960, and the third in April, 1961; and over this period of nearly 2½ years the Office have been endeavouring to fill the vacancies but up to date they have succeeded only in recent months in getting two officers&mdash;one at the end of January and the other on the 1st March.  A further effort is being made through the Civil Service Commissioners to fill the remaining vacancy. The filling of the two vacancies will, however, make some improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>The provision for Miscellaneous Schemes in 1962/63 showed an increase compared with the previous year from £15,000 to £17,000, and the latter figure has been included again for 1963-64. This subhead is intended mainly to meet expenditure on archaeological excavations and on minor marine works. Grants for archaeological excavations totalling £7,300 were authorised in 1962/63 including £5,000 for High Street, Dublin; £1,100 for New Grange, £800 for Creewood near Slane, and £400 for Knowth, all in County Meath. County Councils are required to contribute one-quarter of the cost of minor marine works and to maintain them on completion.  The new marine works authorised in 1962/63 included the <Col N="1560" /> improvement of landing facilities in Garrahies, Bantry, £2,600, which will now be increased to £3,600; supplemental grant for Lehanebeg £1,610, Oilean na gCaorach, Bear Island, £720; County Cork; £500 supplementary grant in Cleggan, County Galway; Portmagee in Caherciveen £700 and the clearance of salmon hauling grounds near Cromane in County Kerry, £270, and Rathlasken Pier £350 in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>The Appropriation-in-Aid subhead includes in addition to the major item of contributions under the Rural Improvements Scheme, receipts in respect of development works on privately-owned bogs, contributions from the county councils towards the cost of minor marine works, and the sale of surplus stores.  The total receipts in 1962-63 are estimated at £45,000, compared with the provision of £41,000.  It is not expected that receipts in 1963-64 will exceed £41,000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the works financed from Vote 10 the Special Employment Schemes Office also acts as agent for the Minister for Transport and Power in respect of the carrying out of development works to facilitate the production of turf for the four hand-won turf-fired generating stations at Caherciveen, County Kerry, Miltown-Malbay, County Clare, Screebe in County Galway, and Gweedore in County Donegal.  These schemes are financed from a National Development Fund allocation of £80,000 at the disposal of the Minister for Transport and Power. Forty-two new schemes costing £11,250 were approved last year including 22 costing £2,770 in County Clare, six costing £3,135 in County Donegal, and 14 costing £5,345 in County Kerry.  Applications for these grants should be made to the Department of Transport and Power in the first instance and the expenditure will be accounted for by the Department of Transport and Power also.</P>
    <P>The Special Employment Schemes Office also acts as agent for the Minister for the Gaeltacht in respect of the carrying out of accommodation road works in Gaeltacht areas financed from the Vote of that Department <Col N="1561" /> Sixty-three new works costing £38,410 were authorised last year of which 18 costing £13,075 were in County Galway, 20 costing £9,925 in County Donegal, 10 costing £6,905 in County Mayo, nine costing £5,760 in County Kerry and six costing £2,745 in County Cork.  The expenditure on these schemes will be accounted for by the Minister for the Gaeltacht to whom applications for grants should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Like myself, all Deputies would, no doubt, like to see more money provided for the different schemes operated by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Apart from the employment they give these schemes in rural Ireland in particular are well recognised for the assistance they give in increased agricultural production and also fuel production.  The various amenities in town areas also contribute towards the improvement of conditions of urban dwellers.  As explained in the recent discussions on the Vote on Account, the various items in the Book of Estimates were examined and re-examined this year and the Minister for Finance found it necessary to cut the provision for many desirable schemes and, in fact, to leave some out altogether.  Having regard to the many claims on the public purse, it was felt that the sum of £874,900 provided in the Estimates was the maximum provision that could be afforded for these services in 1963-64.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it would be included in the Board of Works but, in view of the way we got on, we will not make an issue of it.  The Parliamentary Secretary said all Deputies would like to see more money provided.  I would certainly like to see more money provided. During the term of office of the inter-Party Government, more money was provided than is provided now and, due to the increase in the cost of <Col N="1562" /> living, money is not worth as much today.</P>
      <P>This money is mainly provided to give employment.  That is a better way of doing it than coming along with other Votes, saying you are going to do some wonderful scheme, and not pointing out it is an employment scheme. The frightening thing is that we are spending £800,000 of the taxpayers' money for the purpose of relieving unemployment. But are we?  I have here a copy of the Official Report containing the discussion on this Vote last year.  The Parliamentary Secretary was questioned about the amount of machinery in use, the number of men employed, and how much it cost to give one man one year's work.  He bravely replied by giving us the terrifying figure of £2,000.  It cost £2,000 to give one man one year's work.  I shall quote from column 1261, Volume 197, of the Official Report for the 14th November, 1962.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Malley: It is mainly the fact that machinery plays such a big part now, mainly in the allocation. The works now available in Dublin provide approximately only 25 per cent in unskilled labour costs. When you multiply that figure 50 times&mdash;a round figure&mdash; a figure of over £2,000 a year is reached to give one man employment for one year.</P>
      <P>Mr. A. Barry: There is labour content for only one man?</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Malley: That is right.  I shall repeat the figures because it is quite obvious&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>These are frightening figures.  I am not criticising the Parliamentary Secretary or his Office.  We provide this money in the hope of relieving unemployment in various parts of the country.  The opinion may be held by some people that, if we want to get the best return for that, we must put in machines, that the machines will do more work than the men.  I submit by doing that, we will be able to do more work but we will not be providing work.  If we were to do it in the old-fashioned way with picks and shovels, we would not be able to do more work, but we would be able to employ more men.  The whole idea is to employ more men.</P>

      <Col N="1563" /> This Vote is good because it is elastic.  Money can be poured into parts of the country where there is less employment than other places.  I have spoken about this on the Vote for the Department of Local Government.  It looks fine to see these enormous machines, costing perhaps £10,000 or £15,000 each, pushing earth here, there and everywhere.  At the same time, there are people in the districts in which these machines operate who have to walk to the labour exchange.  Does this thing work out right?  The Parliamentary Secretary is one person who could give us the answer to that.</P>
    <P>The repair or construction of noncounty accommodation roads was mentioned last year.  I am sure every Deputy has had cases such as I have had.  A group of people living up a boreen are endeavouring to get this boreen done under these employment and emergency schemes.  There may be contention between some of the neighbours.  They are not able to get unanimity and the whole business must fail.  The fact that one or two farmers hold out should not count if the majority of the residents decide on getting the boreen done.  There are cases of this kind in nearly every county, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to investigate.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the State grant for Dublin alone in 1962-63 was £92,000, which, with the Corporation contribution of one-fifth, made £115,000 available for new works schemes.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The average number of men employed weekly on the Dublin schemes up to the end of February, 1963, was 80 of whom 63 were UA recipients.  As the men are rotated at the end of each 12-weeks period it will be seen that some 250 fathers of families have each got a spell of 12 weeks work over the period.</P>
    <P>That shows how expensive this is.  I am sure that when the members of Dublin Corporation saw this figure, they thought many more men would be brought in under this.</P>
    <P>I revert to the point I made at the outset when I said I was afraid this is <Col N="1564" /> a Vote through which we are largely providing money for the employment of machines rather than men.  This point must be seriously considered because it is the most important we have to face in dealing with this Estimate.  The allocation to Waterford, I notice, is £7,500 in State grants and £1,250 in local contribution, making a total of £8,750.  I have seen the men at work on a scheme at Newgate Street and Stephen Street in Waterford, and I am glad to say that very little machinery was brought in.  The job included the demolition of a small section of the city wall and of a couple of houses and I am glad to say that, as far as possible, men rather than machinery were employed.</P>
    <P>Very often Deputies, who are also members of local councils like myself, are ignorant of the type of schemes which will qualify for grants under this Vote.  I notice, for instance, that under the Vote, such jobs as the laying down of a walk in Wicklow, a sea wall at Dungarvan, a promenade at Wexford and at Kinsale have qualified for grants. We in Waterford did not know we could apply for grants for such purposes, which are so advantageous because of their labour content.  Some years before the war, I visited a country in which there was terrible unemployment. I noticed a number of men on construction work and saw them carrying the materials to the site.  The engineer, who could speak English, told me that with unemployment at the level then obtaining, they were employing men instead of lorries to draw the materials to the site.  Men were also employed to mix the concrete, though there were some fine concrete mixers nearby.</P>
    <P>That may sound primitive but if we are to spend large sums of money on this type of allocation, we should be careful to ensure that the employment content is as high as possible.  I would point out that the figure in the Estimate this year is £874,900 whereas the Vote in 1956-57 was for £888,000.  I submit that the Minister for Finance should this year have provided more money for these schemes.  I do not, of course, blame the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being smart, but I would point out that there were 97,000 unemployed back in those days.  The allocation must be considered from the point of view of the number of prospective recipients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being smart, either, when I say I could tell the Parliamentary Secretary where most of those unemployed are now working.  The amount of money being allocated here, if calculated in the manner we agreed last year, would give employment for a year to only 400 men.  This would only scratch at the employment problem at the present time, while at the same time the cost of living is going up.  My point is that the Parliamentary Secretary should have been given more money for the purpose of relieving unemployment.  I repeat that I regret very much the Minister for Finance has not provided more money for the relief of unemployment under this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure the Parliamentary Secretary is very anxious to have this item disposed of.  He has had quite a lengthy period in the House and has had to answer numerous questions.  Therefore, I do not propose to hold up the debate any longer than is absolutely necessary.  First of all, I note, as the previous speaker has pointed out, that there is a reduction in the amount.  While the Parliamentary Secretary has given an excuse for that, I would not agree it is the complete reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say there is an increase in this year's amount over last year, but it represents a reduction in the figure provided in 1956-57.  What worries me, representing a rural constituency, is the number of schemes being put on a long waiting list.  It is just too bad to find schemes such as the RIS or bog development schemes held up in this manner.  Last year, there were 3,060 applications, of which it was possible to sanction only 700. That means that the balance of 2,360 will start off the list this year and I assume this number will be added to as the year goes on.  That being so, I think the Parliamentary Secretary should have been given much more than the £160,000 he has been given, <Col N="1566" /> although I admit that figure is a very big improvement on what was given in 1956-57.</P>
    <P>The big trouble with rural improvement schemes is the difficulty in having them inspected.  Every rural Deputy must be in the same position as I am, that every time I go through my constituency, particularly if I am having meetings, I meet half a dozen people who want to know what has happened to applications which they have made for rural improvements schemes.  I am not blaming the Office because any time I have made inquiries, I have received nothing but courtesy, but it is regrettable that that situation should have been allowed to develop.  We are told that the reason for the delay is the shortage of engineers. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to this earlier to-day but I think it goes back a little further than he said it did.  We are all aware of the position some years ago when there were too many engineers in the country and the colleges and universities were discouraging people from going for that profession.  The result was that the intake, the numbers going in for the profession, dropped and dropped.  This was bound to happen and I assume in another few years, we will go back to the position in which there will be too many engineers and people will be advising their friends not to send their sons into the profession.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, schemes are being held up.  A question which was asked earlier on the previous Estimate should apply even more here.  It was in regard to the number of young engineers who went abroad because of the fact that there were better facilities available to them.  In fact, jobs were offered to them.  When we start this &ldquo;Come back to Erin&rdquo; campaign, if the engineers are offered decent salaries and conditions they will come to Ireland. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would be only too glad to see that desirable situation being reached.  It is no comfort to John Smith or Tom Murphy in the country to be told: &ldquo;Your scheme is being considered but because there are no engineers it will <Col N="1567" /> be years before anything can be done about it.&rdquo;  With the best will in the world in the Special Employment Schemes Office, that is the position.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to something which is being done and which is so stupid and so ridiculous that I cannot understand the Parliamentary Secretary or his officials allowing it to continue.  The situation is that there are a number of people employed by local authorities on road work and a rural improvement scheme, or a special employment scheme, is also being done in the area.  The men employed by the county council work under the same conditions and for the same wages as the rural improvement scheme men. But the five-day, 45-hour week was introduced and we have the situation where people work with the county council for one week and work the 45-hour, five-day week and the following week, go to the Board of Works and do the same type of work, under the same engineer, the same foreman, and the same ganger, and must work a 45-hour, five-and-a-half-day week for the same rate of wages, despite the fact that conditions are exactly the same as if they were employed by the county council.</P>
    <P>I think somebody is being childish about this and I do not believe it is the Parliamentary Secretary because from my experience I have found that he is a sensible man and he has had a sensible approach to anything I have discussed with him.  I think somebody has got the idea at the back of his head that he is holding the line here and that he is going to ensure that nobody can accuse him of doing anything to create a bridge by which the five-day week could come into operation. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine this in a sensible way.  They are the laughing stock of the country and even the farmers whose schemes were being done remarked to me how utterly ridiculous it was that the men have to work those extra hours because somebody thinks it is the thing to do.  I will not say anything more about it at present.</P>
    <P>Another matter which should be considered by the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1568" /> is the question of accommodation roads to farms.  In County Meath, we have got over the question of roads into houses because the county council have taken over every lane on which there are two or more houses and have declared them to be public roads and they make and maintain them.  Therefore, that problem has disappeared completely.  Only the one-house lanes are left and lanes where there may be one house and a number of farms. They come directly under the rural improvement schemes.  If the grant could be given to the local authority, it would be prepared to deal with them in the same way, but for some reason that cannot be done and the result is they are left.  As Deputy Lynch said, there may be a contrary fellow in the lane who does not agree that he should pay because he does not like one of his neighbours.  For that reason and only that reason, he will not pay the few pounds and he will not allow the scheme to go ahead.  If the scheme could be changed in such a way that the local authority could get the grant, they could do it and I feel sure it would give general satisfaction.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters to which I should like to refer.  One is in regard to the time at which the Christmas relief schemes &mdash; as some people call them &mdash; are submitted. When I was speaking to some of the officials of the Department last year, I discovered that a situation had been recurring year after year in which some urban councils, town commissioners and so on, had not been sending in their schemes until the last minute. Why they did that I did not know. The only reason I could think of was that they never knew what it was to be without a meal coming up to Christmas and therefore it did not seem important to them that the scheme should be submitted in time so that it could be sanctioned and some men could get work in the period before Christmas.  This idea of starting the job the week before Christmas seems to be at the back of their minds. Those men do now want work for Christmas; they want pay, and they can get it only if the schemes are submitted in time and are sanctioned <Col N="1569" /> so that the work can be done and the money paid out.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary because I have got the greatest co-operation from his officials in regard to trying to force these people, who were dragging behind, to do the decent thing and send in their schemes earlier in the year.  This would give the officials the opportunity of deciding which schemes were to be done.  I notice that some of them did not spend all the money they got. That is unfortunate in view of the fact that while we have not got 97,000 unemployed, we have over 60,000 and during that period of the year there are more people unemployed than we would like to see, even at the worst period of the year.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to change the period of unemployment from 12 weeks to 13 weeks?  A man who is stamping cards and works for 13 weeks is able to draw unemployment benefit for 26 weeks.  If he works 12 weeks and goes back on the employment exchange, he goes back on unemployment assistance which was the same as he got before the 12 weeks. The one week makes a very big difference to the man concerned.  I do not think it is appreciated that people who would be drawing unemployment assistance and are put on this type of work, while they receive the local rate paid for such work, at the same time some of that rate is being saved because it is not being drawn from the Department of Social Welfare.  It is on record that people have been working on those jobs for half of what would be the normal rate because the unemployment benefit, or the unemployment assistance, was being saved during the weeks they were working.  I would therefore ask the Parliamentary Secretary to change it to 13 weeks.  While we will have people sneering at this effort to give others a right they have not got, I would say let them sneer because if the Parliamentary Secretary changes it, the people will thank him for it and give him full credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary and <Col N="1570" /> his Department on the Estimate before us.  I could speak for perhaps five, six or eight hours on the matters covered by it but I hope to be brief.  We rural Deputies constantly ask ourselves if we are achieving anything in relation to the subheads of this Estimate.  Take, for instance, the roads in rural Ireland.  We must consider the amount of money spent on them.  We must also ask if it would not be better to put two or three of the grants together for one road and to do the job properly and then ask the local authority to take it over.  We must ask ourselves if that would not be preferable to putting a few shovelfuls of sand on a road to cover up the potholes. With modern machinery travelling along a road, unless the job is done properly, the road is as bad after a month or two as it was before the repair work was started.</P>
      <P>I notice in my constituency and in my county that the only chance of getting roads taken over is when there has been a Gaeltacht scheme, when a very good job is done.  It would be better if we could get a certain amount of money for a road and do the job well and then ask the local authority to take it over.  I know that the answer in the case of my council would be favourable.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to raise concerns the recruitment of labour. I have often felt that when the labour exchange is approached for labour, it very often happens that the people whom they send out are not actually from the townland or village to which the road leads.  Whether men are on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, I am sure every rural Deputy will agree that it would be better if people from the townland got first preference for work on the road, because naturally they would have more of an interest in it and in doing a very good job there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no sense in the Office of Public Works drawing broken stones a distance of maybe 40 miles for a scheme. In my constituency, that is like bringing coal to Newcastle.  That sort of thing has caused me much disappointment. The Office of Public Works <Col N="1571" /> should get a crusher and crush the stone locally.  There are plenty of quarries which could be got for nothing. The people are not asking anything for the stone.  It may be argued that it would cost more to do that but I doubt it very much.</P>
    <P>As regards the sanctioning of roads, people in my constituency are fed up submitting roads year by year which still are not selected.  I should like to know how the roads are selected.  Is a road selected on the basis of the number of householders living along it or is its selection influenced in any way by the number of householders cutting turf alongside it, where turbary is adjacent?  I welcome every road that is sanctioned but I feel that, year by year, some are neglected and, indeed, some have not even been listed.  I have in mind one townland in particular and the road leading into Cannower Cashel.  It has been applied for down the years but it seems to be neglected over all that time.</P>
    <P>Do the Office of Public Works go back over the number of applications submitted, say, three or four years ago, when these people got fed up filling up forms and getting no results?  Do they make any inquiry as to the position of such roads at present?  Neither the doctor nor the priest can at present travel over the road I have mentioned because it is practically cut across in several places.  It is beyond me why that road has not been selected, in addition to many other roads like it in the area.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the completion of the list of roads is possible but it should be feasible.  Every year, Deputies get a list of the number of roads in an area.  In general, I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the list.  For the first time, it came out last year with the amount of money marked down on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes on to the local engineer who gets his ganger and men to carry out the work on the road.  Suppose that that road is just a number on the list.  Would it be wrong to ask the engineer, when that road is done, to return particulars to the Office saying that the road is completed? In turn, the Office could send the particulars to the county engineer to see if the council would be prepared to take over the road.</P>
      <P>Up to this year, we had been taking over these roads in Galway in the month of January.  I noticed the difficulty in connection with it and I asked at a meeting of the local authority if the engineer would be prepared to take over such roads twice a year instead of once a year.  He agreed, and it was agreed to in general.  By leaving a road from January of one year to January of the following year, there is every likelihood that, by the end of the year, the road will be torn up by modern transport and left in exactly the same condition as it was before work was started.</P>
      <P>I come now to bog development schemes.  I am sorry to say that at the most there are only about five of them west of the city of Galway.  We have as much bog, and as badly in need of drainage, west of the city as east of the city, but, for drainage purposes, most of the money goes east of the city.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that the west gets 95 per cent of the minor employment schemes.  I agree.  Nevertheless, we have the bogs.  We still have to drain them and get the turf out of them.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would urge that all roads leading into bogs where work is at present carried out should be brought up to a proper standard.  The day is gone when the ass and cart is used to take the turf out of the bog.  With modern transport, tractors, and so on, the standard of the road must be improved if we are to make full use of our turbary and if we are to make life somewhat less arduous for the people cutting turf who must bring it out along such roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few observations make on this Vote for <Col N="1573" /> £800,000, which is mainly allocated for the relief of unemployment and the financing of certain emergency schemes such as minor relief and bog development.</P>
      <P>I should like first to refer to minor employment schemes, and the recruitment of labour.  One area in particular has come to my notice which would have qualified for a minor relief grant but for the fact that there was not a sufficient number of men registered as unemployed in it, but if an adjacent area&mdash;which was quite convenient, only a few hundred yards away&mdash;had been included, the combined area would have qualified.  That meant that the people in that area lost the grant.  That position should be examined.</P>
      <P>Like other rural Deputies, I am particularly interested in the rural improvement schemes, because they are devised more or less to try to do something about the enormous number of <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads and lanes that are not maintained by the county councils. In my constituency, we cannot avail of a Gaeltacht scheme, a harbour grant or any of the various grants that are given to maritime counties, but we have an abundance of lakes and little hills and, as a result, we probably have a greater road mileage than most counties.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear a Deputy from Meath saying that Meath County Council have taken over all the lanes and <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads.  In my constituency of Cavan, we still have roughly about 500 miles of lanes and <i>culs-de-sac</i> which the county council are not prepared to take over.  Indeed, one could hardly expect them to do so in view of the enormous amount of money it would cost to put them in any kind of repair.  For that reason, we are very glad that the rural improvement schemes are available.  Because of the fact that in many cases the valuations are small, the Government have put up 90 per cent of the cost in some areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another great improvement is that in some cases people living along the lane can themselves get work on the scheme.  In that way, they can earn back the local contribution which <Col N="1574" /> they have made.  At the same time, it may be necessary eventually to ensure that when the <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads and lanes are put into a proper state of repair under a rural improvement scheme, they are immediately taken over by the county council.  I understand that at present that is a matter for the council.  We had difficulty when some schemes were completed, and our engineer advised that the road was not of public utility.  That is something that should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>In Cavan, I believe about one-third of the rural people live along such lanes.  In some instances, we have 20 families living in <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads or lanes which lead to lakes, rivers or mountain tops.  When a rural improvement scheme is carried out, the local county council should be encouraged to take over the roads and maintain them in repair.  Something might also be done to ensure that a better job is done.  I think they should be brought up to modern standards and should be tarred.  I know it is easy to carry out such schemes in Meath where the ground is firm, material is available and the farms very big but there is no easy solution for an area such as my constituency.  Now that an enormous amount of work has been done in trying to clear up the backlog of <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads and lanes the SESO should again examine the problem and see if they can carry out further improvements pertaining to the local contribution and the standard aimed at.</P>
    <P>With regard to bog development schemes, despite what many people may think, they are still very important. Bog roads should be wide enough to allow tractors to take turf out of bogs.  Someone said that the antiquated methods are dying out in most areas but where they remain, they must be catered for.  I should like to see more money provided for the different schemes carried out by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  In that regard, I am of the same opinion as the Parliamentary Secretary.  The only way in which we can get more schemes carried out and a better job done is by providing extra money.  That type of scheme may look small in the eyes <Col N="1575" /> of some people, but in rural Ireland it is very important because it provides the little extra employment during the year which augments the income of the small farmers who live along these <i>culs-de-sac</i> and lanes.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the fact that we have over 500 miles of such roads in County Cavan.  That in itself should bring home to people's minds the enormous task which still faces many inland counties in which there is a great road mileage.  The Special Employment Schemes have helped considerably since they were first introduced.  I exhort the Parliamentary Secretary, even within the meagre resources available, to devise some scheme whereby when a job is completed it is automatically taken over by the local council so that it will not be necessary to put up money the following year to have it done again.  That of itself would encourage many people to avail of this useful scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that in the past month it was possible to get two extra engineers to examine the rural improvements schemes.  It was annoying to have those schemes held up because of a shortage of engineers. That looked very bad; it did not give a good impression.  I understand there is still a shortage of engineers.  Quite a number of them leave Ireland each year when they qualify.  Something must be wrong with the conditions if young men are not enticed to stay at home and apply for these positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a scheme is completed, it should be inspected inside six weeks. Many people are interested in these schemes.  In most counties, they have a very big effect on quite a number of people.  People do not like to have to travel on rough roads.  Farmers who are prepared to co-operate in a scheme should receive every encouragement. Inspection should be carried out within, at most, six weeks.  I know of one case where agreement had been reached and the farmers concerned felt that they should go ahead and do the job themselves, lest there might not be agreement by the time the scheme was inspected and the grant <Col N="1576" /> given under a Rural Improvement Scheme.  They were not prepared to wait.  When agreement is reached, a scheme should be devised.</P>
    <P>An effort should be made to have two engineers appointed.  That would be sufficient to keep the Office up to date.  I do not know whether at any time the Office were able to get a scheme inspected within six weeks but I do know that since I came into this House, delays of up to 15 months have been experienced.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will bear this matter in mind and will try to get the necessary engineers in order to expedite inspection and payment of grants.</P>
    <P>It is a very good thing that most of the roads made under the Rural Improvements Scheme are being tarred.  Tarring does not cost very much extra and it does mean that the road will last much longer.  I have seen roads that were made and which were not tarred.  After four years the road was in a worse condition than it was before it was gravelled and the people had to subscribe again towards the cost of having it tarred.  If the tarring had been done in the first instance, the road would still be perfectly good.  The money that is contributed by the State and by the local people towards the cost of these works should be put to the best possible use.</P>
    <P>In my view, when work is being carried out on a lane under a Rural Improvement Scheme, it is altogether wrong that the first half of the lane should be dealt with first.  It would be a much better idea to start at the far end of the lane.  Obviously those living on the part of the lane nearer to the road are reluctant to subscribe the following year towards the cost of having the other half of the lane dealt with.  If the far end of the lane were dealt with first, that would not be the case.  It would be to everybody's advantage in that case to complete the work. If the far end were done one year, the nearer half could be done the following year.</P>
    <P>At times, the cost of carrying out Rural Improvement Schemes imposes a heavy burden on local contributors. <Col N="1577" /> I have in mind a Land Commission road in which there may be ten or 12 people concerned.  Some of these people may be migrants.  Others may be local people.  The valuations are fairly high and the assessments are also high.  It would be a help in having such roads dealt with if the work could be spread over two years and if the half of the road farther from the main road were dealt with first.</P>
    <P>In regard to bog roads and drains, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure sanction for a scheme in view of the insistence that 100 tons of turf must be cut on the bog before the question of a minor development scheme can be considered.  When sanction is obtained the work carried out is similar to the type of work that was carried out 20 or 30 years ago.  It must be borne in mind that nowadays turf is taken out by tractor and lorry whereas in former days it was taken out by horse and cart or ass and cart.  The type of roads being made will not stand up to the heavy traffic.  I would suggest that when such work is being undertaken a really good job should be made and the road should be tarred. That would mean that it would not have to be repaired for perhaps ten or 12 years and, with a bit of luck, it might be possible to get the local authority to take it over.  Usually the local authority has no objection to taking over a road that has been put into a good state of repair.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of road improvement schemes are carried out each year.  It is very necessary work but I feel that it would be a much better use of public money if the roads were tarred.  It might be possible to reduce the number of roads done in any year so that a good job could be done on individual roads and over a ten-year period most of the roads would be done and done well.</P>
    <P>With regard to bog development schemes, the people in my part of the country feel disgruntled because of the fact that £5 is taken by the county council.  In quite a number of cases the scheme is sanctioned in order to relieve unemployment.  The £5 is taken by the county council for the services <Col N="1578" /> of the engineer.  The engineer would have to be paid by the county council in any case.  When a number of schemes are in operation in an area, the £5 in relation to each scheme would represent an extra week's work for the men. You should look into that matter with a view to seeing that the entire allocation will go to the people whom it is intended to benefit.</P>
    <P>Some trouble has arisen because of the fact that county council workers work a five-day week and when they are engaged on work for the Parliamentary Secretary's Office it is on the basis of a 48-hour or five and a half day week.  Some Rural Improvement Schemes were held up for a few weeks because of this difficulty.  It is difficult for the engineers to fit in the schemes into the normal pattern.  It means that they must work the entire week on a Board of Works scheme.  In case of adverse weather conditions they may have to defer the tarring of a road and may have to spend a couple of days in the following week on that work.  It would be much simpler if there were more co-operation between yourself and the county council, so as to facilitate the transfer of workers from one job to another.  When the weather is against them, they are in a very difficult position.  You should impress upon the local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>With regard to bog development schemes, I should like to make some reference to drainage.  You set a target of 100 tons before you agree to authorise a drainage scheme on a bog. It is quite impossible to cut turf in a number of bogs because of lack of drainage.  These bogs would be availed of extensively if they were drained. There is one at Tyrrellspass where a few drains would make a considerable difference and where there would be no trouble in getting a number of people to cut turf if the bog were <Col N="1579" /> properly drained.  At the moment no one can go into it.  If you could see your way to get existing drains cleaned and new drains made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very significant to our rural areas and our rural community that there is a reduction in both the minor employment schemes grants, to the extent of £6,000, and in the rural improvements to the extent of £10,700.  There is a slight increase in the grants for bog development, but there is an overall reduction of some £14,000.  Rural communities have always looked forward to these schemes as a means of, first, improving their local conditions and, secondly, earning a certain amount of money during the winter months, money which helps them out economically during those months.  It is even more significant to find that, while there is a reduction in these schemes, there has been an increase of some 20 per cent in the past two years in salaries and expenses amounting to over £18,000.  The accent now is on increased productivity and lower costs and one would expect the Office of Public Works to meet the position by making more money available to help the poorer sections of the community. In the past five years, there has been an increase of 25 per cent, or £21,000, in a total of £80,000 odd since 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any reduction in moneys provided for rural areas is very serious indeed. While there is an increase in urban schemes, there is a decrease in schemes <Col N="1580" /> for the rural areas.  It is necessary now to draw attention to the serious increase in the costs of administration and, at the same time, the serious decrease in the grants for rural areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan referred to material for road surfacing and repair being hauled over long distances in heavy lorries, leaving the very minimum to be earned by the local people. Twenty years ago, the material dug up alongside the road was used in the trunking up of the road.  Roads which were treated in that way are still in first-class condition.  A certain amount of fine gravel may be necessary to cover the road done the previous year, but hauling such material in heavy lorries long distances is all wrong when material perfectly suitable for the purpose for which it is required can be found on the spot.  These heavy lorries damage the roads.  Indeed, in one particular case this year they had to be stopped traversing a road because of the damage they were causing to it. Material was being hauled from 15 miles away and the crown of the road would have been utterly destroyed if these lorries had not been stopped.  In most bog areas there is a suitable hard material nearly always available which could be used.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to certain roads that are submitted year after year but never seem to be examined for a grant while other roads seem to come up every two or three years.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have that position rectified. I know some roads which have been submitted year after year for the past 15 years and have never even been examined.</P>
    <P>By and large, the Parliamentary Secretary has done a good job in regard to those schemes.  However, it is serious that out of an overall increase this year of £11,000, £7,300 will have to go on increased salaries and expenses.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that, whatever schemes are put forward, the maximum amount will be channelled to the people who need it most and that the cost of administration will be kept in line with what it was in the past.  The <Col N="1581" /> same thing applies to our local authorities. When there are deductions to be made it is always the poorer people who suffer.  It seems to apply generally in administrative circles.  It is not unreasonable to ask our Departments to pull up their socks and do their part in making things work well.</P>

      <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary replies, I wish to refer to a difficulty we have encountered in Cork where we have agreed to take over every road that has been brought up to the required standard. There are in the suburbs of Cork short roads where the people cannot obtain the rural improvement scheme grants. Would it be possible to permit the Cork County Council to pay the contribution to the Special Employment Schemes Office to have the work done for these people?  They are good ratepayers contributing rates to the county at large and yet they are in difficulties.  These are short roadways servicing their houses that were not included in the scheme of house building.  They are in a very bad condition and the people are not in a position to avail of the grant.  We are prepared to take them over if they are brought up to the required standard.  Where the people have the wherewithal we insist on their doing the work but in many instances they have not got it.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at the matter in respect of the coming year.</P>

That is a national problem and it is not peculiar to Cork.  It has been raised by <Col N="1582" /> the General Council of County Councils.

      <P>I shall look into the point mentioned by the Deputy.  Deputy Lynch, the first speaker for the Opposition, mentioned a point with which I have already dealt, the high cost of employing a man for a year.  I raised that point myself last year and most of the criticism could apply to Dublin.  It has always been the policy to have regard to efficiency in the carrying out of public works and our job is to strike a reasonable balance between efficiency and relief.</P>
      <P>Since the Estimate was passed last year, this problem of employing a man in Dublin has certainly occupied our minds and we have not come up with any definite solution.  We have had and are having discussions with other Departments.  I hope the cost will be cut down because were it cut down, it would give employment to more men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch also mentioned the small number of men employed in relation to the total of unemployed.  If the Government were to provide work for all the people who had not work <Col N="1583" /> the cost would be very great.  There would not be enough useful and necessary public works there to employ the men.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully again mentioned the five-day, 45-hour week.  Conditions in the Special Employment Schemes Office must be in line with those in other State services, the Land Commission, the Office of Public Works, etc.  Government policy is to adhere to this 48-hour week.  I need not go into the matter because I went into it in detail before.  We must bear in mind the fact that agricultural workers have a minimum working week of 50 hours.</P>
    <P>Criticism was made about rural improvement inspections in County Meath.  There are only nine awaiting inspection: only one is over 12 months, one of nine months, four between six and nine months, and three less than six months.  When we get the new engineer mentioned earlier we shall have those dealt with.</P>
    <P>There was an important point mentioned by Deputy Tully and I am sure Deputy Dunne would be interested in it.  He said that if workers in the Dublin area worked 12 weeks and if they got the extra stamp to make it 13 weeks they would qualify for a certain period of unemployment benefit.  The fact is that the men in Dublin get 12 weeks' employment and they do get 13 stamps and, therefore, qualify for unemployment benefit. They start on a Thursday and that is how it is achieved, so the human element was taken into consideration. Unfortunately, workers in rural areas get only six weeks so it does not arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion also referred to the delays in rural improvement scheme inspections.  That is an aspect which we hope will improve in the coming months but there will always be delays to a certain extent in the scheme.  The schemes are so scattered that excessive travelling costs would arise if they were looked into immediately a request for an inspection was received.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Lynch who mentioned that expenditure by the inter-party Government was greater than <Col N="1584" /> ours, I do not want to argue these points with anybody but the position was that in 1957-58 the figure provided under the heading &ldquo;Urban&rdquo; was £140,000 while, as Deputies will see from this Estimate, in 1963-64, the amount is £200,000.  In 1957-58, £115,000 was provided for bog development, while the figure is £160,000 in this Estimate.  For rural improvements, the figure was £150,000 in 1957-58 compared with £225,000 in the current Estimate.  Those points are purely of academic interest.</P>
    <P>As regards the points mentioned by Deputy O'Connor, he has already been in correspondence with me about some of them; I have discussed others with him personally and the remaining three or four points will be looked into and I shall communicate with him.  I trust that I have covered all the other points raised.</P>

    <P>In the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, a net sum of £537,000 is provided to meet the salaries and other administration expenses borne on the Vote.  The sum sought is only £4,390 higher than the Vote for 1962-63.</P>
    <P>The increases in the payment subheads as compared with the previous year total £12,990.  This sum is partly offset by expected higher receipts under the Appropriations in Aid Subhead totalling £8,600.</P>
    <P>The increase in the payment subheads is mainly attributable to an increase of about £10,000 on the provision for salaries, wages and allowances. This is the net result of casual variations, up and down, in the items making up the total provision of £1,360,000 for the year.  The number of staff for whom provision is made shows a net reduction of eight as compared with 1962-63.</P>
    <P>The higher receipts under Appropriations in Aid are mainly due to an increase in the sum due to be recovered from the Social Insurance Fund in respect of the expenses incurred by my Department in administering the scheme of social insurance.  The increased receipts are a direct result of the increased expenditure under the payment subheads.</P>
    <P>The Estimate of £8,020,000 for Social Insurance for 1963-64 is £371,000 higher than the Vote for 1962-63 when the Supplementary Estimate of £1,370,000 in 1962-63 is taken into account.  The Estimates Volume does not show the true position as it <Col N="1587" /> was printed before the Supplementary Estimate was passed.  The increase of £371,000 occurs under Subhead A of the Estimate.  That subhead provides for the payment by the Exchequer into the Social Insurance Fund of the estimated amount by which the expenditure of the Fund will exceed its income in 1963-64.  The estimated amount is £7,982,000.</P>

On the expenditure side, the main increases are £714,000 on old age (contributory) pension, £709,000 on disability benefit, £482,000 on widow's and orphan's (contributory) pension and £301,000 on unemployment benefit. On the income side there are increased receipts of £1,700,000 from employment contributions and £115,000 under reciprocal arrangements.</P>
    <P>The increases in benefit expenditure in 1963-64, as compared with 1962-63, are mainly due to the increased benefit <Col N="1588" /> rates under the Socal Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1962, which became payable from the beginning of January, 1963.  Aggregate increases of £2,094,000 in the benefit estimates for 1963-64, as compared with 1962-63 represent the extra cost due to the increased rates being payable for the whole of 1963-64 as against three months in 1962-63.  Another factor in the increase is a rise in the number of old age (contributory) pensions estimated to cost an additional sum of £208,000 in 1963-64.  This is partly offset by a reduction of £119,000 in the provision for unemployment benefits attributable to an expected decrease in the numbers of claims in 1963-64.</P>
    <P>On the income side the estimated increase of £1,700,000 in receipts from employment contributions is due, to the extent of £1,522,000, to the fact that the 1963-64 figure provides for the effect of the revision in rates under the 1962 Act for a full year as compared with three months in 1962-63. The remainder of the increase, £178,000, is attributed to higher stamp sales resulting from an expected improvement in the employment position in 1963-64.</P>
    <P>As regards Social Assistance the net provision of £20,127,000 for 1963-64 is £243,000 greater than the Vote for 1962-63, including the Supplementary Estimate of £694,000.  As in the case of Social Insurance, the Supplementary Estimate for Social Assistance for 1962-63 was passed after the Estimates Volume had been printed.  The increase of £937,000 shown in the Volume does not therefore show the correct comparison between the two years.</P>
    <P>The main items in the increase of £243,000 as compared with the previous year are £92,000 on old age pensions, £88,000 on unemployment assistance, and £17,000 on widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions. Increases on four other subheads amounting to £28,500 in all and net decreases in appropriations in aid totalling £17,500 make up the balance of the £243,000.</P>
    <P>The increased provision for old age and widows' and orphans' non-contributory <Col N="1589" /> pensions and unemployment assistance is a result of the increases in rates and other improvements effected by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1962, as from the beginning of August, 1962. The difference in the estimated cost of these increases for the whole of 1963-64, as compared with the provision for eight months of 1962-63, amounts in the aggregate to £460,000.  This increase is offset to some extent by anticipated reductions of £202,000 and £35,000 in the provisions for non-contributory old age pensions and widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions, respectively, arising from expected decreases in the numbers of pensioners under the non-contributory codes.  In the case of unemployment assistance, there is a reduction of £26,000 as it is expected that there will be a lower level of claims in 1963-64.</P>
    <P>I have outlined briefly the causes of the main variations in the Estimates for 1963-64, as compared with those for 1962-63.  The position is, of course, complicated as a result of the passing of the Supplementary Estimates towards the end of March, but I will endeavour to give Deputies any additional information they may require on individual items.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that the sums mentioned for Social Insurance and Social Assistance do not take account of the cost of the proposed improvements in these services announced by the Minister for Finance in the Budget Statement.  Provision for these increases will be made by way of Supplementary Estimates later in the financial year after the necessary legislation has been passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party agree with the Minister in saying that we have been presented with a set of extremely complicated figures that make it well nigh impossible to compare like with like.  During the year we have had the Supplementary Estimate for the Department.  Then recently we have had the discussion <Col N="1590" /> on the Budget debate.  Consequently, the ground of social welfare has been pretty well examined by the House in relation to all its aspects.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many of our people have to look to the Department of Social Welfare for assistance.  Their needs have been examined very closely on a number of occasions during the year.  One would have expected in the presentation of the annual Estimate that the Minister would have given more life to his statement than reading out these figures of costings and that he would have indicated how difficult it would be to compare them in view of the events that occurred since the last annual Estimate was presented.</P>
    <P>I note there is an absence of any indication regarding the broad policy of the Government in relation to employment. Pious hopes were expressed which, we trust, will be realised.  We can recall that last year the Estimate included similar pious hopes, which were dashed by the necessity to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to cope with the unemployment situation. We cannot be complacent regarding recent trends in the employment situation. The prime responsibility of the Department through its various branch offices throughout the country is to assist those people who are in the unfortunate position of not having employment and seeing that they get within the shortest possible time the employment they require.</P>
    <P>I would enjoin on the Minister to use his influence with his colleagues for the implementation of any scheme that will relieve the Department of having to pay unemployment assistance when it would be within the competence of the Government to provide full-time employment. It would be better for those to be given employment; it would be a better thing for the community that the skills, industry and labour of those men and women be availed of for the benefit of the country as a whole.  One can readily understand the obligation there is on us to see that these people are given sufficient assistance to tide them over what we hope will be a temporary period of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is one activity on which the <Col N="1591" /> Government have suspended operations which could relieve unemployment in rural parts and that is the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The Minister would do well to bring his influence to bear on the Government to reintroduce the operations of that Act in order to give employment to the people he is charged with looking after. Almost the entire Vote for activities under that Act would go into the hands of those employed.  That, in turn, would relieve the Department of Social Welfare and would give these men an income which would be considerably more than what the State can afford to give them in an idle capacity.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the trend of recent unemployment figures indicates a disturbing increase notwithstanding the fact that we have unfortunately forced so many of our people to leave our shores in order to secure employment in other lands.  The trend, one would expect, should be in the opposite direction, particularly when one realises the amount of investment by the State and otherwise in advancing various projects.  One would have hoped for better results and one cannot but be concerned by the fact that we have not provided the additional employment necessary to give work to the unemployed and as well to absorb those coming on the labour market.</P>
    <P>There are actually no provisions this year for any real improvement in the position regarding those whom we must look after under all the sections of this Department.  One would have expected differently if there was any reality in the statements we have heard during the last year regarding the prosperity of the country: one would have expected that the poorer, weaker sections would have fared better and that, if all this prosperity were available and if we had embarked on this high road, it would have been reflected in the Minister's Estimate.  The House will appreciate that despite the Minister's remark during the Budget debate that what was being done in the Budget would abate the effects of the cost of living increases arising from the turnover tax and the incidence <Col N="1592" /> of other additional taxation, the reverse is the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must assume that the people affected will have families who will be contributing to our taxation code.  There are many people of such an age and of such poor circumstances that they will qualify for State benefits, yet the Minister and the Government have done nothing to abate the impact on the family in consequence of the increased taxation&mdash;there is no indication of any step forward in social advances to assist these people.  Is there any indication in the Minister's statement that there is a proposal to modify the means test for old age pensioners? There is none.  Is there any proposal that it is the intention to lower the qualifying age for old age pensions? There is none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people expected many things but there is no indication here of increases in the amounts recipients of benefits will get to help them overcome existing cost of living increases, let alone those projected.  On other occasions we have allowed sufficient time for the Department to gear themselves to the administrative problem of granting increases from the time the Government decide these awards shall be forthcoming.  In this case the aged people, beneficiaries under projected increases, will have to wait until November, that is, those of them who survive that long, to derive any benefits.  There is a feeling abroad that, in the circumstances as presented by the Government so affirmatively over a period, there would be this year a considerable step taken towards improving the lot of State beneficiaries. I have nothing further to say in relation to the general content of the Minister's statement other than to emphasise again the confusion of figures existing in it arising out of circumstances over which the Minister has very little control.  I have referred to the absence of any clearcut policy regarding unemployment or any clearcut advance in benefits to those whom <Col N="1593" /> we will be forced to help in their distress.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to a matter which I have brought to the Minister's attention in other years, the hardship inflicted on a few people&mdash;the fact that their numbers are few does not detract from its seriousness&mdash;who have been deserted by their husbands, who have been unable satisfactorily to prove the death of their partners and who have consequently been deprived of recognition for the purpose of widows' non-contributory pensions.  We have been given to understand by the Minister in reply to questions on previous occasions that the number is limited. That is not sufficient reason for denying to the many legitimate widows in poor circumstances the benefits to which they are entitled when their partners are dead.</P>
    <P>God knows, life has been hard enough on them in the loss of their partners without imposing the extra cruelty of depriving them of their just dues when they reach the qualifying age.  The State could take a more charitable view of their circumstances and regard them as qualifying in the absence of reasonable suspicion that the partner is alive.  Possibly I am influenced by the fact that there are one or two cases in which I have a special interest, but I would again urge the Minister, after every reasonable effort has been made to secure determination of whether or not the partner has died, to give the wife the benefit of any reasonable suspicion that the husband is dead.</P>

      <P>In fact, I am dealing with the Minister's Department at the moment on this question.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>To avoid possible confusion, I would like to make clear at the outset that this is not pensions increase legislation, which will be presented separately.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with this Bill shows that it deals with many aspects of superannuation and pensions in respect of public service. The explanatory memorandum also contains a summary of the Bill's provisions so I do not propose to repeat that summary here.  As Deputies will have seen, most of the provisions are selfcontained and are of a miscellaneous character which makes the Bill essentially a Committee Stage one.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to comment on what is really the main provision of the Bill, that is, Section 4.  For some time past, I have felt that it would serve the public interest to facilitate transfers between branches of the public service, where such transfers are desirable to promote better performance of public business, by enabling a transferee to carry into his new appointment pension credit earned in his first post.  I have also had representations made to me in this matter by the Staff Side of the Civil Service General Council and have studied recommendations on the subject made by a Committee set up by the Institute of Public Administration.</P>
      <P>There is already provision in the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, for transfer of pension credit between the Civil Service and the local authority service, and that Act also enables arrangements to be made for similar transfers between local authorities and bodies approved by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill, while not exactly following the precedent of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, is designed to provide a system for the transfer of pension credit <Col N="1595" /> within the public sector, by which I mean in this context the Civil Service, the local authorities, State-sponsored bodies and possibly the universities. The section proposes that the Minister for Finance should have power to designate by statutory order the organisations, additional to the Civil Service and the local authorities, which will come within the scope of the transfer arrangements.  Also each individual transfer between the Civil Service and a designated organisation or between two designated organisations which is to qualify for aggregation of pensionable service will require the prior approval of both employers.  A contribution will be payable by the first organisation towards the cost of any superannuation award made by the second body.</P>
    <P>The proposed section is a flexible one which can be availed of to a greater or lesser degree as experience shows the need for facilitating the transfer of suitable personnel between the various organisations in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Another important change in the Superannuation Acts is the provision for the grant of national service in certain cases.  One of the fundamental principles underlying the Superannuation Acts is that pension should be related to length of service, so that if one man serves the State for the whole of his career and another for half, the latter's pension should be half that of the former.  Notional service materially affects this principle. However, I think Deputies will agree that while it is essential to retain the principle of relating pension to length of service, a departure from it would be warranted in the two circumstances for which provision is made in Section 6.</P>
    <P>The first of these is redundancy and the section provides for the grant of up to ten years of notional service to a redundant officer.  The other case derives from a recruitment difficulty experienced with certain professional grades who are required to have had a period of pre-recruitment experience. <Col N="1596" /> This requirement naturally has a restrictive effect on the field of recruitment, but the prospect of notional service should offset this effect to a considerable extent by making the Civil Service posts more attractive.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that because of the requirement of pre-recruitment experience, the professional candidates for appointment may be 30 years of age or more, so superannuation considerations might be expected to have quite a persuasive influence on their decision to compete for Civil Service positions.  While there has been a considerable volume of representations that notional service should be granted to any person who fails to qualify for maximum pension because of insufficient service I am quite convinced that a departure from the principle that pensions should be related to length of service can only be justified by reference to redundancy or as an effective recruitment incentive.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for one exception to this&mdash;serving professional officers who would have qualified for the grant of a period of notional service had they been appointed after the enactment of this Bill, may have one half of this period added to their service. This is a gratuitous concession to these officers which, being confined to a limited number of persons should not prove too expensive.</P>
    <P>The general rule regarding unestablished or non-pensionable service, when followed immediately by established or pensionable service, is to allow onehalf of it to reckon as pensionable.  A number of the sections dealing with the reckoning of service, referred to in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the explanatory memorandum, extend this rule to cover certain non-pensionable service which, for one reason or another, cannot benefit at present under the general rule.</P>
    <P>I will refrain from dealing in detail with the other sections of the Bill, as this is more a matter for the Committee Stage.  I would, however, like to say that when the Bill was being drafted, my Department undertook a comprehensive examination of superannuation <Col N="1597" /> matters in respect of which representations had been received and which might appropriately be disposed of by legislating for them in this Bill.  Any matters which, as a result of that examination were considered suitable for inclusion in the legislation, have been incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A superannuation and pensions Bill is always welcome if it improves the pensions and conditions of retired personnel.  As the Minister remarked, this is a comprehensive measure and it deals with a variety of miscellaneous matters which will naturally cover a wide number of retired persons.  I think it is true to say that with few exceptions, the superannuation code&mdash;and I use the term in its widest application &mdash; is generally inadequate and lags behind the advances in the cost of living.  I hold the view strongly that pensions, like wages and salaries, should move in line with variations in the cost of living.  I appreciate that, as the Minister said, this Bill is not a pensions increase Bill but deals with specific matters that affect the conditions or the terms under which pensions are paid.  Pensions can be regarded as deferred wages or salaries earned by those entitled to them during their working lives.  It is right, therefore, that such emoluments should change with the cost of living. This is the approach adopted now in a number of European countries and we should follow suit in this matter.</P>
      <P>A difficulty about this Bill, which the Minister will appreciate, is that almost any amendment moved by a private Deputy as distinct from a Minister, will be out of order as the amendment will likely involve a charge on public funds and as such, will normally be ruled out of order under the procedure of the House.  Therefore, I would urge on the Minister the desirability of accepting suggestions made on this Stage or the Committee Stage and I suggest that the Minister might introduce the appropriate amendments, either on Committee or Report Stage, after the matter has been referred to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" /> As the Minister has remarked, this Bill is more appropriate for consideration on Committee Stage.  At the same time, in view of what I have said about the difficulty of individual Deputies moving amendments, or the likelihood of amendments in order to achieve the objects of those interested involving their being ruled out of order, it is necessary at this stage to refer to certain cases.  In fact, it may well be difficult on this measure not to refer to individual cases because of the personal nature of some of the matters involved and the individual cases which are affected by its provisions.</P>
    <P>The prime purpose, as the Minister remarked, is to facilitate a greater mobility between the staffs of local authorities, State and semi-State bodies and the Civil Service.  In the past, I think the Civil Service organisations were somewhat opposed to a movement of that sort.  On the other hand, with the increase in the number of State and semi-State bodies, there is the view that greater mobility will provide for greater efficiency.  To the extent that Section 4 provides for that, it should facilitate these arrangements and enable the persons affected to have their pensions covered.</P>
    <P>There are, however, certain categories of State pensioners&mdash;I use the term in its widest sense&mdash;to whom I specifically wish to refer.  This measure deals, in the main, with civil servants and has reference to local authority personnel as well as to certain other retired persons.  I have had occasion previously to refer to a specific group of retired officers who are affected by what might be described as premature retirement.  These were Army officers, not a very large number, who were granted the two years' extension some years ago because they had pre-Truce service and an IRA medal.  Subsequently I notice the Minister for Defence in 1957 withdrew that concession. However, as a result of representations made here he accepted the view that although these officers were retired, they should be paid for the two years which they would have served, if the concession had not been <Col N="1599" /> withdrawn, the same pay and emoluments as they would have received while serving; in other words for two years after the retiral age which was fixed in 1957 they received full pay and emoluments.  That, at the time, seemed a reasonable enough concession. However, this problem has arisen and they have been affected adversely.</P>
    <P>Since then, there have been, I think, three increases in salary.  While serving officers and even the category to which I have referred&mdash;I think, about 50 officers in all&mdash;got the benefit of these increases, once the officers concerned ceased to serve the two-year period and entered on the pension arrangements, the increase in salaries that had been granted did not apply for pension purposes.  That was an unfair arrangement.  I feel that where these officers had served and had not merely rendered distinguished service in the Army but had given pre-Truce service in respect of which they had been awarded the IRA medal, they should be entitled to the increase in pension which would have been granted had the two-year concession not been withdrawn from them.  Therefore, I would urge on the Minister that the scheme be amended to allow for that.  If the concession had not been withdrawn, they would have been entitled to these increases.  In fact, as I say, those who were still on the two-year period, instead of salaries and emoluments, got the benefits of the increases in salary but they did not apply for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Another matter brought to my attention is in respect of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, 1937.  That scheme provides for an abatement in respect of Article 15 of the Scheme. Probably the most satisfactory way of dealing with this is to refer to a specific case.  A commandant, say, who retired voluntarily in 1954 and was on the maximum rate for his rank, was in receipt of remuneration of £1,107 per annum.  The equivalent rate at present is £1,694.  If the person referred to was in receipt of a salary of, say, £1,200 a year from <Col N="1600" /> public funds, his pension would be totally abated.  I believe that abatement is unfair and unjust.</P>
    <P>A pension is a reward earned for years of satisfactory service.  It is unfair that the reward should be abated because service is continued in another sphere.  This abatement applies only where a retired officer joins either a Government service such as the Civil Service or service in a local authority.  I suggest to the Minister that favourable consideration should be given to amending the scheme so as to withdraw the abatement provision.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recollect that some years ago a similar abatement applied in respect of military service pensions and that abatement was abolished.  It seems to me that there is a reasonable case for abolishing the abatement in this instance, particularly with the changes in remuneration generally due to the increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Pensions of retired officers are abated to the rate of pay of an officer immediately prior to his retirement. Subsequent adjustments either in the Army or civilian life&mdash;of which there have been many in recent years&mdash;are not taken into account and Reserve pay is taken into account when determining abatement.  In theory, Army pensions are not contributory.  Local authority pensions are subject to a compulsory reduction of five per cent under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948.  Such deductions are not allowed for in determining abatement.  Thus it will be seen that Army pay in respect of which no contribution deductions are made is compared with local authority pay before such deductions are made.</P>
    <P>Another category that will be affected are the widows of retired officers.  The pensions payable in those cases are extremely low.  Consideration should be given to granting some increase. When the Army pensions scheme was introduced, there was no pension scheme for widows of civil servants and, to that extent, there has been a change in the general outlook on pensions since then, and it seems to me that there is a case for increasing <Col N="1601" /> those pensions.  At present, the pensions of officers' widows range from £120 10s. for the widow of a captain to £206 10s. for the widow of a colonel, and there is an additional £35 odd for each child under 16 years of age.  That is a matter which should receive sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>Another category to which I wish to refer are civil servants who had pre-Truce service.  I think this matter is covered by Section 16 of the Bill.  So far as I am aware, there are very few cases, but I believe there are some such cases.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that favourable consideration should be given to providing that pre-Treaty service on the staff of Dáil Éireann be reckoned as established service for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1936; that service on the staff of the Provisional Government be reckoned as established service for the purposes of those Acts; that the First Dáil and Second Dáil and pre-Treaty civil servants be placed on the maximum of their scales, with two extra increments in recognition of their long service; that service on the staff of Dáil Éireann on or before 5th December, 1921, be reckoned as established service for the purposes of these Acts; that in a case where the Minister is satisfied that a person's imprisonment by the British Forces prevented his appointment on the staff of Dáil Éireann until the post-Truce period, such person's service be reckoned as pre-Truce service for the purposes of the Acts I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Another category which I believe require to be considered in this matter are CIE pensioners.  It is generally recognised that the CIE pension rates are extremely low, and in some cases, there has been considerable delay in implementing the arbitration award.  I refer to this in order to see if any action is open to the Minister to get a more speedy implementation, for this reason: some of those persons who retired would be entitled to make a settlement in respect of their wives, but because of the delay in certain cases in dealing with some of the persons concerned, some of them died before the award was made, and in that case no such settlement is possible, and the <Col N="1602" /> wife gets only whatever gratuity is payable and whatever balance of the pension is due.  After the arbitration award is concluded and a person's entitlement fixed, he is entitled to make a settlement which will allow whatever pension, or proportion of the pension, is agreed to be handed over to his wife.  It is something similar to the arrangement which is now in operation in the Civil Service, where portion of the pension may be transferred to the wife.</P>
    <P>The other category to which I wish to refer are certain ESB officers or employees.  I know this is a matter which has been the subject of fairly protracted representations to the Minister and, indeed, to successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce. It applies to the general employees' superannuation scheme established under the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act.  The scheme came into operation on 1st April, 1943, and as I understand it, Section 14 of the Act empowered the Board to grant out of its own funds, not out of the superannuation funds, an additional pension to those members of the staff who were not less than 40 years of age in July, 1942, the additional pension not to exceed the amount of the pension to which the person would be entitled if ten years were added to his service.</P>
    <P>I mention this matter because as the Act stands at present, a man with 37¼ years' service gets a pension of 37¼ eightieths of his salary, and another man with 40¾ years' service gets a pension of 33¼ eightieths of his salary. As I said, this is a matter which has been the subject of consideration by the Board as a result of representations by a very limited number of employees, all of whom I believe were employed at the inception of the scheme, and contributed to a considerable extent to the establishment and working of the Board and the success of the ESB over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>There are certain categories, particularly social welfare officers, who are affected by the Bill and who have made representations, I believe, on certain amendments.  These amendhal <Col N="1603" /> ments cover a wide category and in view of the fact that some of them would involve a charge on public funds, I propose, with the Minister's consent, to forward the representations to him for sympathetic consideration. The amendments would be ruled out of order because of the fact that such amendments, moved by an individual Deputy, would involve a charge on public funds.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in connection with the Army personnel to which I wish to refer, that is, the position which has arisen in respect of local authority employees who have been transferred from the Army to the local authority, and who had service in the Army and now have local authority service.  Under the 1956 Act, civil servants and semi-State bodies have available certain machinery for transfer which is also dealt with in Section 4 of the Bill.  That arrangement does not include Army personnel.</P>
    <P>I believe that where an officer, an NCO or a man had Army service, during, after or prior to the emergency, and subsequently had service with a local authority, his Army service should count for pension purposes. Many of these people rendered very good service during the emergency but because of the present position of the law, the Army service is not counted. I do not know whether the proposed alteration which the Minister referred to, which will allow a notional period or half of a notional period to count for pension purposes, may rectify this, but if it does not, there is a very strong case for allowing personnel now employed by local authorities and who had a number of years' service in the Army either as professional officers, technical officers or in whatever category they were employed, to have that service counted for pension purposes and aggregated with the Civil Service or local authority period of service.</P>
    <P>There is one matter to which I should like to refer before I conclude. Deputy Carty has informed me that he proposes to raise the specific case of a former member of the Dáil, Mr. Stephen Jordan, who was a member of this House for many years.  The <Col N="1604" /> Deputy has given me details of the case in question.  He is more familiar with the case than I am but I should like to support the representations which he intends to make and would urge the Minister to introduce a provision, or accept an appropriate amendment, as the case may be, to cover the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point Deputy Cosgrave mentioned, I want to say that as far as I am concerned, if any special case can be made for this former Deputy, it certainly will be considered for support by the Labour Party, and sympathetically considered.</P>
      <P>As far as the Bill generally is concerned, it does not alter in any radical way the general principles of the superannuation code for State and local authority servants but it does make some amendments which could be considered to be very desirable.  The most important sections seem to be Sections 2 to 8.  The remainder of these sections, it would seem, were introduced either to cover special people or to cover a special type of case and we shall await the Committee Stage to hear the Minister's case so that we may be in a better position to decide whether or not the sections are worthy of support.</P>
      <P>As I have said, Sections 2 to 8 seem to be the sections of general application and are, in the main, an improvement on the existing legislation in respect of those to whom these sections refer.</P>
      <P>Section 2, which deals with the payment of gratuities, seems commendable in that it abates the qualifications necessary for the payment of a gratuity for a person who is described as an unestablished officer or unestablished servant.  The section also, in subsection (2), abates the conditions for the payment of a gratuity to the dependants of a civil servant and certainly has our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am primarily concerned about immediately is the type of officer to which Deputy Cosgrave has referred, that is, the social welfare officer, because of all civil servants, the proposals in this legislation will be immediately applied to some 40 or 50 <Col N="1605" /> social welfare officers who may be required to resign in the immediate future or who will voluntarily resign. It is not possible in the course of a Second Reading speech to make the detailed case for these officers or for the Minister to give what might appear to be an adequate reply.  Suffice it for me to say that in the circumstances the Minister ought to consider more generous treatment for these people in view of the fact that they have to resign or are being required to resign at a much earlier date than that at which they ordinarily would resign.</P>
    <P>It is being suggested in this legislation that they will receive a maximum of ten years' added service for the purpose of the assessment of their pension.  That may appear to be generous in ordinary circumstances but I am informed that the Department of Finance or the Department of Social Welfare, in the name of reorganisation, in the name of general efficiency, want to reduce the number of these officers by about 40 or 50 and that some of them may have to resign at the age of 45 or 50 and perhaps younger.  It is unreasonable that they should be offered merely a maximum of ten years' added service.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the retirement through redundancy of these social welfare officers which I should like to mention, namely, the payment of the gratuity.  Section 7 contains a provision whereby, if a civil servant is removed from office because of the abolition of his office, in the interests of reorganisation or efficiency, he may get a special severance gratuity not exceeding one-half of his annual salary. Again, that may appear to be generous but in view of the special circumstances of the people concerned the Minister ought to consider providing for a more generous gratuity.</P>
    <P>As I said, the sections from Section 9 to 36 seem to be proposals in respect of special people or special cases and it is not possible to treat of these sections until we come to the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, I should like the Minister to have regard to one of these sections. It is Section 33, which provides for added years of service for pension <Col N="1606" /> purposes to district justices who had been county registrars.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell me whether or not service in the State Solicitor's office is reckonable for pension purposes in respect of other district justices?  It does not seem to me that such service is service which would be reckoned for pension purposes but perhaps the Minister would clear up the point?</P>
    <P>I am sorry I was not here for the Minister's opening speech but perhaps he would say whether or not it is contemplated having a pension scheme for members of the Labour Court? There is provision in the Bill for a pension scheme for those who have acted on the Industrial Development Authority.  It has been felt for a long time that those who have served, and served so well, on the Labour Court have been very neglected in the matter of a pension scheme.  I trust that this opportunity that presents itself to the Minister and the State will be availed of to make some provision for the members of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this Bill also provides for the transfer for pension purposes of credit for service between the Civil Service and other bodies.  For some years now, there has been that interchange between the Civil Service and local authorities and it has worked very well indeed.  The Minister now proposes to introduce interchange for other State and semi-State bodies.  He also says he may designate approved organisations for the purpose of the transfer of credit in respect of service. I wonder would the Minister be able to give us, when he comes to reply, an example of the type of organisation that may be approved or would it be confined entirely to semi-State organisations? Would the Minister also confirm, or otherwise, that national teachers will be included in these proposals?  At first glance, I assume they would, but I should hate to think that, through any error in putting this Bill through, they may be left out.  The only reason I mentioned that is that technically speaking they are employed not by the State but by the school managers.  I am assuming they are covered in the matter of transfer of <Col N="1607" /> credit for pension.  I trust the Minister will be able to confirm that they are.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 5, the Minister might tell us what he means when he says he proposes to take power to make a contribution towards the pensions of persons transferred from one organisation to another, or from one State or semi-State organisation to another.  Does that mean that he, as Minister for Finance, will contribute through the Exchequer the entire amount of the gratuity or will there be an apportionment as between the Minister for Finance, on the one hand, and the State or semi-State bodies or organisations on the other?</P>
    <P>Another section of this Bill proposes to give credit for years of service in the case of those in the professions and who serve in another profession before entering the State service.  Would the Minister consider expanding that proposal to cover the social welfare officers giving them credit for the activity in which they were engaged, an activity associated with social welfare officer work, before they were appointed as social welfare officers?  The Minister will recall that some of them were recruited at a rather late age and the value of their former experience was recognised in the regulations governing their appointment.  I want to stress that many of these did not have an opportunity of entering the State service as social welfare officers until a rather late age and, even with the improvement in the matter of the addition of years of service, they will not find themselves, to say the least of it, too well off if they are retired because of redundancy, or anything like that. With the added years of service, the pension may appear to be generous, but many of these will be in the fifties and some of them will be up to sixty and it would be very difficult for them to obtain any sort of employment to supplement their pensions to the extent of making them reasonable incomes.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage amendments will be suggested but, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, it will be impossible for ordinary members to table amendments which would impose <Col N="1608" /> a charge on the Exchequer.  Perhaps after the Committee Stage it will be possible for the Minister to consider what has been said here in respect of many State and semi-State servants with a view to his bringing in the appropriate amendments on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because I regard some of the provisions in it as a genuine attempt to rationalise the vexed question of superannuation, pension and increments for public servants who move from one section to another, whether it be from the Civil Service to State or semi-State bodies, or <i>vice versa.</i> Any Bill which encourages movement of that kind is to be commended.  If transfers can be effected and people can find their place in the sun without loss of pension rights, superannuation or increments, that will be a big improvement because public servants will then be encouraged to move around until they find the posts for which they are best fitted.  Because certain losses could be incurred up to this civil servants and others were immobilised.  It is my hope this Bill will encourage movement because I believe such movement would be beneficial to the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish referred to national teachers.  My reading of the Bill is that national teachers have been left out and no credit will be given for years of service to those who move into the Civil Service or who take appointments in State or semi-State bodies.  It can be argued, of course, that national teachers are not employed by the State.  That may be so, but their salaries are paid by the State.  In the buildings adjoining this House, the National Museum and the National Library and in this House itself there are former members of the teaching profession with many years' service in that profession who will get no credit for it.  I am aware, too, that social welfare officers are very perturbed over certain sections of this Bill.  No doubt the Minister has been circularised and he is aware of their grievances.  I am confident he will do what he can to remedy these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> Deputy Cosgrave mentioned Army officers and Army personnel who appear to have been left out of the beneficial provisions of this Bill.  I trust the Minister will be able to consider favourably the points made by Deputy Cosgrave.  Recently one particular matter was brought to my attention.  Engineers who joined the Army at the outbreak of war, when the emergency was declared, and who subsequently became officials of local authorities got no credit for their Army service.  I do not notice any provision for credit for pension purposes or incremental purposes for such people in this Bill whereas engineers who joined the local authority immediately in the 1940's after graduation will benefit for pension purposes, although they did not volunteer in the emergency. The men who made the sacrifice stand to lose.  I trust it will be possible for the Minister to remedy that position on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am particularly grateful to Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish, the leader of the Labour Party, for the support they have given to a case I mentioned to them, the case of a former member of the Oireachtas to whom Section 29 of this Bill would apply, were it not for the fact that the section states that an aggregate of 3,650 days' continuous service is required whereas this man has about 3,600 days' service.  The man in whose case I am interested is also the holder of a 1916 Service Medal and Service Certificate. It might be possible for the Minister, by virtue of the man's holding this certificate and medal to add the requisite number of days to his Oireachtas service and so qualify him under Section 29.</P>
    <P>In every part of this House from time to time, Deputies have spoken in favour of assisting the Old IRA whenever it is in our power to do so.  On this occasion it is possible to do so. It is not possible for us to bring in an amendment which would involve a charge on the Exchequer but I feel sure that, having regard to the support this case has received from all parts of the House, the Minister, in his goodness, will agree to rectify this matter. It is an isolated case.  It will not <Col N="1610" /> establish a precedent because it cannot happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always seemed to me that in matters of legislation which relates to superannuation, whatever we try to do produces a result wherein confusion is worse confounded. One of the difficulties is that all superannuation legislation, in my experience at any rate, is related back to previous legislation which, in turn, is related back to other previous legislation, and one would need to spend a great deal of one's life studying this aspect of law to get even a grasp of the subject at all.</P>
      <P>This Bill seems to me, so far as I have been able to comprehend it, to be an advance on the present situation but I have some doubts as to omissions. Like Deputy Carty, I fear that the small handful of ex-national teachers who are now civil servants, whether by accident or design, are not provided for in this Bill in the matter of getting credit for their service as national teachers.  They were State servants equally then as they are now. I would ask the Minister to clarify that position and, if these men are not being provided for within the terms of this Bill, that he would, in his kindness&mdash;and I am sure he is anxious to do the fair thing&mdash;include them so that the time they spent as national teachers will be counted as pensionable service when the determination of their pensions falls due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other section which puzzles me and it is a section in regard to which I am in a similar difficulty to others.  If one were to seek to amend it in Committee, it would be ruled out of order because it would be deemed to impose a charge upon the revenue and, therefore, we have not the right to move such an amendment; only the Minister has.  I do not intend to take up much of the time of the House on this but I should like briefly to indicate what the position is in relation to Section 21 in which there is a reference to the Garda and to ex-members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  Section 21 refers to subsection (3) of Section 15 of the Superannuation Act, 1936.  It would appear to me that the person referred to in that <Col N="1611" /> subsection must have been an established civil servant at the date of the passing of the Act of 1936.  It seems a very long time ago and the purpose of Section 21 of the Bill would appear to be to extend the Minister's powers of discretion, in relation to such persons as were established civil servants in 1936 on the date of the passing of the Act, from officers of the Garda to officers of the Dublin Metropolitan Police.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that almost 30 years have passed since the passing of that Act and a number of men joined the Garda Síochána and, to my knowledge, some of them subsequently became employees of semi-State Bodies and some of them became established civil servants.  I would urge upon him that the section should be so changed as to cover such people as were members of the Garda and who are now established civil servants and so as to give such people credit for service given before their entry into the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with other Deputies in the plea on behalf of the ex-member of this House who failed to qualify by a handful of days under Section 29 of the Bill.  We all know very well what happened in other years.  Men have very often given the best part if their lives in this House and have ended their days in anything but comfort&mdash;some of them, be it said in truth, in absolute poverty.  It behoves us, in regard to the case Deputy Carty has mentioned, to act in as humanitarian a way as we can and I would support the plea to the Minister to make an exception in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that, in the main, the purpose of this Bill is to tie up a number of loose threads here and there, and to bring into one Bill a number of adjustments which it would probably be necessary to make in separate Bills unless this omnibus type of legislation were resorted to as a means of carrying out the necessary adjustments.  Therefore, while the Bill is not fundamental in <Col N="1612" /> any way, it does, nevertheless, make adjustments over a wide field where adjustments have been clearly called for because of omissions in the past and because of a failure at the time to foresee potential developments.</P>
      <P>There is one new thing here, that is, the extension of the device of using what is known as notional service or as perhaps it is more colloquially known, added years.  The Minister in his speech seemed to emphasise the necessity for a provision of this kind because, as he rightly explained, in some branches of the Civil Service where you desire to recruit professional or technical officers, the minimum qualifications are prescribed and, as these minimum qualifications are frequently not attainable by the potential applicant until he is 30, 35 or 40 years of age, it means that his official service will be a matter of only 25 or 20 years, which in turn means that he can never hope to get a full pension, although he enters the service with all the high qualifications required as a condition of his employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister is apparently taking additional powers now to extend the application of notional service or added years and in this way hopes to be able to tempt into the Civil Service persons who are likely to sell their skill outside, unless there is an attraction of the type offered by the Minister.  This is a wise decision, in view of the competitiveness of offers outside the Civil Service, particularly for professional and technical officers. I think it is the only means by which the Minister can be assured that the State will have at its command the best possible technicians and those with the highest possible professional qualifications to carry out the work of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather that whatever is behind this Bill, there is a necessity to deal with redundancy somewhere or other, but the Minister did not go so far as to tell us what the redundancy problem is.  I have a suspicion that redundancy is anticipated in the Department of Social Welfare.  If that is so, would the Minister tell us what is the extent of the redundancy, how many officers are likely to be affected, their grades, and <Col N="1613" /> what exactly the Minister proposes to do to deal with the redundancy problem. Possibly persons may be transferred to other Departments: possibly some who cannot be accommodated in other Departments will be tempted to accept a pension, with some years added in recognition of the fact that their services and their contract with the State may be broken because of the redundancy occurring now.  The Minister might give us some information on that point so that we may know what is being done in this rather important Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the change which is being made now in the provision of gratuities for certain persons. In the past, under the Superannuation Act of 1887, an unestablished full-time officer, that is, a person not holding a Civil Service certificate, could, if he had seven years' service, be granted a gratuity on retirement if retired for the purpose of facilitating reorganisation in his Department; or he could get a gratuity if he had 15 years' service, provided the reason for his retirement was infirmity of mind or body.  Now, as a result of discussions which have taken place between the staff side and the official side on the Civil Service conciliation council, the Minister has agreed to modify that provision and it will be possible in future with a minimum of seven years' service to qualify for this gratuity.  Previously the minimum service was 15 years in order to qualify.</P>
    <P>The gratuity in the future will vary as in the past.  I understand there is no change in the basis of compensation. In the past, a person in this particular category and who retired without pension after 15 years' service got approximately 15 weeks' pay, a week's pay for each year of service.  In future if he retires with seven years' service, I understand he will get seven weeks' pay.  I understand the unit of computation of compensation is a week's pay for each year of service.  This method of compensation which applies to civilian personnel in military barracks in Dublin and throughout the country also applies to full-time unestablished officers in different State Departments.  In the aggregate, there is <Col N="1614" /> not a great number of them but they are still a permanent feature of Civil Service organisation.  They have always been there and the effluxion of time has not operated to diminish their numbers to any great extent.</P>
    <P>It was felt in 1887, 76 years ago, that if such persons retired, they should get a week's pay for each year of service.  We are now in 1963 and the basis of compensation is still a week's pay for each year of service. It is true that pay has changed since 1887 but it is highly questionable whether a week's pay at that time bought more than a week's pay does to-day, having regard to the high level of prices, but whatever view prevailed in 1887, the general feeling was that if you gave a week's pay for each year of service, you were doing well.  Notwithstanding the way the world has changed since then, we are still proposing to give a week's pay for each year of service now.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that he could not be accused of any great rashness or impetuosity if in 1963 he reflected that the present compensation was based on concepts of humanity in 1887 and that he was going to take a step to the left in this matter also and increase the compensation to something above a week's pay for each year of service. I do not suggest any particular unit rate as adequate compensation but I think the Minister must realise whatever was fixed 76 years ago as a method of compensation can hardly be a fair method of compensation to-day, particularly when pension schemes and gratuities are so well known and so much a part of conditions of employment to-day.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister therefore to look into this question of gratuities payable under the 1887 Act to full-time unestablished officers who get no pension on retirement.  He should endeavour to increase the amount of compensation beyond the extremely miserable basis of a week's pay for each year of service. That basis means that if a person retires after 40 years' service to the State, the most he can get is about nine months' pay.  It can hardly be urged that that is adequate recognition of such long service.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="1615" /> would be able to examine the matter to see if he can do something substantially better for those concerned. The number is not very large and an increase in the gratuity which they will get in lieu of the pension for which they will not qualify would be extremely helpful to those who have no other income on which to subsist in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question of the widows of civil servants.  Fifty years ago, the idea of having a job which carried a pension was regarded by some people as a rather enviable assignment.  But, of course, in the past 30 years in particular, the world has undergone a metamorphosis in the matter of the introduction of pension schemes.  Every large firm in the country now has a pension scheme of some kind or other.  Every good firm has a pension scheme certainly. The local authorities provide pensions for all their employees, even down to the weekly wage earner who previously never came into the reckoning for local authority pension purposes. Similarly, many other firms with which we are all familiar have provided pensions for their staffs.  In the State services, pensions have likewise been provided.  While one might complain here and there about the pension schemes provided, nevertheless, it is gratifying that on the whole we have reached the stage at which we recognise that when a person reaches a mature age and is no longer able to sell his brains or brawn on the labour market, he must of necessity be provided with the wherewithal to see himself through the rest of his days on this earth.</P>
    <P>Many of the State-sponsored bodies, however, provide better pension schemes for the widows of their employees than the State does.  In 98 per cent of the cases&mdash;and I do not think there has been any change in this&mdash;no pension is provided for the widows of civil servants.  You may find a case in which a civil servant rendered 44 years' service.  He may have been a dedicated civil servant. He may have believed his noblest efforts were to be found in serving the <Col N="1616" /> State.  But when he dies his widow gets merely one year's salary.  If the family were able to spend that year's salary in the previous year and the year before that, presumably they will spend it on the same demands as encouraged spending while the breadwinner was alive.  In the year after his death, the widow of that civil servant has to live on that year's salary.  After that, there is no more. That person just floats out into the general mass of the community.  The services which her husband rendered to the nation, perhaps at a lesser rate of pay than he could get elsewhere, are forgotten.  The widow is allowed to fend for herself, and perhaps for schoolgoing children, in any way she can.</P>
    <P>The time is now coming when the State ought to look at the question of providing pensions for the widows of civil servants so as to ensure that when the breadwinner, the pensionable officer, dies, at least there will be some income available in order to assist the widow during her lifetime or until such time as the family are in a position to provide for the mother. Certainly, there is a big gap at present between the pension on the day the civil servant dies and the provision of no income whatever for the widow.  I would hope the Minister would be able to give some idea if he is in sympathy with the objective I seek to attain.  I hope he will have the matter examined and a reasonable scheme formulated so that it could be considered and made sufficiently attractive to enable especially the middle and lower grades to embrace a scheme of that kind.  Otherwise, it may be impossible for them because of the necessity of sacrificing so much of their own pension during their pensionable years in order to make sure that there is some portion of that pension hypotheticated to provide for the widow after the serving officer's death.</P>
    <P>Those are a few of the matters I wanted to raise on this Bill.  There will be a variety of others, to which the Minister made no reference when introducing the Bill, which we can discuss more effectively perhaps when the Committee Stage is reached.</P>
    <Col N="1617" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to mention two points.  The first touches on what was dealt with by Deputy Norton, that is, the likely redundancy among social welfare officers.  Due to the operation of the contributory old age pension, it is clear the volume of work to be done by social welfare officers will be greatly reduced.  There is a feeling of uneasiness among these people in regard to their future employment. Deputy Carty mentioned it would be good for the Civil Service generally if officers could move around from one Department to another until they found some section congenial and suited to their capabilities. However, I am afraid that is not possible at the moment.  There is, shall we say, a sort of closed shop between one Department and another. The result is that it would be impossible to put social welfare officers into the Department of Finance and <i>vice versa.</i> Therefore, there is a problem in this prospect of redundancy.  I would ask the Minister to deal favourably with these social welfare officers, because they were pioneers and helped in the formation of a Department.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to deal with at this stage is one touched on by many speakers, that is, the question of recognising the service given by national teachers who subsequently came into the Civil Service.  The Minister is giving the benefits of this Bill to officers of semi-State bodies.  He is giving them credit for their service with CIE, Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna and the Folklore Commission.  In the case of the Folklore Commission, while officers were in the service of that body they had, as far as I know, no pension at all.  Yet when they come into the Civil Service they will get full credit for the years they served with the Folklore Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, a teacher who has a right to a pension for his services and who would have a full pension had he remained as a teacher, if he enters the Civil Service, will not bring with him any pension rights he may have acquired in his service as a national teacher.  I want to stress particularly the point that this applies <Col N="1618" /> only to national teachers, not to vocational and secondary teachers.  I think it is a most unfair discrimination. My interpretation of this Bill is that it does not remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>I feel quite sure the Minister, if he has not already adverted to that point or considered it, will if necessary bring in an amendment or indeed a new section to deal with it.  I do not want to labour the point at all but I think the feeling of all sides of this House is that this is something that has been overlooked in the past and that it does require remedial measures.  While this Bill is going through the House is the time to do it.  If the Minister does what I have suggested he will, first of all, remedy an injustice and, secondly, receive the support of every member of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that if this Bill helps to speed up a flow of personnel from one section of our society to another it will be doing a good day's work.  There are undoubtedly people in various categories of public service in this country who can be described as square pegs in round holes and there is no doubt that people whose services in a Department or other post are now recognised for superannuation or pension purposes should, on transfer to a section where their gifts might be more profitably exploited to the public benefit, be allowed to carry those pension rights with them.</P>
      <P>This provision is long overdue.  I could never understand in connection with bodies like the ESB and Bord na Móna why it is not possible to have a flow of highly technical men between one organisation and the other or between either organisation and the Civil Service.  That has been a fundamental weakness in the organisation of these two companies and I believe we have suffered greatly because of a negative approach to that problem by the two companies.  Some people may say there has been a form of healthy competition between these organisations. I maintain there is a great deal of antagonism between them and that it would be much better for the public at large if there were greater mobility of staff between such bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> The same applies to officials and employees generally of local authorities. I see no reason why an officer of a local authority should not be allowed, if he is so fitted, to move to any branch of the Civil Service or why, if some individual in the Civil Service feels he would like to move into the local authority service, he should be prevented from so doing or that he should have to sacrifice pension rights.  Such mobility is highly desirable from the point of view of efficiency and satisfaction in the State, semi-State or local authority services.  In this context I should like the Minister to consider what appears to me to be a snag in this measure&mdash; the provision that the transfer must be approved by both employers.  The Minister may have been envisaging a situation where a number of employees may rush from one group to another, getting the doors jammed.  I do not think there is any need for fear in that respect and, consequently, I do not believe there is need for approval from both employers.  In fact, it could lead to victimisation by one employer or the other and it should not be left open to an employer to victimise any employee just because he wanted to transfer his services.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the post of full time, unestablished officers, particularly those attached to the Department of Defence.  Whatever about the Department of Defence, there are such officers in other categories and I think there is an attempt being made here to help them.  I refer to provisions in Section 5, particularly.  However, I do not think the Bill is going far enough. Like other Deputies, I feel that by making reference to snags at this time we may be helping more than by putting down amendments later which will be ruled out of order because private Deputies may not move amendments which would have the effect of imposing a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton made reference to the 1887 Act which is taken as a precedent here to estimate what gratuity or lump sum should be given to those people who had retired or left <Col N="1620" /> a particular form of employment after several years' service.  It amazes me that such a situation would arise and I should like to say immediately that I do not blame the Minister.  The people who draft Bills such as this are civil servants, the backroom boys, and I say that in no derogatory manner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to leave the Minister clear in this but if the Ceann Comhairle wishes me to lay the blame on him, I shall respectfully do so.  The Minister is responsible for the fact that his advisers show no mercy at all or sense of charity to those who are in a weaker position than themselves. I do not know how many times I have met in the corridors of this House members of ex-Civil Service organisations looking for increases in their pensions or making some other form of demand.  It amazes me that they allowed themselves to be put in that position, seeing that a few years prior to such a demand, they themselves were the advisers of a particular Minister.  To my mind, they showed a short-sightedness in dealing with a matter of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is seriously suggested that one week's pay for every year's service is a fair gratuity to offer to a person who is going out after seven years' constant service and loyal dedication to his work in a particular Department of the State.  The minimum <Col N="1621" /> to which the Minister should agree should be at least six weeks' pay for every year's service.  It should be realised, first and foremost, that officers who are unestablished suffer by comparison with their colleagues who are fully established.  They suffer in many respects.  They are at a disadvantage when it comes to the question of leave and very often they are at a disadvantage when it comes to the question of remuneration.  What I cannot understand is why two people are paid a different rate of wages or salary for doing the same work side by side.  We have the established civil servant getting £9 a week with good holidays and a good pension rate and side by side with him, we have an unestablished officer drawing £2 a week less and perhaps only getting ten to 15 days' holiday, half the period given to the full-time officer, while both do exactly the same type of work.</P>
    <P>Why is there that differential?  Is it not sufficient to say that one is established and one is unestablished? Should that not be sufficient to segregate them?  To penalise unestablished officers to the extent they are penalised is very unfair indeed.  Of course, there is the aspect that to a great extent they are unorganised and weak.  As such, like any unorganised section of the community, they are at the tail-end when it comes to getting their rights.  I hope the position of the unestablished, full-time servants, to which I and other Deputies have referred, will receive more sympathetic consideration before this Bill passes through all its Stages.</P>
    <P>One other point upon which I should like to comment is the possibility of allowing Army service during the emergency for pension and superannuation purposes in State, semi-State and local authority employment.  This is a most reasonable suggestion when you consider that the young men who came into the Army during the emergency perhaps sacrificed very good positions.  They may not have been in them when they joined the Army but the very fact that they did join and answered the call, as it was then described, meant that they were depriving <Col N="1622" /> themselves of the opportunity of entering good employment outside. Many people did not answer the call and therefore today they are in the advantageous position that they have anything from two to five extra years' service that will be counted for superannuation and pension purposes over the individual who joined the Defence Forces at the time of the emergency.</P>
    <P>I do not think the position is as difficult as it would appear on initial examination and if the Minister has this matter examined by the various Departments affected, he might find that it would be a simple proposition to allow, as Deputy Cosgrave suggested, a percentage of the service in the Army to count for superannuation purposes in their employment at present.  That should apply not alone to the officer rank, and the technical and professional officers, but right down the ranks to NCOs and men.  We have many former NCOs and men in the Civil Service and in local authority employment and a limited number working in State and semi-State companies.  The service they gave during the emergency should be counted in their present employment and the State should not receive any great thanks for enabling that to be done because these men sacrificed possibly the best years of their lives.</P>
    <P>Many of them, when the emergency was over in 1946, received a miserable gratuity which was not even sufficient to enable them to set up in civilian life in a small business.  The biggest percentage of those in the lower ranks of the Army during the emergency, the NCOs and the lower officer ranks, had to emigrate.  Those who are left in the country should be given some recognition on the lines I have suggested and it would be appreciated by all.</P>
    <P>Omnibus legislation such as this is not going to satisfy all who should be brought into it.  I know it is a very difficult proposition to include all and sundry and it is only when such a Bill as this comes before the House that we find very deserving sections have been left out.  It is really on an occasion such as this that you can pinpoint the injustice done to those left out.  I <Col N="1623" /> hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will take time to amend the various sections with a view to meeting the points put forward by Deputies and by interested groups outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>My principal reason for intervening is to support my colleague, Deputy Carty, in the plea he made for a former member of this House, under Section 29.  This former member is an ex-Deputy for County Galway and he is just a few days short of the number required to qualify for superannuation under Section 29.  As he is the holder of a 1916 Medal and a certificate, I trust the Minister will be able to qualify him under this section. I am very pleased that the proposal has received the benediction and support of all the other Parties in the House.  I hope, as this will not be a precedent, that this will be set right before this measure finally becomes law.</P>
      <P>I am also in agreement with Deputies who have spoken for former members of the national teaching profession who are employed in Government Departments and whose teaching service is not counted for superannuation purposes.  I hope that their case will also be righted under this Bill.  As regards social welfare officers, I was circularised like other members of the House.  It would take too long to go through the whole circular we got.  I am sure the Minister has already received it and will give consideration to the case they have made, especially as regards those who have to go out on superannuation due to redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Minister has, under Section 22, provided for the granting to inspectors and organisers of the Department of Education who retired prior to 1950 a concession similar to that granted to teachers who retired before that year.  About two years ago, I think there were only six of those in the whole country.  I happened to meet them.  I took up their case and made representations to the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance on their behalf. They have since been awaiting the introduction of this Bill.  I see now <Col N="1624" /> that their case has been covered.  I hope the six are still alive and that they will shortly benefit by this concession which the Minister has incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we are allowed under this measure to refer to other sections of the community which I do not see mentioned in the Bill. Like other Deputies, from time to time we had questions down about, say, superannuation for forestry workers and for auxiliary postmen.  I do not see any reference to superannuation for these categories in this Bill.  In Galway, this comes up very often for the simple reason that since the Act was passed, I think in 1945, we were one of the first counties in Ireland to implement the Act.  Our county council workers are contributing. When they work for 200 days they qualify.  All of them who have gone out on pension since have benefited by that Superannuation Act.</P>
    <P>Forestry workers who, one might say, work side by side with county council workers and the same hours, too, feel they also should be brought in.  They feel some legislation should be introduced to enable them to qualify for superannuation when the time comes for them to go out on pension.  Their work could be classed as permanent.  The forests are established now.  Certainly, 70 or 80 per cent of them could be classed as permanent workers.  Deputations and groups of them whom I have met have informed me they would be only too pleased to pay into a superannuation fund from their weekly wage, the same as the county council workers do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether this provision could be included before the Bill becomes law?  The same applies to auxiliary postmen.  Is it because they are not established?  They are doing very important work.  I suppose there is nobody they call on as often as the local Deputy.  They bring more letters to him than they bring to the ordinary individual in the same village or district.  I have seen questions from all <Col N="1625" /> sides on this matter.  I have spoken on their behalf on several occasions.  I should like these two sections to be included in this Bill.</P>
      <P>My main reason for speaking was to support the case made by Deputy Carty for the ex-member of this House from County Galway.  I hope he will qualify.  I welcome the Bill and its main provisions and I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.  I hope it will get a speedy passage so that the people expecting to benefit will benefit from it as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all agreed in principle that we should support this Bill.  It is encouraging that so many members of the Opposition spoke here tonight with such evident sincerity in respect of certain classes of individuals. I do not think it is unfair, however, to ask the members of the Opposition who have spoken so eloquently tonight to remember those speeches before they make further criticisms of Government expenditure, and particularly of the taxation provisions.  They have been spending a lot of time recently criticising the Minister for Finance for his whole financial policy and the Budget has scarcely been passed before they come into this House asking for increased expenditure.</P>
      <P>I am very much in favour of this Bill.  In particular, I should like to support the points which I understand Deputy Cosgrave already made with reference to Army personnel.  There has always been a curious differentiation between the treatment of ex-Army men and others.  Cases do arise, particularly amongst the officers, where they retire from the Forces and take up civilian employment very occasionally in the Civil Service and more frequently in a State company. There is, for instance, one very senior officer who retired after long and excellent service and who is now giving equally excellent service in one of the State companies.  In that capacity, I understand he is still very properly able to draw his Army pension.  I think that is exactly as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an officer is entitled to an Army pension and transfers from the Forces <Col N="1626" /> to a post ranked as a Civil Service post, he is not allowed to draw his Army pension.  That appears to me to be unwarranted.  If he deserves his pension, he should be paid his pension.  It is not, to my mind, sustainable to say there is any difference between a partlyowned State company and the Civil Service.  Those who are employed in State-owned companies are, to all intents and purposes, civil servants.  I should like the Minister to look into that matter to see whether this injustice can be rectified.</P>
    <P>I have also in mind a rather curious situation which arises in connection with the Ordnance Survey.  The staff of the Ordnance Survey partly consists of Army personnel of the Survey Company of the Corps of Engineers. That is the normal way in which a man enters the Ordnance Survey Department.  These Army men are employed, therefore, in the Corps of Engineers and are working with civilians on exactly the same type of work.  After a certain period in the Army, these men may be given an opportunity to apply for a post on the civil side of the Ordnance Survey.  If they do, they must first complete five years' unestablished service before they can become established and start ranking for pension.</P>
    <P>It may very well be that a man may serve in the Survey Company of the Corps of Engineers for eight or ten years before he gets the chance of transferring to the Civil Service but he is allowed only three years at most of his Army service to rank as unestablished service.  Even though he has been in the job for eight or ten years, he must still do another two years in &ldquo;civvies&rdquo; before he can start ranking for pension.  There is no difference whatsoever in the work carried out by the Army man and the civil servant.  The man who transfers from the Corps of Engineers to the civilian side of the Ordnance Survey does not have to sit on a different chair or at a different desk.  All he has to do is hand in his uniform and buy himself a suit of civilian clothes. He carries on exactly as before.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to take this matter into consideration as well <Col N="1627" /> as the points which Deputy Cosgrave already raised.</P>
    <P>All along there is a tendency to discriminate against the Army men, even though they have been in the Government service.  There may be other instances I am not aware of.  There probably are.  Even though the numbers are very small, I think these are cases which should receive the most sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised some questions about pensions lagging behind.  They will arise on another Bill which will be brought before the House dealing with increased pensions.  I also think that questions about Army pensions are not strictly relevant to this Bill, because the Army have a code of their own, and I am afraid those questions will have to be deferred until the Army Pensions Bill comes before the House.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment on a matter raised by Deputy Cosgrave and also referred to by Deputy Booth.  It is alleged that an Army man who goes to the Ordnance Survey and afterwards gets a transfer to the Ordnance Survey is rather shabbily treated.  I should like to have another look at that to see exactly how it works out.  That is all I can say about it at the moment.</P>
      <P>A question was raised about the pensions of the widows of officers.  In recent years, a civil servant can opt to take a lower pension for himself and leave part of his pension available to his widow, if he leaves a widow, that is, if he dies before his wife.  There is no concession there to the pensioner.  Actuarially, he draws the same amount if he takes the full pension and disregards his wife, as he would draw if he were to agree to take a smaller pension and leave some of the residue for the benefit of his wife.  I do not know whether or not that applies to the Army.  I mention it only to show that there is no concession for the civil servant as against the Army officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I should like to deal with is the matter of pension abatement. The general rule of the Civil Service is that if a civil servant retires on pension and he takes another job&mdash;and sometimes <Col N="1628" /> he is asked to take another job&mdash; whatever he is paid for his new job, plus his pension, must not exceed his salary when he retired.  If it does exceed it, his pension is abated to bring it down to that level.  He cannot earn more from public funds than he was earning before he retired.  That appears to be fair enough, because some disservice might be done to the State if it were possible to bring a man back when he was on pension and treat him better than he was treated before he left the service.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, pre-Truce service is reckonable for pensions.  The reference in Section 16 is to certain situations only.  Generally speaking, those who are employed in the Civil Service have their pre-Truce service reckonable for pension purposes.  Of course, there are exceptions.  For instance, a man who was in the IRA before the Truce and who also worked on and off for the Dáil office cannot get a pension for both.  If he gets a military service pension for his services during the fight for independence, he cannot also, at the same time, draw a pension for his service in the Dáil office.  Apart from that, generally, a civil servant would be allowed his pre-Truce service.</P>
    <P>One of the big questions in this Bill is the question of transfer.  It must be remembered that this will apply only where the transfer is for the benefit of the country, or the public good, and not for the person's own benefit.  If there is a transfer from the Civil Service to a State company, or from a local authority to the Civil Service, or any other transfer, if the two employers agree that the transfer is for the benefit of the country, then the person being transferred will have his service with the employer he has left counted towards his pension as well as his service with the employer he goes to.  It must be kept in mind that both employers must agree that it is for the public good that the transfer is taking place.</P>
    <P>We must not look at this at all as being for the benefit of the person concerned.  He might better his position by going from one position to another. If he does, that is at his own volition. If he leaves Bord na Móna to go to <Col N="1629" /> a better job with the ESB, that is his own look out, and he is not to expect that his service with Bord na Móna will count towards his pension when he retires from the ESB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish </NameTxt>
      <P>Would a simple release from Bord na Móna to go to the ESB be deemed sufficient ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan </NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is that quite obviously in many cases in the past a person would be a great asset to, let us say, one of the State companies, but if he left the Civil Service as things stood, he would lose his pension rights, and he would not go.  In many cases, people were seconded, which was a way of getting around the difficulty.  We think it is better to do it in this way. If both employers agree that the man should be transferred, his pension will be reckoned on his full service and the employer he leaves will make a contribution towards his final pension.</P>
      <P>On redundancy I should like to say as a starting off point that, up to this, redundancy was treated by just telling the man: &ldquo;You are no longer required and you have to go.&rdquo;  He got the pension which was due to him based on the number of years' service he had attained at that stage.  I do not think that has been used very much recently, but when I first became a Minister, I remember distinctly that was the case.  There was no other way of dealing with it at that time.</P>
      <P>This provision is brought in to make it more pleasant, if you like, where there is redundancy, and to enable the Minister concerned to give added years of service so that the person can go out with a better pension than he would otherwise have.  I do not know of any expected cases of redundancy, except in the Social Welfare Department, so there is no&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  There is a provision in the Bill that a county registrar's service will be counted for pension purposes if he becomes a district justice.  Deputy Corish asked if the same would apply to a State solicitor. It does not.  It applies only in that particular case because it was considered that the work of a registrar is very much the same type of work as a district justice would be doing.  The work of a State solicitor would not be exactly the same type and, therefore, it was not included.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recommendation made by many Deputies in respect of ex-Deputy Jordan who sat in this House.  The reason why I welcome it is that the first place I met ex-Deputy Jordan was in Frongoch after 1916 and one is inclined to have regard for people one has met in those circumstances. I shall see what can be done in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned before, when I brought in the provision dealing with those men who have left the Dáil or <Col N="1631" /> Seanad before the contributory scheme was brought in, I was approached by three men&mdash;one of them is here at present&mdash;one from each of the three Parties.  I asked these three men afterwards to advise me on everything I did. I did not ask them on this particular one.  The Deputies will see on reading the clause that there is an amendment already put into the Bill which was not there up to this, that is, that a person need not be 60 years of age.  If he is over 50 and is incapacitated he can be brought in.  That is a new clause, put in at the request of these three advisers of mine and I intend to ask them what they think of this particular case of ex-Deputy Jordan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought to consider it in respect of this Bill if it can be put in, because I do not know how quickly the Bill which the Ministes has referred to will come in.  There has been need for a pension scheme for these people for a long time.  There is one case of a man who gave great service not only to the Labour Court, but to the country.  He passed on without getting anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall inquire about it again.  I was asked could national teachers be brought into these organisations that would be interchangeable. They are, of course, brought in as far as local authorities are concerned <Col N="1632" /> under the Local Government Act. They can be brought in here, of course, by me, by order, but it must be kept in mind, as I have already said, that it will only be applied where it is considered that a national teacher would do very much better national work by being transferred than he is able to do where he is.  Only in such a case would it be applied.  In other words, it would not be applied where the national teacher was applying for a job in order to better his position.  If he was not going to improve conditions generally for the country, then he would have no claim.</P>
      <P>As far as these added years to professional men are concerned, there was no adverse comment and I can pass on as far as that is concerned.</P>

They are the Government service, all the State bodies, very likely, the universities and, of course, the local authorities.  I do not know at the moment about anything else.  There might be a case to be made for some other particular class of people that does not occur to us at the moment.</P>

      <P>There was a clause brought in in 1936 to deal with certain officers.  It was not properly done. Now it is necessary to amend that and this is the amendment.  I think I have already answered Deputy Norton's question.  He asked me what was the redundancy problem.  The only problem in any Department is in Social Welfare.  I do not foresee redundancy in any other Department in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a good deal of discussion <Col N="1633" /> in regard to the gratuity for unestablished service.  We are making a small advance, I admit a very small advance, as far as that is concerned.  On the other hand, it must be admitted that the social welfare benefits are increasing fairly rapidly and fairly substantially and the unestablished people will to a great extent gain by these increased social welfare benefits.  I am not prepared to defend at all that we are treating people very generously by giving them a week's salary for every year of service but I want to tell Deputy Norton that this is not by any means a trivial matter.  It is fairly costly.  However, I am prepared to have another look at it to see if some change could be made in it.  I want to warn Deputies that if it were a matter of a cost of £1,000 or £2,000 a year I would not hesitate to say that we would do something about that but it is a very much bigger problem.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan raised a matter that I have great sympathy for, that is, the case of men who were in the Army during the emergency. I think we all have great sympathy for these men because what Deputy McQuillan said is quite true, that they were mostly young men, just around the age where they would be looking for some way of settling down to a job for life and it may have deprived many of these men of a good job in that somebody else came along in their absence and took the jobs that they might have got.  That is true but I do not think we can do very much now.  When I say &ldquo;just now&rdquo; I mean now or at any future time.  At the time they were retiring we may not have been as generous as we should have been but we did as a Government at that time lay it down that they would get preference for jobs that were going for some five or six years after they left the Army.  Some of them were placed&mdash;not all, indeed&mdash;and, of course, many of them did very well indeed in commerce when they went out.  There are, I am quite sure, some <Col N="1634" /> who have been unfortunate about getting a job but it would be very difficult indeed to say that they should be allowed for the years in the Army for pension purposes.  It would be impossible, I am afraid, to deal with it in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate can be said to have an effect on a fairly large number of people because many people find that the income that comes to them through this Estimate is their sole means of livelihood.  There are just a few matters with which I should like to deal.  One of the things I am interested in is the entitlement of Irishmen serving on British ships to workmen's compensation. The Minister will remember I asked a question about this fairly recently.  It has been held by our courts that these men are not entitled to workmen's compensation under the Act.  In the case I have in mind, the company made an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of the amount equal to the workmen's compensation, making it clear at the same time that there was no obligation on them, in their opinion, to do so.  This is a matter which should not be left to the goodness of heart of employers.</P>
      <P>I obtained a copy of a circular issued by the Minister's Department and it is made pretty clear and definite in that circular that such seamen are entitled to workmen's compensation. Would the Minister investigate the position and, in his wisdom, remedy that apparent defect?  The court in Cork held that a seaman was not entitled to workmen's compensation.  A remedy of the present defect would be in the interests of Irishmen who are compelled to seek a living outside this country and serve a Government, other than the Government of this State.  We all know there is not sufficient work here.  To all intents and purposes, these people are domiciled here.  They pay their insurance and they should be fully covered for the minimum amount of workmen's compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is the long delay in dealing with appeals in the case of non-contributory old age <Col N="1636" /> pensions.  I am quite well aware that there has to be some delay where the applicant puts forward a contrary view, or someone else does it on his behalf; in that case, the Minister's officers must investigate, and possibly investigate very fully, but the delay in many cases is very prolonged.  It may be due to the fact that there are not enough deciding officers.  Six months is too long a period when one remembers that most of these people are practically dependent upon the pension and, when they are expected to wait for anything from three to six months, they naturally feel aggrieved.</P>
    <P>With regard to blind pensions, an applicant simply gets an old age pension form at the post office, which he duly fills in.  I do not think there is anything on that form telling him that he must not only complete the form but submit medical evidence of his incapacity. Very often an application for a blind pension comes up in conjunction with a number of old age pension applications and the investigation officer's remark is: &ldquo;No evidence of incapacity submitted&rdquo;.  That is the first information an applicant has of what is required and on many an occasion, I have had to explain that such applicants must get a certificate of incapacity from the doctor appointed by the Minister under the particular section of the Act.  Some explanatory note should be appended making applicants aware of what is required of them and how they should proceed when applying for benefit.</P>
    <P>In a number of instances recently, I had occasion to write to the Minister's Department in connection with the cutting off of unemployment assistance from people who had been drawing benefit for quite a time.  A day comes when they go along to the employment exchange to draw their benefit and are simply told their benefit has been stopped.  Apparently no official document is issued to them to indicate why it is stopped.  They are simply left in that situation until the question is raised by their trade union, by some local person representing their interests or by a Deputy through a Parliamentary Question or a letter to the Minister.  Then it is found that allegations <Col N="1637" /> have been made to the employment exchange that these people are engaged in some type of employment.</P>
    <P>Very often an anonymous letter to the employment exchange is accepted as justification for suspension of benefit. In one case with which I have dealt in the past four months, such an anonymous letter resulted in a married man being deprived of unemployment assistance on which he and his wife were totally dependent.  It was discovered later that the person who wrote the anonymous letter to the employment exchange did not mean the man named in the letter but a man of a similar name who apparently he did believe was drawing unemployment assistance and was working.  I do not believe the anonymous writer did it with any intention of saving Government funds but possibly because of some spleen between himself and the other person.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make to the Minister is that a decision to suspend payment and take from a person what very often is the only thing between him and starvation should not be taken lightly.  I have submitted to the Minister two cases, one just outside my constituency and one in my own town.  During the past fortnight, two married people found when they went to the employment exchange that their unemployment assistance had been stopped and no reason given for it.  That kind of arbitrary decision without any warning or explanation is a most unwholesome thing and I would ask the Minister to investigate the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Tully were present this evening.  I am quite sure he would raise the point I am about to mention, that is, the old complaint he has in connection with contributory old age pensions.  Under the regulations made by the Minister&mdash;not under the Act&mdash; a person must have a certain minimum number of contributions within the ten years or the 15 years prior to his retiring, whichever is more to his advantage, but if he had a lifetime of stamps before that, he gets no value for them.  That is unfair.  There are many people who, if the period of time <Col N="1638" /> since they entered into insurable employment were taken into consideration, as provided in the Act, would qualify for a pension.  It is a great hardship on these people that they cannot so qualify.  There are not very many of them and the Minister, in fairness to the limited number who are left and who feel victimised in being deprived of what they believe to be their right and were told was their right, should grant this concession by changing that regulation.  It would make them extremely happy without costing the Exchequer any great extra amount of money and even if it were granted, it would certainly be a dwindling amount of money going out because these people, in the normal course of things, will not live very long to enjoy it.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with all the points in which I was particularly interested except to say to the Minister&mdash;and I am quite sure he is well aware of it&mdash; that our social welfare benefits are probably the lowest in Europe.  As I said in some other debate, if we had gone into the EEC, we would have been forced to improve our social welfare standards.  I know I cannot advocate legislation on an Estimate but I would suggest to the Minister that in view of the fact that our standards are so low compared with the rest of the European countries&mdash;and in many cases very much lower because the European countries have apparently decided that apart from wages, improved social welfare benefits are a good way to pay workers&mdash;the Minister should give as much leeway and freedom as possible in regard to receiving benefits of the limited types we have. Above all, I would urge the Minister to impress upon his officials who have responsibility for deciding claims for disablement benefit, claims for old age pensions, widows' pensions and the various other benefits that the people who apply for them are in the main practically depending on it and must otherwise resort to an application for home assistance to the relieving officer. It is deplorable that genuine cases can be held up so long because of red tape, which, if properly tackled, could be dealt with expeditiously.  I would ask <Col N="1639" /> the Minister to impress upon his officials the need for speedy decisions which will do justice to the people and to the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to confess in the beginning that I have no serious or broad criticism to level at the Minister or his Department but in any case it is a Department that does not lend itself to any broad criticism because, as Deputy Kyne has pointed out, it is one that deals with individuals, some few hundred thousand of them and it is with the administration of the Department from the point of view of these people that we are mainly concerned.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress what Deputy Kyne has said in relation to every single person who must have recourse to the Department of Social Welfare &mdash;and I know I am interpreting Deputy Kyne's mind when I say this&mdash; that there is no other Department to compare with it for reasonably quick service and quick decisions.  Deputy Kyne gave examples of the hardship that may ensue when people are neglected, not necessarily wilfully, among those who must have recourse to the Department of Social Welfare.  If the Department of Local Government do not send out the £300 building grant for a week or two, it does not make much difference even though it is very important to the person seeking it.  Similarly, in the case of the Department of Agriculture and in the case of a decision of the Department of Industry and Commerce in regard to starting a factory, a week's delay may not have such serious effect as delay in the payment of unemployment assistance or sickness benefit to the person who is waiting on the few pounds or the 32/6d.  a week.  I trust the Minister will try to make even more efficient the officers who are working on this in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must commend the Minister for the action he took recently in respect of an individual, a young married man with one child, whose payment of unemployment assistance was delayed for weeks because his right to a qualification certification was not investigated in a reasonable time.  I do not know <Col N="1640" /> if there was good reason for the delay but the Minister seems to think there was not and I should like to commend him for what he did.  He deemed that man to be eligible for unemployment assistance from the date of his application for a certificate.  Ordinarily, the man would have been entitled to benefit from the date of qualification only, not from the date of his application. We cannot stress too strongly the responsibility that is on the officers of the Department in dealing with the people dependent on 32/6 for sickness benefit or 32/6 for old age pensions or other allowances of that kind.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood. I do not allege or infer that the treatment I have referred to is widespread in the Department but even if there is only one who errs in that respect, the Minister should see that such a person is reprimanded and that delays in such cases will not recur.  It is a very difficult task for the Minister and his top officials but I trust he will set himself to it.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the mistakes made in respect of sending out sickness benefit cheques especially.  Deputies will freely admit that of all the approaches made to them, of all the letters they get, a very high&mdash;if not the highest&mdash;proportion is in respect of sickness benefit.  I can appreciate the difficulties of those who deal with the matter and again I must say that any time I have had occasion to approach the Department on delay in sending out sickness benefit cheques as soon as the complaint is made&mdash;within hours&mdash; the difficulty is cleared up and we are able to give the good news to the unfortunate person who is waiting, that the cheque is more or less on its way.  I appreciate how mistakes can occur and the difficulties that arise when an applicant puts in a wrong number or merely &ldquo;P. Murphy&rdquo; instead of Patrick Murphy and is mixed up with Peter Murphy or somebody else.  An effort should be made to obviate these difficulties as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We wondered for years, and I wondered during my time as Minister for Social Welfare, what happened to the Commission on Workmen's Compensation. Now we are wondering <Col N="1641" /> what happened to the report.  Workmen's compensation is quite a complicated subject but it is not so formidable that its general examination and investigation would warrant eight years and then all we have is the report.  It might be unfair to suggest that nobody seems to be concerned about the implementation of the report or certain parts of it&mdash;but it is about time the Minister asked the Government to shake up the Ministers concerned and get them to give their comments so that the Minister for Social Welfare may formulate proposals arising from the report of this pretty expensive Commission.  So far as I know, they met quite frequently for long periods.  It seems useless if after a period of eight years, there is no result.  Some of the recommendations are good and some not so good, but at least we should have some ideas as a result in the form of legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>The Minister has answered several questions on workmen's compensation and according to what he says his hands are somewhat tied or he is held up in any action he might take because other Departments have not reported.  One very important aspect of it is that a very important section of the people are suffering because action has not been taken on the report.  They are the people who have been injured by accident in their employment and who are still required to exist on £4 10s. a week as maximum workmen's compensation. There was an addition made recently, if not by the present Minister, by his predecessor.  If they had sufficient children to qualify for more than £4 10s., if they were deemed to be sick, they got an addition to the £4 10s. That was a welcome concession but generally I think the Minister would be the first to admit that having regard to the change in money values over the past eight years, there is a very strong case for increasing the maximum certainly, and the percentages of wages to be paid in workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister referred to this in his opening speech which, unfortunately, I was unable to be present for but I hope that he will, if he has not said so already, say in his concluding speech <Col N="1642" /> that he will bring in a measure to increase the maximum for workmen's compensation.  He can certainly be assured by the Labour Party and by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that he will get the Bill within a matter of minutes. There are very important facets of workmen's compensation that need to be changed but the important thing for those on workmen's compensation is that there will be an increase in the money.</P>
    <P>There has been in recent years a revision of the regulations and, of course, the amounts, for the purpose of assessing means to qualify for unemployment assistance, but the system still has all the appearance of the poor house.  I had a letter in respect of a single man which is typical of the regulations being applied in respect of the means test for the purpose of unemployment assistance.  The means of this man were said to include the board and lodging he got from his sister.  I do not think we should assess as means what is tantamount to charity. It may be said that she is his sister and is bound to keep him; nevertheless, it is tantamount to charity.  A man likes to be independent, even if he gets only £1 a week.  This man is not so sick or disabled that he can draw a disabled person's maintenance allowance. He is a single man and he cannot, therefore, get home assistance.  And now it seems the value of his board and lodging debars him from receiving unemployment assistance.  I suggest that man is stripped of his dignity in that he has not the 22/- or 18/- he might get from unemployment assistance. The Minister ought to have a further look at the regulations governing the means test for the purpose of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister made very good changes in the last legislation introduced which gave effect to the increases in last year's Budget.  This year as well, he has an opportunity in the Budget proposals to give various increases.  I trust that in conjunction with that legislation, he will contemplate other changes, changes that need not necessarily mean a lot of money.  These changes would affect a relatively small number of people, but they certainly <Col N="1643" /> would be welcomed by Deputies and particularly by the people affected by them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give serious consideration to the application of the means test to people who work for themselves.  Let me give as an example the fishermen on the Blackwater around Lismore, on the Slaney or around Waterford.  These are seasonal fishermen who may or may not earn fairly good money, depending on their catches.  Their means are assessed on what they earn during those six months of the year.  That debars them from receiving unemployment assistance for the rest of the year.  Because they work for themselves, they cannot get stamps to qualify for insurance benefit.  They are nobody's children for about six months of the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also give consideration to a section of the community I believe to be in a much more serious position: the task workers. I do not know whether task work is peculiar to certain parts of the country or not.  It is a system whereby a farmer says: &ldquo;How much will you charge for thinning that field of turnips or weeding that field?&rdquo; They do work that can be measured in drills.  They cannot get insurance stamps; neither can they get credits by reason of the fact they are not available for work. It means that in the long run they have to make application for unemployment assistance when they are not working. They have not the required number of stamps.  They may not have the required number of credits for some reason or other and then they are debarred from receiving unemployment benefit.  Of course, if I had my way I would advise them all not to take up this kind of work at all. Whether it is advantageous to them or not, I do not know.</P>
    <P>In these times, when social welfare benefits are much more than they were when task work was established, the stamp is very important for these people.  It will determine whether or not they get sickness benefit or unemployment benefit.  It determines particularly their entitlement to old age pension or <Col N="1644" /> if the person died, the entitlement of his widow to a widow's contributory pension.  I would therefore ask the Minister to consider the position of these people, which is a very difficult one.  This is a situation which has existed down through the years but it is one which should be remedied because unemployment insurance stamps now mean so much to the ordinary wage earner.</P>
    <P>I would certainly support Deputy Kyne's plea for getting rid of delays in investigation for the qualification certificate and appeals generally.  I know there are only so many appeals officers in the Minister's Department and that it is pretty difficult for them to get around frequently even to the major centres during the year.  I do not know what special qualifications or status they must have.  But surely, if necessary, some other officers from the Department could be sent around to these places&mdash;places like Dungarvan, Waterford, Wexford and Galway. There is a list of people who want to put their appeals before the appeals officer and who have not an opportunity of doing so for a month, six weeks, or, in some cases&mdash;not frequently&mdash; two months.</P>
    <P>Finally, perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to give me information on two points.  First, could he tell me, as a follow-up to an answer he gave to a query in the House recently, the percentage relationship between the amount spent on social welfare and tax revenue this year, and what it is estimated it will be next year?  Second, will he confirm in respect of the Social Insurance Fund that the contributions still are three-thirds&mdash;one from the employers, one from the employees and one from the State?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Corish said, there has been no serious criticism of the Department of Social Welfare in this debate or in any debate I can remember since I became Minister.  I am glad to add my tribute to the manner in which the Department deal with their work generally.  I, as Minister, am very anxious that there should be <Col N="1645" /> created in the country generally a better image of the function of the officers of the Department.  The function of the Department is to alleviate distress in so far as the Oireachtas feel able to provide for its alleviation.  All the employees of the Department are employed for the purpose of administering the schemes introduced by the Oireachtas in the manner in which they were intended.</P>
      <P>I have always sought to impress on the various officers of the Department that that is their main function.  While the field officers in particular instances naturally devote a large part of their activities to seeing that these various payments are made only to those people to whom the Oireachtas intended they should be made, it is at least an equally important part of their functions to ensure that anybody who is entitled to these benefits gets them, and gets them expeditiously.  Generally speaking, there are very few complaints in that regard.  While there are occasionally criticisms, ill-informed criticisms, of the activities of social welfare officers, I think people who have experience, as Deputies have, of dealing with these matters realise these criticisms are unjustified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Sullivan said, lately at any rate, the House gets several opportunities of covering the ground with regard to the Department of Social Welfare.  We have the annual Estimate and in this Government's time, we have also the opportunity at Budget time of discussing these matters because many of the provisions of Budgets presented by the present Government have related to improvements in payments under these schemes administered by my Department.  Arising out of those Budget provisions, we have each year, practically, a Bill to amend the different social welfare schemes.  This gives still another opportunity to Deputies to discuss all these schemes. So does the Supplementary Estimate for the Department, which is taken each year very close to the end of the financial year.  I do not know whether I interpreted what Deputy O'Sullivan said correctly or not, but I understood him to say there appeared to be no <Col N="1646" /> indication of any effort being made by the Department to improve the services administered by it.  In the past year or two, since I have been in charge of the Department, there have been indications, apart from the increases given in Budgets&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the fact is that quite apart from those increases &mdash;and I am glad that was not what Deputy O'Sullivan intended&mdash;a number of anomalies in the different schemes have been rectified.  This was done in the social welfare schemes generally last year.  In fact my Department are continuously on the look out for any further improvements that can be made.  I have no doubt that when the amendment to the Social Welfare Bill is brought before the House this year, further minor adjustments will be made in the various schemes, aimed at eliminating marginal inequities. The Department are not merely concerned with administering the existing schemes efficiently, but are also continuously on the look out for inequities that may arise in one scheme or another and trying to find ways in which they can be improved.  Deputy O'Sullivan stated that the Minister described the improvements made in the Budget as merely having the effect of abating tax increases in the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Finance used the word &ldquo;abate&rdquo;, I can only say it was not accurate.  I showed in my contribution to the Budget debate that, far from merely abating the increases in the cost of living since the previous Budget, plus the maximum possible rise from the tax increases in the Budget, the improvements proposed will in fact effect a real improvement in the financial position of recipients of payments under every one of those schemes.  That is so, whether they are single or married, with or without children.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred me to cases similar to one mentioned by the <Col N="1647" /> Leader of his Party some time ago&mdash; wives who have been deserted by their husbands and who have not heard from them for a number of years.  As I indicated to Deputy Dillon at the time, I am prepared to examine on their merits any individual cases brought to my notice or to the notice of the Department, and if there are good grounds for believing that the man may be dead, then a decision to award a widow's pension may be taken.  Such a decision has been taken on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Sullivan want the Department to do.  Do they want us actually to evolve some rule of thumb method of deciding that if a husband has not been heard from for a number of years, we automatically assume he is dead and that the wife should be considered a widow?  That is a solution that could not be recommended for serious consideration. After all, since these are widows' pensions, it is reasonable to expect the applicant for a pension to submit some evidence of the attempts made to establish whether the husband is in fact dead.  As I said, in cases where it can be shown that all reasonable inquiries <Col N="1648" /> have been made and that the indications seem to be that the person concerned is no longer alive, a decision may be taken to award a pension.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Kyne's question about Irish sailors serving on British ships who have in one particular case been declared not to be entitled to workmen's compensation, I thought Deputy Kyne would be aware of the position in that regard.  There was a decision given by the circuit court to the effect that in a particular case a man was not entitled to workmen's compensation, and that decision was used by the shipowners as a precedent. The opinion in my Department is that as far as we can see this decision was made without anybody referring to the existence of reciprocal arrangements between this country and Great Britain. At the circuit court hearing, neither plaintiff's nor defendant's counsel appear to have directed the court's attention to those reciprocal arrangements and I understand an appeal is under consideration.</P>
