      <P>The Deputy's question appears to be based on a misunderstanding as residence permits are not required.  I assume that the question relates to employment permits.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, representations regarding these permits would not, at the present time, result in any change.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="7" /> The marked reduction shown in the case of (a) Kilkenny County Council as at the 31st March, 1961, as compared with the 31st March, 1960, and (b) Tipperary (SR) County Council as at 31st March, 1962, as compared with the 31st March, 1960 and 1961, resulted from reviews of the General Medical Services Registers by these health authorities as a consequence of which the names of persons which had remained on the Registers, although the people concerned had died or left the health authority area or had otherwise ceased to be entitled to General Medical Services, were deleted.</P>
    <P>The figures supplied by the Waterford Health Authority in respect of the 31st March, 1962, as shown above do not correctly represent the position as a substantial number of entries on the General Medical Services Register was inadvertently duplicated and counted twice over.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, in view of the recent outbreaks of smallpox in Britain and of typhoid in Zermatt, Switzerland, and the possible implications to Irish trade and the tourist industry, he will make a statement as to his intentions in regard to the future of the public health service in this country; whether he is aware of the discontent in the ranks of the assistant chief medical officers at their treatment at the hands of the Managers' Association; and what action he proposes to take to prevent the eventual collapse of the public health service in Ireland, in view of the mounting numbers of resignations, the inadequate salary scale for married assistants, the drop in the number and in the quality of applicants to the service, and the lack of promotion opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Comprehensive powers to deal with cases of infectious disease, or possible outbreaks, are conferred on local health authorities and their chief medical officers.  Every necessary precaution is taken to prevent the introduction of infectious disease to this country and special measures are applied when particular circumstances warrant this course e.g. the airport and seaport screening of passengers following the outbreak of smallpox referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be noted that no case of smallpox has occurred here for many years.  Only one case of typhoid associated with the recent Zermatt <Col N="9" /> outbreak was reported here and this case was speedily and effectively dealt with, without recourse to special measures.</P>
    <P>I fear that in the latter portion of the question the Deputy has unwittingly conveyed an exaggerated picture of the situation.  I can assure the Deputy that I appreciate fully the importance of an efficient public health service and that I shall continue to take all reasonable steps open to me to maintain that efficiency.</P>

      <P>A company carrying on the business of a moneylender or holding itself out as a moneylender is required to take out annually a licence under the Moneylenders Acts in respect of each address in which it carries on business. 137 moneylenders licences are at present in operation.</P>
      <P>There is no form of State registration for hire-purchase finance companies as such but I understand that 44 such companies are operating here and that the capital of five of them is partly or wholly held by Irish banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is at present no State restriction on the amount of interest which may be charged on private or hire-purchase loans.  However, if a borrower against whom proceedings are being taken for the recovery of a loan can <Col N="18" /> show that the rate of interest is excessive, the court may allow relief under the Moneylenders Acts.  If the interest charged exceeds 39 per cent per annum simple interest, the court is obliged to hold that it is excessive and to allow relief accordingly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>The group of statuary in question which is known as &ldquo;La Pietà&rdquo; and which was presented to this country in 1947 by the Italian Government in appreciation of relief supplies sent by Ireland to Italy, was originally erected in the entrance hall of the National Museum.  As a result of representations from various quarters regarding the unsuitability of that location the Government, following investigation of the question by the Commissioners of Public Works, decided to have the group transferred to the present site in the lawn of the Department of Education premises at Marlborough St.  That site is, I am advised, quite suitable, and it is not proposed to change it.  The provision of a suitable setting at street frontage would, I am advised, necessitate the removal of portion of the high railings which enclose the grounds of the Department of Education, and the formation of a recess, fronted by a low railing, in which the group would be placed.  This would involve considerable expenditure and, moreover, in such a location the sculpture might be exposed to the risk of damage.</P>
      <P>I might add that persons wishing to have a close up view of the sculpture have in fact been granted access to the grounds during normal office hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the general interest in this project, I think it well to acquaint the House of developments in the matter.</P>
      <P>In 1961, with the concurrence of An Chomhairle Ealaion the prominent Irish sculptor, Mr. Edward Delaney, who had studied sculpture at the National College of Art from 1951-1953 and later, methods of bronze casting, on the Continent, was asked to submit a design of a suitable memorial to Davis for the site in College Green, Dublin, where a foundation stone had been laid by President O'Ceallaigh in 1945, the centenary year of Davis's death.  Mr. Delaney duly submitted his design consisting of a paved platform measuring about 55 feet by 18 feet by 9 inches high with a pedestal and a bronze figure of Davis, approximately 10 feet high, and a circular pool embellished with bronze reliefs depicting Young Ireland.  The general concept of the design having been approved the sculptor was asked to prepare a two feet high maquette of the figure of Davis for approval.  Three such maquettes were, in fact, prepared.  The latest, which was submitted in the past few weeks, is regarded as satisfactory. Steps will now be taken for the preparation of the finished full scale statue and reliefs.  The execution of this work is, I am advised, a matter which cannot be hurried, but it is hoped that the entire scheme, which is estimated to cost about £15,000, will be completed within two years from now.</P>
      <P>The provision of £1,000 in the current year's estimate for Public Works and Buildings will be required for the payment of fees to the sculptor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The work in question has to be carried out in stages.  The first stage, the treatment of the East Pavilion of the National Library, was completed in 1957 at a cost of about £24,000.  The second stage, the treatment of the West Pavilion of the National Library and the screen wall along Kildare Street, which will cost about £30,000, is at present nearing completion.  The remainder of the frontage of the National Library to Kildare Street will next be dealt with. It is expected that work on this will commence in about two years' time and will take a further two to three years to complete.</P>
      <P>At this juncture it is not possible to indicate with any degree of certainty when the remaining stages are likely to be completed but in view of the magnitude of the work and because of its tedious nature it seems clear that at least another 15 years will elapse before completion.</P>

      <P>In answer to the last part of the Deputy's question, our delegation at the Law of the Sea Conference in 1960 supported the Canadian/United States proposal which would have allowed an extension of the territorial seas of up to six miles and of exclusive fishery limits up to 12 miles from the base line.

      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for External Affairs whether, in view of the Pope's declaration that justice, right reason and humanity urgently demand that nuclear weapons should be banned, the Government will give a lead to the other nations of the world by declaring that under no circumstances would the Republic of Ireland permit her territory to be used as territorial or maintenance bases from which it would be possible to deploy for action nuclear warheads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the article in <i>The Observer</i> of 14th April, 1963, in which the words referred to in the question appeared.  They occurred in the middle of a sentence given in English from the Encyclical <i>Pacem in Terris</i><Col N="25" /> issued by His Holiness Pope John XXIII on 11th instant.</P>
      <P>I have placed the authoritative Latin Text of the Encyclical in the Library. So far no official translation has reached us.</P>
      <P>It will be noted from a study of the Encyclical that His Holiness not only counsels that the proliferation and use of nuclear weapons should be interdicted but that international agreements should be negotiated for the progressive and balanced reduction of all armaments under effective control. This is the policy of the Government.</P>
      <P>For the reasons I gave in the Dáil on 28th March, 1962, and on other occasions, the answer to the Deputies' question is in the negative.</P>

      <P>Is it a fact that we have been asked with other neutral nations to subscribe to an agreement that we would not at any time allow our territory to be used for the deployment of these weapons and that we have refused to be party to such an agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We were asked by the Acting-Secretary General of the United Nations the conditions under which countries not possessing nuclear weapons would be willing to enter into undertakings to refrain from manufacturing or otherwise acquiring such weapons, and secondly, the conditions under which they would refuse to receive in the future nuclear weapons on their territory on behalf of any other country.  On 28th March, 1962 I replied at length to questions put in the Dáil and I replied to that enquiry.  I concluded by saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am more than ever convinced that proposals for de-nuclearising certain areas if they are to be successful must form part of an agreement accepted by a group of States and backed by the UN and the <Col N="26" /> major Powers which will not only eliminate nuclear weapons but will also limit all weapons of mass destruction, exclude foreign troops and provide for the peaceful settlement of disputes, and the enforcement of the rule of law in the area concerned.</P>
    <P>That remains our attitude on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it then, in spite of the Pope's clear condemnation of the use of nuclear weapons, that there are circumstances in which our Government would permit the use of bases of one kind or another for the deployment of such weapons?</P>

      <P>I think the answer we gave the Secretary General was a sensible answer and a very practical one.  I concluded my answer on 28th March, 1962, by saying:</P>
      <P>Now that both the United States and the USSR have incorporated the prevention of the further spread of nuclear weapons in their disarmament proposals we should, I believe, concentrate our efforts in promoting an international agreement on the matter.  Such an agreement would reduce world tension and open the way for negotiations to eliminate nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction area by area throughout the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the demand for Irish store cattle in Britain has been seriously affected by the incidence of liver fluke and warble damage.  Exports of store cattle have shown an appreciable increase in numbers and value since 1960 and the average price per head of exported stores has advanced considerably during the past five years.</P>
      <P>Over the years my Department has taken every opportunity to encourage farmers to make use of such proven remedies as were available for the control of liver fluke and a series of tests are at present being carried out by the Department with products recently introduced for the systemic treatment of cattle affected with warbles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that for every beast exported from this country £1. 5s. is taken for a damaged liver, whether it is damaged or not, plus £1. 5s. for the hide whether it is damaged or not?  Would the Minister look into this matter because it means a loss?  Regardless of the increased price for cattle, 50/- per head is stopped whether there is damage or not.</P>

      <P>We are all aware that damage is caused by these parasites and we know that losses are sustained as a result of that damage.  I have tried to tell the Deputy and the House what is being done but Deputies who know what this problem is like will readily concede that it is not a matter of easy solution.  We know from the experience in other countries where efforts have also been made to eradicate this trouble that even compulsory measures have not been very successful.  If one must resort to pleading with the public, one requires a very considerable amount of <Col N="28" /> co-operation even if the drugs and preparations were available.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to his question of 4th April, 1963, the Electricity Supply Board have planned to re-canvass the whole country with a view to orderly development and with the object of giving those houses still unconnected the best possible terms for supply in accordance with the recent legislation. It is not possible at this stage to state an order of priority for the re-canvass of individual areas, but, to expedite re-canvass, special canvassers are being attached to each district office.  Where, however, the work involved in extending supply is small, it is expected that there will be very little delay in making connection.</P>
      <P>Persons interested in getting supply should keep in touch with their local ESB office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not assumed that the underlying idea of reducing tariffs <Col N="32" /> is to make the import price lower than it was under a higher scale of tariffs? Surely some record is kept in the Minister's Department of what the effect is of reducing tariffs on imports. It ought to mean a reduction in prices. Surely it is a matter of concern to the Department to see if in fact a reduction is taking place or if in fact the benefit of the reduced tariff is going into the pockets of people for whom it was never intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There was another purpose in the reduction in tariffs, that was, to encourage our own manufacturers to become more competitive. As far as answering the specific questions is concerned, it would be necessary in respect of different products affected by a tariff reduction to compare prices as on dates before and after 1st January, 1963, and further to segregate elements of price changes arising for reasons other than tariff reduction, for example, variations in prices charged by the foreign manufacturer concerned.  As well as that, the Central Statistics Office are not equipped to undertake the task suggested by the Deputy in the ordinary course of work.  It would require special and precise study which in any event would not be complete or conclusive.</P>

      <P>The official statistics reflect the aggregate land allotment in each county rather than the allocation of individual farms.  On this basis, the replies to parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the question take the form of a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As regards part (e), records are not so compiled as to enable the precise information requested to be readily extracted.  To do so at this stage would require an exhaustive examination of the numerous estate files concerned and would necessitate a disproportionate expenditure of official time. For the Deputy's information, however, the tabular statement already referred to includes particulars of expenditure on estate improvements in County Meath in each of the years in question.  I would also refer him to the reply to a question (No. 23) of 21st February last, which may be of interest.</P>
      <P>As regards part (f), the general position in this matter and the practical difficulties in the way of supplying the particulars sought were outlined in a letter to the Deputy from my Department on 30th April, 1962.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands why the Land Commission have withdrawn proceedings in regard to the Lyons Estate, The Island, Abbeyleix, Laois; if steps will be taken to have these lands, which are now for sale by public auction, purchased and acquired in order to provide additional land for the numerous local smallholders; and if he will receive a deputation from the local land committee without delay in regard to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have served notice of withdrawal in this case pursuant to Section 24, Land Act, 1927, as they consider that the price fixed by the Appeal Tribunal for the property is such as to make the purchase of the lands inexpedient.  Provided that no objection is lodged on behalf of the owner within the prescribed time, this Notice will have the effect of terminating the acquisition proceedings.  As the determination of lands to be acquired is an excepted matter reserved to the Land Commissioners, no useful purpose would be served by my receiving a deputation in regard to the estate.</P>

      <P>I have given my view of the price fixed for these lands.  This is not the only occasion on which the Land Commission have withdrawn from operations of this kind.  It has been done regularly almost every single year over a long number of years when the Land Commission considered the evidence of price unrelated to the market value of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands how the annuity on land allotted to smallholders by the Land Commission is assessed; and why this annuity is so high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, the market value of acquired lands and the cost of labour and materials for improvement works, have been rising steadily for several years.  There is no question of the Land Commission making a profit from allotments to smallholders. In the general interest, it is necessary, however, to keep capital losses on resale of lands down to minimum and to recover improvement costs as far as is reasonably practicable.</P>
      <P>It is inescapable, therefore, that the allottees' annuities on current allotments must reflect the higher purchase prices and improvements costs.  But these annuities compare very favourably with letting rents in private transactions on the open market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are the replies to the various parts of the question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the application was dated 12th July, 1962.  It covered other employees as well as gangers.  It included a differential claim as well as a wage claim; (b) 10/- per week on the wage claim; (c) 2nd April, 1962; (d) investigation of the differential claim has been proceeding. It affects the structure of the incentive bonus scheme and its implications need careful consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any hope, even at this stage, of having that claim finalised?  I am sure that, no matter what way you look on it, last July to the present time is too long to consider anything affecting wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the gangers as well as the workers got the benefit of the increase to which I referred in my reply.  There is a question of a differential as between gangers and workers.  The incentive bonus scheme has been introduced on the Land Commission side. The differential varies but it goes up to 10/- a week.  Furthermore, the pattern has changed because most of these gangers now live at home and travel to their work rather than as in former <Col N="53" /> times, lodging out.  The implications of the incentive bonus scheme, which is in operation for about two years, I think have still to be studied in connection with the differential between gangers and workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister can get his Department to give a decision on the differential, without taking into consideration at this stage the question of whether or not it affects the bonus payments?  Would the Minister try to get his Department or the Department of Finance who, I suspect, are responsible for holding up this matter, to come to an early decision because it is ridiculous to find something affecting a small number of men being held up for nearly 12 months?</P>

      <P>We shall try to have it finalised as quickly as possible.  The Deputy will appreciate that these men got the benefit of the increases.

      <i>General</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of a budget nowadays is not merely to regulate the nation's finances but also to promote national progress.  To judge what this year's budget should do, it is necessary to review the main features and trends of the past year.  I can be brief about this as two recent publications&mdash;Economic Statistics, prepared by the Central Statistics Office and issued last week, and the annual report on Ireland by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development &mdash; are already available to Deputies and contain an extensive account of the position of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>During the past year, the volume of national production continued to increase; output and employment in industry rose; considerable industrial investment by both internal and external interests continued; emigration fell and the population increased.  The growth of both national and industrial production was, however, less than in 1961; the volume of agricultural production did not expand; and a gap developed between incomes and productivity which occasioned the recent White Paper.</P>
      <P>
        <i>National Production in 1962</i>
      </P>
      <P>The volume of national production is now provisionally estimated to have risen by 2½ per cent in 1962, as compared with 3.8 per cent in 1961.  The growth of the economy over the period 1959 to 1962, covering the first four years of the Programme for Economic Expansion, was 18 per cent.  This represents an annual average of almost 4½ per cent, a rate of increase comparable with that of more highly industrialised Western European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A primary factor in the slowing <Col N="60" /> down of the rate of growth in 1962 was the failure of agriculture to expand because of weather and other difficulties. Industrial growth, as measured by the volume of output of all industries and services, also slackened, being 5 per cent as against 8 per cent in the previous year.  Since increased industrial production must to a large extent be for export, particularly to Britain, it is likely that part of the reason for this lay in the comparatively slack condition of the British market during the year; part, also, may be attributed to loss of competitive advantage as a result of higher costs following the eighth wage round.</P>
    <P>The rate of growth in 1962 was not unsatisfactory when set against developments during the year in Britain and on the Continent.  In Britain, domestic production fell in 1962, while in a number of Continental countries there was a smaller increase in the volume of gross national product than in 1961.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>
    </P>
    <P>Economic growth, of its nature, cannot be absolutely steady from year to year.  Ups and downs are to be expected.  The OECD report forecasts an upturn in 1963.  It is our concern, as a Government, to create conditions in which the growth rate will rise so as to maintain over the coming years the average achieved since 1958.  The Second Programme for Economic Expansion, to be published this year, will have this as its chief objective. The general outline of the programme is now being drafted and it is hoped to begin consultations with representative farming, industrial and trade union organisations in a few months.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Balance of Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>There was a balance of payments deficit of £13½ million in 1962, compared with a surplus of £1 million in 1961.  The change from surplus to deficit resulted from a bigger trade gap brought about by a fall in exports and a rise in imports.  Exports amounted to £174 million or £6 million less than in 1961; imports were £274 million or £12 million more.  The deficit of 1962 should, however, be viewed <Col N="61" /> against the background of overall equilibrium for the previous five years.</P>
    <P>The fall in exports in 1962 was a reversal of the upward trend since 1959.  It was mainly due to a reduction of £12 million in cattle and beef exports, following exceptionally high shipments in 1961.  There were increases in other agricultural exports, notably mutton, lamb, pork and butter, which together rose by £4 million, and a small increase&mdash;£1½ million&mdash;in industrial exports.  The net reduction of £6 million in total exports is to be compared with the rise of no less than £50 million over the two preceding years.  It is an unwelcome change that exports failed last year to rise sufficiently to pay for the higher imports required to sustain our development programme.</P>
    <P>The connection between exports and economic growth has been clearly shown in the past year.  Expansion of the economy can take place only on the basis of a continuous rise in exports; when this is missing, the growth rate suffers.</P>
    <P>The increase of £12 million in imports was spread over a wide range of commodities, mainly capital goods and materials for further production. There was also some increase in imports of consumer goods.</P>
    <P>Though there was a deficit of £13½ million in 1962, our reserves were not reduced by this amount.  Indeed, thanks to a substantial inflow of capital, our net external assets rose by £9½ million during the year.  A great part of the capital inflow was direct investment in industry and in minerals exploration and purchases by externs of Irish Government and other securities.  This type of investment is important to us at the present stage of our development. It is also a mark of confidence in the economy and does not represent, in any real sense, &ldquo;hot money&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Formation and Savings</i>
    </P>
    <P>Both capital formation and savings increased in 1962.  Mainly because of the large volume of building and contruction carried out during the year and the high level of imports of capital goods, gross fixed capital formation <Col N="62" /> rose by £14 million to £115 million. This represented 15 per cent of gross national product, compared with 14 per cent in 1961 and 13 per cent in 1960, but we have still some distance to go before the ratio matches the general average in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>Total savings amounted to £74 million or £7 million more than in 1961. Of the £20 million National Loan issued in November last, £18.4 million was subscribed.  This response was satisfactory having regard to the other public issues earlier in the year.  The Electricity Supply Board loan of £7 million issued in March, 1963, was heavily over-subscribed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment, Unemployment and Emigration</i>
    </P>
    <P>As mentioned in Economic Statistics, previous estimates of the total numbers at work in the decade 1951-1961 will have to be revised by reference to the 1961 Census returns.</P>
    <P>Whether one takes manufacturing or transportable goods industries&mdash;and in either case the information, derived from the Census of Industrial Production, is dependable&mdash;the numbers employed increased by almost 25,000 between March, 1958, and December, 1962.  In manufacturing industries employment in the December quarter of 1962 was 4,600 higher than in the same quarter of 1961.  In all non-agricultural economic activity there was an estimated rise in employment of 7,000 over the year but it would seem that this was more than counterbalanced by the fall in the numbers engaged in agriculture, for which reliable figures are not yet available.</P>
    <P>Unemployment among insured persons in 1962 amounted to 5.7 per cent, or the same figure as in 1961.  In recent months, mainly because of the harsh weather, unemployment figures rose somewhat, but with the advent of milder conditions they are falling again.</P>
    <P>Emigration continued to decline in 1962.  Net passenger movement outwards by sea and air totalled 20,800, compared with 26,800 in 1961.  The consequence of the drop in emigration was that in 1962, for the first time for many years, the population rose.  There <Col N="63" /> has been a further improvement in 1963; in the twelve months ended February, 1963, the figure for net passenger movement outwards fell to 12,200.  Even if some of the reduction is associated with present economic conditions in Britain, emigration has now been consistently below previous levels for long enough to justify expectations of a permanent improvement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prices</i>
    </P>
    <P>Consumer prices rose during the year, the index in mid-November, 1962, being 4 per cent higher than in mid-November, 1961, while there was a further increase of 2 per cent in mid-February, 1963, following a temporary rise in food prices due to the effect on supplies of the exceptionally cold weather.  Wholesale prices were on average 3 per cent higher than in 1961.  There was an improvement of 1 per cent in the terms of trade; import prices showed no change while export prices rose by about 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The White Paper on Incomes and Productivity</i>
    </P>
    <P>Because the national economic interest required greater understanding of the urgent need to close the gap between incomes and productivity which had emerged in 1962, the Government in February last issued the White Paper &ldquo;Closing the Gap&rdquo;. Its purpose was to emphasise to all, whether they receive incomes in the form of dividends and profits or are paid salaries or wages, that increased output is the only safe basis for an increase in incomes.  General restraint was asked for until national production had risen sufficiently to support a further general increase in incomes without damage to the economy.  The White Paper has been fully debated in this House and there is no need for me to enlarge further on its contents.</P>
    <P>Since the White Paper was issued, estimates of output and earnings in manufacturing industry in the December quarter of 1962 have become available. Thanks to the rise in production in that quarter, there was some narrowing of the gap between incomes and <Col N="64" /> productivity as compared with the September quarter.  However, the rise in output per head since the December quarter of 1960 was less than half the rise in earnings.  Productivity has still to be increased considerably before the gap will be closed.</P>
    <P>The OECD report on Ireland, which gives the independent view of an international institution on our economic situation, has this to say about the desirability of incomes restraint:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The ability of the authorities to pursue an ambitious expansionary policy untrammelled by the need to resort to stop-and-go policies can be seriously limited if money incomes are pushed up excessively.  And a repetition of the sort of wage round that occurred at the end of 1961 and in the early months of 1962 could easily compel the authorities to fall back on such policies, thereby seriously weakening the more dynamic forces that have developed in the Irish economy in recent years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are not doing anything unique in this country in calling for temporary restraint in incomes until output has increased.  The OECD report on &ldquo;Policies for Price Stability&rdquo; has pointed out that governments are becoming increasingly convinced of the need to evolve some form of national incomes policy.  Measures have been taken in a number of European countries in recent years to promote a general policy of conformity between income increases and increases in productivity. Our White Paper has the same purpose.  It is to be hoped that both employees and employers will understand it in this light and will, in their own and the community's interest, co-operate with one another and with the Government in bringing to a successful conclusion the discussions initiated by the Taoiseach with a view to establishing a more orderly relationship between income increases and the growth of national production.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prospects for</i> 1963</P>
    <P>In November, 1961, Ireland, in association with the other countries of <Col N="65" /> OECD, accepted the collective target of a 50 per cent rise in the volume of national production over the years 1960 to 1970.  A great and sustained effort is needed to attain this objective, which calls for the high, but not unrealistic, annual average growth rate of slightly more than 4 per cent.  Our purpose in 1963 is to do better than in 1962 when the growth rate was only 2½ per cent.  This involves not only progress in investment, productivity and employment but also avoiding anything which would make the attainment of the target more difficult in this or future years.</P>
    <P>In our present circumstances, the way to remedy the slackening in the growth rate is not by stimulating consumer demand.  The volume of consumer spending in 1962 rose by 3½ per cent, a figure in excess of the increase of 2½ per cent in the volume of national production.  Internal demand is already so high that a deficit is being incurred in external payments. Instead of a further stimulus to demand, what is needed, as already mentioned, is increased productivity and the diversion, by way of saving, of a higher share of incomes to productive investment.</P>
    <P>Economic prospects for 1963 depend to a great extent on how exports fare. Provided we can sell competitively, we can reasonably hope for some stimulus to exports from a revival of activity in Britain and increased prosperity in continental Europe.  So far as agriculture is concerned, it is notable that the enumeration last January showed an increase over the previous January of 121,000 cattle.  This also should lead to increased exports.  Imports, like exports, are likely to rise and a moderate deficit may again emerge in the balance of payments.  This need not cause alarm.  I share the view expressed in the OECD report that Ireland's exchange reserves are high enough to enable moderate overall deficits to be faced in support of the economic development of the country.  But it is important to ensure that even moderate deficits are not incurred simply to enable us to consume more than we can afford.</P>
    <P>The overriding need in 1963 is to <Col N="66" /> narrow further the gap between incomes and productivity and so improve the competitiveness and volume of our exports.  This is the key to a higher rate of economic growth.</P>
    <P>
      <i>External Trade Relations</i>
    </P>
    <P>Any survey of the economic scene would be incomplete without referring further to our external trade relations.</P>
    <P>A year ago attention was focussed on the measures necessary to prepare the national economy for early entry to the European Economic Community. Anticipations in that regard have been altered by the breakdown last January in the British negotiations with the Community.  The resulting situation was discussed fully in the House at the time and I do not propose to cover the same ground again.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like to emphasise two points.  First, in the sphere of external economic relations there is no adequate substitute for membership of an enlarged European Community which would include Britain.  Participation in such a grouping would afford us free access to a vast and growing market and would secure for our agriculture the kind of trading conditions which would enable agricultural production to develop on a sound economic basis.  While these advantages are not now within near reach, the Government believe that, in time, the way will be opened to the participation of Ireland, Britain and other applicant countries in the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Government will do all in its power to secure, in bilateral or multilateral arrangements, improved openings for our exports, particularly agricultural exports.  This in effect means reducing the protection we have been affording our industrial products&mdash;a process in itself desirable as a stimulus to efficiency&mdash;as a means of bargaining for improved outlets. There are conditions of oversupply and depressed prices for some agricultural products in the only market still a relatively open one, namely, Britain; and extensive protective barriers exist in other countries.  It would be unrealistic to expect that, in these conditions, such improvements as it may <Col N="67" /> be possible to achieve will be comparable with those that would be obtainable under the common agricultural policy of the EEC.</P>
    <P>My second point is this.  The growth of the national economy, and with it the raising of our living standards, is becomingly increasingly dependent on industrial production and exports.  At the same time, the world is moving into an era of freer trade in industrial products and the initiatives being taken for the lowering of tariff barriers, while they will increase the openings for exports, will also intensify competitive conditions in international trade. There is, therefore, greater need than ever to raise our whole industrial sector to a pitch of efficiency which will enable it to compete successfully in world markets.</P>
    <P>There is not as yet, I fear, a sufficient sense of urgency.  The need for extensive reorganisation has been conclusively established by expert analysis of comparative production costs and by thorough surveys which have diagnosed the problems of individual industries and suggested solutions. Most of the reports of the CIO survey teams have by now either been published or made available to the industries concerned in preliminary form.  The Government have provided a range of aids and incentives, including adaptation grants and special re-equipment loans.  So far the response to these inducements, which are available only to 31st March, 1965, has not been sufficient in scope or volume. Much more rapid and intensive progress is essential.</P>
    <P>In agriculture, too, a series of special surveys has been undertaken, which, like the Dairy Produce Survey Team Report recently published, will provide information and guidance as to possible improvements both in domestic production and in export marketing. State aid will continue to be available to promote efficient production and export but it will, of course, be realised that, as our industrial base is still relatively small, it is not possible to match the aid given to agriculture by more highly developed countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> In the period immediately ahead we face a challenge as great as, and in some ways even greater than that which would confront us on entry to the EEC.  The rewards to be gained are also great: an expanding and better balanced economy and rising living standards.  Moreover, by matching the progress of other European countries we will be facilitating our entry to the European Economic Community when circumstances favourable to this step emerge.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>What should be our purpose in this budget in the light of the foregoing review?  Clearly, it is right that the State should, directly and indirectly, increase the volume of productive investment and do everything else in its power to promote as rapid a growth of the economy as can be sustained without excessive strain on the balance of payments.  There is no need here at present to stimulate consumer spending&mdash;our spending is rather too high in relation to our production and saving&mdash;and one of our main concerns must be to avoid adding to personal spending until production has caught up.  Another of our problems is the deficit in our current budget&mdash;a deficit which, if it persisted, would divert into the financing of current expenditure savings needed to finance the higher capital expenditure which is nationally desirable.  We must do something effective this year, therefore, towards bringing our current finances back into balance.</P>
    <P>With a deficit on last year's account, and with greatly increased expenditure to face this year, additional taxation is unavoidable.  Increased taxation is never popular and it can always be argued that it means a cut in income or purchasing power.  This argument, however, is sometimes carried so far as to imply that the money raised by taxation is withdrawn from circulation and destroyed, whereas, of course, it goes back again to the community in the form of services of every kind, including grants, subsidies and social welfare payments.  Nothing is taken that is not returned in another form and the notion of a general loss of <Col N="69" /> real income through taxation does not make sense.</P>

      <b>II. CAPITAL BUDGET</b>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Outturn,</i> 1962-63, <i>and Estimates,</i> 1963-64</P>
    <P>Taxation changes tend, inevitably, to monopolise attention at budget time. The capital expenditure proposals do not receive due notice.  In the hope of bringing about a better balance, I have published a separate paper this year dealing with the Capital Budget at greater length than is possible in the Financial Statement.  The relevant Tables, hitherto included in the Tables in connection with the Financial Statement, appear this year in the new publication. It is hoped that this will encourage greater interest in, and discussion of, the various items of public capital outlay and a closer examination of the contribution which the large and growing volume of public capital expenditure makes to national development.</P>
    <P>It may suffice for me to say here that actual capital expenditure in the year 1962-63 was £65 million as compared with the estimate of almost £67 million.  There were, of course, variations under particular headings which are described in the Capital Budget paper but the total expenditure corresponded closely with the Budget estimate.</P>
    <P>Public capital requirements for 1963-64 are estimated at £79½ million which is an increase of £14½ million on the outturn for last year.  The details are shown in the Capital Budget paper.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of building and construction in capital programmes, both public and private, the Government have decided to set up a National Advisory Council for the Building Industry.  The arrangements are being made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is intended that the Council should survey the building work in prospect over the coming years and advise on means of ensuring that it progresses in an orderly, efficient and economic manner.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sources of Finance for Capital Budget</i>
    </P>
    <P>Table 2 sets out the sources from which last year's expenditure was met <Col N="70" /> and Table 4 the manner in which it is hoped to finance the programme and certain other items of capital expenditure in 1963-64.  It will be observed from Table 3 that the Exchequer is expected to provide almost £58 million leaving the balance of almost £22 million to be found from other sources. The community, as I have already indicated, is not yet saving adequately for development needs.  A greater degree of public support will be needed to enable the Exchequer to meet the heavy demands which this year's extended programme will make on it.</P>
    <P>The Savings Committee continues to devote its energies untiringly to the development of thrift especially among wage and salary earners and has extended its activities to the schools where the saving idea is also being encouraged.  There is no shortage of attractive modes of saving and it is hoped that there will be a sustained and progressive increase in the total volume.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <b>III. CURRENT BUDGET&mdash;OUT-TURN,</b> 1962-63</P>
    <P>It was disappointing, but not surprising in view of the heavy supplementary requirements for Supply Services, particularly for agriculture, that a deficit of £4.85 million was incurred last year.  A sum of £5½ million for supplementary items was provided in the Budget, as revised in June in connection with the milk price subsidy, but, in the event, expenditure on current Supply Services exceeded the provision by £2.9 million.  There was a saving of £¾ million on the Central Fund Services, excluding payments to the Road Fund, but total current expenditure exceeded the estimate by £2¼ million.  The increase in payments to the Road Fund is balanced by a similar increase in motor taxation receipts.</P>
    <P>On the revenue side, expectations were, in the aggregate, closely borne out by the event.  Motor taxation, apart, total revenue was only £327,000 short of the estimate.  The components of the revenue total, however, diverged markedly from the original expectations.  There was a shortfall of some £3¼ million in customs and <Col N="71" /> excise revenue which was largely counterbalanced by extra receipts from the direct taxes&mdash;income tax, sur-tax, corporation profits tax and death duties.  The principal indirect taxes which disappointed our hopes were those on tobacco, beer, spirits and petrol.  Their relatively poor showing may be attributed to various causes.  There was some forestalling in the month or two before the last Budget in anticipation of increases in duty on spirits and tobacco.  The severe weather affected some items. But the principal cause was the effect on consumption of the budget increases in duty, accentuated in the case of beer and spirits by trade price increases.  The lesson of last year's experience is that it would be unwise to depend this year on traditional taxes on expenditure for any substantial increase in revenue.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <b>IV. CURRENT BUDGET, 1963-64&mdash; INTRODUCTION.</b>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Growth in taxation and expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>Much public attention has been directed of late to the growth of taxation and public expenditure and to the proportion of national product absorbed under these two headings. It is right that these trends should be carefully watched and their implications studied.  A new table is included this year in the Tables relating to the Current Budget which may help in assessing how far there is justification for uneasiness.</P>
    <P>This table shows the growth of State current expenditure in recent years and the proportion which such expenditure represents of gross national product.  The year 1958-59 may be taken as base because it marks the commencement of the period covered by the Programme for Economic Expansion.  The main feature emerging from the table is that although State current expenditure has grown considerably over the period 1958-59 to 1962-63&mdash;from £126 million to £168 million or by one-third&mdash;it has not greatly increased as a proportion of national product.</P>
    <P>So far as total taxation and current expenditure are concerned, the public <Col N="72" /> authorities here, central and local, account for about one-quarter of the national product.  The proportion has not risen much over the past decade and comparisons with other European countries indicate that it is not relatively high.</P>
    <P>This, however, is not to say that we can be negligent or uncritical in our financial or fiscal policy.  It is possible to defend, in the circumstances of a developing economy, a temporary rise in the public expenditure and tax ratios provided it is clear that there will be a reasonably early and adequate increase in national production. On that basis, taxation would not become a permanently heavier burden on the economy or, account being taken of the beneficial effects of expenditure, an impediment to economic progress.</P>
    <P>In view of the increased emphasis placed on public investment, it is not surprising that the amount provided for debt service, including repayment, increased from £24½ million in 1958-59 to £34½million in 1962-63 and accounts for over 20 per cent of total current expenditure.  It is also worthy of note that, in the same period, expenditure on social services has been increased from £47 million to £57½ million while expenditure on the economic services&mdash;broadly, agriculture, industry and transport&mdash;has grown from £22½ million to £35 million.  These expenditure trends are a consequence of the role which, in the circumstances of this country, the State has to play both in promoting growth and in ensuring that all sections of the community share in the resultant increase in national prosperity.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Administration</i>
    </P>
    <P>Some comment on administrative costs will be expected.  As Table III shows, remuneration accounted for £51½ million or 30 per cent of total current expenditure in 1962-63.  The constituent items were:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> As regards the Civil Service, which accounts for 45 per cent of the pay bill, every effort is being made, through the re-allocation of work and through organisation and methods surveys, to keep numbers and cost at a minimum.  There is, however, no escaping the inevitable consequence of the growth of State activities.  Since 1956-57, there has been a large expansion in the telephone service; the Department of Agriculture has intensified the campaign to eradicate bovine tuberculosis; there has been an expansion of the forestry and fisheries programmes; the Revenue Commissioners have had to organise and operate the Pay As You Earn scheme and deal with increased airport and frontier traffic.  There has also been an expansion of the work of other Departments.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the most economic use is being made of the available staff resources, consultants continue to be employed, with good results.  Every effort is being made to increase administrative efficiency, and thus to reduce costs, by extending the use of labour-saving machinery and by improving methods of work.</P>
    <P>The use of modern electronic and other means of data processing, in particular, is transforming civil service work.  An electronic installation recently introduced in the Post Office Savings Bank is enabling the work of the bank to be done more efficiently and at much less cost.  The electronic computer in the Revenue Commissioners' Office, when installed, will do a great deal of the routine work connected with income tax assessment and collection for the entire country and will perform payroll, statistical and accounting work.  Other machine installations are in view for various sectors of the Government service.  I have had an Inter-departmental Committee set up to advise and co-ordinate the various activities in this field.</P>
    <P>The training of staffs is now being carried out on a larger scale than ever before in our Civil Service, and basic training courses are provided by my Department for all recruits to the Administrative, Higher Executive and Executive grades.  Various specialised courses are also held, and some Departments, <Col N="74" /> in addition, organise training to meet their own particular requirements. Advantage is also taken of training courses offered by the Institute of Public Administration and by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  I am convinced that substantial benefits are being derived from these activities.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <b>V. CURRENT BUDGET, 1963-64&mdash;DETAIL</b>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure show that revenue at existing tax rates falls short of meeting expenditure by £8½ million.  Due allowance being made for recent experience under particular heads and for the general economic outlook in 1963-64, it has been assumed that revenue will be almost £8¾ million above last year.  Expenditure is estimated to rise by £12¼ million and thus the deficit incurred last year is enlarged by £3½ million.</P>
    <P>The opening deficit of £8½ million, large though it is, is not the whole story.  This year again the Budget must make some additional provisions, in pursuance of the Government's policy that the whole community should share in improved national income.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmers</i>
    </P>
    <P>The provision for the Supply Services must be adjusted at the outset for the cost to the Exchequer of the increased payment to creamery milk suppliers of a penny a gallon recently announced.  This assistance for milk producers follows the principle that State expenditure in the agricultural sector should help to sustain production and exports, and thus to achieve a better balance between the incomes of farmers and other producers.  State aid to agriculture, capital and non-capital, exclusive of the additional subsidy, was already estimated at £37.3 million for 1963-64.  It includes relief amounting to over half of the rates on agricultural land, the cost of eradicating bovine tuberculosis, fertiliser subsidies, land project outlay, grants for farm buildings and water supplies, advisory services and agricultural <Col N="75" /> research.  Of this amount direct price supports to agriculture accounted for £7.2 million.  To this must now be added the £1¼ million for the additional milk price allowance. Further, because of the increase in milk production shown by recent figures, it is necessary to add £½ million to the Estimate to cover the probable cost of dairy produce subsidies this year.  The total supplementary provision will, therefore, be £1¾ million, which brings to £39 million the aid being given to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The addition to the milk price is as much as the Exchequer can afford this year by way of extra help for farmers.  This form of extra help has been chosen because, as the Minister for Agriculture has said, dairying is the basic factor in our agricultural economy; it provides the main source of income for great numbers of our farmers, especially the small and medium-sized farmers; and it is intimately linked with the development of our cattle, pig and poultry industries.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>Every budget for the last four years has contained proposals to increase old age and other pensions and unemployment assistance, the object being not merely to protect the value of these social payments but also to give the recipients some share in the improvement in national income.  The increases have given special recognition to the responsibilities of those with dependent children.  Since the most recent improvement became effective in August last, there has been a slight upward movement in the consumer price index&mdash;some three points or less than 2 per cent.  There will be a further slight increase in the consumer price index when the proposed expenditure tax comes into operation.  To offset these price changes and to add something to the real value of the benefits, it is proposed to increase the maximum rates of non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions by 2/6d. a week.  The personal rate of unemployment assistance and the allowance for an adult dependant of an unemployed <Col N="76" /> person in both urban and rural areas will each be raised by 2/6d. a week.  The total improvement, including this increase, in old age and widows' pensions in the last five years will, therefore, have been 10/- a week. In the same period the total improvement in unemployment assistance for a married man and wife will have been 17/6d., in addition to which there have been large increases in the allowances for dependent children.</P>
    <P>The increase in social welfare payments last year was extended to two kinds of allowances administered by the Department of Health, those for infectious diseases and for disablement. It is again proposed to provide for increases&mdash;of the infectious diseases allowance by 2/6d. a week for a person without dependants and by 5/-a week for a person with an adult dependant, and of the disabled person's allowance by 2/6d. a week on the maximum rate.  Half the cost of increasing these two allowances will be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The changes in rates will be effective from 1st November next and will cost this year about £600,000.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to introduce increases in benefits under the social insurance schemes from the commencement of the contribution year in January next. The State contribution will be £110,000 for the last quarter of this financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>I said on this occasion last year that the cost of raising public service pensions to take account of post-war movements in the cost of living and to bring those who retired earlier into line with their post-war colleagues had been estimated at £1,300,000.  The Exchequer position precluded acceptance of a total commitment of that order but provision was made in the Budget to bring pensioners who retired before the pay revision of 1st November, 1955, to parity with their colleagues who retired with the benefit of that pay revision.  Subsequently, a further 6 per cent was added.</P>
    <P>The Government feel that there would be general approval of some <Col N="77" /> further advance being made in this Budget in the process of bringing service pensions up-to-date.  The cost is a more serious consideration this year when substantial extra taxation has to be raised to finance the public services.  The maximum revision that can be afforded is to bring the older pensioners to parity with their colleagues who retired with the benefit of the 1959 pay revisions.  The groups affected are civil servants, national teachers, Gardaí, Defence Force pensioners, local authority officials, military service pensioners and holders of special allowances.  The increases will be payable from 1st November next and the cost is estimated at £120,000 this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economies</i>
    </P>
    <P>The gap has now become £11 million and my first concern is to see whether it cannot be narrowed, even slightly, by some reductions in the current expenditure already proposed for this year.  The Government have decided that, however desirable the expenditure on certain items, it is preferable that it should not be incurred this year, or should be spread over two or three years, rather than that it should add to this year's already heavy taxation requirement.  This decision applies to the following items:</P>
    <P>1.  The grant to the Road Fund in the Estimate for Local Government will be reduced from £550,000 to £150,000.  The Road Fund will benefit this year from a substantial increase in motor tax revenue and, despite the grant reduction, is expected to have a greater total income than last year.</P>
    <P>2.  Purchases of defensive equipment, clothing reserves and helicopters will be spaced out so as to save £350,000 on the Vote for Defence but at least one helicopter and requisite spares will be obtained this year.</P>
    <P>3.  A saving of £50,000 will be effected by postponing recruitment of Gardaí and by other economies in the relevant Vote.</P>
    <P>By these reductions, which total <Col N="78" /> £800,000, the gap is narrowed to £10¼ million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Errors of Estimation</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is customary to make an adjustment for errors of estimation, which may mean either underestimation of revenue or overestimation of expenditure or, of course, a combination of both.  Last year was unusual in that nothing was realised towards the adjustment made in the Budget. Having regard to experience in earlier years, and to the special effort which has been made to estimate adequately for agriculture this year, a deduction of £2 million is considered to be warranted.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Revenue Balances</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is one other thing I can do to reduce the tax requirement and that is to draw on the revenue balances which for many years now have stood at about £2 million.  These balances have served to augment the revenue inflow, and thus to obviate temporary borrowing during the early, and hitherto lean, part of the financial year.  Already, the steady flow of income tax revenue into the Exchequer, largely because of PAYE, has reduced the need to hold these balances.  The tax reserve certificates will also help increasingly to smoothen out fluctuations.  The process will be carried further by the introduction of a general tax on expenditure, payable monthly into the Exchequer. In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to maintain the revenue balances and they will be taken into the Exchequer this year.  This, of course, is a once for all operation but it is warranted by the disappearance of the basic justification for holding the balances and by the higher yield of revenue which will come from the new expenditure tax in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Extra Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>To close the gap of £6¼ million which still remains, there is no alternative but to impose extra taxation.  I propose to raise this money, all of which is required to maintain necessary public services, by levying £3.4 million on profits and rents and obtaining the balance, in effect, from a new turnover tax.  The Government would <Col N="79" /> not consider it equitable to expect wage and salary earners to bear increased taxation on their expenditure, especially so long as restraint regarding income increases remains necessary, unless the recipients of profits and rents were first called upon for a major contribution.  My aim in this, as in all the provisions of the Budget, is to preserve social equity within a sound financial framework intended to promote national progress.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Profits</i>
    </P>
    <P>Profits have risen substantially in recent years and can bear an increase in taxation without being unduly cut back; to tax them specifically is obviously the right course as an increase in income tax, while it would fall on profits, would also raise the tax bill of wage and salary earners.  It is, therefore, proposed that the rate of Corporation Profits Tax, which is now 10 per cent, be increased by 5 per cent and that all profits, including those hitherto within the exemption limit of £2,500, should bear this new 5 per cent.  The extra tax will be payable in relation to profits arising on or after 1 January, 1962, and is estimated to yield £3 million this year.</P>
    <P>This action, taken in the special circumstances of the current year, is a limited departure from the policy in regard to direct taxation which has otherwise been consistently followed in recent years, namely, the reduction of direct taxation in order to encourage earning and saving.  Under this policy, the rate of income tax has been brought down from 7/6d. to 6/4d. in the £.  The desirability of adherence to this policy is outweighed this year in the case of business profits by the conviction that social justice requires an even distribution of the additional taxation which is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>So far as it may be argued that the tax increase will have an adverse economic effect, it should be remembered, in the first place, that the various capital allowances for modernisation of plant and buildings will, if such expenditure is being incurred, enable companies to avoid or reduce the impact of the additional tax.  Even <Col N="80" /> at the higher rate, our taxation of profits will not compare unfavourably with that obtaining in most European countries.  Moreover, because of our tax exemption for exports, companies can offset the increase entirely by expansion of exports; by throwing into bolder relief the value of the tax exemption, the increase should provide a further stimulus to higher exports. External as well as domestic interests planning to set up or expand export businesses may do so in the knowledge that complete freedom from income taxation will continue to apply as heretofore to their profits and that, in addition, generous grants and other incentives are available.</P>
    <P>25 <i>Per Cent Exports Tax Relief&mdash; Tapering-off</i></P>
    <P>It will be recalled that in 1957 a measure of relief was provided for those companies which had pioneered in foreign markets without the help of any tax aid and whose current exports might not materially exceed those for either of the standard years prescribed.  These companies were allowed to choose, instead of the 100 per cent relief on increased exports, a 25 per cent remission of the tax referable to the profits from all exports. This alternative relief was made available for a five-year period which, in the case of corporation profits tax, commenced on 6 April, 1958, and, for income tax, began with either the year 1958-59 or the year 1959-60.  I propose to bring in a &ldquo;tapering-off&rdquo; provision under which a reduced measure of this relief will be allowed for the five years following the last year of the existing relief in any given case.  There is already a tapering-off provision in connection with the 100 per cent relief.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Residential Rents</i>
    </P>
    <P>The full amount of the net rents from premises occupied for business purposes has for the past thirty years or so been liable to tax.  In their Second Report the Income Taxation Commission recommended that landlords of residential or other property let for non-business purposes, instead of being assessed under Schedule A on a notional figure fixed by reference to <Col N="81" /> the valuation, should be charged under Schedule D on the net income receivable: that is, gross rent less landlord's outgoings such as rates, maintenance and repairs.  This recommendation was subject to two provisos.  The first was that special relief should be allowed where the rent was controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts.  The other was that in all cases full liability should be reached only in stages over a period of three years.  The first White Paper on Direct Taxation recognised that this recommendation was desirable in principle but indicated that the Government did not propose to alter the income tax position before rent control was substantially relaxed or abolished.</P>
    <P>Besides the present need for extra revenue it is manifest from the changes which have taken place in the past two years that this matter now calls for fresh consideration.  There has been a marked upward trend in property values, accompanied by higher rent charges for non-controlled residential properties.  Under 1960 legislation houses become free from rent control on certain changes in occupation and possession and also on conversion into self-contained flats.  The number of non-controlled dwellings is also increasing, especially in the Dublin area, according as new houses are constructed.  The practice of letting furnished flats which are outside the scope of rent control is growing. The narrowing of the area over which rent control operates and the fact that there is a material and growing loss of revenue justify changing the tax position.  The very large amount of income arising from the letting of residential property should bear its equitable share of the tax burden. The Finance Bill will, therefore, contain provisions to implement the Commission's recommendation in this respect.</P>
    <P>Under the new provisions all profit rents will be taxed in the same manner under Schedule D.  Income from the letting of land, including conacre lettings hitherto assessed on a notional basis, will be brought within the scope of the charge.  This will affect only persons who derive income from the <Col N="82" /> letting of land and whose total incomes are sufficiently large to make them liable to income tax.  The change will have no effect on farmers who farm their own land or who work land taken on conacre.</P>
    <P>The question of giving a measure of special relief to landlords as recommended by the Commission has been considered.  The first White Paper on Direct Taxation adverted to the difficulty of giving relief for rent-controlled properties, on the lines suggested by the Commission.  It is accordingly proposed, as regards controlled properties, to allow a deduction of 40 per cent of the net assessable rents, subject to a maximum of £200 for each individual taxpayer.  As regards non-controlled properties, it is intended to allow, for a three-year period, a deduction of 20 per cent of the net assessable rents, subject to a maximum of £100 for each individual taxpayer.  These reliefs are intended particularly for persons living on small incomes derived from property.</P>
    <P>I expect that the new method of taxing rents will bring in about £400,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Turnover Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>I come now to the new tax on expenditure.  As the Dáil is aware, the Government have for some time past been considering various forms of taxation in force in other countries on sales, purchases and services.  The Income Taxation Commission, in their Third Report, recommended by a majority the introduction of a purchase tax at wholesale level at a rate or rates between 7½ per cent and 15 per cent with exceptions in favour of certain commodities.  The proceeds of the tax were to be used to reduce the rate of income tax.  The first White Paper on Direct Taxation, in the course of a comment on this recommendation, said that a sales tax would not be inappropriate to the circumstances of this country and, if the necessity were to arise for a major increase in taxation, it might become unavoidable.</P>
    <P>This necessity has now arisen.  It is not safe to rely for substantially increased revenue on the duties on only four commodities &mdash; tobacco, beer, <Col N="83" /> spirits and oils &mdash; the yield from which is liable to be seriously affected by changes in demand.  The danger inherent in this situation has become more pointed by reason of the reduction which will continue to occur in other customs revenue as a consequence of the lowering of protective tariffs.  Moreover, without a more dependable source of revenue, it would be impossible to proceed with any programme of tax reform.</P>
    <P>Economic growth of itself will result in revenue increasing without the necessity of raising rates.  It is, to say the least, very doubtful, however, whether revenue buoyancy can, in fact, fully reflect the growth in national income if our commodity taxes, from which the bulk of revenue is derived, continue to be narrowly based.  The situation might conceivably arise in which, for purely technical reasons, sufficient revenue could not be raised for improvements in social and economic services which were both desirable and within the country's means.</P>
    <P>All these considerations make it necessary to introduce as soon as possible a new tax on personal expenditure capable of producing a worthwhile yield.</P>
    <P>The Government gave careful consideration to a purchase tax applicable to selected commodities, chargeable at the wholesale stage but not necessarily at a uniform rate.  It is important, however, that the tax chosen should disturb as little as possible the existing patterns of trade and industry.  It would be indefensible in our circumstances to introduce a tax which might threaten the prospects of expansion of particular industries, or their very existence, and bring unemployment in its train.  It is immaterial in this context whether or not the goods produced or dealt in are classed as luxury goods; the work they provide is not a luxury for the employees.  From the point of view of the Exchequer, a purchase tax of the kind mentioned would have a narrower base than a retail stage tax because it would cover only a limited range of commodities, would be applied at an earlier stage of production <Col N="84" /> and could not, moreover, be extended to services.  A much higher rate would, therefore, be needed to give the same yield as a general retail stage tax.  The impact would inevitably be increased by the trade &ldquo;mark-up&rdquo;, to the disadvantage of the consumer and without any direct gain to the revenue.  From the trader's point of view, the selective application of the tax would add greatly to the complexities of bookkeeping; additional working capital would be necessary because tax would be payable in advance of retail sale; and changes in the tax rate could involve loss.</P>
    <P>The Government also considered the multi-stage tax and the tax on value-added.  Apart from other features, such as the complex provision needed for export rebates, multi-stage taxes have the disadvantage that the final price of a commodity increases not merely by the amount of the tax at each stage but also by the amount of the trade &ldquo;mark-up&rdquo; on the tax which has been paid.  While the value-added system of taxation largely avoids these disadvantages, it is rather complex for a country which has had no previous experience of sales taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government decided, therefore, in favour of a low-rate tax on all retail turnover and applying to services. Besides its simplicity and productiveness, such a tax avoids the risk that expenditure will be switched from one form of consumption to another, to the detriment of particular industries and of the people deriving a livelihood from them.  Taxing at the retail level should eliminate the &ldquo;mark-up&rdquo; feature I have already mentioned.  The tax will be on turnover, not on individual sales, and the trader will not have to apply a uniform percentage increase to the price of every commodity.  From the consumer's point of view, there is the assurance that the force of competition will prevent traders from making disproportionate increases in any line.</P>
    <P>The new tax is unobjectionable in the context of the long-term harmonisation aims of the EEC.  If it should become necessary for us later on to adopt a value-added tax to conform with developments elsewhere, the retail <Col N="85" /> stage tax can with little amendment form a constituent part of a value-added system.</P>
    <P>The tax will, in general, include all retail sales and will apply not merely to expenditure on goods but also to expenditure on services, subject to the following exceptions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Excepted Expenditure on Goods:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Sales of goods for resale.</P>
    <P>Sales by farmers of their own produce.</P>
    <P>Sales by individuals of their personal property.</P>
    <P>Exports.</P>
    <P>Bulk sales of certain basic building materials.</P>
    <P>Sales of goods of a capital nature to a concern for the purposes of its business.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Excepted Expenditure on Services:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Services provided for the purposes of a business.</P>
    <P>Transport services.</P>
    <P>Education.</P>
    <P>Services provided by the State, by local authorities and by the Radio and Television authorities.</P>
    <P>Services given in return for wages and salaries and for professional fees such as fees charged by doctors, solicitors and accountants.</P>
    <P>Lettings of houses and accommodation otherwise than in the course of carrying on hotel and guest house businesses.</P>
    <P>Banking and insurance.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to register all persons, whether manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers, who for business purposes sell or buy goods, and all persons who in the course of their business provide services.  Apart from the excepted items I have mentioned, the general rule will be that registered persons will be accountable for tax on the goods and services they sell but will not be required to pay tax on the purchases necessary for their business.</P>
    <P>Persons engaged in building and allied activities and certain other persons engaged solely in the business of selling excepted goods or providing excepted services will not be required to register or to pay tax on their turnover, but they will not be permitted <Col N="86" /> to purchase goods or materials free of tax, except to the extent that they can avail themselves of the exemption I have already mentioned in favour of certain basic building materials purchased in bulk.</P>
    <P>The tax will be calculated by applying the appropriate rate to the taxable turnover, which in general will be the gross turnover less receipts from registered persons.  The tax due will be remitted monthly, with a simple covering statement.  The accuracy of the monthly statements will be checked by reference to the accounts furnished to the Revenue Commissioners for income tax purposes.  There will also be powers of investigation and inspection.</P>
    <P>Goods imported by unregistered persons will bear tax at the same rate as domestic sales.</P>
    <P>The preparations for introducing the tax&mdash;the drafting of regulations, registration and so on&mdash;will take some time and it is proposed that it should not come into operation until 1st November, 1963.  It follows that only four months' receipts will reach the Exchequer during the current year. Because of the extensive base of the tax, I am satisfied that the low rate of 6d. in the £ should suffice.  This is estimated to bring in £3½ million this year.</P>
    <P>It is because the tax will apply to all retail sales, with the few exceptions indicated, that it is possible to have a rate as low as 6d. in the £.  If food, clothing and fuel were to be excepted, a rate of up to 2/- in the £ would be necessary to produce the same yield. The tax would become a selective tax at wholesale stage and would have all the economic and other disadvantages I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>There will be relief, by way of reduced rates of tax, for persons in a small way of business.  In fact, very small businesses will have to pay only a nominal charge.  The intention is to charge only a flat 5/- for the first £50 of monthly turnover and 3d. in the £ for the next £50 of monthly turnover, which would mean that a shop with sales of £100 a month would pay only 17/6d. tax a month.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> I think that most businesses, no matter how small, will find the monthly system of payment the most convenient.  If I find, however, that there is a demand for a weekly system, it may be possible, where the turnover does not normally exceed, say, £100 a week, to arrange to have the tax paid weekly by affixing stamps to cards as is done in many cases with income tax under PAYE.</P>
    <P>I am hoping, and will be grateful, for the active co-operation of the business community in the work of devising simple and effective procedures for the operation of the tax so that it will cause as little trouble as possible to all concerned.  Because of its simplicity, I think the tax will be one of the most economical yet devised, with an administrative cost less than 1 per cent of the yield.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Alleviation Provisions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Although the tax will be low, the Government realise that, as food and other basic commodities come within its scope, certain sectors of the community should be given some relief. The increase of 2/6d. a week in various social payments which I announced earlier will more than cover the effect on social welfare recipients of the new tax as well as compensating for the increase since last August in the cost of living.  The Government propose to alleviate the burden which the new tax will impose on families by augmenting the existing scheme of children's allowances.  At present the allowances are 15/6d. a month for the second child and 22/- a month each for the third and subsequent children.  It is proposed to introduce a new allowance of 10/- a month for the first child and to increase the allowance of 22/- a month for third and subsequent children to 26/6d.  This means that, on average, the allowances will be increased by more than 4/6d. a month for each qualified child in a family. This should offset the increase resulting from the tax in the basic cost of rearing a family.</P>
    <P>These reliefs, like the turnover tax, will apply from the beginning of <Col N="88" /> November next and, as they will cost £1.2 million this year, will reduce the yield of the tax to a net £2.3 million. This is not sufficient to bridge the gap but I am counting on increased effectiveness in collecting direct taxation to make up the deficiency, as I shall explain before I conclude.</P>
    <P>It has been argued against a general sales tax that it would increase the proportion of indirect taxation, which is already high in this country by international standards, and that it would be inequitable in its incidence. The available information indicates that, in our tax system, the combined incidence of direct and indirect taxation is not regressive.  Government policy with regard to taxation, as stated on many occasions, is that it is a good principle in the circumstances of a developing country to place the emphasis of taxation on expenditure rather than on income so that earning and saving will be encouraged rather than spending.  This policy has been justified by the improvement in the economy in recent years.  It is in the national interest and particularly in the interests of the wage-earning and the less well-off members of the community that economic growth should be promoted by all possible means.</P>
    <P>It is not contrary to equity that those members of the community who can afford to spend most should pay most, as will be the position secured by the new tax.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Reports of Income Taxation Commission</i>
    </P>
    <P>At this point I should like to refer to the effects of acceptance of certain of the recommendations of the Income Taxation Commission as announced in the Second White Paper on Direct Taxation which was issued on 16th April.  The White Paper sets out the decisions of the Government with regard to the recommendations made in the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Reports of the Commission.  A glance at the various recommendations suffices to show the extent and value of the work which has been performed by the Commission.  A debt of gratitude is due to them.  Their extremely difficult <Col N="89" /> task has been completed expeditiously and the various reports have served to clarify the problems requiring attention and will greatly assist in making the income tax code simpler, more intelligible and more equitable.</P>
    <P>Inevitably it is not feasible for the Government to accept all of the many recommendations which the Commission has made but, as the two White Papers on Direct Taxation show, quite a high proportion of the recommendations has, in fact, been accepted.  The implementation of these recommendations will involve extensive legislation. Much of this will be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill and the remainder dealt with as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Evasion</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have accepted in broad principle the Commission's recommendations on evasion in their Seventh Report.  The Commission said that a complete review of the penalty sections should be taken in hand without delay.  This has been done and the forthcoming Finance Bill will contain a new set of penalty sections.  Another section to be included in the Bill following on a recommendation of the Commission will require banks and other financial institutions to make returns in relation to moneys held on deposit by Irish residents.  The return, except for current accounts, will, however, be one of interest accruing rather than of amounts on deposit and it will be sought only where the interest exceeds £15 in the year, which represents an average deposit of £1,500 at present.  The first year for which information may be sought will be 1962-63.  This will place the bank depositor in the same position as an investor in securities or an employee as regards his remuneration.  The information obtained will, of course, be treated as confidential by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Commission regarded the keeping of business records as of fundamental importance in the scheme of income taxation and they stated that the Revenue Commissioners should have access to whatever records exist.  It is proposed to incorporate a section in the Bill enabling the <Col N="90" /> Revenue Commissioners in certain circumstances to require a person to deliver accounts of his business to the Inspector of Taxes and to make available his business records for inspection.</P>
    <P>Improvements in organisation coupled with the provisions I have just mentioned will mean that tax evasion will in future be attended by a greater risk of detection.  I recognise, however, that it might be regarded as unreasonable to bring in these provisions without first giving a special opportunity to persons who may have been concealing some of their incomes to put themselves right with the Revenue Commissioners without incurring any penalty.  I therefore propose to arrange that any taxpayer concerned will be supplied on application with a form of undertaking to be completed and sent to the Revenue Commissioners before 31 March, 1964.  On this form the taxpayer will undertake to furnish the Revenue Commissioners by 30 June, 1964, or such later date as they may allow, with the accounts and information they consider necessary to enable them to compute the amount of all tax underpaid; and to have the accounts certified by an approved accountant if the Revenue Commissioners so require. When this undertaking has been executed the Revenue Commissioners will accept, in full settlement, payment of the amount of the underpaid tax and they will not look for penalties.</P>
    <P>This is a substantial concession and will, I have no doubt, be so regarded and used by persons who up to now have failed to pay their full tax.  I should, however, stress that leniency will not be shown to any taxpayer concerned who fails to avail himself of this offer.</P>
    <P>A loophole in the existing law which will be closed relates to the case where a person, who engages in a trade or profession and is taxed on actual profits under Schedule D, engages also in farming which is charged under Schedule B. Where a question arises as to the adequacy, having regard to the person's standard of living and financial position, of the amount of business profits returned he may allege that the apparent discrepancy is accounted for <Col N="91" /> by large profits on farming.  Since his farming profits are taxed on a notional basis under Schedule B the taxpayer has nothing to lose by overstating them. A new section will provide that farming operations in such cases shall be assessed under Schedule D by reference to actual profits.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the various measures proposed for dealing with tax evasion will bring in £600,000 in 1963-64 and materially greater sums in future years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Miscellaneous</i>
    </P>
    <P>The arrangements which are being made to bring the &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; system into operation, as set out in the Second White Paper on Direct Taxation, entail some changes in assessment procedure which, for technical reasons, necessitate the introduction of a Financial Resolution.  I shall explain this further when moving the Resolution.  Another Resolution is required as a result of the proposed alignment of income tax and sur-tax which is also mentioned in the White Paper.  There will also be a Resolution to remedy a defect in the operation of exports tax relief.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Customs and Excise Provisions</i>
    </P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to some customs and excise provisions which will be contained in the Finance Bill and none of which will have any significant effect on the revenue.</P>
    <P>I propose to extend by three months the period of credit for payment of excise duty on lager beer, as the present period, which is the same as for ordinary beer, is inadequate and adversely affects the competitive position of Irish lager in export markets.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to amend some penalty provisions in the customs and excise law following the Supreme Court decision last December that the provision in Section 186 of the Customs Consolidation Act for the election of the penalty by the Revenue Commissioners is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to seek power to make regulations exempting goods from customs and excise duties where it is necessary or expedient to do so in <Col N="92" /> order to comply with an international convention or agreement to which the State is a party.</P>
    <P>Provision will also be made for some changes of minor importance in relation to imported spirits, and authority will be sought to make statutory regulations governing the temporary importation of motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>To avoid complete loss of stamp duty on transfers of external stocks and shares I have to forgo one-half of the existing 2 per cent duty by reducing it to 1 per cent as from 1 August next.  This is a consequence of proposed legislation in Britain under which domestic transfers of securities will be liable to the reduced rate of 1 per cent from that date.  If we were to retain the 2 per cent rate, the result would be that most transfers of such securities to or from Irish persons would be stamped in Britain rather than here.  The cost of reducing the duty to 1 per cent will be £70,000 this year.  The change will mean that transfers of stocks and shares issued outside the State will be chargeable at the same rate of duty as transfers of stocks issued by Irish companies and other Irish bodies.  I am prepared to consider further the rate on transfers of the latter class when I have the report of the interdepartmental committee which is investigating the question of improving the marketability of Irish securities.</P>
    <P>A few further modifications in stamp duties can be made without upsetting the budgetary balance.  I propose to abolish in the Finance Bill the duty of 6d. on bills of lading.  I also propose to provide that insurance companies may compound for the duty on policies of insurance of all classes; and that local authorities may compound for the duty on their cheques or pay orders.  Provisions will also be included to relieve local authorities and State-sponsored bodies from the obligation of having the duty on conveyances and leases of lands to them adjudicated.  Such instruments, if stamped with the proper duty, will <Col N="93" /> accordingly not require to bear the adjudication stamp before being deemed to be duly stamped.  These provisions will all take effect from 1 August, 1963.</P>
    <P>I made reference last year to a comprehensive volume on stamp duty law which the Revenue Commissioners were preparing.  The volume will be on sale later this year.  It will be in loose-leaf form so that it may be kept up to date by the issue of amending leaves which may become necessary upon changes being made in the law.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am too long in politics to think that this budget will escape criticism, that there will be no exaggeration and no misrepresentation.  Serious and honest critics must, however, accept the obligation of explaining what they would have done.  Would they have cut expenditure by many millions so as to reduce or even eliminate the need for increased taxation, and, if so, under what heads?  Would they have given nothing to the farmers or the old age or other pensioners?  Would they have imposed different taxes to cover their deficit and, if so, what taxes and with what effects, economic and social?  I omit questions which only the irresponsible would consider: for instance, whether the deficit should be ignored, or even added to, regardless of the need to pay our way and the vital connection between financial order and economic progress.</P>
    <P>I believe that the solution I have proposed of this year's budgetary problem is a sound and fair one.  A big increase in investment is provided for in the Capital Budget, to strengthen the pace of national development and to increase employment.  The claims of dairy farmers, social welfare recipients and others to some improvement in their position, or at least to protection against disimprovement, have not been ignored.  The taxation needed to reduce&mdash;and in time to close &mdash;the budgetary gap has been selected with careful regard to social equity. Profits and rental income are called <Col N="94" /> upon for the primary contribution, while a general tax on current spending, no longer avoidable, will not become effective until November, will be at a low rate, and will be accompanied by relief for all families with children.</P>
    <P>The new tax must, of course, fall on many without alleviation, if the yield at such a moderate rate is to help meet the need for more money to finance the public services.  I realise that it will be said to be unfair and inconsistent to cause living costs to rise by taxation at the same time as everyone is being asked to be content with his existing income until national production has risen further. But, however understanding and sympathetic one may be, however tempted to take an easy, popular line, it would be altogether irresponsible and inconsistent with the community's future welfare either to pretend that public services can be provided without paying currently for them or to contemplate a further general rise in money incomes before national production catches up even with existing incomes.  The Government hope that their taxation proposals&mdash;intended merely to pay for services and benefits obtained by the community&mdash;will be considered just and acceptable and will not become an occasion for the raising, through untimely income increases, of the costs of production, and, therefore, the home and export prices, of Irish goods.  This we cannot, as a nation, afford.  Our progress depends on our goods becoming more competitive in export markets and I have faith in this being understood by all who care for the nation's interest.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, recommend this budget to the Dáil as a set of responsible and equitable measures designed to keep our national finances in order, to be fair in the allocation of benefits and burdens, and to promote the higher rate of economic growth which is the key to greater prosperity for a larger population.</P>

This is offset in the Assets Statement where the balance on the American Loan Counterpart Fund, the National Development Fund (Winding-up) Account, the National Loans Sinking Funds and the Savings Certificates Fund (Principal Reserve Account) include the Funds investments in Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer and Exchequer Bills.</P>

      <P>I would not have sat down for such a disorderly point of order but for the fact that I thought the Tánaiste was going to honour the statement that he made some years ago when he said that any Minister who took any part in raiding the till or the petty cash was not fit to be a Minister and should resign forthwith.  On this occasion the Minister for Finance, and Deputy MacEntee as Tánaiste, have not merely raided the till but they have taken the whole till away. One would have thought that for the sake of showing the example of honouring his speech, the Tánaiste would have realised his obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the thing that astounds one in relation to this Budget is the atmosphere of bluff and propaganda with which it was heralded by many people and particularly by the Taoiseach. Last week, he tried to make it appear that the Budget was going to be the starting point towards a new programme.  Instead of being such a starting point, it is going to be a crippling point for many of the people in this country.  Of course, that was done partly to take away attention from the mistakes and from the errors, and from the results of those mistakes and errors by him and his Government and the Minister for Finance. Where did we start to-day?  We started, first of all, with the knowledge that last year the Minister for Finance ended up the 1962-63 Budget with a deficit of £4,857,000, with a deficit that means that we are going to pay this year and every year ahead for 19 more years <Col N="130" /> £679,000 for the purpose of meeting the cost that will arise in sinking fund and interest over the years to recoup the deficit for which the Minister was responsible last year.  We start with that deficit for which he has given no explanation but, of course, the explanation is obvious. The explanation is that revenue came up to expectation but the Minister for Finance as Minister for Finance failed to exercise his proper functions of looking over the finances and expenditure in the country and allowed expenditure to rise beyond the money he had to meet it.</P>
    <P>We can go further from that.  I wonder how many people, how many Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party, realised when the Minister for Finance came in today that on 1st April he was able to say, without his having even to get up from his seat, that he was going to have tax buoyancy of something over £6¼ million and increased non-tax revenue of almost another £2 million&mdash;buoyancy in revenue, without having to lift a finger, of up to £8 million, buoyancy in revenue enough not merely to wipe out the deficit of last year, not merely to provide the £1¾ million provided for the price of milk or to double it, not merely to provide for the social welfare benefits that are included&mdash;that amount of buoyancy and enough extra revenue to meet all that&mdash;if only he had made the effort of ensuring that expenditure would be kept at last year's level, not even at the level estimated this time last year but at last year's actual level.  All those benefits could have been included and the deficit of last year wiped out if only the Minister for Finance had properly acted in pursuance of the functions vested in him.  It is because he did not&mdash;for that reason and that reason alone&mdash; that we have here today a Budget whose impositions, perhaps, not yet realised, will be crippling in their effect on very many people throughout the community, not merely in this year but in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>It was not merely in relation to the Budget of last year that the Minister failed.  He failed, in addition, in his job of guiding the external transactions <Col N="131" /> of the community in such a way that we went on external balance to a figure of £13,400,000 on the wrong side.  That is not merely the figure for 1962.  It is a figure in respect of which the trend month after month and quarter after quarter since last year has been steadily rising.  The figures released only yesterday show a further increase in our import excess.</P>
    <P>The immediate effects of that have been hidden by the hot money to which reference was made by economists, by the Banking Review, and which everybody seems to know about except the Minister for Finance.  If it has had the effect that we are now living on capital externally it is because the Minister has failed in his task of guiding the economy in the right way.</P>
    <P>But, of all the facts that emerged during the past week in the documents circulated, the figures that have now been disclosed in relation to employment must shatter the confidence of everyone who has seen them and who appreciates them.  If we take the returns in the pink book Economic Statistics, we find that last year there was a reduction of 19,200 in the number of people on the land of Ireland, that the policy of this Fianna Fáil Government has meant that 19,200 people have been pushed off work on the land of Ireland.  If we go back to 1956 we find that in the intervening period 48,500 people have been driven off work on the land because of the policy of the Government. If we take the number of paid employees in agriculture, apart from those engaged in family work, we find that the increase in industrial employment does not provide any proper margin at all above that.  Five thousand paid employees lost their jobs in agriculture last year.  That is supposed to be a record of which the Minister for Finance today can be proud.</P>
    <P>As I say, for years the position has been that there has been some increase in industrial employment that would at least offset that but, while there were 5,000 fewer people paid in agriculture last year the offsetting increase in transportable goods industries has only been some 3,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> I shall now turn from that aspect of economic activity to the total number of people at work.  I shall leave out of account altogether the number of people who have left the country. It was estimated by one of the big firms the other day that the reason why their sales of flour were down was that there were 300,000 fewer mouths to eat their flour.  There is a table that has been dropped this year from the <i>Economic Statistics</i> but which can be reconstructed. If it is reconstructed we find that, in spite of all the ballyhoo, in spite of all the propaganda and in spite of all the promises by Fianna Fáil, between 1956 and 1962, even taking account of any increase in employment in industry that there may be, there are today as we stand here 58,500 fewer persons employed in Ireland than there were six years ago and the Minister for Finance expects that he will receive plaudits from the people on that record.</P>
    <P>Where are the 100,000 jobs the Taoiseach promised?  Where was the great plan the Taoiseach promised he had only to take out of a drawer and put into operation and that, not merely after a period, but so many in the first year, so many in the second year, the third year, the fourth year and the fifth year?  Where are the placards Fianna Fáil had about wives getting their husbands back to work?  There are 58,500 fewer persons at work today than there were the day they walked into the jobs for themselves beyond.</P>
    <P>Let us go on from that damning failure of the Government to consider the position in relation to the national debt.  The national debt at the end of last year was £531 million.  It increased by £43 million in 1963 alone and the cost of servicing that debt has gone up to £32 million from £18 million when the Minister took over.  Up to the time they came into office the increase in the cost of servicing the national debt could safely be taken account of by increase in non-tax revenue but we now need £22,940,000 to service the national debt this year, whereas in 1957/58 we needed only £11 million, that again taking into account each year the amount that comes in the repayment of advances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> How is it that in spite of all the money we see expended for the purpose of allegedly increasing production we see no sign of that increase when we come to the other side of the exchequer book?  Why is it that we see a virtual stagnation in agricultural output because of the failure of the policies of the Minister for Agriculture? The net output of the agricultural industry increased last year by only one per cent.  Why is it that there is virtually no increase in our livestock population?  Why is it that when we sold 200,000 cattle last year there is only an increase in the cattle population of 120,000, 80,000 less than the number sold?</P>
    <P>It is now obvious to everybody that industry last year was showing that sign of sluggishness which meant that all we had got before was a taking up of the slack that was present in existing concerns and was due to the effect of the boom at the other side of the water which the Minister for Finance has admitted today when he said that one of the reasons for the reduction in our industrial exports last year was the change in the economic situation across the way.</P>
    <P>Where is this Budget going to help the development of an incomes policy? We said last year and the previous year that the development of an incomes policy was vitally necessary to the country.  We cannot afford to have the continued effect of play and counterplay between opposing interests in our economic life.  This Budget is not going to do much to help the situation and neither did the hamhanded White Paper issued by the Government three months ago.  All that this Budget and that White Paper have shown is that this Government do not understand what an incomes policy really is.  Their policy has been concerned solely with restricting earnings but by an incomes policy we would have expansion in salaries and wages, expansion in profits, in agricultural earnings and in social service benefits. Of course, that has never been Fianna Fáil's understanding of these matters. Instead they have always preferred to rely on incomes.</P>
    <P>If we turn again to the industrial <Col N="134" /> increase and to the figures given for the gross national product we will see nothing of the increase of the kind which we have heard so much about and for so long in sermons from members of the Government.  However, after six years the Minister for Finance has taken my advice.  It has taken him six years to realise that my advice was good and excellent advice.  Six years ago I told him it was desirable to have a separate Budget statement issued in relation to the capital Budget.  When Dr. Ryan and the Fianna Fáil Party came into office they were not going to admit that anything done here by their predecessors could be of any value and so they buried that idea for six years hoping that, when they reintroduced it, people would have forgotten where it came from.  It is a good thing that even after that lapse of time the Minister has adopted that policy but it is unfortunate that he did not do so earlier.</P>
    <P>We see a tribute in the Budget statement to those who, by their savings have helped to provide necessary capital but we see no reference on the part of the Minister to the fact that the most permanent form of small savings has ceased to be as attractive as they used to be.  Saving certificates are by far the most permanent form of small savings and yet they are the only type of small savings that have shown a decline.  I would have thought that it would be obvious to the Minister for Finance that this is the time to introduce a more attractive issue in that respect.</P>
    <P>Last year and the year before people got from the Minister for Finance a new form of taxation in PAYE.  This year they have got another new form of tax in what the Minister has called a turnover tax.  I think most of them will go home tonight and tomorrow wondering what new tax Fianna Fáil are going to think up for them next year.  People will realise that if they get the opportunity Fianna Fáil will not fail to put another blister on them next year.  I do not blame the members of the Fianna Fáil Party for failing to follow what was being done as the Minister announced this turnover tax today. <Col N="135" /> The Minister read so quietly and so fast that nobody could follow him but I wonder will the members of Fianna Fáil and of the public generally realise tomorrow that the Minister, instead of taxing perfumes, furs, expensive motor cars and jewellery as was announced by the Minister for Lands, is taxing bread, butter, sugar, tea and milk and all the necessaries of life?</P>
    <P>He is taxing the clothes of every sort that we have to wear.  He is taxing the clothes of every sort that we have to get for our children.  It does not matter what it is: whether it is the hair-do for the lady or the hair-cut for the man, or bread, butter, milk or clothing&mdash;all have been taken into the maw of the Minister for Finance by this Budget.</P>
    <P>There is no question of any luxuries. There is no question of a differentiation in tax as between the fur coat and the loaf of bread.  There is no question of a differentiation on tax as between the expensive motor car and the ordinary, cheap, small car a person might want to buy.  There is no question of a differentiation in tax for the thing that is really necessary as against the thing that is a complete and absolute luxury.  There is no question of ensuring that those who could afford to buy the most luxurious articles should pay the highest rate of tax on those articles.  Apparently, simplicity is the only thing that matters. There is no question of hardship because the fact that all goods are being attacked is not apparently a matter of any consequence.</P>
    <P>Even that was not enough for the Minister.  He endeavoured to balance his Budget this year by, as I have said, taking the till money out and leaving no revenue balance whatsoever.  If there has ever been a more disgraceful method of robbing the till, I shall allow the Tánaiste to explain it when he speaks on this Budget, and no doubt he must speak to defend his honour because, as an honourable man, he should have resigned after what he said, rather than adopt this Budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister has increased the imposition of corporation profits tax not merely on all companies but also in <Col N="136" /> respect of the first £2,500.  It is easy for Deputies to say that will not hurt anyone, but I believe this additional imposition will have the effect of ruining many small family businesses.  I believe the turnover tax will make it virtually impossible for small family businesses to carry on.  It will not affect the bigger businesses because they have their own resources.  They have the money to modernise and with that modernisation, they can take advantage of the industrial allowances that are given under the income tax code.</P>
    <P>The small family business has not got the money to do that.  It has not got that type of reserve.  Its difficulty has always been to carry on from day to day.  It will find now that there will be less and less profit, and many of those family businesses will find that as a result of this Budget their days are numbered.  Before I leave the corporation profits tax, I should say that in our circumstances it is from the accumulation within the companies by selffinancing that we are able to get greater productivity and modernisation. At one fell swoop, the Minister has cut down on that, and that is bound to affect productivity in the future.</P>
    <P>Again, it is easy for the Minister to refer in wide and sweeping terms to taxation on rents and on unfurnished lettings.  We all know that after the breadwinner has gone, one of the ways in which the widow can help make ends meet&mdash;be she a farmer's widow or the widow of a man who owned his house&mdash;is to let the land or the house until her family have grown and can take their place in the world.</P>
    <P>That type of letting will come under the attack of this Budget not merely in respect of conacre land.  In addition, the widow who lets her house in Dublin will find the same penalty imposed on her.  That will inevitably have the effect that there will be fewer houses and fewer flats to rent.  Working people in Dublin, and working girls, find it hard enough to get flats at present but this will mean that there will be fewer houses and flats to rent, and when they come on the market they will be sold for owner-occupation only and not for letting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> I do not understand how the Minister can possibly calculate that the cost of this turnover tax will be as light as he says.  How is it to be collected from the huckster shop?</P>

      <P>Licensed premises are already suffering from the effects of last year's Budget.  There was a drop of one-sixth in the consumption of home whiskey as a result of the Minister's action last year.  Tobacconists have been suffering because of the Minister's action last year.  Petrol, one of the Minister's best revenue collectors, will have to meet this additional impost, as will bread, butter, sugar, tea, milk, clothing and everything, so far as I can see, that is in everyday use.  When anyone complains, the Minister says: &ldquo;Do not worry, boys; there are others worse off in other countries.&rdquo;  That is all he can say.</P>
      <P>What about the situation of the ratepayers? Last year's relief was swallowed up in the increased rates this year.  One of the provisions in this Budget, the increased disablement benefits, will automatically increase rates by Government direction.</P>

      <P>There was enough to pay for the social services.  It does not matter which page you turn to in <Col N="139" /> the Budget Statement; it all amounts to the same thing.  According to the tables issued today, last year, 22 per cent of the gross national production was taken by the Central Government. That was the highest amount taken in any of the past five years.  It has increased immeasurably, and this Budget will go down in history as the one in which Fianna Fáil deliberately placed further blisters on the backs of the people, deliberately increased taxation not by itself but as a percentage of everything everybody needs.  If that is something for which they think they will get praise in the country, they have another think coming because the people will be only too anxious, as soon as they can, to pass a verdict on them, and no uncertain verdict it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Without closer examination of the details of the Budget, I should like to express some comments on behalf of this Party as to how the Budget appears to us at this stage.  I think the Minister for Finance displayed considerable political sagacity and foresight when at the top of page 62 of his statement, he said:</P>
      <P>I am too long in politics to think that this Budget will escape criticism, that there will be no exaggeration and no misrepresentation.</P>
      <P>Anybody who knows the Minister's wily ways will realise it was at that point that introspection broke out within him and the Minister realised that the 61 pages which he had already written, or which his expert advisers had written for him, would be insufficient to insulate him against criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is right, of course.  He is too old a warrior, as is the gentleman on his left, not to realise that this is not the kind of Budget you can ride around on with a white horse underneath, announcing yourself as a kind of Messiah to the people.  This is a disappointing Budget; it is a pedestrian Budget, a Budget of shifting here and chopping there, moving from one thing in one direction to another thing in another direction.  If cards were in <Col N="140" /> use, this Budget is very like a game of Find the Lady because there are moments here and there when you are wondering what is happening.  If you travel back over the statement, you will find that what is purported to be given away in one place has already been taken ten pages earlier, that compensation promised in one portion of the statement is utterly inadequate in the circumstances governing the case.</P>
    <P>What has been made quite clear is that the Minister in his review has said that exports fell last year.  That is a very serious situation against the background of the European Economic Community, in circumstances in which we are supposed to be making arrangements to combat the effects of EEC membership on our industries and agriculture.  In 1962, our exports fell by comparison with previous years. I think nobody can gainsay the absolute necessity and urgency of pushing our exports to the highest possible pitch, and the fact that last year, by a relatively substantial figure in our circumstances, our exports fell, is an indication that basically we have not yet got to grips with the problems confronting us as far as Europe is concerned, that we are still in a relatively stagnant position.</P>
    <P>Not only has there been a fall in exports but the whole employment position seems to have got into a condition in which it is almost impossible to understand the factors that are at work.  A Parliamentary Question recently elicited the fact that in 1962 18,200 persons left agricultural employment. Is that not a very serious situation?  Yet we were told in the week before the general election in 1957 that Fianna Fáil had a plan to put 100,000 persons into employment in four years, a plan that would end emigration.</P>
    <P>It is now six years since that promise was made and the position to-day is that there are fewer in employment. These figures cannot be denied. This booklet issued by the Taoiseach's Department, Economic Statistics, shows that in 1956 409,000 persons were employed in farm work.  The number in 1962 had dropped to 360,000; in other <Col N="141" /> words, there were approximately 49,000 fewer persons employed in agriculture in 1962 than in 1956.  This has happened notwithstanding the Government's covenant that, if they got into office, they would provide 100,000 jobs in four years.</P>
    <P>Surely, after six years, nobody can be accused of peevishness or impetuosity if they ask the Government where are the 100,000 extra jobs, bearing in mind the fact that there are 49,000 fewer people in agricultural employment today than in 1956.  It may be said that employment in industry has gone up.  It has, of course.  We had to do something for the people.  Let us look at the figures.  In 1956, there were 154,000 people employed in industrial production or engaged in the transportable goods industries.  The number in 1962 was 170,000.  Approximately, 49,000 people left agriculture and 16,000 got new jobs in industry and that means that 33,000 fewer persons were employed, according to these figures.  Somebody ought to explain how this plan for 100,000 new jobs is working.  It does not seem to work in accordance with the ordinary rules of mathematics.  These figures show instead that we have fewer people in employment in Ireland today than we had in 1956, notwithstanding the 1957 plan to give 100,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>All this has gone on in spite of large scale emigration from the country. If there had been no emigration in the past six years, the number unemployed here, the number out of industrial and agricultural employment, would be substantially more than is revealed by an examination of these statistics.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to ask: what is the Government's real plan for dealing with unemployment?  What is the Government's policy in respect of agriculture?  Is it to allow agricultural employment to fall and fall, and to continue to hope that we can absorb a fraction of those who leave agriculture into industrial employment and allow emigration to take care of the remainder?  Will somebody state the Government's policy in half-a-dozen sentences so that we may know and <Col N="142" /> understand in full in which direction we are moving?</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that since November, 1961, prices have risen by six per cent, which is a pretty substantial increase.  This Budget will, of course, add considerably, in my view, to the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Against the background that prices have risen by six per cent, to talk about a wage pause by which the Government would put their finger on the scale against the wages and salaries of the workers is obviously an unfair method of approach.  The Minister was much more sagacious when he came to talk of the wage policy and he spoke of a policy of adjusting production and incomes.  One can generally agree that out of the pool of production come the wages and sustenance standards of those who are employed and I do not think, as I said during the discussion on the pay pause motion, that it would be impossible&mdash;I think it would be desirable&mdash;for the responsible central trade union organisation and the employers' organisation to discuss the matter.  It should be possible to work out a wage policy and an economic policy that would avoid upheavals from time to time and give reasonable satisfaction to both sides.  The Taoiseach's wages regulation, with entry into the business of salary, was comparable to the bull in the china shop.  It caused considerable comment and disquiet amongst those who were apparently to be the victims of the Government's wage policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The turnover tax now announced in the Budget and heralded for some time is to appear later in the year. Apparently there is to be a tax of two-and-half per cent or 6d. in the £ on practically everything apart from a few isolated commodities.  How this will work is another matter but two and a half per cent will be taken from everybody who goes into practically any kind of shop to buy commodities.  If you take an ordinary tradesman, carpenter, bricklayer, plasterer, glazier, tiler or an ordinary clerk who has a wife and a <Col N="143" /> few children, he spends roughly £10 a week.  He will pay at least an extra 5/-a week.  That will be the minimum tax. I suggest this may work out not at 6d in the £ but at 1/8 in the £.  For example, what will be the tax if a person buys 1/- worth of goods?  Will the tax be one-twentieth of a shilling? If so, what coinage will be used?  I suspect that if a person buys 1/- worth under this tax, he will pay at least a halfpenny and if he buys 20 separate items worth a shilling each, 20 separate halfpennies will have to be paid, that is on the assumption that the shopkeeper adjusts the matter on the basis of a halfpenny.  In a great many cases, it is not always possible to get a halfpenny and many people give pieces of paper for halfpennies in provincial shops. They say: &ldquo;I have no halfpenny but keep that bit of paper until the next day&rdquo;.  I suspect that there will be 1d. minimum tax in many cases where relatively small amounts of money are spent.  The effect will be that the tax will be substantially more in small instances than if you had to pay 6d in the £.  If you buy £10 worth, the calculation is clear and you pay an extra 5/-but where people have slender resources and have to buy small quantities and have to use the curren coinage, I am afraid they will not get away with 6d in the £ but will have to pay substantially more and may in fact pay up to 20d or 1/8 in the £.</P>
    <P>That will be a nice turnover tax to inflict on these people at the same time as they are being advised by their political superiors to take note of the necessity for a wage pause.  This matter needs further examination by the Government who should take note of the fact that a new impost is being put on the backs of people who are not able to bear the present burdens, much less meet the demands which will amount to another £3½ million. The weakest backs and the most slender incomes will feel this tax most.</P>
    <P>Up to 1957, the problem here was to give the people food at the cheapest possible prices.  For that purpose, we had a scheme of food subsidies. Fianna Fáil did not like that.  In 1952, <Col N="144" /> when they got back to office after 1951, they slashed a substantial number of food subsidies to the extent of about £9 million.  When they got back to office again in 1957, they slashed the remainder of the food subsidies, so that instead of a situation in which it was part of the national policy to subsidise food production and give food to the people at the lowest possible price, we have now, thanks to this Government, got away from a food subsidation policy and embarked in a whole-hog manner on a scheme of food taxation.</P>
    <P>This is the first Government in this country to impose a tax on foodstuffs. That tax is being imposed in this Budget by a Minister for Finance who quaintly says that he thinks there may be criticism.  Fianna Fáil now enjoy the reputation that prices were never higher than they are today and they are the first Government to put this blanket taxation on foodstuffs and at a time when people are groaning under the burdens they are now compelled to bear.</P>
    <P>I see nothing in this Budget calculated to give any inspiration whatever to our people.  I see no evidence of any clear plans for the growth or expansion of the economy on either the agricultural or industrial front.  It is a gloomy reflection to remember that our exports have gone down and nobody is yet prepared to say that we can correct that tendency this year, although, personally, I hope we shall be able to do so.</P>
    <P>On the agricultural front, we have reached the stage when one of our biggest products&mdash;milk, and its corollary, butter&mdash;has now become the enemy of the Irish Exchequer.  We are now spending £3½ million a year in getting other people in other countries to eat our butter at a price 40 per cent cheaper than our own people can eat it.  Surely that is a defect in the agricultural economy that ought to be remedied by methods other than sending an odd commercial traveller around here and there to see if he can sell a few cwts of butter?  A sum of £3½ million is now being spent on what must be recognised as the most <Col N="145" /> wasteful form of investment, namely, selling our products at a substantial loss to other people.</P>
    <P>In the developments that have taken place since General de Gaulle's temperamental decision in January last to have nothing more to do, for the time being, at all events, with the British application for membership of EEC, I think most people will have discerned, both in industry and in general discussions at public gatherings, a slackening of the urgency about our membership of EEC.  If this is allowed to go uncorrected it must mean, inevitably, a falling back to the old ways, to the old methods, and a resort to reliance on whatever can be sold on the home market, with all the difficulties involved in that if, at the same time, this sense of resignation to events is accompanied by a continued reduction in the tariffs on imported commodities.</P>
    <P>I see nothing in the Budget which is likely to act as a clarion call to the nation or as an incentive to gear the nation for the emergency of our membership of EEC.  I see in it many petty changes of a kind which in my view affect neither one way or the other the internal economy and which, beyond providing light reading for people who are interested in Budgets, will make no substantial contribution to the eradication of our difficulties or the removal of many of the evils which press with such rigour upon our people.</P>

      <P>The Minister has suggested that there should not be any criticism of this Budget.  He must have had his tongue in his cheek because for the first time since I have come to this House&mdash;I am here exactly 20 years now&mdash;a deficit will be found by the Minister for Finance from the very poorest people in the country. One statement the Minister made was that employment in industries producing luxury goods is no luxury to the employees concerned.  In every other case when Governments had to find additional expenditure the very first thing the Minister for Finance turned to was to see if the money he required could be got from luxuries and <Col N="146" /> non-essentials.  That was the method employed during our time by the two inter-Party Governments with a great measure of success, a great measure of relief and an easement of the burden on the poorest classes of people.</P>

      <P>Explain it otherwise. The Parliamentary Secretary will get a chance when he is speaking to explain it otherwise but the fact remains, just as Deputy Norton has said, that we had established that system.  We had established and maintained the system of food subsidies. It was bad enough for Fianna Fáil on two occasions to remove these subsidies&mdash;first, when they got back to power in 1952 they reduced them to the tune I think of about £9,000,000 and, when they got back in 1957, they removed them altogether&mdash;but now the wheel has gone full circle and instead of removing subsidies on food and driving up the price of it they have actually resorted to taxing food.</P>
      <P>Let us look at what they propose to do under this Budget.  It certainly is sad to see that they have descended to such a meagre thing.  First and foremost, I mention the proposed turnover tax and the tax on conacre lettings for the first time in the history of this country.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he proposes a turnover tax.  He tells us he proposes to start a register of every <Col N="148" /> person doing business in the country. Is that not right?  Very good.  As I take it from the Minister's speech, without any elaboration or explanation other than what the Minister has just told us, a certain tax will be levied on everybody engaged in business.  In other words, they have to turn in monthly accounts to the Revenue Department.  They can find the tax any way they want to: there is no word of a prohibition.  Take the shopkeeper who sells small quantities &mdash; sixpence worth and one shilling's worth&mdash;to the ordinary poor people throughout the country.  I imagine this imposition will not lean as heavily on the big business as it will on the small business.  Take the small businessman who sells tea by the quarter or half pound, a box of matches &mdash; any small quantity with which we are familiar.  How is he to operate this tax and how is he to bear it out of his profits and not raise the cost of these commodities?  The loaf of bread, the lb. of butter&mdash;all such commodities must bear an increase from the shopkeeper.  Otherwise the shopkeeper will find himself in <i>Stubbs' Gazette.</i></P>

We know what happened.  Big interests got to work the moment an election was in the offing and, whether they did or not, the result was the same.  The moment the Fianna Fáil Party got back into power the big interests were protected and the poor man had to bear the burden, through the removal of the remainder of the food subsidies.  It is even worse today because taxation is being imposed on the essential commodities bought by the ordinary working man.</P>

I am thinking of the mass of ratepayers who are up against it at the present time.  There are the small farmer and the small businessman in the town whose rates have gone up beyond their capacity to pay.  It is high time to bring some relief to those classes.  No attempt has been made to stem emigration.  We are losing 50,000 or 60,000 people every year, which is considered part of the pattern.</P>

      <P>Once again, this House is facing what has become the traditional pattern in the economy over the years, an increasing deficit in the balance of trade, a failure to increase exports, an excess of imports over exports, a lack of sufficient increase in industry or agriculture, all creating a demand on the Minister for Finance to find the money needed to continue to pay for the rudimentary social and other services by taxing the public generally.  It is quite clear that the position which the Minister now faces <Col N="152" /> is in many ways comparable with the position which the Minister for Finance faced in 1957.  It is true to say that the solution of the then Minister for Finance for that problem was in no way as ruthlessly harsh as is this Minister's solution for his dilemmas.</P>
      <P>However, as in 1957, so now in 1963, the solutions which are offered by the Minister are merely accountancy solutions. As Deputy Norton said, there is no sign of a plan or a policy.  It is as if we merely appointed a firm of chartered accountants to look after our affairs and that each year they come forward with a bill and tell us how we shall pay it.  There is no creative attempt by the Parties on either side to tell us how, by means of intelligent planning, to organise land labour and capital, to create a dynamic increase in the formation of capital so that we do not have to revert to penal taxes of one kind or another which have such a serious and painful effect on the mass of the people and particularly on the group least able to bear these impositions.</P>
      <P>I have very little to say on this Budget except that it is primarily an anti-family Budget.  Its impact will be felt most by the family unit.  The family unit in our society is the largest single consumer.  The larger the family, the greater the consumer; the greater the consumer, the greater the tax burden.</P>
      <P>The result of what is effectively a consumer tax is that the person with the large family will be hurt the most. I do not believe the offsetting social benefits will, in fact, offset the penalties imposed by the Budget.  There is no doubt that this Budget in its effect will impose a mean and harsh penalty on the family man and on his wife and children.  It must be taken in the context of the fact that a wage standstill order has been imposed.  While the cost of living has been allowed to rise by seven points, we have the addition of these new taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one knows better than the seasoned members of the Front Bench of the Government Party that this Budget, with its greatly increased taxation on the mass of the people, is most damaging politically.  It could have been introduced only in a situation <Col N="153" /> in which the economy was in very great danger indeed and deteriorating rapidly.  It can have been acceptable to the members of the Government only because, in fact, they have no other choice and have at last fully understood and accepted the position of impending bankruptcy now facing the economy as a result of the drift, which is the only policy they have followed since they have taken over. There is no doubt whatsoever that this drift towards national bankruptcy will not be halted permanently by the measures outlined by the Minister in his Budget Statement.  They are merely a very harsh and unjust taxation on consumer goods, which will hurt most of all those people least able to bear it&mdash;the family man and his children.</P>
    <P>We must recall that the case disclosing this serious economic situation facing the country was made by the Minister for Finance and carries all his authority.  It is based on figures provided by Government Departments. In my view, this makes all the more serious the indictment of the Taoiseach implicit in the facts.  Until as recently as last November, in this House and outside it, the Taoiseach claimed and protested that the economy was in a state of unparalleled bouyancy.  He claimed that prosperity was at a peak never equalled before.  In fact, he claimed that so prosperous was this unit of society that we were all fitted to take our place in Europe in the face of the most bitter competition from the most advanced societies in Europe.</P>
    <P>In respect of this now clearly shown fraudulent misrepresentation of the true position, we had the Taoiseach supported by members of his Party at all ranks, by members of the Seanad. by the newspapers and by political economists supporting the Government. In the light of the disclosures by the Minister for Finance as to the true position, the public can only conclude that the two year old campaign by the Government to mislead the people at home and in Europe was either the result of a deliberate attempt to mislead and misinform in order to get into the Common Market on what was, in effect, a bogus prospectus, which would <Col N="154" /> be called in the courts an attempt to perpetrate a swindle or a fraud, or alternatively, it was due to the fact that the Taoiseach and his colleagues, or their advisers, so wildly misread the economic indicators that they blundered into their present position. In either condition, it seems clear to me that it is clear the Government are not fit to govern and should resign without delay before greater and more irremediable damage is done to the national economy.</P>

      <P>The Income Tax Commission recommended that where parents of advancing age were depending on a daughter to look after them, the income limit should apply the same as in the case of any other dependent relative.  There was no provision as to what income she might have.  We are now providing that she should not have more than £120 a year.  This is only in preparation for next year's Budget, which will bring in a tapering allowance which they also recommended.  Before the tapering allowance comes in, a child who has £1 over a certain income gets nothing.  When the tapering allowance is brought in, that child will get the allowance, less £1.  If the child has £10 over in a year, the allowance will be granted, less £10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On pages 5 and 6.  The intention is to withdraw the provision that related to these co-operative societies and to insert new provisions with regard to them.  What it is intended to do is to exempt from income tax profits derived by co-operative societies from the processing of farm products or the selling to farmers of certain requisites, such as seeds and manures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to wait until the Minister deals with the matter more fully on the Finance Bill but I want to make it clear that I think it is a most extraordinary procedure that a Resolution of this kind appears on the paper without any reference whatever to it in the Minister's speech.  So strong was my assumption that the Minister would not make such a change without referring to it in his Budget speech that I felt that I could not believe my own interpretation of the Resolution, but the House ought to know what this means.</P>
      <P>This means that you are taking from the co-operative societies an exemption they have enjoyed for 60 years.  It has often been argued strongly that it gives them an unfair advantage in that they enjoyed an exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax whereas individual traders up and down the country were obliged to meet these costs.  That can be argued pro and con but it is most astonishing that Dáil Éireann should be asked by this Resolution to determine this wide and vitally important question without any case being made for it by the Minister. Surely if we are to change the whole basis of co-operative trading as it obtained since the co-operative societies were introduced the House should consider and hear the arguments for and the arguments against?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must charge the Minister with being disingenuous in his procedure in this regard.  I have often placed it on record that the Minister is an extremely astute operator and skilful debater but I put it to him that this kind of ingenuity goes beyond legitimate limits, to put a Resolution like this before the House without giving any explanation in his speech and then <Col N="161" /> to say when he is asked about it &ldquo;Oh well, I did not mention it in my speech but it is mentioned in the White Paper&rdquo;. That is not a proper procedure and I think the proposal contained in this Resolution, if I interpret it correctly, will be received with consternation and amazement by the agricultural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Resolution means.  I take it that it will impose an annual charge on the Mitchelstown Co-operative Society of anything from £30,000 to £40,000. Would that be a fair estimate?  I imagine that Drinagh under this Financial Resolution will become liable to an annual burden of anything up to £50,000.  I imagine the principal co-operative societies in my constituency, the constituency of the Minister for Transport and Power, will be called upon to meet a charge which may annually amount to £20,000.  Maybe I fail to understand the Financial Resolution correctly but if I do I should like to be corrected.  If I am wrong I want to be corrected.  The Minister has a fair, approximate knowledge of the volume of trade of a body like Drinagh, Dungarvan or Mitchelstown or any of the larger co-operative societies.  Could he give me a rough estimate of what he thinks this Resolution will impose on such co-operative societies by way of annual tax?</P>

      <P>If they confine their activities to taking in farm produce, milk and so on, from the farmers and sell to the farmers what the farmers want by way of seeds, feeding stuffs and manures, there will not be any tax at all. That is the intention of the Finance Bill.  This Resolution gives the Revenue Commissioners power to put on a tax but in the Finance Bill that is how it will be done.  As a matter of fact, as far as my recollection goes, the Revenue Commissioners told me that the most they expect to get from it in a year is £10,000.</P>

This has been drafted, and we are asked to pass a Resolution as drafted, which means that the tax exemption existing at the present for co-operative societies is to be scrapped.  I do not know what the Minister's intentions are and when he comes along with the Finance Bill or anything else that will be another day's work and we will examine it, but surely to goodness it is wrong to put before the House a Resolution which says it is giving effect only to the Income Tax Commission's Report when patently it is not?  It is a Resolution repealing entirely the provisions of the Act in regard to co-operative societies.  If the Minister only wanted to repeal the provisions of the Act in relation to what I might call shop produce or manufactured produce and leave the provisions of the Act for shop produce bought and sold by the farmer member of the co-operative society, why did he not put it in this?  The Resolution has been drawn in such a way as to cover everything the co-operative society does and the effect of it is that from now on under this Resolution the entire exemption is gone.</P>

Last year, the Finance Act imposed a charge of interest on arrears of income tax over a certain point.  When we come to the one taxpayer, one charge, it will have to be brought in together.  As brought in last year, each assessment was taken separately with regard to interest and it is felt that next year when we have the one taxpayer, one charge, it should be brought in together.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want some further explanation in relation to this Resolution. This refers to 1st January, 1962, which, at first, makes it look as if it were a retrospective tax.  The answer could possibly be if the assessment to corporation profits tax in 1963-64 is based on the accounting period which arose after 1st January, 1962.  If that is so, then I could partly understand it, but I am not quite clear on this why it is not in respect of any accounting period after 5th April, 1962, as apart from 1st January.  If a company had its corporation profits tax accounting year ending, shall we say, on 31st January, then it seems to me that on this it would go back to the year ending on 31st January, 1962 and, in addition to that, be taxed under this Resolution for the year ended 31st January, 1963, so that it would be caught on the double.  If it were merely up to 5th April, I could have appreciated it better.</P>

      <P>I am quite happy about that, but this goes back 15 months.  If it were going back only 12 months, I would have no objection.  It seems to me that by taking 1st January, the assessments for 1962-63 will be re-opened, because the assessments for 1962-63 were made in respect of income arising before 5th April, 1962. This goes back to 1st January, 1962.</P>
      <P>Apart from that am I right in thinking that the effect of this Resolution is to bring every business in the country into the corporation profits tax net?  As I see it, the effect of the Resolution is that the smallest company business will now have to pay corporation profits tax.  Corporation profits tax was regarded as, if you like, a privilege of the large companies. Now the smallest companies will have to pay corporation profits tax, as I understand paragraph (ii) on the top of Page 4.  Do I correctly understand that?  That seems most unjust and most unwise.  Whatever about the bigger companies, why bring the very small companies into the net?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this case to the Minister.  He is now proposing to extend the corporation profits tax to the limited liability companies whose total profits are below £2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="171" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, five per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of such companies are family concerns who have incorporated themselves for accounting convenience, and possibly for family arrangements in order to divide the proceeds of the company amongst several members of the family. Many companies are, in fact, retail distributing companies&mdash;shops in rural Ireland&mdash;and at the same time those companies are being very hard pressed in town and city by the invasion of the big British combines setting up supermarkets, and their only hope of survival is in some degree to re-equip themselves to provide self-service facilities in their shops.</P>
      <P>A firm whose total profit now is £2,000 per year will be asked under this Resolution to pay in addition to the income tax to which it is already liable, an additional sum of £100 a year.  I suggest to the Minister that he does not realise that he is taking from such firms the very narrow margin they have at present, and ought to employ to modernise their premises and bring them up to date in order to have a chance of surviving.  Small family businesses in this country are gradually being squeezed out of existence. I think that is a bad thing.  It is a bad thing that they should be forced to sell out to an amalgamation.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister is trying to catch in this Resolution. I cannot imagine he will get very much out of five per cent on companies earning less than £2,000 a year.  It will represent an average charge of £100 a year on these companies.  I suggest to the Minister that they are already making their contribution in income tax and that they are least fitted to bear this additional burden. This is the kind of straw that might break the camel's back.  I do not think it will produce much revenue for the Exchequer, and it will jeopardise very seriously a number of family concerns which are put to the pin of their collars to survive.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would look into the possibility of providing exemption from corporation profits tax in the case of a business whose total profit is less than £2,500. I cannot in conscience make a case that it will constitute an unbearable burden for the company whose profits substantially exceed £2,500 but it does, in my judgment, constitute a real menace to the survival of the small family business.  It should be quite possible administratively to say that where the total profit is less than £2,500, corporation profits tax will not apply.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  with effect on and from the 1st day of November, 1963, there <Col N="175" /> shall be charged a tax, to be called turnover tax, in respect of the sale of goods and the provision of services, within the State and in the course of business, and in respect of such other activities as may be specified in the Act giving effect to this Resolution;</P>
    <P>(b)  turnover tax shall be at the rate of two and one-half per cent or, in such circumstances as may be specified in or under the Act giving effect to this Resolution, at such lower rates as may be so specified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister devoted a lot of time to discussing the turnover tax.  Further explanations are due to us, particularly in view of what has been said by Deputies who spoke immediately after the Minister.  The Minister describes this tax as a turnover tax but no matter what fancy name it is given&mdash;sales tax, purchase tax, retail sales tax&mdash;it means in effect that there will be a tax paid on practically everything by the purchaser or consumer.  I think it is well it would be made abundantly clear now that while the evening newspapers have stated there is no new direct taxation or specific tax on cigarettes, tobacco or beer, in fact there is a tax imposed through this turnover tax.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to say whether or not this tax provides for circumstances in which taxes were abolished in the last two, three or four years on cinemas and dance-halls.  If we are to have regard to the list of exempted goods, this means that practically everything one can buy in any shop or store will be subject to this turnover tax of 6d. in the £.  We in this Party are concerned as to how the direct purchaser, the consumer, will fare because while the tax is described as being 2½ per cent, or 6d. in the £, we want to be assured by the Minister, if such an assurance is possible, that there will not be a certain amount of profiteering by those who sell the various commodities subject to this tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was posed to the <Col N="176" /> Minister as to what would happen in regard to the purchase of articles costing 1/- Naturally, the shopkeeper will charge something extra but it cannot be one-fortieth because we have no coinage of that sort.  It could be a farthing or a halfpenny.  I suspect that in cases like that the consumer will be asked to pay much more than what he would be expected to pay in accordance with the provisions of this Resolution.  This turnover tax is designed, so the Minister says, to get £3½ million in a matter of four or five months.  Accordingly, I assume that in a normal year it will get something like £8½ million to £9 million.</P>
    <P>Do we take it also from the Minister and the Government that this is to be a permanent form of taxation? It has been described by the Minister as being a modest tax at the present time, but it seems to me that if the same Government are in power next year, and they find themselves financially embarrassed, this 2½ per cent tax may go up to 5 per cent, 7½ per cent or even to 10 per cent.  Could the Minister say in his opinion, or from the advice he has got, what effect this tax will have on the cost of living index figure?  Has he calculated, or have his advisers calculated, what it will mean by way of increase in the cost of living?  Our main concern about this tax, which we oppose very strongly, is the effect it will have on the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When we have had the opportunity to calculate the effects of this tax we will find, despite what the newspapers say about there being no new direct taxation, that this means another penny on the glass of whiskey, a penny on the packet of cigarettes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;1½d. on the lb. of tea.  What is that if it is not a direct tax?  It means ld. on the lb. of butter, 1½d. on the gallon of petrol, and I seem to recall Fianna Fáil Deputies waxing most eloquent on the effects which an increase in the price of petrol would have on the entire community since it would involve increased transport costs and, consequently, <Col N="177" /> increases in the prices of commodities. We have heard talk about competitive reduction of prices to aid productivity and here we have 1½d. added to the price of petrol without a sigh from the Deputies over there.  This means in effect ld. to 1¼d. extra on cigarettes, 1d. to 1¼d. on the glass of whiskey, 1½d. per lb. on tea, 1½d. on the lb. of butter and so on.  The Minister for Transport and Power is fond of rolling out statistics as if from a drum.  I invite him to work out what 6d. in the £ means on the articles included in the cost of living index figure.  If he does that&mdash;he has had time in the past 24 hours since, presumably, he was told the details of the Budget&mdash;he will be able to tell us what percentage increase there will be in the cost of living as a result of this new tax once it comes into operation.  Is it not going to be more serious than perhaps a tax of ld. on cigarettes and ld. on the glass of whiskey because it will have a cumulative, snowball effect?  Will it not, in fact, mean that the licensed premises will come off worse than anybody else in any other business because they are also hit by the existing taxes, which, as I said already, have caused a reduction by one-sixth in the consumption of spirits and home-produced whiskey this year?  The Minister's Budget last year lowered consumption, and therefore profits, by one-sixth, and now they are being attacked in the corporation profit tax&mdash;the small businesses we spoke about&mdash;and will have to bear another 1¼d. on every glass of whiskey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because it is called a turnover tax does not make it any more pleasant to the person who must pay it.  It does not mean that it is not a tax on tobacco; it does not mean that it is not a tax on whiskey or beer, or even on the pint, which will be also hit, with petrol and distribution all along the line.  Fuel oils, about which we had such a song and dance some time ago, will suffer and so will every single thing one uses every day.  They all get this crack from the Minister.  Even the children going to school are affected; every time the child walks to school, he knows he is wearing out a pair of shoes and this tax will have to be borne when they are renewed.  The <Col N="178" /> Minister should have another look at this and not bring in a tax that will hit the everyday necessaries of life like this.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat confused and surprised by the interjection of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to suggest that the workers should welcome this Budget.  It is conceivable that one or other of us must misapprehend the position.  Would the Minister say whether it is a fact that the family on £10 a week will pay approximately 5/-a week in tax which in a year would amount to between £12 and £13?  If the family has an income of £8, out of which £4 a week is spent on food for the family, would this not amount to approximately £5 a year in increased tax on food alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the real nature of this tax.  Those of us who have some experience of legislation here have a vivid recollection of the distinction we have always made here between a hard tax and a soft tax.  It has been a good tradition in this House that if it were regarded as a necessity to increase taxation, we sought to suit the burden to the back that had to bear it.  I want to ask the House: if we are going to put 1½d. a lb. on tea, who is going to bear that burden?  Will it press heavily on the man with £2,000 a year or on the small farmer whose weekly income is something between £5 and £7 a week? Will it press heavily on the person whose income is so low as to make tea and bread and butter constitute the bulk of his diet?  What equity is there in levying a tax of 1½d. on tea when members of this House are peculiarly equipped to know the difference it makes to the different people in the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the officers of the Revenue Commissioners or the economists for putting forward the proposal that a flat turnover tax is the way to raise the revenue and to depress consumption.  Surely our function in this House, as representatives of the people, is to correct the statisticians' <Col N="179" /> approach or the bureaucrats' approach by our particular knowledge of the impact of legislation on the people we represent?  We have always regarded a tax on a food which constitutes a considerable part of the diet of the poorer people as a bad tax and in fact, since long before the war, we had ceased to levy taxes on tea and sugar, a favourite source of revenue 25 years ago.  We have abandoned them on the ground that they were not equitable taxes because they bore most heavily on those who could least afford them and that it was a statisticians' illusion to suggest that 1½d a lb. on tea meant the same to everyone who bought tea.  For some people, it was a material tax; for others, it was a microscopic matter for which they had no regard.  What we are doing in this motion is putting a tax of 1½d. a lb. on tea.</P>

      <P>When we come to wearing boots, that is another story, but I was talking of children's shoes&mdash;well, an extra shilling, I suppose.  These are the things that matter.  They do not matter to most people who are members of this House but matter very grievously to the people who will have to pay them.  They are the people we should think of, the people of whom statisticians are not allowed to think. <Col N="180" /> The statistician is preoccupied with the average man who does not exist. The only man who does not exist in any society is the average man but he is the obsession of the statisticians.  It is our job as politicians and members of this House to keep constantly present to our minds that there is no such person as the average man among all the different people who constitute the society for which we are responsible.</P>
      <P>If this Budget had been presented to the public as a Budget that put a 1d. on the packet of cigarettes, a 1d. on the lb. of bacon, a 1d. on the glass of whiskey, 1½d. on the gallon of petrol, 1d. on the lb. of butter, a 1/- on a pair of shoes, 1½d. on a lb. of tea and 1/-on a boy's suit and a tax on everything that the citizen has to pay, what would its reception have been in this House even among the daftest of our colleagues?  The new picture of legislation says to everybody in Erris, North Mayo, for example: &ldquo;Every time you go to the town to buy anything whether it be bread, shoes, clothes, a drink or anything else, every time you put your foot outside the door to do anything except to drive the cattle home, you will have to pay a tax.

      <P>Is it really proposed it is justice and equity to say to the people of a four-acre farm or on a ten-acre farm that they are being asked to pay no more on their food and clothes than a resident of Ballsbridge or Montenotte?  Do members of the Fianna Fáil Party know the nature of their own proposal?  Do they think it is right at this stage to levy not the figure mentioned most ingenuously in the Minister's speech as a yield of £3½ million turnover tax in this year without any corresponding calculation of what he expects to get from it in a full year? One of the reasons why he has elected to use the balance of £2 million in this year to bridge his deficit was because he looked forward to the full yield of this tax in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> This tax will yield between £8 million and £9 million.  The Government Party in this House are drifting into the state of mind that it is a source of joy to them if in this year they can squeeze only £3½ million out of the people but next year it will be £8 million or £9 million.  But who are you to squeeze it out of?  What is the merit of this tax from the point of view of the tax gatherer?  Its merit from his point of view is that everybody must pay it.  It is not confined to the well-to-do.  It is a tax which bears in equal vigour on everybody. But that, in my submission, is a tragic disparity of burden on those who have to pay it.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government are dead to all sense of responsibility?  Do they feel no obligation at all to try to meet the essential requirements of the public service without taxing tea, butter and the clothes that all our people wear?  I do not think anybody here today has made the slightest effort to defend an omnibus tax of this character and the burden it will throw on those who have to pay it.  Until the last ten minutes, I do not think anybody has adverted to the realisation of the fact that this turnover tax in effect means a 1½d. on a lb. of tea, 1s. on a pair of shoes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is an interesting reaction that the Minister for Finance who brings in this tax and informs the House it may be expected to yield £3½ million&mdash;without reference to the fact that if it is maintained it is calculated to raise £8 million or £9 million in a calendar year&mdash;should protest loudly that any Deputy of this House would proceed to examine the exact nature of the impact of this tax on the people who have to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would anyone tell me how any shopkeeper is to collect 2½ per cent on a loaf of bread?  The present price of a loaf of bread is something of the order of 8¼d.  I am thinking of those fancy loaves that have a farthing on them.  What will happen if he has to collect 2½ per cent?  How is the 2½ per cent to be collected by the tax gatherers, who will henceforth be the shopkeepers of this country?  I cannot help believing that if they are to recover this tax&mdash;which, of course, many of them will not be able to do but, in so far as they will&mdash;it must be <Col N="183" /> recovered in a way which will increase substantially the burden borne by the people who have to buy the goods.</P>
    <P>Can anyone tell me how you are to recover 2½ per cent on a reel of thread, on an ounce of wool, on a wide range of goods?  The Minister has told us how he suggests it should be done. &ldquo;Do not collect it,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;on the inessentials.  Sock it all on the essentials and they will have to pay that.&rdquo; Is that not so?  The Minister has pointed out that it is manifestly physically impossible to collect the tax on every individual item sold but that the Revenue Commissioners will collect it on total sales.  It is the shopkeeper's funeral how he will go about it and the way he should go about it is: do not try to collect it on the inessentials but make sure you collect it on the things people must buy.</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled to expect from the Minister an estimate of the effect of the imposition of this tax on the cost of living.  The cost of living figure at the present moment is the highest at which it ever stood since the State was founded.  The Minister must have a pretty accurate estimate of what change is likely to take place in the cost of living index as a result of the impact of this tax.  Before this Resolution is put to a division, the Minister has the duty to give us a far more detailed indication as to how the tax will be collected <i>in globo</i>.  Will it be levied on the essentials and remitted from the inessentials?  What effect will this tax have on the cost of living figure?  Last but not least, what is the effect of levying the same tax on the purchasers in Bangor Erris as is levied on the purchasers in the most well-to-do areas in Ireland?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended to have a tax on medicine and drugs?  How is it intended to collect tax on the sale of a bottle of milk, a quarter pound of tea, a loaf of bread and other commodities of that kind that are essential to poor people, old age pensioners, unemployed persons?  How is it intended to collect tax from the old age pensioners? Is Deputy Norton right when he suggests that it could result in a tax of 1/8d. in the £ instead of 6d. in the £?  If that is correct, does it not mean, in effect, that instead of getting an increase of 2/6d., they will get only 10d.?  In part of my constituency, there are six shops serving thousands of people, working-class people.  I would be more than anxious to ascertain how the sales tax will apply to them.</P>
      <P>When questions of this kind were asked earlier today and when Deputy Blowick was speaking, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance said there was an answer to them.  Deputy Noel Lemass interjected and said the answer was in the Minister's speech : &ldquo;Read the speech.&rdquo; There is nothing in the speech answering these questions and we are entitled to know the answers.  Has the Minister or anybody in his Department estimated the effects of this tax on the cost of living?  Is he satisfied it will not trigger off a ninth-round increase? I believe it will.  We are entitled to an explanation as to how this tax will be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a specific question somewhat similar to what has already been asked. One of the advantages of taxation as we knew it in the past was that when the Minister announced in the Budget a <Col N="185" /> change in the rate of tax on tobacco, on petrol, on beer or on spirits, he varied the tax according to recognised standards. The tax as changed, meant, say, a rise in the price of the pint, a rise of 1d. or 2d. on the packet of cigarettes, a rise in the price of petrol of so much a gallon.  In all these cases, it was clear to the consumer what actual change was imposed by the Budget and he knew in advance the appropriate change the retailer or wholesaler was entitled to make in prices.</P>
      <P>This sales tax alters the basis entirely because it imposes 6d. in the £ on each sale.  The Minister for Finance complained a moment ago about the unusual trend of this debate compared with other Budget debates but this is a very unusual tax.  I have here a list of the commodities included in the consumer price index.  The consumer price index includes not merely food items but a variety of other articles that are purchased by the public.  I do not intend to weary the House by reading this list but Deputies can see that there are almost three pages of commodities ranging from beef, meat, butter, bacon, ham, oatmeal, potatoes to flour and other articles of food; finally there are clothing, durable household articles, fuel and light.</P>
      <P>What the public are entitled to know is how much the retailer will be entitled to charge on each individual item.  Very many consumers do not buy all their commodities together.  If they did, it might be possible to share 6d. in the £ on the total bill but where commodities are bought as they are bought, in small quantities, where there is no specific rate of charge laid down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If so, is it in addition to the existing tax in respect of both course betting and betting in turf accountants' offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if <Col N="187" /> this tax should not be called an income tax on the poor.  It means that the farm worker earning £6 a week, who has to spend every penny of that on food, will now be required to pay on that £6 a tax of at least 3/- a week. From the Minister's speech here today, he expected we were going to discuss tomorrow or the next day, after the vote had been taken, a tax definitely aimed at people who at present cannot be caught by income tax because they are not receiving sufficient income.  It is a shameful thing that the Minister should attempt to introduce a tax of this kind.</P>
      <P>The question of whether or not it is one penny on a lb. of tea or three halfpennies on a gallon of petrol is something we can work out for ourselves. Deputy Dillon has repeated it so often, and rightly so, that we should all know what it is.  But is it not true what Deputy Norton said earlier, that the real cause of the trouble is that the shopkeepers down the country will be told at the end of each month that they must make a return of the amount of tax they collected on the goods they sold?  Is it not a fact that the Minister for Finance is saying to them: &ldquo;So long as you return the amount which represents sixpence in the £ for every £ worth of goods you have sold, it does not matter a damn what you have collected&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Have the Government departed completely from the principle that farmers are to be exempt from direct or indirect taxation?  Will fertilisers and seeds sold to farmers be exempt from this tax?  I cannot see that they are.  The only possible way fertilisers could be exempted would be to consider them as a capital investment by the farmer.  In his Budget the Minister is putting in fertiliser subsidy as a capital item.  Is he going to exempt the amount the farmer pays for fertilisers from this turnover tax? If not, on a ton of high grade fertiliser the farmer will have to pay a tax of 10/-.  On a barrel of seed, he will have to pay a tax of 3/-.  On an acre of grass seed, he will have to pay a tax of approximately 3/-.  I cannot see how the sale of beet pulp back to the <Col N="188" /> farmer is exempt.  Half a ton costs the farmer £20, and he is now liable to pay a tax of 10/- on the beet pulp he must feed to his cows?</P>

We will try to get this information, but it appears that we will not get it.  If these items are liable to tax, is it the position that a factory which buys raw materials for processing is not liable to this tax but the farmer who buys his seeds, fertiliser, machinery and so on for processing by using his land to produce the finished product is liable to be taxed on the purchase of his raw materials, even though he is not liable to the tax on the finished product?  I want to know is it an offence not to collect the tax on small priced items and is it an offence to collect more than the two and a half per cent.  These are things we must find out.</P>

It is well that Deputies supporting the Government should appreciate when they go into the lobbies&mdash;if the Minister returns to the House&mdash;what they are voting for. They are voting to impose a levy on the mother of the child whose footwear is being subsidised by the ratepayers of Cork and every other county.  Our experience in Cork has been, as Deputy Meaney knows, that the amount allocated for the footwear scheme has not been taken up because the parents have not been able to pay the increased amount demanded by the Department of Social Welfare.  In addition, the parents are now to be obliged to pay this levy of two and a half per cent.</P>

I want to know why the Taoiseach took himself to Limerick to announce this so far ahead of Budget time.  I want to know whether the Minister for Finance took these Budget &ldquo;leaks&rdquo; into account in estimating he would get only £3½ million for five months of this year.  He is aware of the fact that since the Taoiseach &ldquo;shot his mouth off&rdquo; in Limerick, every garage in the country has been flooded with orders for new motor cars, every electrical dealer has been flooded with orders for refrigerators, cookers and every type of equipment in order to jump the Minister's gun.  Because he is aware of the fact that every household will be stocked up for a considerable period, he is allowing only £3½ million income from the levies in this year.  But it must be made clear to those Deputies who intend to support the Minister, if they do intend to support him, that the figure for a year will not be a figure in the proportion of five months to £3½ million.  What will be the ultimate cost per annum in the levies it is proposed to exact from every member of the community on everything they eat, on every mile they travel, in respect of every single thing <Col N="190" /> they do, except that they can still dance without a tax.</P>

I want to know if the Minister will not be seriously affected regarding the inflow of the revenue he expects to get from this tax in view of the fact that the Government found it necessary to leak their intention about it prior to the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will support this Budget.  I contend that the real poor will profit from this Budget because they can only spend what they have to spend.  If an old age pensioner gets 35/- a week he can only spend 35/-. The 6d. in the £ will only cost him 10½d. and he will get back 2/6d.  He will have to hand out 10½d. because of this tax, but he will benefit to the tune of having an extra 1/7½d.  If an unemployed man gets only £3, he can only spend £3 which means 1/6d. in tax.  He is getting 2/6d. extra and he is also getting children's allowances, so, no matter how you take it, he is going to benefit by this Budget.  If a family man has £10 a week and young children, he can only spend that £10.  That will cost him 5/- in tax but he will get that back in increased children's allowances. It is only the people who can afford to pay extra who will be asked to contribute in order to provide this £8 million or £10 million.  The real poor will not lose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering, if this tax is to apply to the sale of newspapers on street corners, how it is to be levied.  Could the Minister tell me how he proposes to deal with the difficulties which health authorities will now find themselves in when, having already decided on their budgets, they find that these budgets are inflated as a result of the Minister's proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been customary in the past, prior to Budget day, to send to customs and excise officers throughout the State a sealed envelope containing these Financial Resolutions so that if increased taxes <Col N="192" /> are to be imposed immediately, they will take effect from the moment the Minister gets on his feet in the House to make his speech.  We were led to believe that there would be a purchase tax on motor cars but today no customs officer received a copy of these Resolutions and it was quite evident to all people in contact with these officers that there would be no motor car tax.  That is definitely a leak and perhaps the Minister would explain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate the number of extra civil servants who will have to be employed to enforce this tax?  Since the Minister has now turned the employer into a tax collector, will he let us know the number of inspectors that will be necessary for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to break the rule of having no speeches at this stage of the Financial Resolutions but it is hard to keep Fine Gael from their little bit of demagoguery if they get the chance at all.  They have done their best by asking questions that do not arise on this Resolution at all, but I wish to reply to the serious questions that have been put to me. I want to correct Deputy Corish.  This is not a five months tax.  It is only for four months.  It is for November, December, January and February, because the March tax will not be collected until that month has closed. I am calculating on £3½ million for the four months which would be £10½ million in the full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering the questions put to me and I do not want to be put out by the Deputy.  Deputies will have the next two or three weeks to discuss these matters and I am sure they will make some pretty long speeches on them.  If we take 2½ per cent of the national income, it works out at about £10 million a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain difficulties.  Deputy Barrett raised the question of the newspaper boy.  He gets his newspapers from the newspaper office and whatever they charge him, he knows what <Col N="193" /> to charge his customers.  That does not concern us.  I assume the newspapers will give him his papers at the same price.  Take the question of the bottle of milk.  If the farmer delivers the milk direct to the householder, there is no tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see how they will collect it.  This is a turnover tax. The retailer will pay tax on his turnover. It is for him to decide how he is going to recoup himself.  I am quite sure there is no retailer in this country, be he ever so poor, who will have the same mentality, the same, if you like, ridiculous mentality, as Deputy Dillon, to think that he must put one-fortieth on this or one-fortieth on that.  I am sure the retailers will be much more sensible than Deputy Dillon or the Fine Gael Party.  They will do their own business and they will do it in <Col N="194" /> a sensible way and not in the Fine Gael way, I hope.  The turnover tax will be there.  They know they have to pay it and they will decide how to recoup themselves.  I have been talking to retailers because a lot of retailers thought this was coming.  I was talking to one to-day and he said that as far as he was concerned, it was not going to cost very much.  We do not oblige him to say that he must add 2½ per cent to everything.  He can recoup himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I admire the simplicity of Fine Gael.  The simplicity of their minds surprises me.  He will probably increase the price of some items and not of others.  Deputy Dillon will agree with me on this, I think, that the retailer now is in a very competitive position and he will not be allowed, if he wants to stay in business, to put up prices more than he has to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Norton <Col N="195" /> spoke about the person getting £10 a week.  If the man earning £10 a week spends £10 a week, as I suppose he does, if he does not save any of it, he will contribute 5/- a week.  If he has children, he will get back part of that. I do not know if any Deputy referred to what the children's allowances are. The increase is 1/- or a little bit more, but take it at 1/- a week, and the man with £10 and with two or three children&mdash;surely no Deputy will claim he is spending more than £2 a week on them; he could not afford to have them if he was&mdash;will be recouped by 1/-.  He is all right as far as his children are concerned but it will undoubtedly cost him something for himself and his wife.  If it did not cost somebody something, we would not get anything out of it.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to make provision, in the interests of the common good, for the proper planning and development of cities, towns and other areas, whether urban or rural (including the preservation and improvement of the amenities thereof), to make certain provisions with respect to acquisition of land, to repeal the Town and Regional Planning Acts, 1934 and 1939, and certain other enactments and to make provision for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2) and substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) This Act shall come into operation as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  this section shall come into operation on the passing of this Act,</P>
      <P>(b)  sections 84, 85 and 86 and subsection (5) of section 89 shall come into operation on the day fixed for that purpose by the Minister for Local Government by order,</P>
      <P>(c)  if an order is made under paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of this section, the rest of this Act shall come into operation on the day appointed by that order,</P>
      <P>(d)  if an order is not made under paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of this section, the rest of this Act shall come into operation in an area on the day appointed with respect to that area by order made under paragraph (b) of that subsection.</P>
      <P>(3) The Minister for Local Government&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  may by order appoint a day to be the day appointed under this Act, or</P>
      <P>(b)  may by orders appoint two or more different days to be, with respect to different areas respectively, the days appointed under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to enable the Act to be brought into operation in stages, and possibly on different dates.  I can visualise, for instance, the Act being brought in on one date for the city of Dublin, and possibly in counties which up to the moment have not had any planning control in operation, it might be that we would consider  <Col N="201" /> it desirable to bring it into operation on a different date for reasons that might have to do with administrative or technical personnel. The amendment is intended to enable us to do that rather than under the Bill as it now stands bringing it into operation on the one day for the entire country.  The purpose of the amendment is to enable the Minister, if circumstances so warrant or demand, to bring it in stages, and to apply it to different parts of the country on different days, to be appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is agreement to take amendments Nos. I and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, one is a corollary of the other. I am glad this amendment has been put down by the Minister. When speaking on Second Reading I think I mentioned the fact that this was an urban as well as a rural Bill, or at least it should be an urban as well as a rural Bill, affecting not one area but two distinct areas. I said we had two distinct problems, one a peculiarly urban one.  Dublin is preeminently an urban problem, much more pressing than an area like Cork where you have the next largest concentration of population, or the other large centres like Limerick, Waterford and elsewhere.  In the light of the experience gained in operating the Act in Dublin the other areas could benefit considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of so delaying the application of the provisions of this Bill to the country at large would be to give the local authorities throughout the country an opportunity of assessing the problem with which they will be faced in the light of experience gained in Dublin because now, with the passage of this Bill, each local authority will be under notice to carry out certain developments in their areas. It will be necessary for them to appoint planning consultants and decisions will have to be taken in regard to the broad outlines of a plan within each urban and rural area.  The fact that the Bill can be implemented in stages throughout the different areas in the country would have that advantage. For that reason I think the application of this legislation by stages throughout the <Col N="202" /> country, instead of bringing it in at once everywhere, is an improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I wish to express my agreement with the Minister's amendment.  When I spoke on this matter before, I went so far as to suggest that the Minister might even consider introducing a Bill in the first instance to deal with Dublin alone as it was a tremendous problem to try to provide legislation of this nature and carry it through in respect of the whole country in one fell swoop.  It presents a difficult administrative problem, and a financial problem which I do not think anybody at the moment is capable of calculating. It would be largely guesswork to calculate what all this will cost, so the Minister is being administratively prudent and financially prudent in bringing it into operation in stages. In certain areas officials will be better able to cope with the problems than in others and the element of urgency enters into the matter far more as far as Dublin and Cork are concerned than in my constituency and in most other rural areas.</P>
      <P>I should like, however, to have an assurance from the Minister that when he names a day for the operation of this legislation in a particular area he will give full consideration to representations from the local authority in that area.  What I mean is that he should hear representations not only from the so-called authority &mdash;the officials or the manager&mdash; but that he would be prepared to listen to representations from the councils and, if necessary, receive deputations if the council members foresaw difficulties or if there were differences of opinion between themselves and the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get it quite clear from the Minister that his amendment means that if the city of Dublin, which has already adopted the old Town Planning Act and certain limited controls, is itself ready to proceed under this Bill when it becomes law that Dublin would not necessarily be held up in proceeding with development when other areas may not yet be ready to begin.  What I am seeking is an assurance that areas which have <Col N="203" /> adopted the previous Act and which are ready would not be precluded from beginning their operations simply because other areas are not ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is specifically the reason for this amendment and, in addition, to facilitate local authorities that might be ready to go ahead because of their work in the past, their knowledge and their staff arrangements. It is also vital that areas which did not opt to operate the old Act, and have, therefore, no planning controls whatever, should be brought in under this Bill at the earliest possible moment.  The difficulties of local authorities is one of the factors which moved me to bring in this amendment. Places which already have controls, and which are, therefore, ready, could be allowed to go ahead and other places where there are no controls would be brought under the umbrella of the legislation as soon as possible.  That is the object we have in mind when we talk about bringing in different places at different times.  As Deputy Hogan suggested, views expressed by the local authorities, by both council and officials, will undoubtedly be given full consideration by my Department and myself before we bring in a county, town or area.  I should point out, however, that we do not intend to allow a large number of years to elapse between the operation of the legislation in the first areas and its operation in other areas throughout the country.  We shall, of course, take due cognisance of the difficulties existing in the different areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As Cork has been mentioned, I should like to know if Cork means the area within the jurisdiction of the Cork Corporation or if it includes the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It means the county borough area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the necessity for local authorities to have proper consultants.  I do not know whether the supply of consultants is sufficient to go around, but I take it the Minister will take heed <Col N="204" /> of what Deputy Hogan suggested&mdash; that there should be consultations between his Department and the interests concerned.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of Cork, the problem of all cities is the fact that they are growing into the county areas. We have in this Bill areas contiguous to others and the interests of the County of Cork would be affected by any growth of the City of Cork.  If Cork City were brought in on planning at an early stage it would mean that the people with responsibility for Cork would have to plan for its growth because these areas are growing outwards. In Dublin there is the proposal for renewed building in a large central area but in the large provincial areas the growth is into the countryside and they are spreading over their own boundaries at present.  Therefore, I take it they would be affected by the Planning Acts as they are.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that in this matter there would be consultation in regard to the appointment of advisers for the planning of these things technically in an efficient way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as that aspect of the matter is concerned the House is probably aware that we already have under way, with great assistance from Dublin Vocational Educational Committee, a training course open to, and intended for, serving engineers and architects of local authorities on the subject of town planning with a view to giving them co-operation and assistance and enabling them to do their job better in the counties from which they are drawn.  In addition, we have had a series of appreciation lectures and we hope to follow with more of a similar, or even a more advanced, nature in the near future.  My Department hope to be able to assist local authorities in various ways as time goes on and as technical personnel are available.  We hope to be very helpful to local authorities who may be shorthanded in respect of expert knowledge in the matter of planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want read into this amendment more than is intended or any suggestion that because of the amendment my mind has changed in any <Col N="205" /> way about the application of the Bill if it becomes an Act to the country as a whole as soon as possible.  There is no change of mind in that respect and this is merely to facilitate the easy introduction of it in stages.  Regard will be had where necessary to any difficulty arising for the local authority that may find that the impending date will be too soon for them for any reason.  We shall take cognisance of that and give due weight to any consideration put forward and we shall probably be able to help in finding solutions to local authorities' difficulties. The overall idea is to get this going as soon as possible even though it may not start everywhere on the same day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister one question?  In connection with these courses we realise that the county or city manager is solely responsible for staff. May the managers select a certain individual on the staff without discussion with any member on the council and send him up for this course without informing the council or corporation whether such a person holds the qualifications suitable for this course?  Also, who is paying for the attendance of the official&mdash;not that I am objecting&mdash;in Dublin for a long course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The county council pays the subsistence of the person sent forward.  By and large, this would be a staff matter and as such, it is the manager who would determine who should attend.  On his return, the assignment of the person who attended the course would be a matter for the manager and he would be a very foolish manager if he did not send the appropriate person to the course.  He would be asking for trouble later on and would not be helping himself or his local authority.  I should imagine that any manager in these matters would be largely guided by the advice of his county engineer who would have the knowledge to say who on his staff was working in some capacity related to town planning or showed some aptitude in that direction.  I imagine the advice of the county engineer would be sought and considered, <Col N="206" /> if not acted on, by most managers.  There will be another course in the following year and it may well be that a manager would send an individual this year knowing that another could go next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual to consult the various committees, vocational and otherwise, if a member of the staff is being offered the advantage of attending a course and for this matter to come before the local body to ascertain if they are in favour of a certain official attending.  That has become the practice.  Has that happened in this case?  I am not questioning any particular county manager but there is a principle involved and I am afraid that city managers might select certain officials and send them forward without adverting to this principle and without asking the views of the members on the matter, especially as there is expenditure of money involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot add to what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to call anything in question myself but since there is expenditure involved, does that not leave it open to the members if they wish to do so, to question the manager in regard to the selection of a person to attend the course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that the local aspect of questioning the manager would apply just as in regard to other action the manager might take involving the council, its finances or staff. I think it is a matter for the manager and he would be foolish to send the least appropriate man to the course. Although it does not alter the objection that might be raised I should say that part of the salary of the engineer or architect attending the course is paid by the county sending him and the other part by arrangement with Dublin Corporation who have been kind enough to employ these officials on actual town planning work while they are at the same time attending the course.  In that way it has been possible to operate this scheme at much less cost, about half the cost, that would otherwise have to be borne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> This is a staff matter and, by and large, one for the manager and I do not think I can go beyond that. Certainly, any member of a local authority will not be debarred from inquiring and kicking up a row if he thinks something wrong is being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> In my area a man was sent forward last autumn and the matter did not come before the local body until an item appeared in the Estimates at the rates meeting when the expenses had to be submitted.  We were then presented with the position that if we did not want to pay we could recall the man.  I think that was a wrong way of doing business.  How do the local body stand who find themselves with an officer of that sort?  If the officer is back after being trained at the expense of the local body he is still a free man and can offer his services somewhere else.  How does the local body stand after spending money on him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If only one local body spent money on him it would be quite foolish to train a man for every other local authority.  The pool is much too small at the moment for our needs. Local authorities have been urged to avail themselves of this course as soon as possible and this course has been set up since before Christmas.  What would be one county's loss in the case cited as possibly arising by Deputy Hogan would be another county's gain. Likewise, it could be Tipperary's case to gain rather than to lose.  They might get someone who attended this course and get two rather than one: also, they could finish up with none. We want to try as fast as we can to enlarge the pool of qualified town planners, engineers or architects with a certain rudimentary knowledge of planning in order to get ourselves off the ground as soon as possible.  I agree there may be losses and gains but if you take it all over the country you will agree that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned the question of Cork boundary &mdash;the city as distinct from the county. The Minister may say: &ldquo;Bring in Cork on a certain day&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bring in Limerick on a certain day&rdquo; or anywhere else.  Within the past year there was a movement in Cork, say, to extend the borough boundary.  Take the same kind of intention and move, for example, in Limerick.  Would it be the Minister's intention to bring in the area adjacent in Cork and Cork County and in Limerick and Limerick County?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in relation to the county and city of Cork.  In Waterford we have a difficulty because we have in existence the Borough of Waterford and on the north side we shall be extending into Kilkenny.  Waterford people and Kilkenny people are reasonably friendly and a lot of Kilkenny people live in Waterford.  There is great rivalry <Col N="209" /> between Waterford and Kilkenny.  A few years ago we endeavoured to extend the borough into Kilkenny and we had a famous Kilkenny hurling county council saying: &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo;. Therefore, you see the borders exist in our own bailiwick as well as they do up, say, around the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond raised a point about a manager appointing an officer to come to Dublin and the council being told about it a month or two afterwards.  That is always a matter of friction between a manager and his council.  The Minister said the manager would only be looking for trouble to do such a thing but some managers do it.  The managers are in charge of the staff.  However, it is a matter of ordinary common courtesy, and I think it should be done, that when the manager appears before the county council he should say: &ldquo;it is my intention, gentlemen, to send Mr. So-and-So to Dublin for this town planning course&rdquo; and talk to the council about it.  That is the kind of thing to put into legislation.  It will take away a lot of friction which occurs between managers and elected councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not take too much notice of that suggestion.  We in the city of Dublin, in our council, have a manager. Fortunately, we get on well with the manager.  We recognise, first of all, that he is in complete control of the staff.  You might as well say, if we were to follow the line that has just been suggested, that he should not have the right to move an officer from one section to another without consulting the council.  Where he does consult the council is if there is a matter of increased expenditure or the appointment of an official which would mean an additional expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that everything works smoothly in our City of Dublin because we mind our business and we expect the manager to mind his business. One of the essential parts of the business is to have complete and absolute control of the staff and we have nothing to say about them whatsoever. If the manager wants to increase their remuneration, however, <Col N="210" /> he comes to us and makes a case for recommending increased remuneration or if he wants to add a number of officials to a particular section he then comes and asks the council to approve of this additional number being engaged because it involves additional expenditure.</P>
    <P>I would certainly hope that the Minister&mdash;I have not waited for him to reply&mdash;would not include in any legislation the suggestions made by the Deputy who has just spoken because that would only bring chaos.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The state of affairs that exists in Dublin city might be all right ar far as Deputy Briscoe is concerned. I have no doubt it is all right. Surely, however, it would not be chaos for a manager to do what the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee does when he appears, as Deputy Desmond said, before the committee and says: &ldquo;Gentlemen, it is my intention to send Professor or Dr. So-and-So to the University in Cork or Dublin or to the Gaeltacht or to such and such a place for a course&rdquo; and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it costs money.  That is why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <P>As it is, Dublin Corporation will not be sending these officers anywhere.  They are here in Dublin.  The Dublin Corporation are kind enough to employ the officers who will be sent up.  Therefore, I do not think it will create anything like chaos. However, it will create an awful lot of goodwill if the managers come to their various councils and notify the councils and say: &ldquo;It is my intention to send Mr. So-and-So to such and such a place.&rdquo;  In 99 cases out of 100, Mr. So-and-So will be sent without a word.  What annoys the council is to hear about it for the first time maybe two or three months later or to read about it in the newspaper or when <Col N="211" /> somebody comes along and says: &ldquo;I believe you sent the county engineer or the assistant county engineer to such a place.  Why did you do it?&rdquo;  It is a matter of courtesy that the council should be informed by the manager and it should be done.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I wish to correct the impression Deputy Briscoe has given.  He said a manager has no obligation to bring these matters before a local body unless it involves increased expenditure.  Whatever about what is paid to the man who is sent on a course, he has to be replaced and increased expenditure is, therefore, involved.  Therefore, the matter should receive the attention of the council beforehand.  Secondly, apart altogether from expenditure, it is bad public relations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 5, line 35, to delete &ldquo;announcement or direction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the inclusion of the words &ldquo;announcement or direction,&rdquo; the provision could be applied very widely. A public authority might decide to make an announcement that there was an outbreak of disease in a particular area, an epidemics and that could be taken to be an advertisement within the terms of this section.  I am not using levity when I suggest that the wideness of the scope of the provision could include notices like &ldquo;attested area.&rdquo;  There is also the question of &ldquo;direction.&rdquo;  A local group might put up a notice pointing in a certain direction to a bazaar which was being run for a charitable purpose.  The section as it stands is much too wide.  An advertisement in the accepted sense ought to mean something which was used for the purpose of advertising by whatever method is used, model, balloon or poster.  That is wide enough.  It is unwise to write into the Bill something which could be misconstrued at a later stage.  That is <Col N="212" /> something we ought to avoid in legislation.</P>

      <P>Under Section 4, subsection (2), there is power being taken, if approved by the House, to make regulations exempting from the provisions of Section 2 certain signs such as those outlined by the Deputy; in fact, the three or four he enumerated would clearly come within what we intend to exempt from the terms of Section 2 and we believe it is the only way to do it, not to leave it as wide open as the Deputy's amendment would make it.  This will enable the legitimate and necessary signs and directions to be used.  It is quite conceivable that if the amendment were conceded, there would be advertisements formulated as announcements or directions.  There would still be advertisements which should not be allowed but, which by the very form in which they were phrased, could get by the law.  What we are doing is closing the door and then allowing the exceptions through by way of regulations under subsection (2) of Section 4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition as it stands is much too wide.  It could mean that a man whose house had been plastered 25 years ago would be prohibited from plastering the gable end of his house, without seeking permission, because some official thought it was inconsistent with the pattern of the houses round about that house. The type of plastering he might propose to do might be different from that of the houses round about.  There will always be forward thought in regard to these matters.  It is a good thing for the march of progress that advances in different types of plastering are applied.  Surely it is inconsistent that we should prevent a man from doing such a job on his own house unless he gets permission from an official, who might say to him: &ldquo;This would be inconsistent with the other houses around about; it would change the character of the house and <Col N="214" /> bring it out of line with neighbouring structures&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>The work carried out by such an individual might be the start of a series of improvements.  Even if it were inconsistent with the neighbouring houses, it might well be that others would think the improvement of such a nature that they would follow what had been done.  For that reason, we think that the provision concerning an &ldquo;alteration, which includes plastering and painting ...&rdquo; is extending the scope of the restriction too far and taking away from the individual a right which people traditionally have had&mdash;the right to be different from somebody else&mdash;and which has been exercised by people all the time.</P>
      <P>Within the recent past, visitors to this country have commented on the fact that the Irish are afraid of innovations in the matter of colour.  One of the things much sought after in this country in the design and treatment of buildings is that there should be the type of variation which actually removes uniformity and makes the thing more beautiful.  A new type of plastering could indeed be something like that.  When in other countries the type of plastering known as stucco was indulged in, it was quite new and different.  At that time it was a complete innovation.  Even within recent times, a new type of dash has been used on houses.  To decide now that an individual may not treat his house in that way without seeking the approval of an official is going too far. For that reason, I move the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jones seems to abhor the suggestion that an official should have to be consulted before a man may carry out necessary repairs to his house by way of plastering.  Yet how many of these people fail to come along voluntarily to seek an inspector of the Department to vet their work in order to get a grant?  What is wrong with an inspector from their local authority coming along to vet what they propose to do, to see whether or not it might be improved by suggestion, or whether the work would not seriously damage the adjoining <Col N="215" /> houses?  The adjoining householders have their rights.  Take the Georgian houses we hear so much about.  Not so long ago, and not more than 100 yards from here, one of those houses in the centre of a long terrace of Georgian houses was plastered.  In the minds of the people interested in Georgian houses, that was the last straw.  Yet it happened not 100 yards from here.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I am inclined to agree with Deputy Jones that a proposal to do up a house by plastering or repairing it in a general way and not making a major operation out of it can have the effect of persuading others to follow.  But what is wrong with going to the local authority, seeing that the work is worth while and good from every point of view?  If they come along with such a proposal, they will get approval.  The job will then be done with the authority of the local body and with the benefit of the advice of their officials.  Others may then follow suit and do their job to conform with the change.  Far from its being any obstruction to them, householders who consult their local authority may receive definite assistance from them, which may enable them to do the job even better than they originally proposed.  They may be advised that they are not doing it the right way, that their house may look a bit out of line or something like that.  I can see no reason whatever for exempting these things from securing the permission of the local authority. Great damage can be caused by certain repairs which may be termed necessary repairs, but which, in the manner in which they are carried out, may result in injury not only to the house itself but to the surrounding houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed by this amendment that the alteration of the external appearance of a structure be exempted.  Surely the Deputy will agree that to allow the alteration of a house, particularly in a built-up area, at the whim and fancy of the owner at a particular time would be tantamount to scrapping any thought we had of planning control.  If we look at this <Col N="216" /> in its proper light, we will see it is not an unfair imposition.  If this amendment were carried, an applicant who had been forced to change the appearance of the structure by the verdict of the court could later on alter it back to the original form.  In that way, we would have a complete negation of the terms under which an applicant must apply to build a new structure.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Deputy to consider the matter in that light and not solely on the basis that doing a necessary repair job is something everybody should be encouraged to to. I agree wholeheartedly they should be encouraged to do necessary repairs. In 99 cases out of a hundred, it is as easy, and very often no more costly, to do the necessary repairs by having regard to the amenities of the area generally and particularly to those of the people living next door.  It does not follow at all that because he may have to get permission, it will cost more or that it will have to be done in a way he does not like.  In 999 out of 1,000 cases of such repair jobs, there is no hesitation in applying for a grant and about having an inspector down from the Department and another from the local council.  Most of the complaints we receive are that the inspectors do not come quickly enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like this arrangement of having to ask the local authority for permission to do every small bit of work that has to be done. Take the case of a plasterer in some scheme or other who is free from his own job for a couple of days.  Another man has a job to be done and that plasterer could do it in the couple of days he has to spare but it would take a month to get permission to have the work done.  The doing of the work depends on the availability of inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think it is all wrong that the local authority should be regarded as the sole judge of a colour scheme for a man's house.  Surely we are carrying things too far if we are to put a local authority in the position of telling a man that he must paint his house such <Col N="217" /> and such a colour.  If we do that, we will leave people in the position that they cannot turn in their own houses and cannot have a flower box if the local authority does not want it.  This provision is wide open to that sort of thing.  I think it is entirely wrong to say that a man cannot alter the colour scheme of his house without having to go to the local authority and tell them that they have to be the judge of it, that he knows nothing about it, although he may know ten times as much as anybody in the local authority.</P>

      <P>When the official comes back after having gone through this course here in Dublin and finds a house under his jurisdiction the painting and plastering of which he believes is not right, can he then cause the owner to change it? I am speaking about a job that has already been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing which should be said about this matter, and which appears to have been overlooked, is that these plastering and painting jobs come into question only when they largely alter the external appearance of the house.  Deputy Clinton has made a point that the man who owns the house and who has to live in it is the best judge but I do not agree that this is always the case. Certainly he should have a very big say in it and if he does not want to do it, he cannot be compelled to paint it in any particular colour.  What may actually happen is that some outlandish decoration, and these are not entirely unknown, may be proposed.  It is to prevent anything like that that this provision is in the Bill.  We are not prepared to allow a man to do these outlandish alterations, if they are going to alter the appearance of the whole place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the alteration proposed is not going to be an eyesore to your neighbours or to other people, then the outlook of the local authority or the planning authority will be far less stringent, but if a man proposes to do his house up in colours that will blind the people next door and the general public, then it will not be allowed.  People coming home late at night or early in the morning may see enough things without <Col N="218" /> seeing a colour scheme of that nature.  There are certain of these things that have to be prevented and it is to have control over them that we have this provision in the Bill.</P>

I know the house to which Deputy Desmond refers.  There is colour in it and care has been taken in the way these shells or pebbles are arranged on it. It is a place to which CIE take foreign visitors to see because there is evidence of a great deal of hard work by somebody.

If I were in one of these houses which had been painted this sickly yellow and a friend advised me to paint the house another colour, a man with artistic taste who pointed out that it would brighten the house and would be good for the district generally, it should be my privilege to do so.  If I do not like the existing colour, I should be privileged to change it.  I am not talking about changing the structure of the house but about the painting of it.  I agree with Deputy Barry that we have a number of houses all over the country the colour schemes of which are repulsive.  Take the Tidy Towns Competetion.

I know it is essential to prevent the fellow who is going to paint his house red, green, blue and yellow and destroy the appearance of the district.  I know that this has to be put in the Bill to prevent the people from being completely outlandish.  Has the Minister's Department received any complaints about outlandish colours here and there?  I know of some houses in which I would not like to live because of their colour schemes but it would be useful if there were an official who could be called upon, an artist or some man who could give advice to the local authority on what colour houses should be painted so that they would brighten and blend in with the district.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak until I heard the Minister's comments on the amendment.  I am beginning to wonder how crazy can we get in regard to this question of regimentation? I am going to give an <Col N="222" /> example to the Minister of an experience I have had in my local authority area.  It is indisputable that the local authority has power to direct tenants of local authority houses as to the colour scheme used in painting houses. A tenant of such a house has no discretion in the matter.  In Roscommon, the tenant of a house in a terrace was a painter and being a man of initiative who had a few spare days, he bought paint and proceeded to paint his own house.  He was in the act of doing it when he was stopped by the busybody local officials.  I had to go to the county manager who took it upon himself to act as, shall we say, a specialist as to what was the right colour or otherwise.  He told me that although he personally liked the colour chosen by the tenant, it was a brighter shade of red than the shade on the adjoining houses.  The front doors and windows of the adjoining houses had not been painted in the previous 12 months.  The outcome was that that skilled painter was prevented from painting his own house.  Now we are going to extend that power to allow these same officials, who are described as experts, to prevent the citizen who is not living in a local authority house from painting his house whatever colour he may desire.  How crazy can we get?  Are we paying people to sit in back rooms in Dublin to plan all sorts of ways of tying up the individual?</P>
      <P>I am described here as a person who wants to see social changes and to see the State interfering.  I want to see the State interfering to ensure that people have a chance to live in Ireland. Here we have tools of private enterprise trying to regiment the people as to the colour they will use on their houses while, as far as accepting responsibility for giving employment at home is concerned, they are indifferent to the fact that people have to leave Ireland.</P>
      <P>If we look at any row of houses for which local authorities are responsible, regimentation is apparent.  Some of them have the appearance of the inside walls of a jail.  If a tenant puts a bit of colour into a house on a terrace, he may be penalised for so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" /> The authority is there.  No matter how amiable officials may be individually, when they act as a body they create fuss.  They have to set up some kind of trouble to justify their existence. Personally, I do not accept that they are experts in the matter of painting. I am sure many Deputies read the description of modern paintings last week by a famous statesman&mdash;work done by a donkey with a stick tied to his tail.  I would not agree with that description.  If a modern artist produces something new, it may be the product of his generation; it may be an expression of his discontent in existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dunne has pointed out, because a person has a completely novel approach to the painting or decoration of his house, are we to have that person described privately as being cuckoo?  That is how he will be described by people who regard themselves as experts in a particular field.  They may be experts for five years.  Nobody is going to suggest that they will be thereafter.  Nobody can say that in ten years time people in this country will not be living in circular houses.  We do not know.  I do not fancy the idea but I do not know what somebody 15 or twenty years younger than I am might think of it. The people who will decide to hamstring anybody with progressive ideas are those who will have power given to them by this House.  They will not be young people; they will be conservative people who will wield the power.</P>
    <P>Unless it is absolutely essential to write this power into legislation, the Minister, who is a man with tons of commonsense, should not provide a weapon for those who are less broadminded than he and who may suffer from ulcers or distortions of mind and allow them to take that out on the public by preventing a lighthearted approach to the painting of a house by any citizen.</P>

There are some badly painted publichouses.  The owners, in many cases, are very staunch supporters of Deputy Burke.  I have to commend the Deputy for being always on the ball.</P>

      <P>It is not to warn the Minister of the danger he is in of treading on the corns of Deputy Burke's supporters that I intervened. The matter with which I am concerned is a little gem of a church.  The people responsible for it plastered that church. There are many people who say that that should not have been done.  There are many others who say that it saved it.  I shall not enter into that controversy. But it is one of the dangers the Minister might find himself in that he might have one of his officials making a decision that this Pugin gem was destroyed and an order would be sent to the parish priest to have him hack off his plaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This might look as if I were justifying what the Minister has put into the Bill.  The objection I have to this alteration including plastering or painting <Col N="225" /> is that it is just another bit of bureaucracy gone mad.  That is the tendency.  Deputy McQuillan put his finger on it.  Here we are turning power over to the State as to what colour a man will paint his house.  We have seen cases in Dublin in days gone by of whole streets being painted the same colour.  That is regimentation.  This Bill ensures that that will continue.  Somebody in a council office may say: &ldquo;We can get a whole lot of cheap red oxide and we will use that.&rdquo;  The houses will look dreadful.  There may be some faded yellow paint or some dreadful pink that might be available at a cheap rate.  County councils buy their paints through the central purchasing organisation.  Paint will be bought in bulk and will be sent out and whole schemes will be ruined.</P>
    <P>This section would destroy initiative on the part of tenants of council houses.  I will admit that someone is bound to make what might be a mistake, in my opinion, in the Minister's opinion or in the opinion of the experts, but it might not be such a mistake after all because, so far as painting is concerned, it is very hard for anyone to say what is right.  I consider that it should be left to the individual to say what is right for himself.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest collections of paintings that was ever made was made by an Irishman.  When that collection was offered to the city of Dublin, it would not be accepted because a place would not be built for it.  It was said to be a collection of daubs, and that it would result in putting up the rates. People woke up when the British had the collection.</P>

      <P>I have often had <Col N="226" /> clashes with the Minister but I will not bring this debate down to the level of the Minister for Transport and Power.  The Minister should accept this amendment.  We want to safeguard the rights of a private citizen to paint his house the way he likes it.  The ordinary private citizen will have to face a more severe critic than the Department, the Minister, or the local authority.  He has to face his neighbour, and if he paints his house some outrageous colour, he will be told about it in the local pub, or his wife will be told about it in the local shop. I think the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The trend of the debate has been to refer to external decoration, and particularly external painting.  I would be inclined to agree with Deputy Lynch that if a man were to go off the rails in regard to a colour scheme, his neighbours would bring him back on to them in a very short time.  There is the other aspect of plastering.  Nowadays the tendency in modern buildings is to have a rough cast finish.  Going through the countryside, we see that the local authorities often decide to plaster the outside of cottages, originally built of good stone, by good tradesmen, and intended to be painted.  It is a pity that work of that kind should be covered by plaster. If a cottier or a business man or anyone else decides to dash his house, we should try to influence him against doing so.</P>
      <P>Tradesmen are scarce and stonemasons are scarce.  I do not believe there are many in the country who could build houses like the houses put up 40 or 50 years ago.  There is a tendency to use stone work on our public and private buildings and we should try to preserve that, if at all possible.  The same applies to brickwork. I do not think one could ever get tired of looking at good stone or brickwork, and it is a pity to see it destroyed by plastering.  If this section preserves that type of building, I am in favour of it, although I do not like the idea of forcing people to go to the local authority for permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to external decoration, the <Col N="227" /> Minister's inspectors, in dealing with reconstruction grants, can play a very important part, and they can influence people in the right direction.  People may think that plastering eliminates dampness, but I believe that no amount of plastering will cure dampness.  It is a pity that so many fine stone and brick houses are spoiled by the application of plaster.</P>

      <P>I feel very strongly that this is a very objectionable subsection. I have a definite impression that it will prevent the carrying out of many small improvements which can mean so much, and which are so desirable.  I know quite a number of people do this type of work when the spirit moves them, and if they cannot do it when they get the idea, if something intervenes, it is never done.  If they have to put it on the long finger, that is the end of it.  Perhaps it gives an excuse to a reluctant husband for failing to make the improvements his wife thinks should be made now and again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something sacred about a man's home.  He builds his personality into the house, and I believe he is entitled to make his home what he thinks it should be, and not what someone else thinks it should be.  It is most undesirable that anyone should have the right to say to a man: &ldquo;Your house must be a certain colour.&rdquo;  That would be enough to drive a man to drink, or to drive his wife and family to drink, because some people have a definite objection to certain colours. <Col N="228" /> They have very definite views about colours, and they are entitled to have these definite views.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about artists. I have seen pictures which I am sure were painted by very good artists, but they gave me no pleasure.  In fact, I disliked them.  I believe people have the right to dislike certain colours.  If the local authorities are to have the right to decide on colour schemes, I think we are going further than we should go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in reply to the point I originally raised, referred to the fact that people repairing or painting their houses have to seek permission for grants from the local authority anyway at the present time and that this provision would not matter because of that.  A great many people do jobs on their houses and never apply for grants and this question of interference with their neighbours and insisting on a pattern need not worry the Minister.  It is a very good job that modern artists were not bound by the Italian or Flemish schools of art where you have so much conformity. I read in an American magazine where the modern artists in cubism are now held up as people of wide judgment and great artistic appreciation.</P>
      <P>In this section our purpose is to take away individualism in decoration and renovation.  The Minister knows that with the amount of reconstruction going on, there will be considerable delay if every person who intends plastering his house has to give notice to the local authority who, in turn, must send out an engineer to inspect the premises to see that it is in conformity with the surrounding area. That is reducing reality to fantasy. People anxious to renovate their houses will have to await permission for so long that they may decide not to do the work at all, that it is not worth doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most houses in the countryside are now getting new faces and a great number of the people responsible never apply for grants.  Where an individual does not apply&mdash;remember, we are now <Col N="229" /> legislating for something that will apply to the country at large, something that will be spread over the length and breadth of the country&mdash; there should be the right of the individual to plaster or paint his own house. I do not know whether the Minister has given thought to the delays and the cost this provision would impose on people.  I seriously suggest to him that he look again at the amendment and, having done so, that he accept it. Its purpose is not to be obstructive but to try to add something constructive and sensible to the Bill.  I would again appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment; it would add something realistic to the legislation and make the Bill a better one by taking away a subsection which impinges the liberty of the individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been interesting to listen to the views expressed on practically every subject other than the amendment or on subjects somewhat indirectly connected with it, if one could draw on one's imagination sufficiently to connect them.  We seem to think this is some crazy imposition by some crazy Minister and Government and that dire results will follow. In the Second Schedule of the 1934 Act, much more stringent control was inserted.  It regulated, controlled and enabled the planning authority to regulate and control the design, colour and material of buildings, along with 101 other controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

      <P>This section is but a watered-down version of that provision of an Act which has been in operation for 29 years.  Still there is no danger of any of the dire consequences, the suppression of colour, which Deputies foresee following this Bill, arising as a result.  If local authorities did not even adopt that Act in the past, surely there is very little likelihood that in the administration of this Bill they will try to prevent anyone from being colourful in the matter of house renovation.  This Bill refers only to any &ldquo;painting or plastering which materially alters,&rdquo; etc. Surely there is a vast difference between that and all the talk we have had about preventing people from being individualistic.  What this aims at stopping is the madcap type of renovation which would have, say, Georgian houses, about which there has been so much talk in Dublin, painted purple or yellow or any other colour, thus destroying the appearance of the locality.  This does not stop people from asserting their individuality in painting doors or windows.  The section as it stands does not represent the serious matter Deputies have tried to suggest it represents.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of each group of tradesmen and certain semi-professional classes, referred to at paragraph 52 of the Second White Paper on Direct Taxation, (a) the amount of the flat-rate expense allowance for Schedule E income tax granted, and (b) the description of the group.</P>

      <P>Since these allowances involve an element of confidentiality I do not propose to publish them.  I may explain, however, that the flat-rate allowances granted in relation to various occupations may, for a particular type of occupation, vary as between one part of the country and another according to local conditions. They are given as a matter of administrative convenience as representing a round figure estimate of the deduction for expenses to which the employees concerned would be entitled under Rule 9 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E.  The giving of a flat-rate allowance does not, of course, preclude a greater allowance in cases where it is established that the flat-rate allowance is inadequate.  In general, the flat-rate allowances have been agreed with representatives of the employees&mdash;usually trade union officials &mdash;and it may be taken that the individual workers are aware of the position.</P>
