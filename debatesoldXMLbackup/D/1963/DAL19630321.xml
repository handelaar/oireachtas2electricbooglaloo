      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business as set out on the Order Paper in the following order: Nos. 10 and 12, and in No. 12, Votes 52, 53, 54, 55 and 43, and Nos. 4, 5, and 1. Questions will be taken at 2.30 p.m. I suggest that it might be desirable if the Party Whips would meet this morning to consider the possibility of terminating this business.  In the event of agreement not being reached, it may be necessary for me to move that the Dáil should sit late today.  Deputies are aware of the necessity for the enactment of the Central Fund Bill in this House and the Seanad before the end of the financial year because otherwise Government authority to make payments will have ceased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make it clear that we have been willing at all times to co-operate in any necessary arrangements but the Taoiseach is not correct in what he has just said.  It is necessary for the Central Fund Bill to go to the Seanad on Tuesday night next, but it is not necessary for the Supplementary Estimates to be included in the Central Fund Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach wait for one second?  It has frequently happened before that Supplementary Estimates were not passed by this House before the Central Fund Bill was passed and were included in the subsequent Appropriation Bill.  It is essential that these Supplementary Estimates should be passed before the end of next week. <Col N="172" /> In that, we are in entire concurrence, but it is not necessary that they should be included in this Central Fund Bill. That has never been done.  This is the Vote on Account and the Central Fund Bill must go to the Seanad by Tuesday night.  We appreciate that the Supplementary Estimates must be passed before we rise next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil to consider a definite matter of urgent public importance, that is, the imminent national bus strike, and to enable members to urge the Taoiseach to intervene personally by inviting both sides to meet him in an effort to find a satisfactory solution; that the Dáil considers that this step is the only helpful one remaining, in view of the failure of the ordinary processes of negotiation and conciliation; and that the grave hardships which will be suffered by all parties concerned in such a stoppage make his intervention imperative.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has given me notice of his intention to raise this matter and I have given it consideration.  The affairs of CIE, including the handling of labour disputes, are by law the responsibility of the Board of CIE and not of any member of the Government.  Moreover, the Oireachtas has established machinery under the Industrial Relations Acts to deal with labour disputes</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> In order to have a matter raised under Standing Order 29, the Chair has to be satisfied that a member of the Government has direct official responsibility in relation to it.  I can find no such responsibility in the case of the matter which is sought to be raised by the member and, accordingly, I am ruling, as I have ruled before in similar circumstances, that it is not one contemplated by the Standing Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, I was referring to the shibboleths which have served for policy in the years gone by, and to the many simple phrases which were offered to the electorate in the belief that adherence to the shibboleths therein enshrined would automatically bring the country to the stage in which all its economic problems would have been solved, and that we would be ushered into a period of embarrassing prosperity.  Of course, to those who have lived to judge the efficacy of these shibboleths, and to those who have measured the national economic development against the background of those glib phrases, it is clear that these early pledges have proved to be false promises and to be unreliable guides to setting achievable targets in the matter of economic planning.  The country was misled for many years into believing that there were easy passports to prosperity, that we could talk ourselves into wealth and that, with the aid of the printing press, we could provide happiness unsustained by work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dust has now settled on all these rather fevered policies and we are now developing a more developed political maturity and are prepared to realise, as the rest of the world has had to realise, that to live we must work and work hard with the limited resources at our disposal in a small country of such limited resources as this one.  It may very well be that we may have to work more strenuously and purposefully here as a nation because we have not substantial assets at our disposal.  We have none of the gigantic resources of timber and ores found in the Scandinavian countries, none of the ores and coal to be found in many parts of the Continent, none of the oil <Col N="175" /> to be found in Africa and Asia, none of the wool and almost natural methods of breeding and rearing cattle to be found in New Zealand and Australia, and gold and silver are deposits with which we are not very well acquainted in this country.</P>
    <P>Our technical skills are less advanced than in any other country in Europe. It is a regrettable thing that those of our people who find it necessary to emigrate to find employment leave this country and the only skills they have are good spines and tough muscles capped with Irish courage.  It is with that small technical equipment that they go to find work in Britain and the United States and try to earn a livelihood amongst people who have received technical training on a well planned basis from the time they were capable of absorbing that training.</P>
    <P>In this debate, two points of view have been expressed about the bill presented to the House for payment. There have been those who say it is necessary and those who say it is outrageously high and that it imposes heavy additional taxation or foretells the imposition of such taxation. There are those who take the view that in 1963 if you are to maintain modern standards of living and develop the national estate properly, you must necessarily incur this expenditure and provide the State and the community with the requisite resources.  In our view, if we demand services for the improvement of the community, for the provision of better education, better social services, more houses, more schools, then it is an inevitable corollary of these demands that the services must be paid for.</P>
    <P>If we want all these improvements, then inevitably taxation must be raised to meet the cost of these services.  No country in the world has a passport to immunity from taxation if, at the same time, it gets new and substantially additional services.  There is no way of avoiding additional taxation in such circumstances.  So far as the bill presented to the House is concerned, the Labour Party are prepared, not merely in this Budget, but in any Budget, to vote approval for expenditure so long as that expenditure is <Col N="176" /> directed towards raising the standards of living of the people and the strengthening of the national economy.  I see no alternative to that as a policy and I think, therefore, that we display political irresponsibility if, on the one hand, we demand new and substantially improved services and, on the other, imagine that these services can be provided without additional taxation.  It cannot be done in our own domestic budgets and it cannot be done in the national Budget.  If we want to provide ourselves with better services and with amenities which are commonplace in other countries, then there is no alternative to raising the necessary taxation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who says he is in favour of developments over a wide area, while at the same time withholding his consent to the raising of the necessary taxation to provide them, is attempting to postulate something which makes no sense whatever in a national Parliament. If we look at the expenditure provided for here, we can see that substantial sums of money are being spent in fields of activity in which we would all desire to see more money spent, in the field of social welfare benefits for the poor and weak, in the provision of more education, more houses and schools, in aids to agriculture and in all these fields in which we still lag noticeably behind many other countries in western Europe.  If we are to catch up in the struggle with these other countries and are not to be regarded as the poor relation who lives on an outpost in western Europe, then we will have to continue to spend, not merely at the current rate, but even at a higher rate, in order to provide these amenities and attributes of modern civilisation for our people.</P>
    <P>I do not complain therefore about the amount raised.  Our main desire is to ensure that the money raised will not be used wastefully or extravagantly and that, in the main, the expenditure will be directed in a two-pronged attack: (1) to alleviate as far as possible the hardships imposed on the weakest and most helpless section of the community; and (2) to provide ourselves with resources of return which will enable us to continue to finance the services it is now so necessary to provide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> The modern State cannot adopt the attitude that was characteristic of the State at the beginning of this century. At that time the State looked on indifferently, apparently helplessly, whilst tens of thousands of people lived in appalling slums with squalor and poverty their everyday companions. The State in the early years of this century was not concerned to succour people by insurance or otherwise in the matter of such inevitable risks as sickness, unemployment, widowhood, old age, large families and intermittent employment.</P>
    <P>Nor was the State concerned&mdash;this city was a living example of it&mdash;with the provision of decent houses and the eradication of slums.  The provision of work by the State was previously unknown as a means of buttressing a fall in employment.  The provision of industry by means of State grants and financial assistance was something which was relatively unknown until the last 25 or 30 years.  The building or rebuilding of schools as we now know them was something on which the State spent an infinitesimal amount of its revenue.  That policy was carried so far that we saw the miserable shacks that did service for national schools throughtout the country.</P>
    <P>In agriculture, the State has found it necessary to intervene with its helping hand by means of grants, subsidies, restrictions on imports that involve very substantial grants to cover these aids, especially towards the reduction of rates and the subsidisation of produce which comes from the land. Expenditure by the State on all these activities was unknown 50 years ago, but more and more expenditure on these activities by the State has been necessary.  One has only to survey the developments throughout the world to realise that the State to-day is intervening inevitably in many fields of national activity, and the financial resources of the citizens are being mobilised to help in the expansion of services which are considered to be of benefit to the national economy.  In fact&mdash;and the demands in this House underline what I say&mdash;the State is expected to be the father of all such enterprises and to provide aid and <Col N="178" /> assistance to all new social and industrial developments.</P>
    <P>So long as that is the role in which the State is cast, then inevitably the necessary moneys must be found for the purpose of financing these activities. It is because the modern State must do these things here as they are done elsewhere that we support proposals which will lead to developments in different fields of national endeavour and expansion in any field which offers the prospect either of enriching the national estate or giving return to the nation either as a social dividend or a means of expanding the nation's wealth.</P>
    <P>How the money should be raised to finance such services is of course a matter which can be discussed on the Budget.  Our view is, however, that a Budget should be an instrument of economic policy and should be framed in order to give effect to a definite economic policy.  We think, however, in framing Budgets the aim of the Government ought to be to avoid putting heavy taxes on backs which are incapable of supporting such burdens. Taxation ought to be equated to the backs of persons who are capable of carrying such burdens.  It is unfair, and it would be particularly unfair if the Government were likely, as the Taoiseach foreshadowed, to embark on a policy of a purchase tax which hit with particular rigour large sections of the community, whose resources were so slender that they were unable to pay the purchase tax except at the price of buying less food or clothing or having less available for the small amenities which help to sweeten life for them.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a purchase tax, it ought to be a tax very carefully vetted, and in any case it should be confined to luxury articles, because an indiscriminate purchase tax could represent a wage reduction policy as far as the masses of the workers are concerned. While we in these benches will support any policy calculated to raise the necessary funds to finance necessary activities, at the same time, we will feel perfectly free to oppose the raising of taxation if it has to be raised by putting unsupportable burdens on the <Col N="179" /> backs of people incapable of bearing them.</P>
    <P>While I think it is not unreasonable to be dissatisfied that many problems are still with us in one form or another and while it is not unreasonable to be impatient with the slowness of our progress in different fields, nevertheless if one stands and looks back over the activities of the State for the past 40 years, there are good grounds in other directions for being satisfied with the substantial progress made.  What we ought to avoid is imagining we are the only country in the world that provides our people with some of the services provided here.</P>
    <P>We have to our credit a very good record in the field of housing.  Much, as I said, has been done in the past 40 years in the fields of social welfare and industrial development, in the provision of new schools and in the establishment of State enterprises, which has given us such valuable public utilities as the ESB, the sugar company, the airlines, the shipping company, and activities of a useful character in the field of tourism, fishing and the financing of industries by means of a State financial house. All these represent developments on which we are entitled to congratulate ourselves but, whilst we should take pride in what has been achieved, it is nevertheless necessary, if we are to keep our place in the European comity of nations, that we should never rest so long as there are still so many problems with us and that we should continue by every means in our power to find solutions for these problems, believing that the solutions will provide better standards of living for our people.</P>
    <P>Some of the speeches made in this debate, notably by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Lenihan, both Parliamentary Secretaries, appear to indicate that they are perfectly satisfied with all the things that have been done, perfectly satisfied with all the things that are being done, perfectly satisfied that our people are as close to the highest standard of prosperity as they will ever get and, in fact, that we are <Col N="180" /> well ahead of Europe.  Deputy O'Malley talked about people with a 48-hour week.  The Government put a Bill through, he said, for a 48-hour week. Practically nobody on the Continent of Europe works anything like a 48-hour week, not even in the war-devastated countries.  The claim is made that the workers here get holidays with pay. They get holidays with pay all over Europe.</P>
    <P>Many of the things which we are trying to provide for our people here are commonplace in other countries but the trouble is that, in our insularity, we imagine we do things which nobody else does.  One has only to undertake a little research to find that, in fact, in many respects, particularly in the fields of both wages and social services, we are behind practically every one of the countries associated with the EEC and EFTA.  So long as that is the position, we are not entitled to feel satisfied that we have reached journey's end.  We are not moving as fast as other European countries.  We have still many serious basic and fundamental problems to solve and, so long as they are there, it must be the task of Parliament to direct the Government's activities, whatever Government may be in office, in such manner that solutions will be found for these problems.</P>
    <P>What are they?  The question of unemployment has been discussed in this debate.  What is the real position? It is true that in recent years there has been an increase in industrial employment. The aids to export, which are very substantial, probably unique in the whole of Europe in their extent, have acted as an incentive to exports, and I hope will continue to do so, so long as we are permitted to use these financial aids for the purpose of accelerating industrial development. Whether or not we can continue to use them if we become associated with EEC is, of course, another matter, and there might be another story to be told if we were prevented from using these financial aids as a means of developing industry.</P>
    <P>Let us look now at the unemployment situation today.  According to the Government's figures, there are <Col N="181" /> 60,000 persons unemployed, and that despite the fact that there has been very substantial emigration every year for the past 40 years.  The British figure announced recently indicates that five per cent of the population in London are Irish.  What would we think if five per cent of Dublin's population were British?  In London alone, five per cent of the population now is Irish.  One has only to go to Birmingham, Coventry, Sheffield and Bristol to hear Irish accents in every street of those cities.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the draw-off which emigration has provided, a draw away from the labour exchange, we still have over 60,000 unemployed.  That would be bad, and indeed very serious if it were something that had been caused by a peculiar set of circumstances, which were not going to be long with us.  But that is not the case; this problem of unemployment is a permanent problem.  It continues with us. Far from providing more jobs in the country, we are providing fewer.  In 1955, the total number in employment was 1,181,000.  In 1961, the latest date for which we can get any figures, the number had fallen to 1,119,000.  In other words, there was a fall of 62,000 in that period, comparing one Government figure with another Government figure, and all this notwithstanding the fact that we had in the meantime very substantial emigration.</P>
    <P>I know there will be a disputation as to whether the number of emigrants is 40,000 a year, or 30,000 a year, or 25,000 a year.  We need not get down to the precise figures based on our own reckonings and our own calculations. Let us look at the situation as revealed by the 1961 census.  That shows that in a period of five years, from 1956 to 1961, 215,000 persons left this country. When one remembers that the total population of County Longford, County Westmeath, County Kildare and County Wicklow is 218,000, one gets a picture of what we have lost in emigration in the five years from 1956 to 1961.  We have lost, in fact, the equivalent of the entire population of the Counties Longford, Westmeath, Kildare and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>If this were a country bulging with <Col N="182" /> citizens and the problem was one of overcrowding, such as the overcrowding that exists in some parts of Italy, one might understand this emigration; but when one thinks of the small population we have and when one remembers that it is the most virile of our manhood and the most fertile of our womanhood who are leaving, those who create population and thus create wealth, the whole picture is one that must cause grave concern to anybody interested in seeing the problem resolved in a manner which will keep our people at home.</P>
    <P>One could certainly never imagine that, control of our own affairs having passed into our hands over 40 years ago, we would still see large numbers of our people emigrating.  Nobody imagined that over the intervening period, over 1,000,000 would have left the country, as has happened, as emigrants. There is the problem.  We have now reached the stage at which, while emigration may have fallen, it is far too big a problem to be allowed to drift or have applied to it such timid measures as are being applied today. Nobody can deny its seriousness and if a solution can be found or a policy adopted which gives hope of arresting this mass haemorrhage of human beings, I am sure there will be goodwill on all sides of the House in dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to agriculture in this debate and it has been the subject, particularly in recent months, of much public discussion.  It is not unreasonable to ask some members of the Government to say what is the agricultural policy of the Government. If an overseas visitor came to me asking me to explain Government agricultural policy, I would have to tell him that I do not know, that it seems to be a deep secret in the breast of the Government.  What is the agricultural policy?  Can we get a half hour's exposition of it?  Where do the Government think they are going in the agricultural sector?  I know, and I suppose every member of the House knows, that we have reached the stage when the position of the agricultural worker is worse than it ever was from his standard of living point of view. <Col N="183" /> His money wages may be more than 20 or 25 years ago but when you see how he lives in his own home, you find that today he is the lowest paid worker in the land.</P>
    <P>I see nothing on the horizon calculated, if we drift as at present, to give him a better standard of living than he has to-day.  He has to contend with such problems as intermittent employment. At the end of the week, he gets the few pounds in wages with which he has to pay rent, keep his wife and children and himself in clothes, buy groceries, school books and meet the thousand and one demands that arise in every home.  The life of the agricultural worker in this country is relatively little removed from serfdom.  If he were chattelled property of a farmer, he probably would be better fed than by being a so-called independent worker.  At least he would be well kept in the same way as the farmer would keep his animals because they serve him and are valuable to him but because he is not even a chattel and has to eke out an existence in any way he can, when and wherever he can get work, he is always on wages inadequate to sustain him in decency or in modest frugality.</P>
    <P>What is to be the outcome for the agricultural worker?  Why should he stay in the country?  Is there any law of the land or of nature which requires a person to stay in this part of the world, living the only life he has in all this misery or poverty, if he can find elsewhere, either in our own cities or abroad, a better living?  We have no right to think that he will answer the frothy pleas to agricultural workers to stay here, to sweat and toil here, if we do nothing to raise his standard of living.  The plight of the agricultural worker here is worse now than in any other country in Europe and the wages standard is lower.  One has only to compare wage standards here with standards in the Six Counties or Britain to see the disparity.  What is this country offering agricultural workers? What can such a worker offer himself, his wife and children?  Are the children to go through life in the same <Col N="184" /> unending bleakness that has characterised the lives of their father and mother?  Are they expected to become another generation that will bear all this hardship with nothing being done for them?  Are we merely to sympathise and say: &ldquo;It is a pity things are like that; we wish them to be otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Something must be done to lift the standard of the agricultural worker because with the introduction of machinery, on the one hand, and the poverty-stricken existence he is compelled to endure on the land, on the other, agriculture is fast losing the numbers that have been employed in it in the past.  A Parliamentary Question asked by Deputy Tully as reported at column 669 of the Official Report of 6th March last seems to have passed unnoticed by the Press but if there were any alertness, one would imagine it would have been highlighted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked for details of the change in agricultural employment between 1961 and 1962.  The answer is staggering.  It shows that the number of persons employed in agriculture has changed to such an extent that 18,800 persons left agriculture between one year and the other.  Of these, 13,500 were members of families; 3,300 were males permanently employed in agriculture; 2,000 were temporary employees and the gross total is 18,000 who left agriculture between 1961 and 1962.  Surely somebody must be concerned with that?</P>
    <P>I attribute that to two factors.  One is the introduction of machinery and the second is the low standard of living which is associated with employment on the land.  Unless we can provide our agricultural workers with a better standard of living than they are getting today this drift from the land will continue and will cause problems in towns and cities.  When a person leaves the land to take his chances in the towns and cities he causes housing problems, employment problems, traffic problems and the various other problems associated with areas in which people live in a large aggregate of that kind, where their <Col N="185" /> number is unplanned, as migration is always unplanned.</P>
    <P>Is there anything in the Government's agricultural policy which tends to stop this migration from the land? We talk about 5,000, or 6,000 or even 10,000 people getting employment in industry but we have got to remember all the time that these other people in agriculture are human beings as well and they are leaving employment on the land because, in the main, of the two factors to which I have already adverted.  Can anybody see anything that is likely to change this tendency? Quite frankly, I cannot see it.  If there is any policy it ought not be kept a secret.  The farmers ought to know it; the agricultural workers ought to know it and everybody concerned with the well-being of the nation ought know it. Nobody has been able to say what the agricultural policy is, at least I have not heard it.  If the policy is that of multiplying our cattle population then it offers no solution whatever, even for the problems of the agricultural workers or the problems of the small farmers.</P>
    <P>No increase in cattle prices in Britain, even if the cattle could be got, or no increase in cattle prices in West Germany, even if our cattle were wanted there, would be of the slightest use to the farmer with 10, 20, 30 or 40 acres of land.  Increased prices for cattle would play an imperceptible part in his livelihood and his domestic organisation.  What then is the problem?</P>
    <P>How long are we going to carry on this business of subsidising our butter exports?  Remember that in each of the two years past we spent £3¼ million and £3 million on the subsidisation of butter so that the total for the two years was £6¼ million.  Milk has now become the enemy of the Irish Exchequer.  That is the situation we have reached but nobody has any suggestion to make on this matter. When are we going to stop paying £3 million a year to other people for eating our butter while our own people continue to pay high prices?  I am not blaming the Government for this.  This is happening while you are here and while we are here and quite clearly from the national viewpoint we ought <Col N="186" /> to apply our energies in trying to find a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure that some of the money spent on subsidising butter exports might not have been better employed trying to find overseas markets, particularly in the emergent countries of Africa and Asia for dried milk which might well help to take up the substantial surplus of milk on the market today.  Many of the countries in Asia and Africa just do not know what clean milk is.  In many of these countries there are entire districts where children never saw their first birthday because of malnutrition.  There are other areas where the second baby kills the first because there is no food for the first when the second is born. Is there any possibility that we could find a market for dried milk in some of these developing countries where the provision of a decent supply of milk is a necessity for the maintenance of the population and the maintenance of a standard of health which will avoid for them gross waste of money in the provision of medicine, hospitals and cemeteries?</P>
    <P>I doubt if we are getting good value for the £3 million odd we spend on subsidising butter.  I realise, of course, that if you are to maintain a dairy business, you must have calves and if you are to maintain a cattle population, you must have calves and milk and you must have markets for them. If you cannot consume the milk here, you must find markets for it.  One is entitled to ask if in our circumstances we can continue to afford to spend £3 million subsidising butter exports? We are entitled to ask whether there is not some other way in which we can get better value for that money than we are getting.  It is a problem for us all and the solution has to come from ourselves.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, the most hopeful developments that I see in the agricultural field are the proposals which have emanated from the Irish Sugar Company in regard to their scheme for growing and processing vegetables of all kinds, and later on, perhaps, meats of all kinds.  This offers the best solution I can see for the problem of the small farmer because it is by growing something which needs careful <Col N="187" /> personal attention, on an extensive scale, and which is eventually properly processed and competently marketed, that we can get a return for the farmer, particularly the small farmer, which he would not get by growing a crop of oats or wheat, if &ldquo;crop&rdquo; is the proper word to use when associated with some of these small farmers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I see in the sugar company's development a greater ray of hope for the small farmer than in any other item of agricultural activity.  Mark you, the field may not be left to us too long. Other countries may think of doing the same as we are doing, but we have the advantage of a suitable climate; we are in the field and we have certain other production advantages as well. It may very well be that we can get off to a good start and because of the efficiency of our processing be able to hold our position in the European and world market.  It seems to me that only from that point is there any glimmer of hope that there is likely to be an improvement in the position of the small farmer and, consequently, in the possibility that the agricultural worker will in some way be beneficially affected by an improvement in the lot of the farmer who is engaged in this kind of cultivation of fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a few questions about our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the breakdown in the negotiations on Britain's application for admission to the European Economic Community.  It is quite clear now that there has been a complete break there.  A number of people have said publicly that as far as the British application is concerned, it must be regarded as dead for quite a long time to come.  If that is so, then what is our position?  Are we just to mark time with the British and wait until a suitable opportunity arises for Britain to re-submit her application and then revive our application as well?</P>
    <P>Is that the policy in respect of our membership of EEC and is that our line for the future?  Efforts are now being made to revivify the EFTA <Col N="188" /> organisation but, as has been rightly said, EFTA has no attractions for us. In the first place, the EFTA organisation is confined to the objective of developing a free trade policy in regard to industrial products.  It is in no way concerned with a free trade policy in respect of agriculture, and as our object in getting into EEC was based on a belief&mdash;I think, a mistaken belief in many respects&mdash;that what we would lose on industry, we would gain on agriculture, clearly EFTA has nothing whatever to offer us in this connection, although at the same time any effort to revitalise EFTA may show itself in the form of EFTA itself, as a group, seeking to make an agreement with the EEC countries and thus there might be some organic connection between the two of an advantageous character.</P>
    <P>It is too early yet to say whether that is a right assumption or whether, if the attempt were made, the objective could be achieved by EFTA.  So now we are in the situation where EFTA is of no advantage to us whatever and the EEC situation is that, as the British application has been rejected, we are sitting outside with the British waiting to see if the British application will be revived or whether the British will seek to have it revived and, if so, how long will it take the British to have it revived.</P>
    <P>A statement was made a few days ago by a prominent member of the British Labour Party, whose voice has been associated with the making of policy within that Party, to the effect that if the British Labour Party win the next general election, it will be four years before they apply for membership of the EEC.  Supposing that happens, supposing they win the next election&mdash;and I was reading an interesting dissertation in the <i>Irish Press</i> recently on the result of a Gallup poll on the next election in Britain which seems to accept that there is no question that the Labour Party will win the next election.  If it does, and this forecast of the speaker I mentioned represents British Labour Party policy, then it could mean that the new British Government might not make any <Col N="189" /> application for admission to EEC for a period of four years.</P>
    <P>What are we to do during the four years?  The Government have embarked on a policy which in certain circumstances might be right, but in the circumstances in which we live, having regard to the people with whom we have to negotiate, we might have to change our policy very frequently in an issue of this kind.  The Taoiseach has said the Government are working on the assumption that we are moving into a time of freer trade, with, ultimately, free trade.  Having earlier said we would be in EEC by 1st January, 1964, the Taoiseach has now said: &ldquo;In any case, the likelihood is we will be in there sometime.  What we propose to do in these circumstances is to scale down the tariffs so that when we are admitted, all that painful exercise of cutting tariffs will be over and we can walk in with our heads up and tell our colleagues in EEC that we have now done all the exercises and complied with all the demands necessary for admission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that in view of the statement attributed to the member of the British Labour Party, we have to ask ourselves now is it wise to continue this policy of tariff reduction here if the only thing we are doing thereby is making it easier for all the countries of EEC, and indeed every other country in the world, to export goods here under conditions which will be easier, as we scale down tariffs, than they are today.  Is it a good policy to keep scaling down tariffs, which we undertook to do, even if we got the compensatory advantages of EEC membership, when in fact we are getting no compensations?  All we are doing is pulling down tariff barriers and allowing the British, the Europeans and everybody else throughout the world to jump the tariff barriers and compete here against Irish manufacturers. It is all right to go around letting tariff barriers down if you do that as a member of a group or if ultimately certain advantages will flow to you.  It is all right to do it in such circumstances, but if we are to reduce tariffs for the benefit of the world and then if we cannot get into EEC, where <Col N="190" /> we are told there will be some advantages for us, I begin to question the wisdom of a policy of continuing to reduce tariffs unless we can see and feel some tangible results from the other side.</P>
    <P>I see no co-operation between EEC and this country in sight.  I see no evidence of it, and what I am asking the Government to say therefore, in the absence of that co-operation and in view of the possibility that the British application may not be cleared up for years&mdash;in fact, it may never be cleared up since there are powers in Britain now developing a conflict with the cold concept of EEC&mdash;is what are we to do in the meantime.  Being kept out of EEC while at the same time dropping our tariff defences to facilitate other exporting countries may well mean for us getting the worst of both worlds and that is something we ought to have a look at before we continue to commit ourselves to a policy of letting down our tariff defences without compensation from those who will benefit by reason of the fact that we let down these tariff defences for Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Even as it is, I still think the situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> our application to join the EEC is in a very cloudy position.  We do not know at all whether Gerneral de Gaulle takes the same view of our application as he does of the British application.  We do not know whether he is any more favourable to us than he is to the British.  Some influential people have been saying that the General regards us as an associate of Britain, as being likely to be a friend of Britain in the EEC and looks askance at our being admitted because he regards it as a strengthening of the British influence within the EEC.</P>
    <P>Even if the British get over the hurdle and are admitted, are we clear we can get over the hurdle?  Will we find that, even if Britain gets over the hurdle, we shall be told we are an undeveloped country and cannot get in and that the most we can get is association on whatever terms it is possible to get that association?  Many people think that while Greece did fairly well in getting association with the EEC, there will be no more Greek <Col N="191" /> agreements and that it is quite unlikely that anybody else will get the same terms as the Greeks got on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The whole situation is so cloudy and so muddy that the Government ought to do some rethinking.  I do not blame the Government for a change of policy. The situation is so fluid and the necessity for safeguarding our interests so paramount that one is justified in moving in any direction thought suitable. Even frequent changes of policy might be necessary and could be understood in a constantly changing situation in which we are up against forces which are Goliaths compared with our economic position.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the Estimate, our vote is not a vote against this Vote on Account.  We believe this money is necessary if taxation is to be raised to provide civilised living conditions for our people.  We believe it is useless and ineffective and infantile to talk about new services, on the one hand, and to refuse to provide the money, on the other.  These are two utterly incompatible contentions which can never be reconciled.</P>
    <P>We want to provide our people with a decent standard of living.  In order to raise the present standard of living we must mobilise the resources of the nation.  A Budget and a Vote on Account are all necessary cogs in that machine.  My complaint against the Government&mdash;indeed it is one which a healthy Government would have themselves&mdash;is that they are not doing enough; that what they are doing is being done too slowly and too late.  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves, and in the light of the problems confronting us there must be more drive, more vigour and the adoption of new methods if we are ever, in our lifetime, to find a solution to or, indeed, a substantial mitigation of the most rigorous problems confronting us today.</P>
    <P>If the Government are willing to embark upon a policy of that kind, I think there will be support and goodwill for any such policy.  Our danger today is that we may drift into a position <Col N="192" /> of economic isolation in which we may lose even the traditional British market if by any chance Britain gets into the EEC and we are kept out because we are underdeveloped.</P>
    <P>If these circumstances should develop, a serious situation would confront the country.  It is because the need is urgent and that time is against us that I urge the Government, by every means in their power, to evolve policies calculated to relieve, if not completely to eradicate, some of the rigorous evils which confront us today. If they do that, the Government will have the goodwill of many sections of this House.  If they fail to do so, then we shall continue to encounter unemployment&mdash;tens of thousands at the labour exchange&mdash;and emigration each year by the hundreds of thousands. We shall continue to give our farmers and their workers a low standard of living and, generally, we shall blunt the enthusiasm for a vigorous policy of development.  That enthusiasm can be got today if the Government will only give a lead in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I noticed last week that there was very considerable discussion on this Vote on Account of the housing position.  As a Dublin Deputy, I am particularly concerned with this problem.  I listened, too, for a period to the hysterical screechings of Deputy Sherwin and his claims to oracular knowledge in connection with this problem as it affects Dublin Corporation. Nobody, of course, is impressed by the performances he puts on.  To some extent, at times, they are a form of light relief in the House.  I daresay it takes all kinds to make a Dáil.  I should like to impress on the Government the need to put the heat on Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council&mdash;and, I am sure, some other local authorities&mdash;regarding their manner of tackling the housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to speak at great length on this Vote on Account or to indulge in clichés on housing but it is impossible not to realise that housing is fundamental to the prosperity of our people and is the basis of whatever progress the nation will make in the <Col N="193" /> future or has made hitherto.  In Dublin, we have a continuously-developing housing problem.  As was amply demonstrated by Deputy Norton in his speech, that problem arises to a great extent from the flight of people from rural Ireland to the cities.</P>
    <P>Dublin is the receiving centre of many thousands of workers who are fed up working for farmers for little or no money.  Many of them are farmers' sons who had to move out of uneconomic farms and are trying to get work in Dublin.  Furthermore, Dublin is the halfway house for returning emigrants or for people coming home on holidays and stopping and, perhaps, getting a job in Dublin and perhaps marrying and settling down here.  Then there is the continuous problem for Dublin Corporation and the county council of housing these people.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here by Deputy Sherwin&mdash;I do not know if it has been stated by others&mdash;that the housing problem in Dublin is due to the return of emigrants over the past few years, that the housing problem is due to two factors, that there was a sufficiency of houses some years ago, that there were vacant houses for which tenants could not be found and that that slowed down house planning and house-building.  Added to that there was this mass return of emigrants.</P>
    <P>Anybody with any knowledge of Dublin housing&mdash;and mine goes back 20 years&mdash;knows very well that it is an ever-developing problem and while at some time or other this condition may appear to reach a stage of saturation, that cannot be at any time but a temporary phase.  The Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation, no matter how they may try to excuse their failure, must carry the responsibility for letting the machine which was then in existence for the annual building of houses grind to a halt and become motionless over a considerable period.  As far as the alleged mass return of emigrants is concerned, they are no more than a handful in the problem which confronts Deputies in this city and Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>They are no more than a handful in the 8,500 which is the actual figure of people looking for houses.  I know the corporation endeavour to excuse or to minimise that figure of 8,500 by saying that is not the effective number, that the effective number is half or less than half&mdash; meaning that the list they regard as effective is composed of people whose plight is absolutely desperate, and the inference is that the other half of that 8,500 are really only applying for houses out of a spirit of fun.  That is not so.  The question of sub-tenants in corporation houses is a major one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of sub-tenants is a major one.  In my constituency, particularly in Ballyfermot, in practically every second house, there is a married son or married daughter with one, two or more children living there.  Everybody knows the social problems created by a situation in which more than one family live within a very confined space.  Corporation houses are small and people live almost on top of one another.  The misery ensuing from that is as grievous as any misery which resulted from any housing problem which existed in this city even in the worst days of the slums.</P>
      <P>The slums are largely eliminated now.  In fact, one has to travel to see a tenement whereas formerly in the memory of most of us Dublin was full of tenements.  The housing problem has, in the main, now drifted out to the new corporation housing areas, to the fringe areas of the city and it is not being tackled by the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation. The Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation have fallen down on the job.  Through the Government, I want to ask the responsible Minister to put the heat on these people.  I know he has done his best in regard to this problem in other parts of the country but I ask him to put the heat on the local authority concerned and make them do their job which they are not doing now.</P>

      <P>The question of unemployment has been ably dealt with by Deputy Norton.  This is a matter which must concern the Government and must concern any Government in office.  It is an appalling thought that we have this residual number of unemployed regardless of the tremendous emigration figures.  There was a time when it was argued that no matter what was done there would be chronic unemployment.  That might be true of a minute fraction but my personal knowledge convinces me that by far the greater number of the people who have to go to the labour exchanges to get a few shillings every week in order to live would be happier in any reasonably paid employment.  The number of unemployed must be the yardstick of the success or failure of the Government's policy, whether the number is declining or increasing, and latterly it has shown a very alarming tendency to increase.</P>
      <P>The question of increased production is one with which the Government must concern themselves and, with the Budget coming shortly before us, the question of increasing production, of reducing costs and of enabling us to compete so far as we can in markets outside this country in the future, must occupy the thoughts and attention of the Government.  Therefore, in regard to a development to which I have referred here by way of Parliamentary question a couple of weeks ago, I should like to take this opportunity to present it more clearly to the Minister for Finance as the responsible Minister of Government in connection with matters of business, the matter of methods of efficiency, the question of costs and the question of the cost of living generally.  I refer to this development over the past few months particularly, of a racket called trading stamps.  This is, as I described it previously, a parasitic imposition upon the business community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will permit me, Sir, I shall try to underline the relevancy which I consider it has.  This business of trading stamps must result in increasing the cost of living and must result in the reduction of employment. It must also result inevitably in increased prices for the people and it is something which the Government must examine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, in the heel of the hunt, everything the Government do is a matter for the individual businessman.  I shall not argue the point with the Chair.  I accept what the Chair has to say on this matter, but I wish the Minister would look into it.  While I am not given an opportunity of developing the point on this occasion, I shall avail of another opportunity, when it arises, to do so.</P>
      <P>This morning, I tried to raise the very important question of the bus strike.  I shall only say that I sincerely hope the Government will not lose any moment of time, and that the Taoiseach particularly will not lose any opportunity today, within the next few hours, to take some steps to obviate this terrible hardship that will exist on Monday.  I hope the Taoiseach will intervene personally and try to get some amicable solution to the problem. Sooner or later, this matter has to be settled, and it would certainly be better for the half million people who will be walking in Dublin next week if it could be settled at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want finally and briefly to make an appeal to the Government on behalf of the old age pensioners. Budget time is coming near and I should like to express the wish that the Minister and the Government will devote all their energies towards trying to do something decent for the old age pensioners, and particularly for those <Col N="197" /> who are dependent on non-contributory pensions.  I think this opportunity should be seized to do something for them and it is by that measuring-stick that I shall judge the Government so far as the Budget is concerned.</P>
    <P>On this Vote, I agree with what Deputy Norton had to say.  This money is essential and it must be voted.  There is no point other than pure obstructionism in voting against it, and I do not propose to take that course.  The money must be made available because it is essential for the running of the public services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote on Account is taken annually and it gives an opportunity for a stocktaking of the Government's work during the previous year.  The difficulty that arises in my constituency, which is a completely rural constituency, is that over the past year, the farmer's income has reduced while his outgoings have increased.  A bullock which was worth £55 this time last year is now worth only £50, which shows a reduction of £5.  With the new grading system, it will be impossible for our pig producers to get Grade A pigs and that will ultimately mean a reduction in the price of pigs.  We are told by the Minister for Agriculture that there will not be any increase in the price of milk.  Every Deputy, irrespective of which side he sits on, is receiving deputations from the ICMSA and the National Farmers Association pleading for increases, and those pleas clearly convey that the farmer's income is going down.</P>
      <P>Everyone in the House knows that there is no market whatsoever for poultry or eggs.  The bottom has fallen out of the market.  The price paid for turkeys last season clearly indicates that it is no longer economic to produce turkeys for the export market, and the home market seems to be very limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the outgoings of the farmers.  Let us take rates, for example. In my county, the rates went up this year from 46/10 to 50/-, an increase of 3/2 in the £.  The demand from the manager in Roscommon is for an increase <Col N="198" /> of 8/- in the £, so it looks as if the rates there will increase from 44/-to 52/-.  At the same time, the price which the farmer pays for feeding stuff to feed his livestock has increased. He has to pay more for a number of commodities and services such as beer, whiskey, cigarettes, tobacco, ESB charges, and bus and rail fares.</P>
    <P>We all know that the economy of this country should not be based on the wheat rancher but on the small farmer who is breeding, rearing and feeding cattle for finishing in the midlands. He gets no advantage from the subsidy paid for wheat, or the guaranteed price for beet and barley.  The fact is that it is no longer economic for the small farmer to stay on the land and, in my opinion, he will not stay on the land.  If we are to make any effort at keeping the small farmer on the land, his income will have to be supplemented.</P>
    <P>From a recent statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it looks as if our hopes of getting any factories in the West of Ireland are much more limited than they were. Some time ago, the small farmer could supplement his income by the price he got for poultry and eggs but, as I said, that market is gone.  Up to the past year, he could also supplement his income by work he got from the local authorities on the roads. Again, it looks as if that is going, due to the use of machinery.  I have often asked myself: is it economic to use machinery on our roads at the rate we have been using it for the past few years?  I wonder is it the case of one county engineer competing with another county engineer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that the small farmer's income was supplemented by the amount of money he received from the work he did for the local authority.  I think the Department of Local Government should spend more money on our by-roads and less on removing <Col N="199" /> turns on main roads.  If they are anxious to have some turns removed, surely they could give much more employment to the small farmer in rural Ireland than they give at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also true if our farmers are doing reasonably well, our business people, our small shopkeepers, will do reasonably well.  If the farmer's income were supplemented, it would mean that he would have more money to buy various commodities such as artificial manures, seeds, clothes, footwear, etc.  At the moment, the small shopkeeper is going through a very lean period, particularly in the small towns of Roscommon and Leitrim, due to emigration and the competition of big self-service stores which are now moving in.  He also finds himself in the position of giving extended credit to farmers for the simple reason that our banks are not prepared to give any credit whatsoever to the farming community, and particularly to the small farmers.</P>
      <P>The small shopkeeper has to meet much heavier demands in the way of rates.  We all know that these people are passing through a very hard period and the Government should try to give them some relief.  A number of them have been compelled in recent years to carry out expensive improvements to their shops, in the line of new counters, plastering of walls, running water and toilets.  These improvements have been called for by the health inspectors and the shopkeepers do not get any grants for them and could not qualify for them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us think about rates for a moment.  A Select Committee should be set up by the House to deal with this matter.  Some Deputies think that equalisation of rates would help to solve our problems.  I do not know about that but I do know that people living in counties such as Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo and Galway are no longer able to bear the demands made on them by the rating authorities.  The Government have a certain amount of responsibility in this matter.  There is no point in the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Finance telling us that this is a matter for the county council.</P>
      <P>Very often, a county council receives a scheme from the Department of Local Government.  That scheme has a coating of chocolate but inside it is a lemon or gall.  We were told that the Health Act would cost us only 2/6 in the £ on the rates but we know what it is costing now.  If a local authority gets sanction in respect of a road scheme for £50,000 or £60,000, they do not get any money until the scheme is completed. They have to provide the capital involved and the interest charges are often very high.  For that reason, the Government have a big responsibility in the matter of rates and they should set up a Select Committee of the House to examine the matter.  The Government can solve the problem much easier than the local authorities because they have access to funds which no local authority could have.  If the burden becomes too heavy for any section of the community, we should all make our contribution from the central authority.</P>
      <P>Speakers on the other side of the House have made reference to the farming community not accepting rural water supplies and have said that it is a political move.  We had deputations in Leitrim from the National Farmers Association opposing rural water supplies.  The only reason they opposed them was that they were afraid they would put the rates skyhigh.  They all admitted that they would like to have the water supplies but were afraid of the costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, it must be remembered what the Health Act cost us.  We do not want to find ourselves in the same position with regard to rural water supplies.  As a percentage of the total emigration, my constituency leads the parade.  I said on the Vote on Account last year that 66,780 people left my constituency over a period of 35 years.  That is an average of almost 2,000 people a year.  The Taoiseach said here a few weeks ago that emigration in 1961 was less than it was in 1960 and in 1962 was less than in 1961.  I believe that statement is true and the answer to it is that all the people able to go have gone and there is nobody else left to go.  It would be a pity if a statement of that kind were allowed to be misinterpreted. We have to bear in mind that in Leitrim nearly one house out of every two is closed.</P>
      <P>On the question of land division, the Land Commission have gone from stop to full stop.  References have been made to new Land Bills and to White Papers but the people in my constituency are fed up listening to this talk of new Bills and White Papers.  They are of the opinion that when a new Bill or a White Paper is mentioned, it means that the people already suffering hardship are to be further overburdened.  If the Government are sincere about increasing the size of the small farms, why do they not buy the land?</P>

Whether there is a scarcity of money, I do not know, but we seem to have plenty of money for the building of luxury hotels and for increasing judges' salaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the advantage&mdash;if I might call it that&mdash;of either reading or listening to all the speeches.  After a three weeks' debate, it would be impossible to deal with every point raised, although many speeches were merely repetition and raised no new point.</P>
      <P>I shall deal first with Deputy Corish. We have not yet any figures dealing with total employment in 1962.  On his own estimates, he arrived at a total increase in industrial employment over 1958 of 19,000.  That figure may be correct; I am not sure.  He does say that that is not due to new factories but an increase in employment, mainly in construction.  He is not right on that point at least.  In the December quarter of 1958 compared with the December quarter of 1962, there is an increase in employment in transportable goods industries of 20,600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made by the Deputy in regard to unemployment was that the rate of from seven per cent to eight per cent of insured people showed no improvement over the figure for 1957.  That is not correct. The percentage of insured people on the live register in mid-February, 1957, was 11.8.  In mid-February, 1962, the figure was 7.9, which is a very big difference.  The total number of persons <Col N="203" /> on the register in mid-February, 1957, was 93,000, 23,000 more than in mid-February this year.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Deputy Dillon.  He said:</P>
    <P>If the Government are obliged to concede these facts</P>
    <P>&mdash;relating to insurable employment, which we are not obliged to concede&mdash;</P>
    <P>... and I do not think this Government can deny them, they ought to get out and make way for people who could do better.  If I had that record, I should be ashamed to admit I had been responsible for the government of this country for the past six years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy must have a very short memory if he does not remember how he stuck on towards the end of 1956 when we had a Government who did more harm to this country than any Government before or since.  He has not a good record therefore to criticise this Government remaining on in office at this time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon then went on to deal with social welfare, especially the old age pensioners.  He started off by saying that on 6th April, 1928, the Cumann na nGaedheal Government increased the old age pension by one shilling.  He started at a very convenient date.  If he had gone back a little, he would have had to say that Cumann na nGaedheal reduced the old age pension by a shilling.  I think they are the only Party in western Europe that ever reduced the old age pension as a means of raising finance for Government purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They took a shilling from the old age pensioners to pay for the Civil War!  That is the explanation Deputy Dillon gives and he is satisfied with it.  They restored it again when they had been defeated in the Dáil.  He <Col N="204" /> went on to say that the Fianna Fáil Government remained on in office from 1932 to 1949 before anything was done for the old age pensioners.  That is misstatement No. 1.  The Fianna Fáil Government gave an increase immediately after the war when increases were given all round to State servants. All these various things were done at the same time in February, 1947.  An increase was given all round to old age pensioners of 2/6d., but in addition to that, a food voucher worth 2/6d. was given to urban old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party seemed to cast a certain amount of ridicule on this food voucher.  It was considered at the time, however, that the food voucher was more valuable to the old age pensioner than 2/6d. in cash, because it was difficult to get certain foods at that time.  With the food voucher, he not only got 2/6d. worth of food but a guarantee that the food would be supplied at a fair price.  That was the position up to 1948.  The rural old age pensioners got 2/6d. cash and the urban old age pensioner got 2/6d., plus the 2/6d. food voucher.  Deputy Dillon said that the inter-Party Government came along with a scheme in 1949 and gave 7/6d. all round.  They gave that 7/6d. including what was given by Fianna Fáil in 1947, that is, they gave a 5/- cash increase to the rural old age pensioners and a 5/-cash increase to the urban old age pensioners, but they took away the 2/6d. food voucher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost to the Government at that time was 5/- for the rural old age pensioner and 2/6d. for the urban old age pensioner.  Deputy Dillon goes on to say that Deputy Norton brought in a Bill adding 7/6d. per week to the basic rate of old age pensioners, bringing them up to 17/6d. per week.  He said he completely revolutionised the means test.  He did not.  That was done by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1952.  The big change in the means test was made at that time and not by Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon then goes on to say that Deputy McGilligan provided 2/6d. in his Budget in 1951 for the old age <Col N="205" /> pensioners.  He did not.  A Social Welfare Bill was brought in by Deputy Norton.  As everybody knows, there was a bit of a rebellion among some elements of the inter-Party Government, including in particular Clann na Talmhan.  They refused to support this Bill unless 2/6d. were included for the old age pensioners.  That amendment was put into the Bill.  The Government were thrown out, however, and the Bill was abandoned.  The 2/6d. was provided by the Fianna Fáil Government when they came into office in 1951.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy always does.  He is not interested in the truth and he never was.  He is only interested in making propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the truth.  If the Deputy puts down a question to the Minister for Social Welfare asking on what date each increase was given to the old age pensioners, he will have to get an answer.  But it would not suit him to put down that question.</P>
      <P>He goes on to say that Fianna Fáil came into office in 1952 and gave 1/6. They gave 2/6 in 1951 and 1/6 in 1952.  That was that for that particular time.  In 1955, the inter-Party Government gave 2/6.  Fianna Fáil gave 1/-in 1957, 2/6 in 1959 and 1/- in 1960. Deputy Dillon got as far as 28/6 and &ldquo;I think there has been a further upward adjustment since that,&rdquo; he said. As a matter of fact, there have been further adjustments up to 32/6&mdash;a total of 4/- &mdash; which were disregarded by Deputy Dillon, though he made a great case for what the inter-Party Government had done; in fact, of course, they gave 5/- during their two terms in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's next point was emigration.  As usual, he talked about the 300,000 people who left this country in six years.  That figure is, of course, wrong.  The latest figure we <Col N="206" /> have is that for the end of January 1963.  Now from the end of January 1957&mdash;just a month before we came into office; the end of February would be a better figure, better, too, from our point of view&mdash;to the end of January, 1963, the total figure is 218,000.  It is an immense figure.  It is far too high, but it is also far different from 300,000, the round figure adopted by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>The census, as has been often said, is the only real source from which can be given the real figure for emigration and the census has proved that these figures adopted from year to year of the outward and inward movements are largely true, but for some reason the outward and inward movements are a bit higher always than the census subsequently proves.  That figure, therefore, is a bit too high&mdash;maybe 10,000 too high, as the census will prove when published in a few days' time.</P>
    <P>Emigration, of course, did not start in our time.  In the three years, January, 1954, to January, 1957, the figure was 150,000, which, in three years, represents a fair effort on the part of the inter-party Government compared with the 200,000 for the six subsequent years.  I should like to draw the attention of Deputies also to the fact that in the last year we have available&mdash;the end of January, 1963&mdash; the emigration figure is 12,700.  That is not a figure specially picked because it seems more favourable; if we go back and take any month in the past six months, the figure is in or about the same.  There has been, therefore, a remarkable improvement in the emigration figures over the past six years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan, of course, was back once more to this point of his that we voted £250,000 in 1957 for marketing but never spent it.  Deputy Donegan will be glad to know that it has been spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no wonder Deputy Dolan is smiling.  A number of Deputies seemed to have a fear, if I may so describe it, that the Government were not giving sufficient thought and sufficient care to the way the money was being spent.  I can assure Deputies that that is far from true.  The Estimates are examined very carefully. When they come in, they are, first of all, cut down departmentally; secondly, they are cut down by me; and, thirdly, they are cut down by the Government. Anything that appears to the Government, in the final analysis, as unnecessary or inadvisable is cut out and, in the end, only the bare amount necessary appears.</P>
      <P>Now, although that criticism was advanced by many Deputies, and there were complaints of extravagance and so on, I do not remember hearing any suggestion from any Deputy that any particular item should be cut out. There are some things which I shall mention later which might come under that heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to a 50 per cent increase in Supply Services over the past eight years.  His figures are, I think, correct.  The increase is around 50 per cent but it must be remembered that in the past eight years, the gross national product has increased by 46 per cent and, as a matter of fact, the table I have made out here&mdash;I think I produced it the <Col N="208" /> last time this Vote was under discussion&mdash;shows that there is a remarkable relationship maintained between national product and Government expenditure.  Taking it, first of all, as the Book of Estimates shows the position&mdash;that is, with the capital items included&mdash;it has varied over the years from 1953 to now between 25.8 per cent, which is the lowest figure, and 28.6 per cent.  There is no pattern at all in regard to when it was highest and when it was lowest.  Indeed, the two lowest figures&mdash;25.8 per cent&mdash; occurred in 1955 and 1958 and the two highest occurred in 1956 and 1961.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include rates or is it simply Government taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am dealing with Government taxation first.  If we take the current expenditure&mdash;that is, leaving out the capital items in the Book of Estimates&mdash;the percentage has varied between 21 and 22 over these years.  The rates increase also gives a picture of a fairly constant figure. Deputy Sweetman talked about the rates increase this year as compared with last year; this relates now to the amount provided for rates on Government property.  First of all, there was a miscalculation last year, particularly in the Dublin rate, and it is, of course, the Dublin rate which is the important one because about 40 per cent. of our buildings are rated in the Dublin area. There is really not so much in the point.  The rates will not amount to £25,000,000 this year.  If you take the amount provided last year for the relief of rates into account, last year's would be about £22,000,000; this year's may be in or around £23,000,000.</P>
      <P>With regard to increased taxation, every Deputy, of course, talked about increased taxation.  It is, I agree, quite a legitimate point because it is certainly disturbing to see the amount going up so very steeply each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister excuse me?  I think he said Government taxation represented 28 per cent. of gross national product?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Government taxation, including the capital amount in the Book of Estimates, 26 to 28 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I ask is that the Taoiseach said at column&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry; I should say expenditure, not taxation.  It is the Book of Estimates I am talking about. When we talk about increased taxation, there are two ways of looking at it.  Suppose we had come in in 1957 when the tax was so much on tobacco, beer, spirits and so on; income tax was so much, and if we had left that taxation just as it was without any change whatever and if we carried on up to the present and were collecting now in revenue sufficient to meet the bill, I think we could claim that we had not increased taxation.  It would be because the yield had grown owing to the general growth of productivity and prosperity and so on in the country. Naturally, as wages and salaries go up and as costs in various ways go up, higher income would be necessary, but if it came from the same taxes I think nobody could find any great fault with it.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if Deputies criticise because the amount taken in, whatever the source may be, is going up.  I think that would be unreasonable. Therefore, I examined on the first basis, that is, leaving taxes as they were in 1957, what yield they would give us at present.  If I go back on the Budgets for the past six years, I find that we got £1,100,000 from the tax we put on tobacco, let us say, and that we took 6d., let us say, off income tax by which we lost £1,700,000.  Taking these Estimates all these years down to the present and, if you like, assuming they were true estimates&mdash;they were not far out, anyway&mdash;I find that we have, over the six years, reduced direct taxation&mdash;income tax and such taxes&mdash;by £6.3 million and have increased indirect taxation, that is, the revenue taxes, such as tobacco, beer and spirits, by £4.8 million.  So that actually we are in receipt of £1½ million less now than if we had left taxes as they were in 1957.</P>

      <P>I told the Deputy the tax position in every Budget I brought in. I said: &ldquo;I am putting a penny on cigarettes,&rdquo; let us say, &ldquo;and I expect to get in so much.  I am taking 6d. off income tax&rdquo;, let us say, &ldquo;and I expect to lose so much&rdquo;.  I put these down as they were calculated and the result is that if we had done nothing to change taxation in that period, I would have £1½ million more this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to the increase of £56.1 million as compared with 1956-57 in this Book of Estimates, but there are some big spending Departments, where every Deputy will, if he asks for anything, always ask for a bit more&mdash; Social Welfare, for instance.  Social Welfare cost £22.5 million in 1956-57. It is now £28.5 million, £6 million more.  Health expenditure has gone up by £1½ million; Education, including Universities, is up from £12.3 million to £21.8 million; Agriculture from £7.9 million to £24 million and Agricultural Grants from £4.8 million to £8.8 million.  In these four headings, Social Welfare, Health, Education and Agriculture, the increase has been £38 million and that is £38 million of an <Col N="211" /> increase in general expenditure over 1958 which leaves £20 million.  It is easy to go and get smaller amounts to take up that £20 million but I am not going to bother the House with small figures at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, mentioned that bank credit for agriculture had gone up.  He said that from April, 1957 to 1962, the amount went up from £17.2 million to £34.7 million.  He did not say, but I am saying now, that amount from the Agricultural Credit Corporation went up from £2½ million to £4 million, so that, actually, we had an increase from something under £20 million to £38.7 million.  We have heard for four or five days now, largely I should say from Deputies on Fine Gael benches, about the plight of the farmers of the country.  While I do not claim that farmers are well off, I cannot agree with Fine Gael Deputies in their estimate of the farmers' condition at present.  The banks and credit corporations have been increasing credit to the farmers.  I did not make any inquiries in the past week or two on hearing these speeches here, but the last time I did inquire I was told that in practically all cases the farmers' instalments were repaid to the credit corporations on the dates due.  The farmers are meeting their obligations even though they are getting much bigger credit than in 1957.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation, I admit, have been encouraged by me and the Minister for Agriculture to be generous in the credit they give but the commercial banks over which we have no control lend money where they think it pays and obviously they think it pays at present to make bigger advances to the farmers than were made in 1957.  In addition, the price of land has gone very high and the price of conacre is higher than for many years, higher practically than it has ever been.  You have these indicators from outside the farmers themselves which show that farming is not as dead or as hopeless as some of the Fine Gael speakers would like us to believe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney said that if Fianna <Col N="212" /> Fáil were in touch with the people, they would have heard the talk about luxury hotels etc., while farmers were in the very low state in which they are at present.  I think we are as much in touch with people as Deputy Rooney or any Deputy on the opposite side but I admit I do not meet the type of people Deputy Rooney and other Fine Gael speakers have been talking about as farmers.  I do not have to listen to the envious, evil-minded, discontented morons whom the Fine Gael Deputies seem to meet down the country who have complaints to make about everything and no encouragement at all for the people of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <P>The creamery farmers surely are not morons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fellows who talk for them are the morons; people like Deputy Rooney.  The Fine Gael speeches are purely demagogic, misrepresentations, misquotations of speeches, falsifications of figures and so on, a mixture of all these things which Fine Gael have tried for many years.  There is a continuous wail of how badly off they are in these places. As I say, I have met the farmers.  I meet them very often in the country. As a matter of fact, my constituency is largely rural and I nearly always meet farmers when I am down there. We chat about things and they are normal people.  They are not always complaining but they are very good farmers.  I have come to the conclusion that every bad farmer follows Fine Gael and tells them he cannot make ends meet.  Fine Gael are always pleading for the bad farmer.</P>
      <P>For instance, Deputy Dillon said that we had reduced the price of wheat. We have not.  We have increased the price for the good farmer and reduced it for the bad farmer.  Deputy Dillon and the Fine Gael Party are always speaking for the bad farmer.  They want a better price for the fellow who brings in dirt to the miller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What the miller calls dirt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is right, and what Fine Gael call good farming, as far as I can see.  Fine Gael speakers <Col N="213" /> also complained about the rise in bacon grading standards.  Surely we must raise our standards and try to get for the farmers who produce the good pigs a better price and bring down the price for those who produce bad pigs. Unless there are improved pigs and better bacon, it is not likely that we will get an export market for it.</P>
      <P>There were three matters which practically every Fine Gael Deputy repeated.  One was the matter of Ministers attending dinners.  This is the low form of talk which we hear from practically every Fine Gael speaker.  If they had more experience, they would believe, as I believe, that you get just as good a dinner at home as in an hotel.  They do not know that but they will learn.</P>
      <P>The second point was that they all referred to the increases for judges. As I said before, that was a real demagogic touch.  We gave our reasons for that increase.  We believed that the judges should get an increase like every other section of the community. Every member of the Fine Gael Party who criticised us on this matter should read the speech of their former Leader, Deputy Costello, and learn what he thought about the scheme.  If they do that, I shall be quite satisfied.</P>
      <P>Now I come to the Health Act.  I said that it would not cost more than 2/- in the £ and every Fine Gael speaker quotes that back at me.  One would imagine that if there had been no Health Act, there would not have been a penny increase since 1953.  They come along and say that I said it would not cost more than 2/- but that actually it has increased rates by 5/-or 6/-.  I obtained the figures for Wexford in this regard.  I had these last year also.  These are last year's figures because this year's rate has not yet been struck.  The total for all health and public assistance in 1953-54, before the Health Act, was 9/4¾d. and the total last year was 15/0½d., so that the increase was 5/8d.  For the mental hospital, for instance, which has nothing to do with the Health Act, the increase was 1/3d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase for all their staff, nurses, doctors and so on, came to <Col N="214" /> 2/6d.  That is a total of 3/9 which leaves 1/11d.  Other items could be taken also.  For instance, an incapacity scheme was brought in under the Health Act which, as far as I remember the definition of the Act, was for a person who had no means, who was permanently incapacitated and who was not insured, and who got a certain amount from the local authorities.  I think it was about a £1 a week.  That saved the local authorities a good deal on home assistance.  It was about 6d. in the £ in Wexford.  There was that saving and therefore it should scarcely be counted against the Health Act at all, but it is evident that whatever the Health Act may have cost, it certainly did not cost the 5/- or 6/- by which the rates have increased.  The increase would have been there in any case to some extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell from Limerick, who made a typical Fine Gael speech, said there was no industry for Limerick. I must say that I personally saw a reference during the last week to the extension of the cement factory which is costing £1 million and there is also to be a new German plywood factory costing £500,000, and of course there is the new luxury hotel about which we heard so much.  Deputy Carroll talked about Limerick and said that when he visited it, he could not get a bed there, so evidently there is need for an hotel.  Deputy O'Donnell can call it a luxury hotel, if he likes; it may bring business to Limerick.  I hope it will, and if so, it is not going to do any great harm.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the control of prices.  I must say I have never been in favour of controlling prices.  I remember when I was Minister for Agriculture, prices were controlled, they were fixed, and in my opinion, they were always fixed higher than they should have been.  When price control was removed, prices went down in many cases.  You must get some person or tribunal to fix prices and if somebody makes an impression on those fixing the prices, they may very often fix them higher than they should be.  I think we are better without control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> Deputy McGilligan made a long speech, the gist of which was to prove that we were anti-labour.  He also attacked the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  The first time I remember Deputy McGilligan as a politician was when he was a Minister when the Shannon Scheme was being opened.  He manfully maintained that 27/- a week was enough for a labourer.  I remember married men in Limerick who went to get a job and they had to keep themselves there and their wives at home, all on 27/- a week, but Deputy McGilligan stood for it, although he was attacked and he said that it was as much as the State could afford. What does he think about the White Paper?  He condemned it.  In 1948 when introducing his Budget, he said:</P>
    <P>The substantial wage and salary increases already secured by all classes of workers, with such further advantages as shorter hours, paid holidays, children's allowances and other increases in social services, have gone as far as is possible, in present circumstances, to meet the claims of social justice.</P>
    <P>All these advantages were put there by Fianna Fáil, of course.  He was speaking of what was already done and he said:</P>
    <P>I would make a most earnest appeal to all employees not to seek further increases in monetary remuneration or improvements in working conditions unless warranted by exceptional circumstances.  Recent experience confirms that the benefit of an increase in money incomes is rapidly swallowed up by rising prices.</P>
    <P>If I had seen that in time, I would have put it into the White Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us talk about one thing at a time.  Deputy McGilligan changed his mind after 1948.  In his Budget speech in 1951, his last one, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> Increases in remuneration offer no escape from this unwelcome development; indeed, they can only accelerate the process of inflation and cause social injustice as between those able to improve or maintain their position and those who cannot enlarge their incomes and are therefore forced to assume an undue burden of hardship.</P>
    <P>In his speech this year, Deputy McGilligan attacked the Taoiseach because the Taoiseach had said that those on fixed incomes were those most likely to suffer.  He thought differently in 1951 when, in his Budget Statement, he went on:</P>
    <P>For this reason, the Government ask for restraint in the putting forward of wage and salary claims and have taken measures intended to limit price increases to those justified by increases in costs.</P>
    <P>He has changed his mind.  He was succeeded by Deputy Lemass in the Department of Industry and Commerce and Deputy Lemass was able to get that Department going again after it had been moribund for ten years. Deputy McGilligan has never forgiven him for that.  Deputy P. O'Donnell told us the 1956 debacle was due to Suez. I remember reading a report from Britain after the Suez crisis which said that Suez had very little effect on the British economy.  Surely it should have had more of an effect on Britain's economy than on ours?</P>
    <P>I am afraid Suez was a poor excuse for the Coalition to make, but of course they had to make some excuse. Deputy P. O'Donnell also said we had staked everything on getting into the Common Market.  Now, he said, the Common Market is out, and he went on to attack us in the usual Fine Gael way because prospects of our joining the Common Market are poor.  In other words, though Fine Gael have been supporting us in our application, when we face difficulties, they rat on us. They just rat and leave us there to carry the burden ourselves.  Deputy P. O'Donnell is not the type one would like to go loan hunting with because he might let one down in a crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> He went on to say that the British Commonwealth countries might meet and might strengthen their ties or their bonds and might make some agreement which would leave us out in the cold, and blamed us for this.  Was it not his Government who brought us out of the British Commonwealth?  He wanted to know if I objected.  I said no, but I wanted to ask him why he is squirming about it.  We are not squirming. After all, if it was his Government who brought us out of the Commonwealth, why should he be squirming?</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan spoke yesterday evening for an hour and 55 minutes and made what purported to be official promises from Fine Gael. He prefaced all his promises by saying to the House and to the country that if Fine Gael get in, they will do so and so. They were official promises, as far as Deputy Flanagan could commit Fine Gael.  Dealing with the teachers' salaries and Garda pay claims, he said if Fine Gael were over here, they would be all increased, presumably whether they proved their case or not.  He said health charges would be borne by the Exchequer and taken off the rates, all road charges would be made a national charge and every farmer in this country would get £1,000.  Even Deputy Dillon did not go as far as that.  Deputy Dillon said that credit up to £1,000 would be made available to them.  I would not mind saying that much myself.</P>

If they borrowed that money, it would come to £300 million and if Fine Gael pay for it, it will cost them about £20 million a year to finance it. Then Deputy Flanagan winds up by saying there would be no increase in taxation.</P>

      <P>Are we to take Deputy Flanagan as speaking for Fine Gael?</P>
      <P>Our attention was drawn by many speakers to the fact that our exports were lower in 1962 than in 1961.  They were lower.  The big item&mdash;it was not the only item&mdash;in that was our cattle. There was an abnormal export of cattle in 1961 because of the carry-over from 1960 and there were normal exports of cattle again in 1962.  As a result, our exports were lower in 1962, but, as I have said, cattle alone did not account for the whole lot.  However, we have done well in our exports. After all, when the Coalition Government were in office, our exports were going down.  In 1954, they were £115 million.  By 1956, they were £108 million and then we had to start all over again.</P>

      <P>The principal point of Deputy McQuillan's speech was an attack on private enterprise.  He attacked us and he attacked Fine Gael &mdash;in that he was impartial enough&mdash; but his attack on us was for our devotion to private enterprise.  Then he said we were inconsistent because we claimed to have a planned economy. I do not see anything inconsistent in that at all.  We believe in private enterprise as far as possible.  There are certain cases where private enterprise does not appear to fit in.  Take the turf business.  No private enterprise would undertake that business, I am quite sure, because it was not easy to see a profit in it when we were starting off.  Therefore, a public utility was set up.  As far as possible, we believe private enterprise should be encouraged.  I do not think it is inconsistent to have a planned economy in addition to depending on private enterprise. Neither do I think it inconsistent to give a grant to help private enterprise to establish industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan also talked about unemployment and emigration.  They have not, of course, been eliminated but unemployment has been reduced by 27,000&mdash;which is a substantial figure&mdash;and emigration by 31,000 at mid-February this year as compared with 1957.  These two figures are fairly satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I want to tell Fine Gael, in case they do not know it, that big countries and small countries now meet on an even footing.  There is no such thing as the big country trying to intimidate the small country.  They meet as equals.  We may not get what we want but we do not have to give anything, either, unless we agree to it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton said he gathered from some Fianna Fáil speeches that the Government are satisfied everything is all right.  I do not think that is true.  I do not think any of us feels satisfied that everything is accomplished which we sought to provide for the people.  There would always be something to be done.  No Government can ever afford to feel satisfied. A Government should be dissatisfied and strive to do better and better all the time.  However, we claim we have made big advances.</P>
      <P>Advances have been made in the real incomes of wage earners.  Advances have been made in the real value of social welfare benefits.  No matter who or what you take&mdash;the old age pensioner, the widow, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit or anything else &mdash;the amount now has more value in real terms than in 1957.  In other words, the increases have been bigger than the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a bigger national income; we have bigger industrial and agricultural output.  As I mentioned already, <Col N="221" /> we have bigger exports.  We have bigger incomes from tourism, and so on. These claims are all right but they do not by any means satisfy us that everything has been done.  We believe <Col N="222" /> we are on the right road, though we may yet have a long way to go, to achieve a better standard for all sections of the community.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,370,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund (No. 14 of 1950 and No. 11 of 1952).</P>
      <P>Mar is eol do Theachtaí, is gnáthach Meastacháin mo Roinne-se a phlé le na chéile.  Ar an ócáid seo, tá dhá Mheastachán Fhorlíontacha os comhair na Dála, ceann i leith Árachais Shóisialaigh agus ceann i leith Cúnaimh Shóisialaigh, agus mholfainn go dtógfaí an dá Mheastachán le chéile.</P>
      <P>Séard is príomh-chúis leis na Meastacháin Fhorlíontacha seo ná na méadaithe a rinneadh i rátaí árachais shóisialaigh le h-éifeacht ó thosach mî Eanáir seo chaite agus i rátaí cúnaimh shóisialaigh le h-éifeacht ó thosach mí Lúnasa, 1962.</P>
      <P>I gcás árachais shóisialaigh, táthar ag lorg £1,370,000 sa bhreis.  Baineann £800,000 den tsuim sin leis na méadaithe i rátaí árachais a luaidh mé cheana, agus tá £515,000 ag teastáil toisc bun-chostas na scéimeanna árachais shóisialaigh a bheith níos aoirde ná mar a ceapadh ar dtús.  In a theannta san, is gá £71,000 a aisíoch don Chiste Árachais Shóisialaigh i leith na bliana 1961-62, de bhrí go raibh glan-chaiteachas an Chiste níos mó de £71,000 ná an méid a íocadh isteach ann ón Stát-Chiste sa bhliain sin. Tá mion-spáráil agus breis chaiteachais faoi mhírchinn eile agus dá bharr sin sé £1,370,000 an méid glan atáthar ag lorg in aghaidh na bliana seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> I gcás Cúnaimh Shóisialaigh, sé £694,000 an méid glan atá de dhíth. Meastar go gcosnóidh na rátaí nua agus na feabhsanna eile ins na scéimeanna cúnaimh shóisialaigh £865,000 sa bhliain seo.  Táthar ag súil áfach le spáráil ar bhun-chostas pinsean seananois agus pinsean na mbaintreach de bhrí gur lugha líon na bpinsinéirí ná mar a ceapadh ar dtús.  Mar is eol do Theachtaí, tá laghdú i líon na bpinsinéirí neamh-ranníochacha in aghaidh na bliana toisc go bhfuil níos mó duine i dteideal pinsean ranníocach. Nuair a chuirtear san áireamh breis chaiteachais de £38,000 ar liúntais leanaí agus mion-spáráil ar fho-mhírchinn eile den Vóta, sé £694,000 atá de dhíth in aghaidh na bliana seo.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, it is customary to deal with the Estimates for my Department as a group.  On this occasion, a Supplementary Estimate arises in respect of both the Social Insurance and the Social Assistance Votes, and I would suggest, if the House has no objection, that we should deal with the two Supplementary Estimates together.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Insurance heading, an additional amount of £1,370,000 is being sought in respect of the current financial year.  The need for the Supplementary Estimate arises principally from the additional cost in 1962-63 of the increase in the rates of social insurance benefits provided under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1962, with effect from January, 1963.</P>
    <P>The main increases on the original estimates for the various benefits amount to approximately £1,315,000 made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The overall increase of £1,315,000 is reduced by an expected small saving of £15,000 on the original provision for treatment benefit, thus bringing the additional sum required to £1,300,000. To the latter figure must be added a sum of £34,000 for excess expenditure on administration costs, mainly due to adjustment of underclaims against the Social Insurance Fund in the previous year.</P>
    <P>There is also due to be paid by the Exchequer into the Social Insurance Fund a sum of approximately £71,000 which is the amount by which the Exchequer contribution from subhead A of the Social Insurance Vote paid to the Fund in 1961-62 fell short of the actual deficit on the working of the Fund in that year.  Payments out of subhead A in any financial year are provisional as the actual expenditure and income of the Fund are not known until after the close of the year.</P>
    <P>The estimated net additional expenditure on benefits and administration costs in 1962-63 amounting to £1,334,000, already detailed, and the adjustment of the underdraw of £71,000 <Col N="226" /> from the Exchequer in 1961-62 total £1,405,000.  This sum is reduced to £1,370,000, the amount of the Supplementary Estimate for Social Insurance, by expected net additional income of £35,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>This additional income represents anticipated additional receipts of £150,000 from employment contributions offset by the non-receipt in the current financial year of £115,000 under reciprocal arrangements.  This sum was included in the original estimates but is not now expected to be received until after the close of the financial year.</P>
    <P>On the Social Assistance side, an additional sum of £694,000 is required to meet the additional cost in the current financial year of implementing the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous provisions) Act, 1962, which increased the rates of old age and blind pensions, widows' non-contributory pensions and unemployment assistance as from August, 1962, and effected other improvements in these services.</P>
    <P>The cost of these increases and improvements in the current year is estimated at £865,000 made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The foregoing figures fall to be adjusted, however, in the light of other factors.  In the case of old age and blind pensions it is estimated that there will be a saving of £169,000 on the original provision of £9,182,000.  The saving is due to the numbers of non-contributory pensioners being fewer than had been anticipated.  The net requirement for old age and blind pensions is accordingly reduced to £352,000.</P>
    <P>In the case of unemployment assistance, the original provision of £1,100,000 needs to be increased by £71,000 as the numbers of recipients are somewhat higher than had been estimated.  Accordingly, the additional requirement of £224,000 for this service, <Col N="227" /> already mentioned, falls to be increased to £295,000.</P>
    <P>The additional provision of £120,000 for widows' non-contributory pensions is reduced to £66,000 as there is an estimated saving of £54,000 on the original provision of £1,842,000 for the relevant subhead.  The saving is due to the fact that the average weekly value of pensions in operation is slightly lower than anticipated.</P>
    <P>The net additional requirement for the foregoing services is, therefore, £713,000.  To this sum must be added a supplementary provision of £38,000 in respect of children's allowances. The original provision for this service for 1962-63 was £7,109,000 but there is a rising trend in the current year in the cost of children's allowances and it is now estimated that the expenditure for the year will be approximately £7,147,000.</P>
    <P>The net total of £751,000 for the four services to which I referred is reduced to £720,000, as savings amounting to £31,000 in all are expected to arise on other subheads of the Vote.</P>
    <P>A further reduction of £26,000 on the additional sum required to be voted arises because it is now estimated that there will be a surplus of that amount in the appropriations-in-aid of the Vote which were originally estimated at £338,000.  The surplus appropriations-in-aid are attributable as to £14,000 to expected higher receipts in respect of recoveries of overpayments of old age pension and, as to the balance of £12,000, to repayments to the Vote by the Social Insurance Fund of interim payments of social assistance made from the Vote pending establishment of title by recipients to insurance benefits.  When these surplus receipts are taken into account the net additional sum required for 1962-63 for this Vote is reduced to £694,000, which is the amount being sought in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have agreed to taking the Estimates as a group and are agreeable to the passage of these Supplementary Estimates.  They are required to carry <Col N="228" /> on the work of the Department in providing for those sections of the community who are most in need.  For those reasons the House is agreeable to furnishing the Minister with the money needed for the continuance of the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts which the House has passed.</P>
      <P>There are some remarks I have to make regarding the administration of the Department.  I note that, despite the prognostications of the Minister when dealing with the Estimate, he has had to eat humble pie by increasing the Vote for Unemployment Assistance. He was one of the Ministers who said the indications were that the present year would be such a year of affluence that he would not require from the Exchequer as much money as heretofore to look after people who are normally able to look after themselves. On Page 3 of his speech, he had to speak of a sum of £1,100,000 and it has been increased by £71,000 as the number of recipients has risen this year.  One will recall the promise of the leader of this Government that his Government would provide 100,000 new jobs.  This is further proof of how false that estimate was and, if the Estimate was not false, how inept the Government have been in bringing to fruition their plan to provide 100,000 new jobs for our people.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that we have to provide this additional money to cover unemployment assistance and that we are not in a position to provide these people with work of a productive character which would be better for themselves and the country.  If the efforts of the Government in this direction were in any way successful the Minister would not have to come to the House with this Supplementary Estimate.  He would have money left over at the end of the year and he would be able to prove the claims of his Government that conditions were so good in the country that the money originally provided for him was not needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people who genuinely think that the employment situation and general conditions in the country are exceedingly good.  These people will be surprised at the introduction of <Col N="229" /> this Supplementary Estimate.  Deputy Meaney, speaking on the Vote on Account, said that the people were never so well off.  If they were never so well off, what is the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate for unemployment assistance?  We are entitled to ask why there has not been a considerable increase in non-contributory old age pensions.  Instead, there is an indication of some reduction in the numbers.  There were also indications that there would be an easement of the means test.  If there has not been a tighter application of the means test, how does the situation arise where fewer people are now qualifying for the receipt of old age pensions?</P>
    <P>It would be well if we had a reexamination of what is involved financially in the administration of the various sections of the Minister's Department with regard to old age pensions.  There is a feeling that we have absorbed so many who were in the non-contributory category into the contributory category that there is now less necessity for the means test. It would be well to know what the cost to the country would be if we were to abandon completely the means test in relation to old age pensions. We should be told what it would amount to, first, by way of additional expense to the Exchequer and, secondly, what would be saved by the elimination of that section of the Department which has to administer the means test and what saving would accrue from the release of those civil servants so engaged.</P>
    <P>I am not advancing the suggestion that the State should use that money to provide for new means tests or new non-contributory pensions.  I am not saying there is not a case to be made for coming to the relief of the poorer sections of the community, but if we have such money to dispense, might it not be more desirable to give immediate relief to those in the lower bracket of old age pensioners?</P>
    <P>These are questions agitating the minds of many people at present.  If the Minister cannot do so to-day, it would be well if he could, before the main Estimate, provide us with information on the following points.  What <Col N="230" /> would be involved in the complete abolition of the means test in relation to the non-contributory old age pension? What saving would accrue to the Exchequer from the elimination of the civil servants employed in the administration of the means test? There is also a strong demand for the lowering of the qualifying age, particularly in the case of females.  If we are now in the position the Minister for Justice says&mdash;that this Government have performed an economic miracle&mdash; surely it should be possible for the Department of Social Welfare to come to the relief of the community at large and to apply more of the means the Government have successfully taken from the people by means of increased taxation and more active pursuance of income tax collection to the benefit of those sections of the people who have to depend on social welfare benefits?</P>
    <P>I would welcome some statement from the Minister indicating what his mind and the mind of the Government is regarding these matters&mdash; whether they think it would be in the interest of the beneficiaries to give immediate relief to the unfortunate old people who find it so difficult to live on what they are getting at the moment?  There is definite proof of the increase in the cost of living.  It is incontestable.  It is revealed by Government figures, but we did not have to wait for Government statements to know how much the cost of living has increased for these people.  The fact that we have this inflated Estimate shows that there cannot have been an advance for those who are in receipt of the benefits.  Any advance these people get is immediately dissipated by what they have to pay for the simple necessaries of life, without going into the field of luxuries.  In order to ensure that the Department will be in a position to maintain the present level of support for those people, the Estimate should be passed by the House.</P>
    <P>I want to close on the note on which I began.  The very fact that the Minister has been obliged to seek this money for assistance to the unemployed is absolutely contrary to the Minister's forecast when introducing <Col N="231" /> his main Estimate and in complete defiance of statements made by members of the Government regarding the conditions of the people.  If that position of wealth obtained, why the necessity to come to the aid of the unemployed to this increased extent?  If the Government had done anything towards implementing the promises they gave to the electorate, or the assurance that they could provide 100,000 jobs, it would not have been necessary for the Minister to come back to the House to seek additional money to aid those for whom they have not found employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree that the Supplementary Estimate should be passed with the least possible delay.  We were very glad the recent increases in social welfare benefits were applied.  We consider that the increase in stamps which the workers had to pay were well worth the increases granted to social welfare recipients.  Very definitely, the contributory old age pension and the operation of it has been welcomed.</P>
      <P>However, as the previous speaker said, a desire has been expressed that the old age pension, particularly the contributory pension, should be applicable earlier than 70 years.  The cost to the Exchequer would not be very much and it would relieve the employment position.  There is no reason why the Minister should not consider reducing the qualifying age to 65.  That would encourage many people at present loath to retire, because they do not want to line up at a labour exchange and sign on for unemployment benefit, to do so.  We hope there will be an improvement in that respect.  It would give the old people a definite sense of security.  It is a pity that some people, including the Department of Finance, have taken it on themselves to try to reduce the efficacy of the pension by mucking around&mdash; that is the only word for it&mdash;with pensions of State and semi-State bodies and trying to reduce the amount because of the contributory old age pension.  It is a most mean and despicable thing and it should not be allowed.  I am not blaming the present Minister.  He is not responsible for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> There is also the question of qualification. I would ask the Minister, as I did in numerous Dáil questions, to reconsider the very limited number of people who have been disqualified for the pension, despite the fact they had upwards of 40 years stamps to their credit because they had not stamps on within the past 10 or 15 years.  I cannot impress too strongly on the Minister that he should make every effort to meet those people.  They were excluded by regulation, but I would ask him to relax that regulation and let those people in.  They will be getting fewer and this will not happen in the case of the people coming along.  In common justice, those people are entitled to be given the pension, when people who have only slightly over ten years stamps can qualify.  It is an injustice to which the Minister should not be a party.</P>
    <P>In regard to unemployment benefit, perhaps the Minister could so something about the long delay which occurs when application is made, if there is any doubt about the applicant's right.  I was talking to a man last night who has been waiting three months for the Department to decide whether he is entitled to unemployment benefit because he has five or six acres of land.  He is not entitled to unemployment assistance.  It is shocking that this unfortunate man must wait until somebody eventually gets around to having some kind of investigation. Surely it could be decided within a week or a fortnight?</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for the Minister's officials.  The officials of the Department of Social Welfare are the most obliging and courteous civil servants it has been my pleasure to deal with.  If there is some regulation which ties them up and prevents them from doing the decent thing and dealing with the matter quickly, surely the Minister should iron that out?</P>
    <P>As far as the non-contributory old age pension is concerned, we cannot stress too much the necessity of reducing the qualifying age, particularly in the case of women.  Secondly, we should do something more than we are doing to try to give those who are <Col N="233" /> entitled to the full pension a little more to live on.  It is just too bad that people, who, but for the Minister's regulation, would have qualified for a contributory old age pension, have nothing to live on except 32/6 a week. If the Minister wants any proof of this, and proof that they are in a bad way, all he has to do is check with the local authorities and find the number who are receiving home assistance.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this House knows that the one thing an independent spirited old person does not want to do is to look for home assistance, if he or she can possibly avoid it.  Surely we should not be the people to force them into the position at the end of their days that they have to apply for home help? I ask the Minister to look into this and, even if he cannot see his way to increasing the amount of non-contributory old age pension substantially for those who are on the reduced pension, to increase at least the pensions of those who do get the full pension now. The Minister should do that.  He has all the necessary evidence to justify his doing it.  If he does it he will be doing a very good job and he will get the thanks not alone of the old people concerned but of everybody in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any political points as to whether or not the numbers in receipt of unemployment have grown.  To most of us, the amount that has to be paid out is disappointing. We believe the amount should be very much less.  But it has to be paid out and, since it has to be paid out, the Labour Party will not place any obstacles in the Minister's way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise again a point I raised with the Minister by way of question and answer recently in connection with subhead D of this Vote, widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions.  There are a limited number of cases in the Department which appear to be virtually insoluble.  They represent the case of women whose husbands disappeared many years ago and have never been heard of since, but whose deaths cannot be proved.  I do not suppose there <Col N="234" /> are more than a couple of hundred cases outstanding, but the dilemma exists that there is apparently no means of these women ever getting the widows' pensions to which their years and circumstances would entitle them, were they in a position to give the Department adequate proof of the deaths of their husbands.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that where he is satisfied that a woman has not heard from her husband for a period of 20 years, that in itself would be accepted as evidence of widowhood for the purpose of widows' and orphans' pensions, unless and until the fact was established that her husband, in fact, survived.  I cannot imagine that anybody in any part of this House, or indeed in any section of the Department of Finance, would raise any very serious objection to a rough and ready solution of this kind.  If two or three women had received widows' pensions, and their husbands subsequently turned up, that would not be likely to wreck the State.  In a very limited number of cases, real hardship is being done, which I do not believe anybody wants to see continue and which could be very easily resolved by a rough and ready procedure such as I have outlined.</P>
      <P>The common law in matters of much greater substance actually provides a procedure for the presumption of death in certain cases so that the distribution of personal assets or real property can be proceeded with.  For a person who would be eligible for the non-contributory widows' pension, the procedure to establish presumption of death would, of course, be quite out of the question as it is a relatively expensive operation involving certain statutory advertisements in newspapers and other precautions that are deemed to be necessary for the safety of real property and substantial personal assets. I suggest to the Minister that such precautions are wholly unnecessary in the case of a widow's non-contributory pension application and that a rough and ready rule of the kind I suggest would be suitable and should, without delay, be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to raise is in regard to subhead A.  It has been suggested and, I think, truly suggested, <Col N="235" /> that elderly people who have been independent all their lives are extremely reluctant, when they qualify for the non-contributory old age pension, to look for home assistance.  It is true that the means test at present prescribed permits of such elderly people having a certain amount of savings to which regard is not had for the purpose of reducing the non-contributory old age pension; but, over and above that, I think the time has come when we should, with propriety, mitigate the regulations in regard to old people doing light work. There are a great many old people in the country, old people of 70 years of age, who are very well able to undertake small assignments, such as light gardening, caretaking, and other light work of that kind.  All of us are familiar with old friends who have been in our service for protracted periods; when they reach 70 years of age, they do not go out on the streets. They remain in their positions with lesser responsibilities; they are allowed to carry on.  I think that is a very good thing.</P>
    <P>My experience of people in all walks of life, both in the professions and in ordinary employment, is only too frequently the sad fact that, when a man arrives at pension age, he retires on superannuation and the next thing is one is following his funeral.  That does not apply only to those eligible for the non-contributory old age pension. Often in regard to the most distinguished public servants, who retire after long service, the next thing one hears about them is that they are dead. The same is true of the businessman who lays down his burden of responsibility and withdraws from his business altogether; only too frequently he breaks up and dies within a relatively short time.  It is a good thing, if people are physically fit, that they should carry on with some occupation.</P>
    <P>I met a friend recently who told me he had retired and had undertaken some kind of voluntary work.  I complimented him on his public spirit. &ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wanted some reason to get up in the morning.  I could not live without it.&rdquo;<Col N="236" /> Expressed in that homely way, one can understand at once what was in his mind&mdash;the normal, admirable detestation of idleness for a person well able to undertake some work, albeit he is not able to do as much as when he was in his full strength.  Now that applies just as much to elderly people who are drawing old age pensions as it does to retired civil servants, bankers, businessmen, or anybody else. But in the case of the old age pensioners the regrettable fact is that, if an elderly person does earn £3 or £4 a week in some part-time job, that is taken into consideration and set off against his right to claim the old age pension.</P>
    <P>I admit freely that a great many of these people qualify for the contributory old age pension.  In their case, they are entitled to draw the pension and to earn.  That applies with particular relevance to the ordinary trade union employee, the industrial worker, and so forth.  But it does not apply so much in the country.  There are a great many elderly people who are entitled to non-contributory old age pensions who can do a hand's turn from time to time but are debarred by the consideration that, if they do, they disqualify themselves for the old age pension.  You get the peculiar situation that, if they work for a few weeks, the total of their earnings is averaged over the year and to that is added their little bit of savings calculated on a special basis of so much per cent. for the first few hundred, and so on, and that may deprive them of the pension.</P>
    <P>I think that is a matter worthy of examination and consideration, more particularly now when we have a system of contributory old age pensions, the recipients of which may work and still continue to draw their pensions without regard being had to what they earn.  We should do something for that section of the community who do not come within that provision and who would like to be free to do a hand's turn and still draw the full contributory benefit to which they would otherwise be entitled.  Perhaps that is a slightly more complex question than the relatively simple and limited problems to <Col N="237" /> which I have referred under subhead D. I do press on the Minister most strongly the view that the liability likely to accrue to the Exchequer under the reform I suggest in respect of subhead D is infinitesimal.  Yet it means a very material loss and sense of deprivation to the few women who are labouring under this disability.  I am satisfied it is within the Minister's power by regulation to put right what is wrong and I urge him most strenuously to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to examine the question of the delay involved where people employed in Britain return to Ireland ill.  I think the delay in securing benefit is unduly long.  In at least two or three cases in the past few months, I found the delay extended to six or seven weeks.  I can appreciate that some of this is due to having to get the record of employment in Britain, but it still seems unduly long, especially when a person is ill at home and very often without any means of sustenance other than disablement benefit.  I ask the Minister to see if his Department can speed up payment of benefit.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to the Minister seeking the money required for the benefit of these needy people.  It is good to see the money being spent and those representing the people who contribute by way of social welfare stamps feel that any money spent in that way or in improving benefits is well spent. All we regret is that the benefit is so low and any effort the Minister will make now or in the future to improve benefits will be assured of the support of my Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the plight of the old age pensioner in Dublin but I take it the same would apply to old age pensioners in other urban centres.  I raised this matter elsewhere and advocated a differential rate of pension as between urban and rural pensioners.  That was not received very favourably.  Yet I think an important Department such as Social Welfare which deals so extensively with the problem of old age and old age pensioners <Col N="238" /> should examine that aspect of the matter.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, there are numerous old age pensioners, sometimes husband and wife, living on their own, with no relatives to assist them.  It is an unfortunate reflection on our society that old people are not wanted today in many parts of the country, and particularly in the cities.  We also have numerous old people living in rooms and their housing presents a problem for the corporation.  We also have them accommodated in schemes where flats are specially provided for them.  They are in a really serious plight.  Some have supplementary incomes from public assistance but then there is the undesirable feature of administration under which one official comes along and examines them and asks questions about the old age pension.  When they seek additional income from another source, you have a whole chain of inquiries about them by the public assistance officer.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister and the Department to examine this aspect of the problem with the view to securing some co-ordination between public assistance and social welfare inquiries and also examine the possibility of giving the urban dweller who, I think, is more hardly hit, more consideration. Living problems are more serious in urban centres, as fuel alone costs much more than in rural areas where the people concerned may live near a turf bog.  I think urban pensioners deserve more consideration and I ask the Minister, who has shown a very human approach to this problem, to examine those aspects of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about time the Minister had another look at the old age pension position and examined the possibility of abolishing the means test.  It may be argued that it would cost so many extra pounds but we should also look at what the administration is already costing.  You may say it means only a handful of officials but by the time a question goes to the Department and an answer comes back, it involves quite a number.  A further argument may be made that moneyed classes should not qualify. <Col N="239" /> My answer is that the moneyed classes would have to pay it back in income tax and it might be their actual undoing if they accept it.  Again, on the administration question, the Department should examine its conscience because we have about 2,000 extra civil servants and I think this Department has quite a few of those.  There were complaints because we had so many when we were in power but we now have 2,000 extra and we are reaching the stage where the cost of administration will outstep the actual benefits paid.  The Department should examine that aspect of the matter.</P>
      <P>Another question that arises in my area is one that I think has been put to the Minister&mdash;if not, it will be&mdash; that is, the possibility of the Department combining with other groups to provide a better type of building in Galway.  This may be a question of administration but I am putting it at this stage to the Minister to examine it because it may be that later on if these groups get together&mdash;the present building in Galway is not to be admired and there is no place for the workers or those who visit the place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Finally, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the need for expediting decisions in his Department. I have had many complaints about such delays in regard to benefits or pensions and the Minister should do something in regard to expediting decisions on these matters.  Some of them go on for months, which is very wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for the manner in which they have dealt with this request for this supplementary sum, which, as I said, <Col N="240" /> is mainly due to the increase in rates of benefit as a result of the Social Welfare Bill of last year.  It is true that part of the increase being asked for in respect of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit is due to the fact that there has been a greater number of claims than was expected. I cannot accept, however, the implications which Deputy O'Sullivan put on it.  It means that we were slightly more optimistic than the position justified. There has only been a marginal increase in the numbers and that arose mainly during the past winter.  It is well known that the increase in the number of claims is largely due to weather conditions, both here and in England.  The very severe winter caused a lot of unemployment, particularly in the building trade, and in forestry at home, and a number of workers found themselves out of employment in England and came back here.  As I say, the increase has been only marginal and the trend is becoming more favourable now.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the means test for non-contributory old age pensions.  The question of what it would cost to abolish it was also raised and an estimate has been made of what that would cost.  It would be approximately £4 million, having allowed for an approximate saving of £25,000 in administration costs.  I may say that if I had £4 million available to me for the purpose of old age pensioners, I would not be inclined to use it in that way.  It would be much more equitable to use it to raise the rates so that those with no means would get their due share of whatever was available.</P>
      <P>In that regard, I might remind Deputies that there is a disregard in the means test of approximately £1 a week or £52 a year in regard to the old age pension.  A person may have that amount and still qualify for the maximum non-contributory old age pension. That is a sufficient differential and any moneys that become available to me would be more equitably used in raising rates so that everybody would get a fair share of whatever money it was possible to distribute in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully suggested that the old <Col N="241" /> age pension should be made available at an earlier age than 70, with particular reference to the contributory old age pension.  I think a comparison was made with the position in Great Britain, but of course their scheme and our scheme are not strictly comparable because there is a retirement condition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was referred to, but anyway, the position is not entirely comparable.  There is no retirement condition here and if we were to reduce the age further, obviously one thing that would have to be taken into account is whether a retirement condition should be attached or not.  However, I do not think that is the most urgent problem to be dealt with and indeed there are many arguments against it.  The tendency in Great Britain is to try to raise that age by offering inducements to people to continue to work after the age at which the retirement pension is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested that it should be made possible to award a widow's pension to a woman whose husband has disappeared.  As I explained to him in reply to a question, that can be done and has been done but every case is dealt with on its own merits and surely it is reasonable that the Department should insist on having some reason to believe that the husband is, in fact, dead?  We do not insist on absolute proof such as is necessary to establish a person as being a widow under common law. There have been many cases in which widows' pensions have been granted in such cases and there have been at least two cases in the fairly recent past in which widows' pensions were granted and subsequently the missing husbands materialised.  In fact, I came across a case lately&mdash;not a case in which a widow's pension had been granted&mdash;in which a woman's husband had disappeared for a number of years. She had obtained work in the meantime and after a number of years, she got word of her husband's death in <Col N="242" /> England.  On his death, she qualified for three different pensions.  She qualified for the contributory widow's pension here on the basis of her stamps; she qualified for a widow's pension in Great Britain on the basis of her husband's stamps; and she got a widow's pension on the basis of the employment which her husband had here before he went to England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the outcome of his talks with Minister of the British Government during the past week; and whether it is intended to resume such talks in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4 together.</P>
      <P>At this stage, I do not think that there is anything I could appropriately add to what is contained in the press communiqué issued after the discussions, a copy of which has been placed in the Dáil Library.  It is expected that there will be further talks in a couple of months' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was reported at some stage that some authorised person spoke of a fundamental alteration in the trade relations between this country and Great Britain.  Could the Taoiseach give any indication of what fundamental alteration in the trade relations between this country and Great Britain was discussed or considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that phrase was used in a way which would suggest that anything so extensive had been decided to be necessary.  The communiqué refers to the fact that British Ministers stated that changes in British agricultural policy are being considered.  We do not know yet what form these changes may take but it is possible they may mean some modification in present trade arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I assume the purpose of the Government in these <Col N="245" /> negotiations will be one to preserve the present position of Irish livestock exports to the British market; two, to do everything possible to remove quantitive restrictions which have been introduced in regard to agricultural exports; and three, to preserve as far as possible our industrial differential position on the British market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We stressed in the course of the discussions the importance we attach to the British market for Irish farmers and our hopes for expanding trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May we assume that in relation to livestock, there is no likelihood of a deterioration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that question should have been asked.  All I can tell the Deputy is that the British Government have stated that changes in their agricultural policy are under consideration, that they are not yet in a position to tell us what form these changes may take, or even when their thinking on the matter will be concluded.  Until the position is made clearer, it will not be possible for me to give any assurances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The communiqué mentioned that there have been discussions in regard to international affairs and the United Nations.  Would the Taoiseach care to expand on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a very general discussion which related almost entirely to matters concerning the United Nations.  It consisted of an exchange of views and information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been stated that the British Minister of Commonwealth Relations and Colonial Affairs will visit this country in the middle of the summer.  Is this to be a social visit or a business one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a courtesy visit.  As I went to London as the guest of the British Government, we felt that hospitality required us to invite the Minister here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's visit was not purely a social one.  Can we <Col N="246" /> therefore assume that the British Minister's visit will be a business visit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be regarded as a courtesy visit, but matters affecting the trade of the two countries may possibly be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say whether the British Government gave any indication as to whether they would seek a reopening of their application for admission to the EEC at an early date, and was any assurance asked from the British Government that we would be consulted before any decision was taken to include agricultural exports from this country within a quota arrangement applying to imports on the British market in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary is no.  My personal opinion is that it will be quite some time before any change occurs in regard to applications for membership of the EEC. Regarding the second point, it is of course to be understood that there will be discussions between the two Governments again before any changes affecting our agricultural trade are brought into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it now that the Taoiseach, having previously indicated he thought we would be in the EEC by 1st January, 1964, will have to revise that estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the communiqué issued after the discussions, it was stated clearly that in regard to the international situation, discussions took place with particular reference to certain issues affecting the UN.  Could the Taoiseach say what <Col N="247" /> were the issues so referred to in the communiqué?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that a very general discussion took place, including such matters as the development of the United Nations policy in the Congo and other activities of that kind in which we have a common interest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said he thinks it will be a long time before the question of Britain's admission to the EEC will be taken up again. Does he still consider it wise that we should reduce our tariffs without getting, during the period of the reduced tariffs, any compensation from those countries which will be facilitated in their exports to this country whilst we are not members of the EEC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Our decision to carry out certain tariff reductions is a unilateral decision.  It is primarily aimed at achieving, in relation to our industrial activities, a higher degree of efficiency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Health whether, in view of the serious hardship imposed on those in middle income groups and white collar workers generally during periods of illness by the very high cost of drugs and medicines, he will consider introducing some form of State subsidy to assist those people while awaiting the findings and recommendations of the Select Committee on the Health Services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, health authorities are empowered to supply drugs and medicines to persons who, because of the financial hardship involved, are unable to meet the cost of these items for themselves and their dependants, even though they do not hold general medical services cards.  Health authorities were asked by my Department some time ago to ensure that persons concerned are made aware of their right to apply for drugs and medicines in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>The payment of a subsidy towards the cost of drugs and medicines on the lines suggested by the Deputies, however, would require amendment of the Health Acts and I think that it would be inappropriate to consider the introduction of such legislation in advance of the findings and recommendations of the Select Committee on the Health Services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the need for restraint regarding increases in wages, salaries and other incomes has arisen because of the gap between incomes and productivity which developed during 1962.  This gap contributed to the rise in prices during the year.  The futility of attempting to counteract a rise in living costs due to this cause except by an increase in output is indicated in paragraph 9 of the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where loans by the State and by State bodies are oversubscribed by the public it is the practice in allotting the stock to give preferential treatment to small applications. I understand that in the case of the recent ESB loan, which was heavily oversubscribed by the public, this practice was followed.  As announced by the ESB in the press on 12th March, applications for up to £500 of stock were allotted in full; applications between £510 and £1,000 were allotted £500 each; applications between £1,010 and £2,000 were allotted £750 each; applications between £2,010 and £5,000 were allotted £1,250 each; while applications <Col N="255" /> for larger amounts of stock were allotted 25 per cent. of the amount applied for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The drainage of the Suck, which discharges into the critical portion of the Shannon, is bound up with the improvement of the main River Shannon.  A decision in regard to it must await the detailed engineering investigation referred to in the report on the Shannon flood problem published in September, 1961.  The Government have decided that these <Col N="257" /> surveys are to be undertaken when the necessary staff can be made available. I should explain that these surveys will be a big undertaking&mdash;I have been advised that they would require about 30 engineers for 6 years or so.  The present prospects of our being able to recruit that additional staff are not good.  The Office of Public Works have great difficulty in recruiting the engineers required to service the arterial drainage programme already in hands.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to say when works on the River Suck and the Shannon can be undertaken.</P>
      <P>The Breedogue River is part of the Boyle river catchment.  A special investigation of that catchment was made last autumn to see whether any improvement could be made in advance of the Shannon works.  I am happy to say that it was found that, by utilising the storage capacity and balancing effect of the lakes in the area, it may be possible to carry out a drainage scheme there without worsening conditions downstream in the Shannon.  A detailed engineering survey will be necessary before a scheme can be prepared.  It has been decided to commence that survey this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the enactment of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1962 rural electrification subsidy was made available at the rate of 50 per cent. of the capital cost of connection.  Since then rural electrification subsidy is made available at the rate of 75 per cent. of the cost of connection subject to a maximum of £75 per dwelling.  On this basis it was estimated that of the 112,000 rural dwellings which remained unconnected 77,000 could be connected at normal rates of fixed charge and a further 23,000 with special service charges not exceeding 50 per cent. of the normal fixed charges.  The remaining 12,000 dwellings, which were the most isolated ones and which would be entirely uneconomic to connect, would attract special service charges of more than twice the normal fixed rate of charge. The new subsidy scheme aims at securing the maximum number of connections and it is estimated that in due course some 96 per cent. of rural dwellings will be connected.  This achievement will compare favourably with that of many better off countries in Europe.  It was not anticipated that any of the 12,000 houses which were most uneconomic to connect would in fact seek connection and therefore the Government decided to make available to them the subsidy of £10 per house for bottled gas which was already available on islands where it was impracticable to provide electricity.</P>

      <P>Under Section 44 of the Transport Act, 1950 CIE has already all the necessary authority to prepare and submit to me any amending superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>I understand that arising out of a suggestion in a Labour Court recommendation that there should be discussions on pensions, welfare, etc., CIE invited the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to take the initiative in forming a committee which would, on behalf of all the unions concerned, formulate and discuss with CIE proposals for amendments in the pension scheme.

      <P>As explained in my reply of 12th December, 1962, to a previous question on the subject of CIE pensions, the provision in the existing scheme for a reduction in pension when a recipient reaches the age of 70 years is effective only at the election of the pensioner concerned.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not be aware of the fact that when this original pension scheme was designed to deal with most CIE workers, they would get only the non-contributory old age pension if their CIE pension were reduced.  Now that the contributory pension exists the CIE worker has an alternative.  If he retires he can get 51/3 a week for five years, followed by £1 a week from there on, or he can get 33/6 a week for life.  The existence of the contributory pension has altered the position entirely.  If the Deputy wishes, I will send him a statement showing him the effects of the change brought about by the establishment of the contributory pension, and he will see that when the CIE worker elects between the two <Col N="265" /> alternatives, the position is very different from what it was, because in either case he will get the full contributory old age pension.</P>

      <P>In regard to the first part of the question I would refer the Deputies to my replies of 21st February, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the life of a national school building is limited, there will always be a normal programme of replacing <Col N="284" /> and reconstructing schools.  It is anticipated that all existing arrears should be cleared in a period of eight or nine years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the fact that young people will have to spend eight or nine years in schools which require replacement, could the Minister say what the reason is why it should take so long to get rid of schools which are unfit or to put schools in need of repair into proper repair?  Is it shortage of money, or labour, or what is the reason for the long delay in supplying the schools in view of the fact that it is possible to build hotels, and so on, in a matter of a year, or less sometimes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrears become built up.  Each year, there is a fall in of a certain number of schools.  The arrears are being cleared at the same time as the normal fall in is being dealt with. As the Deputy knows, the speed of replacement has more than doubled recently.  The main bottleneck occurred at the professional level in relation to the planning of schools, as far as I am aware, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance now hopes to improve the situation by certain steps he has taken to remedy it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 71 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The vehicles in question consist of two stage coaches, a brougham, a landau, a phaeton and a wagonette which the owner, who resides in Collooney, County Sligo, very kindly presented to the Museum.  In view of the contribution to the illustration of the social history of the country which their exhibition would make, the Museum decided to accept them.  They will be exhibited when space for the purpose becomes available.</P>
      <P>The transport of the coaches to Dublin by road was undertaken by Córas Iompair Éireann.  In order to avoid damage to the coaches, which are late nineteenth century, six individual removal operations were entailed and the speed of transport was necessarily slow, involving the absence of the transport crew from Dublin for two full days in each case.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the removals were carried out as economically as possible consistent with the safety of the coaches.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary and Additional Estimates, 1962-63.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil, according to order, went <Col N="291" /> into Committee on Finance and resumed consideration of Supplementary and Additional Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31st March, 1963.</P>
  </MainHeading>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £152,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Cláraitheora), and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
      <P>The main reason for this Supplementary Estimate is that an additional sum of £160,000 is required under subhead G for the Health Services Grant to health authorities.  As the House is aware, the cost of the health services is borne 50/50 by the local authorities and the Exchequer.  In consequence of the fact that the accounts furnished by the health authorities to my Department in the course of the year showed that the expenditure on health services will be £320,000 more than was originally estimated by them, it is necessary for the Dáil to vote a further sum of £160,000, being 50 per cent. of that £320,000 under this subhead.</P>
      <P>The predominant cause of this increase is the continued impact of the eighth round of salary and wages increase on the finances of the Health Authorities.  More than 80 per cent. of the additional provision can, in fact, be attributed to this cause.  The only other major factor is the rising cost of medicines, both in the dispensary services and in hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenditure under subhead I is related directly to the expenditure of the voluntary agencies to which grants are paid.  In the year 1962-63, the costs of these bodies increased, almost entirely as a result of increases in the <Col N="292" /> remuneration of their staffs.  This was particularly marked in the case of bodies conducting institutions and employing nursing and domestic staffs. It is, accordingly, necessary to seek additional provision of £1,800 to cover the increased grants to be paid from the subhead.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in the spring of 1962, outbreaks of smallpox occurred in England and Wales.  I found it necessary to include in a Supplementary Estimate presented towards the end of the financial year 1961-62 a sum of £4,400 to cover the cost of additional supplies of vaccine in order that adequate safeguards against infection should be available in this country.  The epidemic in Wales continued into the year 1962-63 and it was necessary to continue the additional purchases of vaccine.  As a result, the provision of £1,500 included in the Estimate prepared before the outbreak in England and which was based on a normal year's requirements, has proved to be inadequate.  An additional sum of £10,100 is required.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Estimate for Health on 10th April last, I dealt with the question of the training and qualifications of health inspectors which is one of very considerable importance in relation to the prevention of danger to health from food and drink offered for sale and indicated that I intended to set up a training board to organise a suitable course for pupil health inspectors.</P>
    <P>In October last, I set up such a Board; the members include persons holding senior positions in the medical, veterinary, educational and administrative services.  As a result of the work of this Board, a course of training which will extend over four years commenced in January last, the theoretical instruction being provided by the Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  The Vocational Education Committee have the services of a trained health inspector tutor who has undergone special training abroad, and practical training will be provided by assigning students to health authorities during the course of their training.</P>
    <P>There are ten students, selected by <Col N="293" /> the Health Inspectors Training Board, attending the course, and the provision which is now being requested is required to cover allowances to be paid to the students, the cost of the tutorial services and travelling and incidental expenses.  The total of these costs for the current year is estimated at £1,110, and as the original Estimate contained only token provision of £10, the amount now required is £1,100.</P>
    <P>The total of the additional provision required for the services to which I have referred is £173,000.  Against this, it is possible to set a sum of £21,000 representing estimated savings on other subheads of the Vote.  These savings, which are very small relative to the total Vote, arise under a number of headings, the largest single item being a saving of £10,000 in the provision for the salaries of officers of my Department due to the existence of vacancies in certain posts.</P>
    <P>The net amount of the Supplementary Estimate is, accordingly, £152,000.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this Supplementary Estimate but it seems necessary to draw the attention of the Minister and the Government to the fact that the growing burden on the rates indicated by the excess of £160,000 provided here for grants to health authorities, implying an increased burden on the health authorities concerned, is becoming a growing hardship for the people, particularly of rural Ireland.  It is a really desperate situation when in a county like Mayo, people in towns and villages, in the houses and shops, are being called upon to meet a rate in excess of £3 in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That situation continues to grow worse with the passage of each year and there seems to be no end to it. The House has too readily forgotten that last year, as a result of energetic representations by the agricultural community, a sum of £2½ million was provided to mitigate the impact of these rate increases on agricultural land.  Since that was done, two things have happened&mdash;rates have increased <Col N="294" /> by something in excess of the grant-inaid made last year but too many people forget that private residents and business people in the towns and cities got no relief so that they have to meet not only the increase which was mitigated to the agricultural community last year but the additional increase which is falling on them now, and for the small shopkeeper the burden is well-nigh insupportable.</P>
    <P>The young married couple who built themselves a bungalow or house and for some years enjoyed the statutory remission of rates, now discover, if their valuation is about £20, that they are faced with a rent in perpetuity of anything from £56 to £60.  That is a matter to which the Government must turn their mind and realise that while grants of 50 per cent provided for under the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, offer some relief, there is also a current indication of the growing burden which relatively poor people have to meet in order to keep a roof over their heads.  I do not think the Minister told us what are the voluntary agencies referred to under Subhead I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of these voluntary bodies are doing very valuable work and I am certain the House will cordially approve of such assistance as we are able to give them, on the assumption, which I believe is well founded, that their work is very valuable and is regularly inspected by the Department to ensure that it effects what in fact they are set up to do.  Nobody will complain about the precautionary purchase of supplementary supplies of vaccine lymph consequent on the epidemic in Wales now happily passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the merits of the training scheme for health inspectors and therefore it is a matter on which I am not prepared to express an opinion.  Subject to those observations, <Col N="295" /> we have no objection to the passage of this Health Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to develop these views to any great extent but to those who see the Health Act administration, it is quite clear that complaints of a widespread character exist at certain points in connection with that scheme.  One is the charge for persons who have to undergo hospital treatment; another is the condition, or perhaps means test would be a better description, governing the issue of medical cards.  The third point of friction is the absence of free choice of general practitioner for the person who requires medical attention.  It was because of complaints under these headings that the Dáil in its wisdom, decided to set up a Committee to examine the whole structure of the Health Act.  It was also charged with the responsibility of making a report on the matter to the Minister and the House.</P>
      <P>Most of us had hoped that the Committee would be able to discharge its duties in a shorter period than it has taken and it is now very clear from the recent discussion on the Second Interim Report from the Committee, that it will be some time before we get the Committee's final report. Responsibility in this matter is not entirely in the Minister's hands and, in fact, not even substantially in his hands.  If the House is to do anything to remedy the existing defects in the Act, it must get a relatively early report from the Committee; otherwise it will fall to some other Parliament to apply the necessary rectifications to the 1953 Act.  Could the Minister at this stage give us any estimate as to when we are likely to get a report from the Committee, and if he can, could he say when it is likely that it will be possible to introduce amending legislation, on the assumption that legislation is recommended by the Committee?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing this Supplementary Estimate, the Minister said that the greater part of the increase was due to the eighth round of wage increases.  That would seem to indicate that the administrative <Col N="296" /> costs are unduly high in relation to the health services.  It poses the question: Are we getting value from the health services, which are lauded to the skies by so many members of the Dáil, if 80 per cent. of the Supplementary Estimate, which imposes £160,000 on the ratepayers, and likewise £160,000 on Central Government, is due entirely to administrative expenses?  I take it that by administrative expenses, the Minister means wages payable to State employees and local authority employees in relation to their administration of the health services.  It seems to be a hardy annual to have considerable increases in the money necessary to administer this Act.  I do not think anyone can feel satisfied that the country is getting value from the Health Act as administered at present.  One cannot attribute the blame to the Minister or his officials; it is entirely due to the fact that this Health Act is quite unsuited to the country.</P>
      <P>It poses the question to Deputies who are not on this Committee, which has been sitting for a considerable time, whether they are likely soon to reach some conclusion which may be of benefit to the country as a whole, to those who are in receipt of benefits under the Health Act, or can any hope be held out that there will be an easier and more facile administration of that Act.  The £160,000, plus the money already spent this year and which is likely to be spent in the future, is largely responsible for the very large increase in rates imposed in practically every administrative centre in Ireland. Practically every county manager who comes to strike a rate has the same story to tell: &ldquo;This is for the health services.&rdquo;  It means that we must take a serious look at the situation.  It will be necessary for the Minister and his officials to review the health services and to see that money which has to be spent on administering the existing Act is spent to good purpose.  I should like the Minister to clarify the statement he made that 80 per cent of these costs are due to administrative costs.</P>

      <P>There may be a slight difference of words but the meaning is the same&mdash;those who are paid as State servants and local officials to administer the Act.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify exactly what officials are involved and what their work actually is and their relation to the Health Act itself?  The country is entitled to know that and so are the ratepayers and taxpayers, as well as the beneficiaries of the health services.  The Minister may think that I am adversely criticising him.</P>

      <P>I have always expressed sympathy in this House for the Minister for Health who has to administer an Act which cannot be administered, which, in my opinion, is unsuited to our conditions, and which is not giving us the benefits which we were promised in flowery terms when the Act was introduced, in the long debates during 1951 and 1952. It would be a good thing if the Minister could soon be in a position to give some indication that we may expect some sort of administration which will meet modern conditions and which will be suitable to all those concerned.</P>
      <P>Another matter is the question of the vaccine lymph supply.  We understand that there was a serious threat to the country, and indeed to Europe, in an outbreak of a virulent type of smallpox which was due to the fact that there is greater intercourse now with countries which have not got established health or sanitary services. This type of disease is gradually forcing its way into Europe.  I am glad to say that we did not have any cases in this country and it appears that cases were dealt with very effectively across-channel.  I believe the Minister and his Department had full liaison with the authorities concerned there and nothing was allowed to come in which in any way could create the possibility of the disease starting here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> Perhaps the Minister would indicate the percentage of people who were vaccinated during the crisis period.  If he has not got the figures&mdash;I see him shaking his head&mdash;perhaps he would give us some idea of what the rate was because it is quite conceivable that we may be faced with a parallel situation at any time in the future, in view of the contacts that exist between the East and Africa, and Europe.  I presume that the lymph in the Estimate was that used for vaccination by the health authorities and not that used for ordinary people, which was bought and paid for at ordinary commercial rates.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate whether we have succeeded in building up the protection that has become necessary nowadays, and which had ceased to exist, to ensure that the public have full protection against the risk of this disease which was one of the greatest killers, and indeed one of the greatest causes of disfigurement, a century or so ago.</P>
    <P>The provision, small as it is, for voluntary organisations is eminently desirable.  These organisations collect private funds and are run by devoted people who work long hours and often do not get a very big return.  I think the House will generally welcome any subvention the State may give to help such people.  What I am wondering is whether the sum is large enough. I suppose it is only a small percentage of the entire sum that is paid throughout the year.  Subject to those few remarks, I am perfectly happy to accept the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a few comments to make.  During the discussion on the pay pause, one of the arguments used was the danger that might arise as a result of our goods not being sufficiently competitive.  Now we are told there are grounds for further fear because of increased rates. That fact should have been quite obvious to all of us.  Rates have increased by 80 per cent, due to wage increases generally.  I take advantage of this Estimate to raise two other matters.  When a man's income is being assessed under the Health Act, he may be earning only £12 or £13 <Col N="299" /> a week as a tradesman, but may be compelled to pay £1 a day for hospital treatment, £3 for each X-ray and the top figure for specialist services, on the ground that his income, with that of two or three of his children is over the £800 mark.</P>
      <P>It would appear that if a man has £12 or £13 a week and three or four daughters earn £3 or £4 each a week, his income is taken to be over £800. The unfairness here is that whereas the first £2 of each daughter's wages is not counted, the assumption is that anything over £2 goes to help her father to pay for his illness.  That is not fair.  A girl with £4 a week hands up £2 or £2 5s. at most and the rest of her money goes to pay clothing checks.  Women get trading checks for, say, £30 at Christmas and they pay it back at the rate of 15/- a week. Girls in a family have to buy their cosmetics and when they go to one or two dances a week, they have not a &ldquo;deuce&rdquo; left on Monday.  The Minister does not appear to know that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>He assumes that the daughter will hand over her buckshee couple of quid towards her father's illness.  Be fair about it.  The girls eat something&mdash;let us say, they eat £2 worth each week.  The other £2 they have left is handed out for their hairdo's, their lipstick and their clothing. Women must clothe themselves.  They are out to catch men and so they must clothe themselves.  A man need only get a suit every two or three years but the women have to have their clothes. Their high heels fall down every fortnight. All this means that women with £4 or £5 a week have not a &ldquo;deuce&rdquo; on Monday.  The Minister thinks they have nothing to do but hand their mothers a couple of pounds and hand the rest to their fathers, when they get ill, to pay the hospital bills.  When assessing the family income under the Health Act, the incomes of such girls should not be taken into account until they have at least £4 a week each.</P>

      <P>Some people are unfortunate in not having insurance and they are boned completely if they fall ill.</P>
      <P>The other matter I wished to refer to is the problem of disabled people.  I brought it to the Minister's notice last year that disabled people had only 22/6 a week, whereas they should be treated in the same manner as noncontributory old age pensioners or blind people who are in receipt of 32/6 a week.  I conclude that the reason for the difference is that the disabled people come under the Health Act and that it is because of that that they are forgotten.  They should have got the same increases as the other categories I mentioned but they have not had an increase in six years.  I am now asking the Minister to keep it in mind because if he does not, I shall avail of every opportunity to bring it to his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): I want to advert to one small aspect of this matter, that is, the question of financing the health services.  We know that 50 per cent. comes from the rates and I suppose it is true to say that in our rural community 80 per cent. of the rates are paid directly or indirectly by the farming community. If you consider any small town or village, you will find that the people in them, be they publicans or grocers, derive their incomes largely through the welfare of the farming community. Leaving out the larger towns where there are people with big salaries and wage packets, that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so, let us look at the picture of farming incomes over the past ten years.  In 1953, the total farming income was, speaking from memory, £107 million.  That was the total profit in respect of farmers and their families.  The last available figure was £117 million, which indicates an almost static income.  However, during that period, rates in <Col N="301" /> general, and in particular in respect of health charges, have mounted considerably. That is the main point I wish to advert to.  It seems to me that the rating system as a fiscal means of payment of health charges is becoming more and more inequitable and must inevitably break down. Some other means of financing the health services instead of rates or in conjunction with rates will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Sherwin was ráiméising a bit.  He often speaks ráiméis.  He made a plea in respect of hospital charges.  In connection with health services in this country, the average amount of money received is less than fourpence a day for everybody in all classes, lower, middle and higher.  In my constituency in South Tipperary, 90 per cent of people who are treated in public institutions pay not one brass farthing.</P>
    <P>I rose to point to the increasing injustice of the health services as they affect the whole community and particularly as they affect the individual farmers.  In my constituency, our two main expenses on the rates&mdash;apart from roads, of course&mdash;would be health and gravitation of water supply schemes. Some people, because their valuation is over £50, can never benefit by any hospital or domiciliary health services. Some of these people are also so situated geographically that they will never get a water supply.  Yet, these costs are mounting every year, particularly the water supplies.  Here again, there is a gross injustice not alone to the farming community in general but as between one group of farmers and another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Health Committee which was set up to study this problem, I want to make one or two brief remarks.  I disagree with my colleagues opposite who say the Health Act is not working.  It is working reasonably well and, because of that, people are inclined to demand too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical cards have been mentioned as well as many other matters on which I do not intend to dwell at the moment.  Fault was found with the method of financing the health scheme. <Col N="302" /> That was a big problem.  Fault was found with the scheme of block grants allocated to local authorities.  What is this House to do about that problem? That is a problem applicable not merely to this country but to other countries: it is a very pressing problem in Britain.</P>
    <P>If you take away the power of payment from local authorities you also take away power of administration from them.  Do those who suggest the health services should be wholly a national charge also suggest we should back up that by administration and take away all authority from, so to speak, the local health committees and invest the power in this House?</P>
    <P>The Department of Health worked very well and very cautiously during the year to prevent any imported disease.  The measures taken by the Department in regard to the smallpox outbreak in Britain and outbreaks of other infectious diseases were timely and adequate.  We hear a good deal of criticism about the Health Act but in the same breath we usually hear a demand for more services.  If people demand services under any Act they must realise that the services must be paid for at some level.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the motive of the Opposition is that if the services are not paid for at local level they must be paid for at central level.  What does it mean?  It means that either you transfer the obligation from the local authority to the central administration or <i>vice versa</i>.  In the end, it amounts to the same thing.  In Britain, they nationalised their health services and they had great trouble in administering them.</P>
    <P>The cost of drugs and medicines has been mentioned.  The British had to impose a charge and a second charge where drugs were steeply rising in cost and where the authorities thought there was excessive use of drugs, excessive recourse to demand for drugs and a good deal of wastage.  We must consider the wisest method in the long run of administering the health services. If we want to curtail the cost we must also curtail our desire to make demands which would have the effect of increasing costs.</P>
    <Col N="303" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, quite properly, I think, called attention to the increasing burden of the Health Act falling upon ratepayers.  Everyone must be concerned that the health services are costing so much not merely to the ratepayers but also to the taxpayers. We are hit from the right and from the left.  When we complain of the rising cost of the public services we must ask ourselves which of the services we are prepared to do without.</P>
      <P>It is true that there has been a substantial increase in the rates and in the taxes but, as Deputy Dillon and every member of the House knows, the increase in the rates has not been due solely to the health services.  There have been increases in the rates arising out of the housing programmes of the local authorities, the road programmes of the local authorities, and the vocational education programmes of the local authorities.  All these services are responsible for the increases in the rates.  It is, I think, taking a rather lopsided view to try to put the full responsibility for the increases upon the health services.</P>
      <P>What Deputy wants to restrict or limit the health services further?  I do not see anybody putting down a Parliamentary Question asking me if I will reduce the expenditure on the dental services, on the ophthalmic services, and so on.  On the contrary, the only questions put down to me are questions urging me to expand the health services, to provide more and better health services and, of course, more expensive health services.</P>
      <P>I am glad, as Minister for Health, the House takes a very keen interest in these matters.  However, I think I am entitled to remonstrate with those who ask for bigger, better and more expensive health services and at the same time complain when the cost of these services rises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde deplored the fact that I had to bring in an Estimate asking the House to provide £160,000&mdash; just half of the increase in the cost of the service over what had been estimated for it.  Not merely did he deplore that but he ascribed all of it to administrative expenses.  The Deputy was not correct.  He not merely ascribed the whole of it to <Col N="304" /> administrative expenses but also blamed the local authorities and held them responsible for the whole of it as well.</P>
    <P>The truth is very different.  The greater part of this £320,000 is represented not by increases in remuneration of the administrative officers engaged in the health services &mdash;it does not go to those who administer the Acts&mdash;but of those who operate the services, the dispensary doctors, the hospital staffs, the nurses.  We have increased the salaries for their patients.  It was very unfair of Deputy Esmonde, who is generally very fair and balanced in his criticism, to distort the picture in that way.</P>
    <P>We have substantially increased the salaries of dispensary doctors.  We have increased the salaries of the nurses.  We have increased the salaries of all those engaged in the mental hospitals and, of course, we have increased the salaries of the professional men attached to these institutions. We could not have done less. Quite frankly, I would like to have been able to do more but if I had done more in order that I might, as somebody said today, be able to make good any deficiencies that exist in the personnel of these organisations, look what the cost would have gone up to. The rates would have gone up and taxes would have gone up as well.  The fact is we must have regard to our economic circumstances, strike a balance between what we would like to have and what we think our people can afford to pay for, and what they can afford to pay for will, unfortunately, always fall very far short of what we would like to have.</P>
    <P>Another point which Deputy Esmonde made, which, again, was incorrect, was that he ascribed the whole of the increase to the rise in the cost of the local authority institutions and the local authority services. That, of course, is not so, not as far as Dublin is concerned and, to some extent, not as far as Cork is concerned. The fact is that a very large part of the expenditure on health services in the city of Dublin goes to defray some part of the cost of the voluntary general hospitals and, in so far as Dublin is <Col N="305" /> concerned, a very great part of this £160,000 is represented by the increase in salaries of those who are engaged in the nursing profession in the hospitals.</P>
    <P>Does anybody want to reduce that? If you complain about this increase in expenditure, surely it is logical to assume that you want to decrease the salaries of the nursing staffs in the hospitals or that you want to reduce the amount of capitation grants which are paid to certain members of the staffs of these hospitals?  I do not say Deputy Esmonde wants to do that but I say it is the logical conclusion which one must draw when a complaint such as he has made here today is uttered.  I know he does not want to do that; neither do we.  On the contrary, we have been trying to make the nursing profession more attractive to our young women.  The newspapers are flooded every day with advertisements painting in glowing terms the attractions of the nursing profession in Great Britain.  We are in competition with that sort of thing and because we are in such competition and wish to see that our institutions are properly staffed, we must, to the extent to which we think our people can afford it&mdash; that must, of course, be the final arbiter in these matters&mdash;improve the conditions of those who are engaged in providing the health services.  If we jib at doing that we must ask ourselves do we want to reduce the standard of these services because that is the only way in which we can possibly economise in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde also asked for some information which I should like to give him.  In regard to smallpox vaccinations there were 8,280 in 1960, 10,700 in 1961 and 305,000 in 1962.  Therefore, the experience in Great Britain has provoked a salutary reaction here. May I say, in passing, that this problem of infectious diseases which for a great many years was almost a negligible one will probably increase in gravity and cause whoever happens to be in charge of health a great many headaches in the future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I presume, refers to more rapid travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, more rapid <Col N="306" /> travel and sometimes the prejudice which has grown up in some quarters against such preventive measures as vaccination.  I gave some figures to Deputy Dr. Browne which will appear in the Official Report in due course indicating the rather apathetic approach which our people have made to the need for protecting themselves and their children against polio.  The figures are very disappointing to me.  There was no charge made in general for these services.  The vast majority of people did not have to pay but, unfortunately, the vast majority of them who ought to have done so did not avail themselves of this service.  It only indicates that this problem of infectious diseases is likely to become a graver one than it has been in the past.  Deputy Norton raised three matters on which he wished to have some information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;charges for hospitalisation, the means test for medical cards and free choice of doctor.  All these matters have been actively considered by the Select Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>By the Select Committee and by the Fine Gael Party.  I do not want to become too controversial when I have to refer to these matters because the Committee represents all Parties in the House.  I am not, I suppose, divulging any secret if I say we do not see identically eye to eye about everything but it is a fact that there is not one of these things which people want, relaxation of the means test, the abolition of charges for hospitalisation and free choice of doctor, which would not involve us in substantially greater expenditure which would have to be faced from the point of view not only of the taxpayers with whom this House is immediately concerned, but also the ratepayers with whom it is indirectly concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Select Committee have undertaken an enormous task.  If I had visualised what would be involved for the members of the Committee, I would certainly have hesitated before I <Col N="307" /> asked the House to charge any section of its membership with so grave a task. An enormous amount of research has been carried out on the services.  The members of the Committee have devoted a great deal of study to them. I do not think there is any other committee of which I have had experience &mdash;and I have had experience of some &mdash;that worked with greater zeal, energy and enthusiasm.  The Committee have, in fact, been meeting regularly.  In the early stages, we met every week.  Sometimes we sat twice on the one day, and on one occasion there were three sessions on the one day.</P>
    <P>This has meant a great deal of study and discussion.  We have had fairly detailed examination of witnesses who have appeared before us.  I want to say in regard to this work, which is really supernumerary to the work which is done in the Chamber, that while it is no harm to try to spur us on, Deputies are really spurring a willing horse.  I do not think the Committee should be expected to produce a report as though it were a case of drawing out of a hat rabbits which you had put into it.  The members of the Committee have approached their task in a very objective way.  Those of us who may have started with certain misconceptions find that our minds are becoming more flexible as a result of the discussions that have taken place, the submissions which have been made to us, and the evidence which was put before us.  Therefore, I would ask Deputy Norton not to be too impatient with us.  I can say quite sincerely that we are doing our best to produce a report in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>In his criticisms, I think Deputy Sherwin&mdash;at the beginning, at any rate &mdash;rather over-simplified the situation until Deputy Norton corrected him, and pointed out that so far as hospital charges are concerned, if the patient is an insured person and particularly if he is a manual worker the question of income does not arise.  With regard to the question of hospital charges falling upon those who might be described as the middle income group, the fact of the matter is, that despite what <Col N="308" /> Deputy Sherwin said, if you have three members of a household earning, there is a limit on the income of £1,100 a year.  After all, having regard to the fact that very few families have a permanent invalid, and that it is very rare for the majority of a family to have to avail of hospital services, I think it is reasonable that a household with an income of £1,100 should be required to pay something when they go into an institution.  If there is any question of hardship involved, they can avail of the hardship clause.  If they can satisfy the persons who are administratively responsible that, in fact, hardship does exist, they have the benefit of Section 15.</P>
    <P>In regard to the disabled persons' allowances, there is, to some extent, an anomaly in the Health Acts.  My personal conviction, which is becoming stronger every day, is that the Minister for Health should not have responsibility for this matter at all, that it should relate to another code, but it is there and we administer it.  It is there because, when the Health Act was going through, there was no other Act, and a special Bill would have had to be introduced to deal with that problem.  Make no mistake about it: it was a problem which had been long neglected, but there was no other ready, convenient means of dealing with it than to have that clause inserted in the 1953 Health Act.</P>
    <P>Originally, the allowance was administered by the health authorities, and it was never intended to be a subsistence allowance.  It was a subvention payable to a disabled member of a family, but the members of the family were expected to try to look after him or her, as the case might be, to the best of their ability.  The disabled person's allowance was merely a subvention to provide him with greater comforts.  The original maximum payable by the health authority was 20/- a week.  It was subsequently raised to 22/6 and later to 25/-, so Deputy Sherwin was not strictly correct when he suggested that there had been no improvement in these grants.  I think that is all I have to say and I am sure the House is very anxious to hear the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

Again, there was the fact that the newer drugs now available for the treatment of patients suffering from a mental illness have increased in cost and we now have to make provision accordingly.</P>

      <P>Most of the expenditure covered by this Supplementary Estimate relates to price support for pigs, milk and wheat, and to schemes of productive assistance to agriculture.  Deputies will recall that we have already had a Supplementary Estimate of £1 million for milk, so that the total provision for support of milk prices in the present financial year now stands at £3,172,000.  The total provision to support pig prices is going to be £2,750,000 in this financial year, while the arrangements for wheat are expected to cost about £1,540,000 in the present financial year and a further £500,000 next year, making a gross total of £2,040,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to begin by saying something about price support and other forms of assistance to agriculture, in order to put in proper perspective various pronouncements made recently by some people who claim to speak for the farming community; and I shall take first the question of milk.  In many of the declarations we hear on this subject from various sources, there is a great deal of propaganda and a very little amount of objective analysis.  It is very important, therefore, that the actual <Col N="311" /> facts should be stated clearly and fully understood by all concerned.  I have no need to indulge in propaganda or wild statements.  I will confine myself strictly to the facts.</P>
    <P>In comparing the farmers' position over a period of years, some organisations love to take the year 1953 as the starting-off point.  We all know that 1953 was an exceptionally good agricultural year and that if you take 1952, and particularly 1947, comparisons with present-day conditions would show entirely different results.  However, I am going to take the year 1953 and meet these people on their own ground.</P>
    <P>In 1953&mdash;a good year, as I have said&mdash;total milk production amounted to 508 million gallons, and the quantity of milk supplied to creameries amounted to 232 million gallons.  In 1960, these figures had risen to 570 million gallons and 281 million gallons, respectively; in 1961, to 594 million gallons and 305 million gallons, and, in 1962, to 613 million gallons and 324 million gallons.  The total milk cheque of creameries in 1953 was £18.1 million, and in 1962, about £26.2 million.  The number of cows on farms supplying milk to creameries rose from approximately 625,000 in 1953 to 695,000 in 1962, and the average quantity of milk supplied to creameries per cow increased from 370.9 gallons in 1953 to 460 gallons in 1962.  The average return per cow from milk supplied to creameries, including value of skim content, was £32 in 1953 and £41 in 1962.  The average value of the dropped calf was £8.9 in 1953 and £11.9 in 1962.  The cost of Exchequer support to the dairy industry was £122,000 in 1953/54, and it will be £3,172,000 in 1962/63.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the price of milk went up by a smaller percentage than did the total amount paid to milk suppliers by creameries, but it is, clearly, absurd to try and judge the milk producer's position in 1953 and 1962 by looking only at the price of milk.  The fact is that, by their constructive agricultural policy which has brought about a considerable increase in productivity of <Col N="312" /> our dairy industry, the Government have succeeded in increasing the return from milk production by £8.1 million through a combination of price support and production subsidies.</P>
    <P>Our production subsidies are conveniently forgotten by those who pretend that Irish agriculture has been neglected by the Government, but it is, obviously, essential to consider not only the large amount which the Government are paying by way of price support, but the large amount they are also providing for aids to increased productivity and lowering of costs.  State aid to agriculture otherwise than by way of price support totalled £13 million in 1953-54, and will amount to over £30 million in 1962-63.  This State aid includes the following:</P>
    <P>Relief of taxes on agricultural land: £4,940,000 in 1953/4 and £8,524,000 in 1962/3; Fertiliser subsidies: nothing in 1953/4 and £3,000,000 in 1962/3; Land Project: £2,244,000 in 1953/4 and £2,208,000 in 1962/3; Farm Buildings and Water Supplies Scheme: £574,000 in 1953/4 and £1,253,000 in 1962/3; Advisory services: £257,000 in 1953/4 and £411,000 in 1962/3; Agricultural research: £50,000 in 1953/4 and £808,000 in 1962/63.</P>
    <P>In addition, direct price support to agriculture will cost £7½ million in the present financial year.  Now, I am not looking for any thanks for this very large increase in productive State aid to agriculture.  All I am asking is that its existence should be recognised.  It is, after all, a fact.</P>
    <P>When I introduced the fertiliser subsidies a few years ago, I knew that greatly increased fertilisation of our grassland would put a good deal more money into the pockets of our farmers, and especially into the pockets of milk producers.  Not only was there a great potential to be developed here if fertilisers could be made sufficiently cheap, but this was only a way of assisting farmers, particularly dairy farmers, which could not give rise to complications with other Governments, as can the price end.</P>
    <P>The fertiliser subsidies have been very successful in bringing about a <Col N="313" /> marked increase in production, especially milk production, without a corresponding increase in costs.  As a farmer, I certainly would prefer to have subsidised fertilisers than to have their monetary equivalent added to the milk price, and I believe most good farmers would take the same view.  The fertilisers and ground limestone subsidies will cost £3.75 million in the present financial year.  We expect the use of ground limestone to exceed a million tons in 1962-63.  The use of phosphates and potash is now 50 per cent. greater than before the fertiliser subsidies were introduced.  It is sometimes alleged by the kind of person who thinks that his function in life is to try to tear to pieces every progressive State measure of agricultural importance that the fertiliser subsidies are benefiting the tillage farmer mainly.  This is a false and a futile argument.  Grassland has, in fact, benefited greatly from the fertiliser subsidies.</P>
    <P>Then, take the question of local rates.  We would all like to see agricultural land derated, as in Britain and the Six Counties, but this is a comparatively easy business in Britain where only 5 per cent. of the working population is on the land, as against 35 per cent. in our country.  However, the large sum of £8½ million is being made available in the present year in relief of rates on agricultural land, and this is a figure which cannot be shrugged off.  These grants represent over 50 per cent. of the total rates payable on agricultural land.  A farmer with a valuation of £20, however, would this year be paying only about £13 in rates; his land is derated to the extent of 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look, now, at another side of the question&mdash;export markets. We have very heavy bills to meet this year for subsidies on pigs and milk, as well as wheat.  The average price for our butter on the British market in 1962 was about 298s. a cwt., and, if this was all we got for our butter production, the price of milk would have been only 1/2d. per gallon.  The British market became so saturated with butter, including British home produced butter as well as imported <Col N="314" /> butter, that the British Government decided to control import of butter from all sources.  This control is being continued in 1963-64.  In working out the quotas for individual countries, the British Government took into account what they described as the degree of dumping by each supplying country, that is to say, the difference between the market price in Britain and the price to producers in the supplying country.  I am not saying that I agree with this approach, but my disagreement with it does not prevent the British from doing it in this way.  Apart altogether form the cost to the taxpayer, how can we start increasing prices here of products which we have to sell in such difficult and controlled markets without thinking of the consequences this might lead to in relation to those outside markets?  Again, how could we take the risk of increasing the price of butter to our own consumers, when we know very well that this will only reduce consumption, increase the quantity for export and add to the difficulties of producers and Government alike?</P>
    <P>Pigmeat, also, has been a very weak market in Britain during the last year, and that is the main reason why I have had to ask the Dáil for so much money to support this industry.  The British market has been over-supplied, mainly because of imports from Denmark and increased British production, and very difficult marketing conditions existed throughout the period.  In order to ensure that the quality of produce we send to Britain would measure up sufficiently to that of bacon from other sources, and, in order to retain our position on that market, we found it essential to bring in stricter grading arrangements.  This was done following lengthy conversations with farm organisations, and it was carefully phased so as to cause the minimum upset to our own producers. I believe that these measures are bound to bring in good results in time and will give the efficient pig producer a better return for his money.</P>
    <P>Let me say, finally, on the subject of pigs that we calculate that, if there had been no State support, the price paid to farmers for Grade A pigs <Col N="315" /> during the past year would have been no more than 155s. per cwt., dead weight, as against a guaranteed price of 230s.</P>
    <P>To return, for a moment, to my 1953 comparisons, it is provisionally estimated that income per farm family member increased by approximately 30 per cent from 1953 to 1962.  During the same period, income per head in all other sectors increased by about 60 per cent.  If, however, one takes 1947 as the base year, a very different result is obtained&mdash;agricultural incomes have since then increased by some 152 per cent and non-agricultural incomes by about 130 per cent.  However, I am not going to quibble.  I realise that 1947 was a poor year agriculturally and I only wish that those who pick a particular year because it may seem to suit their argument, would try to be a little more objective and fair minded.</P>
    <P>The fact is that in Europe and throughout the world non-agricultural incomes have been increasing faster than agricultural incomes.  This is a matter which gives no satisfaction to Governments, but is mainly due to hard economic facts&mdash;above all, to world production of food outrunning commercial demand, and I regret to say that expert opinion believes that this position may persist for years, especially for dairy products, wheat and pigmeat.  At the same time, there has been a good world demand for industrial products, and the result has been to widen the income gap between farmers and other sections of the population.  We have experienced this in common with other countries, but the disparity is not as great in this country as in, for example, France, Germany, or the United States.  It is true that some well organised groups in the non-agricultural sector have occasionally been able to exert considerable pressure in order to get increases of income which would not be justified by the economic situation generally, and I deprecate such tactics, but, when all is said and done, the basic reason for the disparity between agricultural and other incomes is the weakness of agricultural export markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> The best any Government can do in such circumstances is to try and maintain some reasonable relationship between agricultural and non-agricultural incomes.  That is, precisely, what the present Government have been doing since they came into office, and the increase in total State aid to agriculture from £12,979,000 in 1953/54 to £19,342,000, in 1957/58 and £37,894,000 in 1962/63 is a sufficient measure of the Government's regard and sympathy for the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Turning, now, to specific items in the Supplementary Estimate, we require a sum of £520,000 net for the purposes of the BTE Scheme.  The original Estimate was based on the direct purchase of reactor cows in the South commencing early in 1962-63. In fact, the headage grant payments continued until 1st October, and this has meant that gross expenditure and receipts figures are less than they would have been.  The increase in net expenditure is, however, mainly due to the fact that the number of reactor cows disposed of in the year, taking the headage grant and direct purchase procedures together, was considerably in excess of the number originally anticipated.</P>
    <P>Under the modified clearance area programme which was put into operation in the South last year, compulsory testing of all herds commenced on 15th June.  The results achieved under this programme to date are, I am glad to say, most encouraging.  It is estimated that between 1st October and the end of the financial year some 70,000 reactors, including 52,000 cows, will have been taken up by my Department on direct purchase, while the returns from the round of herd testing which is now nearing completion show, in respect of close on 1½ million animals tested, that the overall incidence of infection in cows in the area has fallen from the original figure of 35 per cent to about 10 per cent and in other cattle from about 10 per cent to less than 3 per cent.  This is a satisfactory picture and one which augurs well for the success of the final stages of eradication in the Southern area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> From the commencement of the next round of testing in the South, about April, stricter controls on the movement and sale of cattle in the area will have to be applied, and it is essential that these controls should be observed by all herd-owners if the job of eradication is to be completed in the minimum time.  There are still some farmers in the South who have not arranged for the testing of their herds. These herd-owners, whether or not they realise it, are breaking the law and running the risk not only of prosecution but of having their herds placed under restrictions so as not to constitute a danger to other herds in the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>The fact that since the beginning of 1963, only attested store cattle can be sent to Great Britain will have brought home to many herd-owners in the South the importance for them of early attestation.  From now on, farmers must be prepared for lower prices for their store cattle if they are not of attested status.  I must strike a note of caution, too, as regards the export of uncertificated fat cattle.  At present, such cattle may be exported to Britain, provided they are going to designated slaughterhouses.  There can be no guarantee, however, that this can go on indefinitely.  In these circumstances, I would urge farmers in the South to consider seriously having their herds individually attested in advance of area attestation.  There are at the moment over 1,100 individually attested herds in the South, but very many more herds would become attested without undue difficulty, especially amongst the 32,000 which have earned the herd bonus.</P>

      <P>The conditions for individual attestation are not really onerous, and facilities for the sale of <Col N="318" /> attested cattle in the South are constantly increasing.  Any southern farmer who, individually or as a member of a group. wants to build up his herd to attested status can be assured of every possible assistance from the local officers of my Department.</P>
      <P>Satisfactory progress continues to be made also in the operation of the scheme elsewhere in the country.  Within the past 12 months, seven further counties have been added to the attested area, four in the Midlands and three in the eastern part of the country, making a total of 17 attested counties at present.  I am confident that a further three &mdash; Dublin, Laois and Wexford &mdash; will be added to the area within the next two months, leaving only the south to be finished.</P>
      <P>As regards wheat, millability difficulties arose in four of the past five years, mainly because of weather conditions. Exchequer assistance to wheat growers from 1958-59 to 1962-63, inclusive, totals about £5,800,000.</P>
      <P>I was approached at the end of September, 1962, by representatives of both growers and millers who confirmed the reports I had already received that a large proportion of the crop would turn out to be unmillable. I, therefore, introduced a scheme under which unmillable wheat was purchased at approximately £17 per ton, green, with a view to use for animal feeding, and a supplementary payment of 12s. 6d. a barrel (£5 per ton) was made to growers for such wheat.  Approximately 160,000 tons of the crop were classified as millable, and 220,000 tons as unmillable.  This resulted in almost 200,000 tons in dried terms of extra feeding stuffs being marketed in addition to a record feeding barley crop of over 400,000 tons.  The cost of the 12s. 6d. a barrel bonus is approximately £1,100,000, while the cost of the disposal through An Bord Gráin of the unmillable wheat for animal feed will be in the region of £900,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past few years, the guaranteed floor price for feeding barley has been implemented through the normal trade channels.  These arrangements have worked satisfactorily.  The barley has been purchased from the <Col N="319" /> growers at the guaranteed price; the cost of the grain to the feeders has been kept at the minimum level and no unnecessary overhead expenses are incurred.  However, the fact that an additional 195,000 tons of feed wheat became available this year has created problems.  Our annual requirements of grain and pollard very from year to year but for 1961-62 were approximately 770,000 tons&mdash;370,000 tons barley, 60,000 tons wheat, 130,000 tons maize and 210,000 tons pollard.  It is estimated that availability this season is approximately 935,000 tons&mdash;450,000 tons barley, 195,000 tons wheat, 90,000 tons maize and 200,000 tons pollard 100,000 tons of which is home-produced. This means that there may be approximately 150,000 tons of surplus grain which must be exported this season no matter what we do.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that imports of maize and pollard should be stopped or further restricted.  As regards maize, the fact is that limited quantities are normally required for special foods and we have undertaken to import this year over 80,000 tons under the arrangements made with the United States Government for the purchase of sugar from us.  In the case of pollard, home supplies are not sufficient to meet requirements.  From a nutrition point of view pollard cannot be completely replaced by wheat; the price of feed wheat is in line with the price of the imported pollard and any restrictions would only tend to increase the price to the feeders.</P>
    <P>I know the food problem is complicated but I am satisfied that the action I have taken has resulted in a satisfactory market being provided for growers of barley and in feed grain being made available at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>The increase in the amount required for grants under the Farm Buildings Scheme is a reflection of the substantial improvements in grant rates effected in 1961 in respect of piggeries, cow-byres and general farm building repairs. The scheme is, indeed, being availed of to an ever-increasing extent.</P>
    <P>A sum of £300,000 is included in the Supplementary Estimate to meet this <Col N="320" /> country's contribution to the World Food Programme, the very laudable objectives of which I outlined in introducing the main Estimate last July.  As I then indicated, the purpose of the World Food Programme, which is being jointly administered by the United Nations and by FAO and is the outcome of fifteen years of effort by both bodies, is to use contributions of food in such a way as to help the economic and social development of the countries which receive the food. The programme stands for development and not merely relief, and its central objective is to eliminate the conditions which make food aid necessary. It is a stimulating experiment in multilateral assistance and will clarify to what extent and in what manner food can be moved through international channels for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The programme went into operation on 1st January, 1963, and will continue until the end of 1965.  I should like to take this opportunity of referring to the Freedom from Hunger Campaign which is another widespread effort by FAO to assist those countries in need of help.  This campaign is based not on food aid but on technical aid to enable more and better food to be produced within those countries.  It operates mainly through funds raised by public subscription in all participating countries.  This is World Freedom from Hunger Week and the Irish Red Cross Society which is in charge of the national collection in this country is making a special appeal for funds during the present week.  As already announced the national collection will be used to promote increased food production in Tanganyika.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also includes a sum of £10,000 as a contribution to the FAO Fund to prevent the spread into Western Europe of an African type strain of foot and mouth disease which has appeared in the Middle East, Turkey and Greece.  Its spread to Western Europe would be a calamity.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also provides for increased contributions to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, arising from the eighth round wage increase, and to the Irish Countrywomen's Association, to enable <Col N="321" /> it to make an organiser available in the Gaeltacht and to support the Association's College at Termonfeckin. The House may be interested to know that in the present financial year grants by my Department to rural organisations will total £37,000.  These organisations include the NFA, ICMSA, Muintir na Tíre, ICA, Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe and the IAOS.  The grants have been applied by the organisations to a variety of purposes ranging from the hiring of management consultants to visits to <Col N="322" /> the Continent by organisation members.</P>
    <P>This is a very big Supplementary Estimate, but I have no hesitation in asking the Dáil to approve it in the interests of our farmers.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 26th March, 1963.</P>
