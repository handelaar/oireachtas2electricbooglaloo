      <P>I am unable to say when work will commence on the final <Col N="8" /> stage of this improvement scheme which began in 1957.  This stage has been postponed pending a decision by British Railways on the question of providing a car ferry terminal, and comprises completion of the two storey structure on the west side of the Mail Boat Pier; forming of a public concourse; and improvements to the approach road.  The estimated cost of the outstanding works was about £55,000, and about two dozen additional men would have been employed temporarily on them.  If the car ferry project proceeds, the design of the scheme will have to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The car ferry terminal is estimated to cost some £300,000.

      <P>A Dutch shipping line, which is not a member of the West Indies Shipping Conference, recently <Col N="22" /> inaugurated, with the encouragement of Córas Tráchtála, a service from Dublin via Liverpool to the West Indies.  Another Dutch shipping company, a member of the West Indies Shipping Conference, has announced its intention of providing a similar service from Dublin.  Irish exporters are free to use the independent service in preference to any service provided by a member of the Conference.  No intervention on my part is necessary, nor, indeed, have I any power to intervene.</P>

      <P>The only reply I can give on that is in connection with local authority schemes.  The ESB makes a distinction between the capital contributions required if as part of the installation of a house, an electric cooker is included or is not included.  A capital contribution is required where it is felt that consumption of electricity will be so low that it will place a heavy charge on the ESB.  If the Deputy puts to me the particular case he has in mind, I will refer it to the ESB but I may say that the ESB takes the same action in respect of all people of this kind.  They take special action with regard to urban housing schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics of flour consumption over the period mentioned are not readily available.  However, the annual production of flour fell from 3,206,298 sacks in 1945 to 2,067,400 sacks in 1962.  This represents an overall reduction of 35.5 per cent or an average annual reduction of 2.1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> The annual quotas of flour millers represent the quantity of wheat authorised to be milled.  The quantity of flour produced from the milling of a given quantity of wheat depends on the extraction rate.  In view of the changes in the extraction rate during the period, the total quantity of wheat fell by 22½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The quotas of the flour millers have decreased by approximately 22½ per cent in the period since 1945.  This resulted from the fact that all quotas were reduced by Ministerial Orders by 12½ per cent in 1953-54 and by 5 per cent in 1957-58, and in addition the proprietors of four mills decided to cease milling and surrendered their licences so that their quotas were extinguished. Clondulane Mills, Fermoy, with a quota of 44,800 barrels closed in 1953; Quarterstown Mills, Mallow, with a quota of 78,400 barrels in 1957; Comerfords Mill, Rathdrum, with a quota of 31,325 barrels in 1957 and Avoncore Mills, Midleton, with a quota of 96,481 barrels in 1960.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 4th July, 1962, to a similar question put down by the Deputy, a housing authority in its assessment of needs may have regard to industrial development in its district and provide accordingly in its building programme. If Mayo County Council are satisfied that there is need for further local authority housing at Crossmolina or at any other centre, it is their function, without instruction from me, to take appropriate steps to meet such needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the allegations in the article to which the Deputy refers, the Housing Acts and the regulations made thereunder do not prevent a housing authority from rehousing workers with the aid of subsidies, whether or not such workers are subtenants of local authority dwellings or whether or not they are married relatives of registered tenants. As the Deputy is aware, housing authorities have a function to secure the elimination of unfit housing conditions. It is not, however, the responsibility of the housing authority to provide houses for persons who are in need of rehousing if, for example, the circumstances of the persons concerned are such that they could reasonably be expected to provide housing for themselves with the facilities available for the purpose from the State and from the local authorities. The initiation of proposals to provide houses rests, therefore, with the persons concerned or with the housing authority, as may be appropriate in particular cases.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government what regulations and facilities exist in his Department to meet the lack of housing existing in a district where new industries are established, and particularly where workers have to travel long distances to work; whether a worker having to travel a long distance to work is entitled to qualify for a local authority house on these grounds alone; and if he will state the number of miles from the place of employment considered to be a qualifying distance by him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing Acts provide for the payments of grants by my <Col N="30" /> Department, with supplementary grants, loans and developed sites by local authorities, to persons providing, purchasing or improving houses.  In addition, the Acts provide a system of rates remission on housing.  These facilities may be availed of by groups or individuals to provide housing for employees of new industries.  Legislation also enables housing authorities in the formulation of their building programmes to have regard to needs, which are associated with industrial development, of persons who are unable to avail themselves of the private housing facilities.</P>
      <P>In so far as industrial concerns are prepared to sponsor the provision of housing for their employees, the services of the National Building Agency, Ltd. are available generally and have been availed of by several such concerns in County Cork.</P>
      <P>Distance from work may be taken into account by a housing authority as a factor in considering an applicant's need for rehousing but by itself alone it would not be sufficient to imply an obligation on the authority to rehouse the person concerned.</P>
      <P>There are no statutory or administrative regulations on this point.  The weight to be given to it in conjunction with other factors is a matter for decision by the housing authority concerned in any particular instance in which it arises.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to taken questions Nos. 50, 51, 52 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is made in my Department to have appeals under Section 18 of the Labourers Act, 1936, determined with the least possible delay.  It is, however, necessary to obtain information from the appropriate local authority in respect of each appeal received and much delay has been occasioned in the past due to the <Col N="33" /> failure of some local authorities to reply to inquiries in a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The matter has been under examination in my Department and, as a result, alterations in procedure were made in 1962 to facilitate local authorities in dealing with such inquiries. I have circularised local authorities this year emphasising the necessity to furnish early replies to Departmental inquiries in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>I have received representations about the delay in completing development on this estate and I have brought these representations to the notice of Dún Laoghaire Corporation.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be rather difficult at the stage where houses had not really been finished off to withhold grants or, indeed, loans for that matter. If there was every reason to believe, as there usually has been in these cases, that the development work was being done or was about to be done or, in fact, had started but was not yet complete, what has been suggested by the Deputy could be done in order to catch out the few defaulters in this matter. However, in catching those out we would probably be rather severe on the many people who are doing a good job and who have kept faith with those for whom they have built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Acts, in any financial year, an employment allowance of £17 is payable to rated occupiers of agricultural land in excess of £20 valuation, in respect of each adult workman who was at work on the holding during the whole of the previous calendar year.  An adult workman for the purposes of the Acts is defined as a man who at the commencement of the qualifying period was not less than 16 nor more than 70 years of age and who was not and whose wife was not the rated occupier of agricultural land of £5 valuation and upwards.  There is provision that if two or more men are successively at work on a holding or are employed in such a way that at all times during the calendar year there is one man at work, such workmen may be regarded as one man at work during the qualifying period.  There is further provision that the total of the employment allowance and the supplementary allowance in any case will not exceed the rates payable on the land valuation over £20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion of the Vote on Account can be properly described as a general stocktaking and review of the conduct of the Government during the past year.  This is also an occasion for Deputies on this side of the House to remind the Taoiseach and the Ministers of the Government of the responsibility they have, not only to the House but to the country.  We have now reached the stage at which this Government have lost all sense of responsibility so far as the people are concerned.  We take this opportunity to remind the Government of the various pledges and undertakings which <Col N="53" /> they gave to the people at the last general election, and the undertakings they gave to the House since the general election.</P>
      <P>The economy of the country today is in a serious state of decay and no matter what the Minister for Finance or the Government may attempt to convey to us, the people of the country have no respect for, or belief, or confidence in economists or statistics and figures of any kind.  No amount of statistics supplied by the Government, and no expressions of opinion from the economists, can convince me that we are enjoying the wave of prosperity which is alleged to be prevailing by Fianna Fáil Ministers from the Taoiseach down.  I have no evidence that a wave of prosperity is passing over the country at the moment, and I doubt if the people have either.  Every section of the community seems to be labouring under the greatest difficulties, to be working under a wave of depression. They are attempting to live on meagre and limited incomes, despite a soaring cost of living.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister his excuses for the present unemployment position.  No amount of statistics can convince me that we have not an extraordinarily high number of unemployed persons here and that that number is not increasing week after week.  We saw over the week-end that some hundreds of workers in the textile and clothing industry have gone on short time.  There are fewer agricultural workers on the land.  There are fewer employed in business houses and behind the counters of the shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 12 months, not to speak of the past five years, record numbers have been emigrating.  No positive steps have been taken by the Government to check the flowing tide of emigration of our young people. These young people have been denied the right to live in their own country by this Government, who promised them employment and undertook to provide it.  There has not been a single sneeze from the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to the stemming of emigration and the provision of employment.  Immediately young girls leave school, they embark on the emigrant ship and <Col N="54" /> are exposed to the grave moral dangers of life in England.  The hospitals, hotels and factories of England are crammed with young Irish girls, forced to leave this country through lack of employment and because so little is held out for them at home by their own Government.</P>
    <P>A grave problem is also presented by the number of fathers of families who are torn away from their families and, because of the bad management of those in office, forced to seek a livelihood in the land which was once the traditional enemy of the Party in office to-day.  They are compelled to work in the coalmines, the industries and other concerns in Great Britain. That is a far cry from the promises made by the Government when at one stage they promised to bring back all the emigrants.  The traffic was to come to a standstill in all the provincial towns because of the huge numbers going home for lunch from all the factories and employment schemes to be provided by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>This country is a good country for a small section of the community.  It is a good country for the rich and for those who have pull.  It is a good country for those who have influence, but it is a bad country and holds no future for the unfortunate poor, who appear to be increasing in numbers. It is a queer country for those unfortunates who cannot provide for themselves.  I should like the Minister to tell us what happened to the Fianna Fáil plan for the provision of 100,000 jobs in five years.  They have been six years in office now since the Taoiseach made that statement when he was enjoying the hospitality of his colleagues in Clery's Ballroom.  Not alone would this House like to know, but those who were expecting some of the 100,000 jobs would like to know what happened that scheme.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister be honest enough to tell us that they never had a scheme for the provision of 100,000 jobs?  It was a scheme for the provision of 100,000 votes for Fianna Fáil, if they could get them.  A very good vote-catcher was this promise of 100,000 jobs.  Parties have made promises and men in public life have given undertakings <Col N="55" /> but that this was the most barefaced, the most cajolling promise ever made to the electorate&mdash;to have the hardness of neck to stand up and say: &ldquo;If you put us back, we will provide 100,000 jobs and there will be no such thing as an unemployed man or woman in this country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland has made application for membership of the EEC.  During the past year, the negotiations in Brussels have broken down and Britain's application for membership has been unsuccessful.  Despite the fact that Britain's application has been rejected, we find the Taoiseach hopeful that Ireland's application will be accepted. Will any responsible Minister stand up and say that Ireland's application is likely to be successful when Britain's has been turned down?  Assuming for one moment that we are admitted to the Common Market, what preparations have we made in this country for such entry?  Is it not true to say that in Britain for the past ten years, or thereabouts, there are experts and there are engineers and a Department of State separately set up to plan and to make provision for the repercussions of the Common Market? Statistics have been taken there as to what products are to be stepped up and what industries are likely to be affected.</P>
    <P>What alternative employment is to be provided for workers in industries whose product will seriously be curtailed by our entry into the EEC?  In this country, all we had was plenty of loud, foolish talk but not a single step to plan for the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been questioned by the leader of Fine Gael, by the <Col N="56" /> Labour Party and by others as to the thousands of workers who will become redundant in industry and in other spheres of activity, in the event of Ireland's entry into the Common Market.  Where will they go?  Some people in Fianna Fáil seem to think they have been planning for that.  Has it been done by the same planning engineers as planned the scheme of the 100,000 jobs because, if so, neither the country nor this House can have confidence in the planners of such a bogus, false and misleading scheme as that of the 100,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>It has been declared that, if we enter into the EEC, at least 150,000 workers in this country will lose their employment.  That was made very clear here by Deputy McGilligan last week. On top of the number of people already unemployed here, we shall have a further 150,000 unemployed.  It is only reasonable that we on this side of the House should ask the Government to what will they put those 150,000 workers.  The Taoiseach may say, in effect: &ldquo;Well, that does not worry us a whole lot now because Britain has not been accepted.&rdquo;  Therefore, when Britain has not been accepted, we shall not be accepted and the question of planning of the future does not arise and we need not worry about 150,000 persons losing their employment.</P>
    <P>There was a very interesting article in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i>.  It contained a forecast by the head of the French ready-to-wear industry which he gave at a press conference in London.  This leading French businessman states, as reported in the <i>Evening Herald:</i></P>
    <P>We feel that the Common Market was a battle between politicians but politics will change and we feel sincerely that not later than next year England will be in the Common Market.  To get England in, we feel that concessions will be made.</P>
    <P>France has been responsible for torpedoeing Britain's application, according to authoritative sources in this country, in Britain and elsewhere.  We feel that the attitude of France has been the result of the action of one man <Col N="57" /> only and, as this leading businessman said &ldquo;politics change&rdquo;.  We feel an effort will be made, even by France, at a later stage to encourage Britain into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>My view, for what it is worth, is that the Common Market cannot work or will not work or can never be successful without Britain.  Therefore, if it is to survive and if it is to work, Britain must be a member.  Whilst we play our part and whilst we are likely to play our part in the world in which we live today, there is only one choice to be made and the choice is between the free world of the free people in the free nations or the complete and entire rule of Communism.</P>
    <P>The Government must be aware that if free nations are to flourish and to survive, the only hope for the world is a completely united effort between a completely united Europe linked in close co-operation with the United States of America forming a <i>bloc</i> known as the free world <i>bloc</i> against Communism.  We should play our part and we must play our part to bring about, in so far as we possibly can, a United Europe.  It is our place to use all the influence we have abroad to see to it that an effort will be made to have both Britain and Ireland members of the EEC and that, in addition, when the EEC is formally established, there will be the closest possible link between the United States of America and the united Europe. When we reach that stage, there will be little fear of war, of world discontent or of any trouble because a united Europe, with the United States of America, will definitely be the most powerful force in the world.</P>
    <P>All of us desire to see the day when we shall have that world force in order to ensure against war and, furthermore, to plan for a future and for a greater measure of prosperity in a united Europe.  If this leading French businessman is correct in his forecast, and I have a feeling that his forecast may be very accurate, what planning have we done here in this country to prepare for entry next year into the EEC?  The Government have been silent on this matter.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Taoiseach and to the <Col N="58" /> Minister for Finance that we have lagged well behind Denmark in making arrangements for entry into the Common Market; that our Ministers were snoring while the Danish Government were actively planning for entry into the Common Market.  I should like to hear from the Taoiseach whether he has brought together under the leadership of the Minister for Industry and Commerce the leading industrialists in this country, the trade unions, and all sections of the community, including the farmers' organisations, to discuss the seriousness of the Common Market. When I hear Fianna Fáil speakers down the country talking about the Common Market at crossroads, one would imagine they were talking about Ballinasloe fair.  Very few of us realise the seriousness of the problem, the manner in which it must be met, and the necessity of planning in preparation for it, and the manner in which we must be prepared to face the growing pains of the early years of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I want to accuse this Government.  I want to charge them with neglect of duty.  I want to say they have not faced up vigorously to their responsibilities, that they have not kept the country, this House, or the people properly informed of the implications involved, that they have not got down to consulting with all organisations concerning the urgency and importance of preliminary preparations.  There has been no positive or definite planning for the 150,000 workers who will lose their employment overnight on the entry of Ireland into the EEC.</P>
    <P>However, the Common Market problem faded into pale insignificance in recent weeks in comparison with the problem posed by the Government in their White Paper <i>Closing the Gap.</i> Where was the White Paper asking the people to live within their means, to tighten their belts, to watch their spending and not to look for increases in pay when the judges' salaries were being increased, although some of them were already earning £30 a day? The man with £30 a day was not asked to tighten his belt; he was not asked to cut down his spending or to live within his means.  The White <Col N="59" /> Paper was addressed to the workers, the wage earners, the farmers and business people, all of whom have very limited incomes.</P>
    <P>The White Paper was an unnecessary document.  If Fine Gael were in office, there would have been no need for a White Paper of that kind.  This was a typical piece of Fianna Fáil planning.  I should like to hear from the Taoiseach, because he has been dodging the answering of this question, whether he studied the White Paper before it was sent to members of the Dáil and the Press.  If he did study it, why did he not immediately say: &ldquo;Before we release this to the country, we had better consult with the trade unions and the people?&rdquo;  The first duty of the Government before issuing that White Paper should have been to call a conference and to have present at that conference representatives of the farming organisations and the trade unions.  The Government should then have told that conference: &ldquo;This is what we are faced with.  Have you any suggestions as to how we can meet the economic difficulties lying ahead?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil did not do that.  They used the firm hand again.  After paying themselves and their friends and after being responsible for increasing taxation to an unprecedented figure, they asked the poor to live within their means and made a threat of a wage freeze.  What are the implications of the White Paper?  Why does it ask people not to seek increases in pay? It is a pity it was not addressed to the select few who received large salary increases eight months ago.  Here we have a White Paper asking the people not to seek wage increases, to be patriotic, to work harder, to spend more time working and get less money for it.</P>
    <P>If that White Paper had been sent to Grangegorman, one could understand a certain response from that quarter but why, in Ireland, in 1963, is a pay pause asked for by the same Government as recklessly increased the prices of bread, flour and butter, recklessly increased the cost of living, did away with the Prices Advisory <Col N="60" /> Body and allowed everyone in a position to do so to charge what they liked for their goods without any public inquiry into increasing costs?</P>
    <P>During the time of the inter-Party Government, a public inquiry was conducted by the Prices Advisory Body before any increase was allowed in the prices of essential commodities. That is not the case now.  Instead we see the Government asking the community generally to be patriotic while they themselves can spend what they like in wild extravagance and squandermania.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Taoiseach whether it is a fact that when that White Paper was issued, many thousands of applications by Government employees for increases in pay were under consideration.  I should like to know that because I feel that this House is entitled to a statement. What is the position regarding the 10,000 members of the National Teachers' Organisation who propose to press their claim for better salaries and better conditions with the utmost vigour and determination?  Does the White Paper cut across the rights of these 10,000 national teachers who are looking for what they are entitled to, a decent and proper standard of living?  Before the White Paper was issued, did the Minister for Education agree that the 10,000 national teachers were to be betrayed in this manner and that an effort was to be made to sabotage their right to look for what they are entitled to?  In replying to the debate to-night, it is the duty of the Taoiseach or of the Minister for Finance to inform the House what the attitude was, is and will be towards these national teachers.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that 5,000 members of the Gárda Síochána now say that despite the White Paper, they are going ahead with their claim for an increase in pay and better conditions? Who can deny that the Gárda are entitled to a substantial increase in pay? I want to place on record that a Government from this side of the House would and certainly will sympathetically consider the case of the Gárda Síochána and of other State <Col N="61" /> officials for increases in pay to which it is felt they are rightly entitled in order to ensure a proper standard of living.</P>
    <P>I should like to be informed as to the position of other sections of the community such as civil servants.  The association representing the civil servants recently issued a statement which was published in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of Friday, 15th February, 1963, under the heading &ldquo;Protest by Civil Servants.&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>An attempt to single out State employees for discriminatory treatment in the matter of pay adjustments would be resisted by every means at their disposal, says a statement on behalf of the civil servants general staff side on behalf of 25,000 civil servants who are looking for the rights to which they are entitled. The statement followed a special meeting of the civil servants which considered the Government's White Paper on incomes and output.</P>
    <P>Here we see that the civil servants' association speaking on behalf of 25,000 organised workers have protested against the terms of the White Paper.  We feel sure that they will continue to seek what they are entitled to and that men will be found in the House sufficiently courageous to stand up and see that the rights of those people are safeguarded and maintained, because they are seeking only what they are rightly entitled to.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is very hard to beat the old dog off his track.  It is well known that Fianna Fáil were responsible in the past for drafting the heads&mdash;and they are still available in Government offices&mdash;of legislation, which they would have presented in this House had they got the chance, to bring about a permanent wage freeze and wage control.  That has been pointed out here by others on this side of the House and it was never denied by any Fianna Fáil speaker or Minister. They did make an effort to freeze and control wages before.  That is on record, as well as the heads of the Bill they were bringing into this House, if it were not for the fact that they were beaten in a general election immediately afterwards and never had <Col N="62" /> the strength or courage to come forward later with their Bill until this White Paper arrived as the thin edge of the wedge to control the wages of wage earners throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government have as yet seen the foolishness of their ways in this regard and whether at this late stage they have proposals to set up a permanent national committee to determine the allocation of national income and to advise the Government on wages.  It is all very well and fine to consult with trade unions, farmers and others, but the primary responsibility is on the Government and it is our job in Opposition to discharge the duty of an Opposition.  I clearly remember when the Taoiseach was in Opposition and when he was criticising the policy of the inter-Party Government, he was asked if he could make a constructive suggestion.  &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is our job to oppose and you are being paid as a Government to put the constructive proposals into operation.&rdquo; Now the boot is on the other foot and he is being paid to put the constructive proposals to this House and to tell the House what the future is regarding output, incomes and wages.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if there is any truth in the report published this week in a national newspaper to the effect that the Government are likely to appoint a national body to fix wages and if the Government have such a proposal under consideration, whether it will be a body of economists who have no responsibility whatever to the people or whether it will be amply representative of the trade union movement.  Any effort to control or restrict wages is bound to meet with the toughest possible opposition from organised labour, unless organised labour have a say in the moulding of whatever Government policy is likely to be introduced in this regard.</P>
    <P>Again, it is strange that the Government should concentrate on restricting people's incomes when they could have rendered a more valuable service over the past three years and particularly over the past 12 months.  They could have reduced the cost of living but they failed miserably to do so.  Not <Col N="63" /> alone did they fail miserably to reduce the cost of living but they made no attempt to reduce it.  They devoted all their energies towards making it very difficult for the wage earner and the poor to exist.</P>
    <P>Has the price of practically everything not been increased?  Is it not a strange time even to consider restricting or freezing wages when there is no attempt to control the cost of living? It is no harm to remind the House that during the time of the inter-Party Government, bread and flour were reduced and either 7d. or 8d. per lb. was taken off butter.  The moment Fianna Fáil got a chance they put back that 8d. per lb.  on butter and they did not even give the dairy farmer the increase for his milk which they promised faithfully to give.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear what is the policy of the Government in relation to the cost of living.  Have they any policy in that regard or are they going to sit there like a group of schoolboys and allow the cost of living to go even higher than it has gone already?  The tendency is for prices to rise and rise.  They have proposals to keep down incomes but no proposals that I have seen or heard to keep down the cost of living.  Every Deputy and, more important still, the people outside would like to hear what will be done about the cost of living.  Does the Minister for Finance realise that there are tens of thousands of homes today where butter is never used?  In an agricultural country, people cannot afford to buy butter.</P>

The moment the change of Government came Fianna Fáil put back that 7d.  a lb.  on butter.  If Fianna Fáil were not back in office today, the Irish people would be getting butter at 7d.  or 8d. a lb.  less than they are paying for it now.  However, if they were foolish, that is their own responsibility.  As I have often said before, if they sow nettles, they cannot expect roses to <Col N="66" /> grow.

      <P>The cost of flour, bread and the essentials of life was much cheaper during the term of office of the inter-Party Government. Nobody knows that better than the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>Before I was interrupted, I was coming to a very important point.  Now that the Minister for Finance is rather vocal, we should like to hear what he has to say in relation to the proposal he has in mind for a purchase tax.  The Book of Estimates this year in so far as the taxpayer is concerned is a record breaker.  Beer, spirits, petrol and the essentials of life cannot bear any further taxation.  We all know that these commodities cannot be any dearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of petrol came down last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that all the channels of taxation are exhausted, the Minister for Finance suggests a purchase tax.  If the Minister for Finance introduces a purchase tax next month, such purchase tax would be equivalent to a reduction in the people's incomes.  A purchase tax has the same effect as a reduction in the people's incomes.  There is no difference. I hope and trust that the trade union movement, the farmers' organisations that we admire and cherish and are glad to have, the housewives and every section of the community will rally together, sink their differences of the past and resist such a purchase tax.  I want to say for the record that if Fine Gael were in office, there would be no purchase tax; there would be no purchase tax contemplated; there would be no purchase tax threatened; there would never be a purchase tax put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have Fianna Fáil coming in the backdoor with this method of cutting down people's incomes.  They do not want to cut salaries.  That <Col N="69" /> would be too barefaced.  They do not want to take so much per week from each wage earner, from the guard, the teacher, the civil servant, the road-worker, the forestry worker, the businessman.  Instead of a reduction in income, there is to be a purchase tax.</P>
    <P>A purchase tax must be and should be resisted.  A purchase tax did not succeed in any country in which it was introduced and is bound to fail in this country.  I hope trade unions and everyone concerned will rally the moment such a tax is introduced and defeat the motives behind it.  The intention is drastically to cut down the incomes of our people.</P>
    <P>The country cannot afford any new taxes.  At one time, the Taoiseach&mdash;I do not know whether it was the present Taoiseach or the former Taoiseach who is now President&mdash;said that taxation had reached its limit.  The Minister for Finance must now realise that taxation has reached its limit long since and that if any new taxation is imposed that will affect the distilling, brewing and textile industries, it will mean more unemployment.  In the case of the brewing industry, it will mean that most of the small breweries will close down.  The textile industry, which is in a very delicate situation at the moment, cannot afford one penny of additional taxation.  Rather than be subjected to additional taxation, the distilling, brewing and textile industries and the motor trade need encouragement and incentive.  They need a tonic to revive them, to enable them to increase their production, to put more on the market, to provide more work, to take on more hands, to increase their output for the home market and the export market, rather than being killed by increased taxation imposed by an irresponsible Government who do not see any further than their noses.</P>
    <P>What is wanted is encouragement. Something should be given to industry, rather than taxing it out of existence. There are many speakers in the House who feel that the Government are endeavouring, so far as possible, to tax industry out of existence.  Was it not the last inter-Party Government, through Deputy Sweetman, who gave <Col N="70" /> certain tax concessions to industrialists to come here and establish industries and to help in the revival of Irish industry?  Would it not be better if the Government concentrated on giving industry a tonic to revive it rather than putting a halter of increased taxes around its neck so that it must cut down on expenses and reduce employment? In that regard the Government have fallen very far short of discharging their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I am a believer in industry, I believe in the establishment and encouragement of industry.  Industry is a great medium through which employment can be given.  I believe our industrialists have played a noble part in providing work and producing good articles.  I believe our industries produce articles which are as good as can be produced in any industry in the world, having regard to the limited conditions in which they must work. The time has come when an effort should be made to encourage, help and assist them in every possible way.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what he has done about his promise and undertaking to reduce the number of civil servants.  We have in this country as good a Civil Service as there is in any country in the world. I am sure that is agreed all round, but having regard to our dwindling population, to our very limited resources and to the paying capacity of our taxpayers, is there any justification for vastly increasing the number of our civil servants? No one has any objection to such an increase if it can be justified, but why promise to reduce the number and then increase it? Does it not show deceit and dishonesty on the part of the Party who say on a platform on a fair day, at street corners and church gates, that their policy is to reduce the number of civil servants and come then into Leinster House and vastly increase it?  If that is not the essence of dishonesty and hypocrisy, I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>When the Book of Estimates reveals a bill for the highest taxation on record, we must bear in mind that as well as having to meet that bill, the taxpayers now have to meet a record-breaking increase in the rates of the local authorities.  I remember <Col N="71" /> when the Minister was Minister for Health, and in this House, from the very seat in which he is sitting this evening, I heard him say that the Health Act could mean 2/- in the £ on the rates.  That is on record.  Instead of being 2/- in the £ on the rates, it is now 6/-, 7/- and 8/- in the £, and yet fewer people are getting health services. Despite the record-breaking cost of the health services, there never was such a limited number of people getting health services; there never were such bad health services; there never were such poor, bankrupt, broken-down, helpless, health services as there are today; and yet the health services never cost the ratepayers so much.</P>
    <P>What will be done about relieving the local authorities in that regard? If the Minister said to me: &ldquo;What would you do about it if you were in office&rdquo;, I would be very happy to reply.  If a Fine Gael Government were in office, the health charges would immediately come off the rates, and the rates in every county in Ireland would be reduced by at least 5/- in the £.  A reduction of 5/- in the £ on the rates would be very welcome to the small farmers, to the mountain farmers, and to the farmer who lost his sheep in the snow, the farmer who was surrounded by snow for the greater part of the winter and whose Government did nothing whatever to relieve his plight during a disastrous and tragic winter.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael would immediately deal with the finances of the health services, and would introduce a scheme of better health services, services for all, with free choice of doctor which does not obtain to-day, and that reduction of 5/- in the £ on the rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree, but I was endeavouring to point out the reduction Fine Gael would bring about for the ratepayers and taxpayers, if we were in a position to do so.  It is only right that we should demonstrate to this House and to the <Col N="72" /> country the comparison between the wise economic policy of Fine Gael, and the wild, extravagant and spend-thrift policy of Fianna Fáil.  It is only right that we should tell the people how we would bring about a substantial reduction in rates by making all charges for main roads a national charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Government spending in relation to roads in a general way, and particularly in relation to housing, is not being tackled by the Government as it should be. The same applies to the various schemes in relation to drainage and afforestation which could be implemented, both of which would be quite capable of employing many thousands who are now unemployed.  I put it to the House that the Government are not spending the taxpayers' money with prudence, wisdom and caution. That is why I charge them with irresponsibility, with insanity and with a high degree of neglect.  As the custodians of the taxpayers' money, they are failing to spend it wisely and as it should be spent.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Taoiseach or the Minister what Government policy, as reflected in this Book of Estimates, has in store for the farmer.  I represent a good farming constituency.  It has a first-class tillage tradition and a tradition of honesty, hard work and straightforwardness.  Is it not a fact that people are flying out of our farms to-day?  There is no Fianna Fáil Deputy in the House at the moment from west of the Shannon. If you travel through parts of Galway, Mayo and Roscommon you will find galvanised iron nailed up against windows, doors barred and the land in a state of desolation.  There is no one to be seen because they have emigrated. The small farmer has been put completely out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the dairy farmer, the tillage farmer and the livestock farmer.  Is there any hope that the position for them next year will be any better than <Col N="73" /> it was last year? Last year, from my own knowledge, was the worst for the majority of the people on the land since the Famine days.  I have known farmers who, when last year's harvest was over, still had to pay for the seeds and manures that went into the ground last spring.  I have known farmers who were the victims of an injustice by the millers and others, who took their produce unjustly and did not pay for it.  The Government stood by and allowed that state of affairs to exist.</P>
    <P>What encouragement is there for any young farmer's son to remain on the land? Is the tendency not to get off the land as quickly as possible, to fly from the country to the cities, towns and abroad?  This is simply because in this country we have no agricultural policy.  The Minister for Agriculture has no contact whatever with either policy or realities.  This Government do not know the conditions under which the farmers are living today.  Our farmers are short of credit.  All our land is short of livestock.  Our farmers are not getting sufficient for wheat, oats, beet or barley.  When they produce both barley and wheat, there is no market for them and they have to beg those responsible to take the barley and wheat, as I saw them begging last year.</P>

Deputy Dillon is the man who will provide it. It is the one way in which you can increase production.  There is no use asking farmers to work harder.  They cannot work any harder.  They have themselves slaved to death.  There is no use asking them to increase production. The only way is to give them the money to do it.  We have in Ireland farmers as good as those in Denmark, New Zealand, Australia or Britain. But our farmers never got a chance. How could they get a chance?  We had the Economic War.

      <P>The Economic War opened the gates of every workhouse in Ireland for the intake of small farmers.  The Irish farmers must be the best in the world to take the treatment they got over the years.  There were the ten fields of inspectors that the Minister for Agriculture was to bring down on them.  He said: &ldquo;The old cods.  I will make them work.&rdquo;  We have a fair memory, and the farmers <Col N="75" /> have not a bad memory, either.  If the livestock breeder or tillage farmer got half a chance, if he were encouraged with the capital to enable him to go ahead, he would have a better record than the Danish farmer.  I am hopeful that the day will come when the Irish farmer will be given a chance to display his real ability on the land&mdash;a chance he has not got under Fianna Fáil.  I see in this morning's paper the heading &ldquo;Hope For More Exports: British Market's Value.&rdquo;  That heading is in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Our farmers are the backbone of the country. If you have a prosperous agriculture, the community is prosperous.  If you have a bankrupt, poor agricultural community, all is lost&mdash;and that is what we have today.</P>
      <P>In connection with this &ldquo;Hope For More Exports&rdquo;, the Minister for Finance stated a moment ago he did not like any references to the Economic War.  I should not imagine the Minister would like to hear any references to the Economic War. Those were the days when he was shouting &ldquo;The British market is gone and gone forever, thank God.&rdquo; We now see the very men who condemned the British market arriving, even as recently as the day before yesterday, in London to see if they can get anything.  They wanted to talk to the British Government about the serious plight in which they now find themselves, in the hope that they would be able to get a market for Irish produce.</P>
      <P>We must bear this in mind.  Last week and the week before, the Danes were in London negotiating with the British Government to see what they could get for their farmers.  The minute the reports appeared in the papers that representatives of the Danish Government were in London bargaining, the Minister for External Affairs and the Taoiseach got in touch with Mr. Macmillan to know if he would meet them to see if they would be able to get anything that would be left after the Danes had got the best of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Danes are always able to wipe the eyes of the Irish because the <Col N="76" /> Danes have the key in their hands to the British Ministry of Agriculture and to 10 Downing Street.  Our present representatives are the men who always condemned and wrecked the British market, who denigrated it and despised it until the day before yesterday when they dropped over to see if the Danes had left anything. Why did the Government not go to England before the Danes? Why did the Taoiseach and his Government of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;-men&mdash;as we can describe them because none of them must have spoken for the farmer&mdash;not arrange with Mr. Macmillan to enter into negotiations long ago?</P>
    <P>There was a great fuss in 1962 in relation to certain talks on Ireland's admission into the EEC.  We were told in this House that the Danes were not as far advanced in negotiations as we. Deputy Dillon will deal with that later.  Now we find that back they came from London yesterday, having got nothing.</P>

      <P>We got more out of Britain than ever Fianna Fáil were capable of getting.  Why?  Because Fine Gael always had the good Ambassadors, the men who knew how to negotiate and the men who knew how to get the best possible bargain out of the British.  Could you blame the British?  Mr. Macmillan and Mr. Sandys and Mr. Soames are by no means foolish men.  They know that the men coming to talk to them on behalf of the Irish farmers are the men who crippled and denigrated the British market.  They know they are the very men who decried and hated the British market.  They know that these very men are now trying to steal in through the back door to see if they can get for the Irish farmer anything the Danes have left.</P>
      <P>It was terribly stupid not to go over and negotiate long ago and particularly before the Danes.  I see the report in today's paper of what I may describe as a statement of silence by the Taoiseach when he came home.  If they had got anything from the British for the Irish farmer or for the Irish economy the Taoiseach would hardly be down the steps of the plane before he would have a press conference to announce it.  But always, when they lose anything, we have this silence. The last time they came back with less than they had; they lost concessions for Ireland.  When they arrived back last night, there was not a single word and there was no statement. The simple fact is that they got nothing from Britain.  But if Fine Gael had been there, something would have been got and could be got and can be got and will be got from the British.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach was going over on behalf of the Irish Government, in the hope of getting more exports&mdash;Ireland being an agricultural country and the Danes having been over there bargaining on agriculture&mdash;why did the Taoiseach not take the Minister for Agriculture with him?  Is it not strange that our representatives went over to ask for <Col N="78" /> increased agricultural quotas, better markets and better conditions, and that those representatives were the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs and that the Minister for Agriculture was left at home?</P>
      <P>No explanation has been given to the Irish farmers as to why they were not represented.  The Irish cattle trade must look upon all this with suspicion as must the tillage farmer and the dairy farmer.  The talks went on between Mr. Macmillan and Mr. Sandys and the Minister for External Affairs and the Taoiseach and our Minister for Agriculture was not present.</P>

I want to say that the more British Ministers who come here on public or private visits, the better. Let them see what we have, what we can give them.  We have the best livestock for the British market; we have good farmers and we have as good a country as there is in the world today if only it were worked properly.

      <P>The time has now come when Fianna Fáil should allow the people to test their policy. They have failed miserably in every step they have taken and blundered in every attempt they have made.  They are no possible asset to the country and they have inflicted untold hardships on every section of the community, farmers, civil servants, business people and all.  All sections today are clamouring for a general election and when the time comes for one, the people will show their appreciation of the men who have been serious in their efforts to help them.  I direct my remarks to the Labour Party.  The Labour Party have a duty to put Fianna Fáil out and we have a duty to co-operate with any Party who help to put them out.  Is that not very clear?

      <P>Public representatives at some stage or other in life become mature.  They either resort to gimmicks to keep themselves in public life or they take increased responsibility seriously.  It is a matter of which course one chooses, but we in Fianna Fáil have invariably chosen what we regard as the responsible course in all our time in public life. You have only to look back on our record over the years to appreciate that fact.  If we went out of government temporarily&mdash;and we did&mdash;we always came back stronger than before and those accidents do not happen without reason.  They are based on very sound reasons and the reason, in my view, is the fact that we have been honest with the people at all times.</P>
      <P>We are considering the Vote on Account for 1963-64 and to a great extent the debate has not differed much from what one would hear in many county councils throughout the country at this time when the local rate is being discussed.  I must say that the Labour people took a constructive line and welcomed the amount but Fine Gael speakers invariably started by condemning the huge amount proposed in the Book of Estimates and having done so, having condemned and pretended to be appalled at this huge vote they proceeded in their speeches to advocate more expenditure in every possible sector of the community.</P>
      <P>The same thing happens in parish pump politics, in county councils throughout the country where local councillors advocate more expenditure right through the year for every little service for which the local authority is responsible but when it comes to striking the rate, they try to shelve responsibility and say it is an unbearable burden, intolerable and must be reduced.  Fine Gael resorted to the old tactics of saying it was entirely the fault of Fianna Fáil.  The public in this country are not fools any more than in any other country in the world.  For many years they have listened in this House to speeches such as Deputy Flanagan has repeated and which have made very little impression upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> Once again, we have just heard from Deputy Flanagan the miracle of Fine Gael, the miracle which only happens when they are not in office.  We have just been told butter will be reduced in price, farmers will be paid more for their milk, bread will be cheaper.  A better price will be paid for wheat; every farmer will get £1,000; taxation will be reduced; the guards, the teachers and civil servants will get more and taxation will be reduced. Outside of Grangegorman, there is not a solitary citizen who will take that statement otherwise than with a grain of salt and it is not necessary to dwell on that statement for one moment.</P>
    <P>We have faced up to our responsibilities fairly and squarely.  At the start of our term of office, we announced our programme in the form of a White Paper known as the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  We decided when that programme was issued, we would hide nothing from the public, that our method would be exposed and open to them, that the progress made would be charted along the line, that we would annually review the progress and publish a statement accordingly.</P>
    <P>It was particularly stressed in that programme that as much of the public expenditure as possible would be channelled into productive employment and increased production generally.  Those are the lines on which we are going and I defy any Deputy listening to me here to take that Book of Estimates of £167 million and say that that is not the predominant motive which actuated every Department's Estimate in the entire book.  The taxpayer is being asked to come to the aid of agriculture to the extent of £36 million, which is more than £8 million above last year's Estimate, and we have just heard a Deputy insinuate that nothing is being done for agriculture.  I should like to see a greater figure for agriculture.  I am a rural Deputy and I particularly welcome the Government's plan for the small farmers about which most of the Deputies on the Opposition side of the House who have spoken so far know very little.  The small holding west of the Shannon is the holding that has down through the years supported <Col N="87" /> a family at a very low standard of living which the younger people of to-day are not prepared to tolerate.</P>
    <P>I come from a constituency where emigration has been known in the days when emigration was more akin to starvation and nobody in this House can tell me anything about it.  I have seen emigration in days when destitution drove the people to find a living somewhere.  In the townland where I was born and reared, I saw over 40 people emigrate between 1924 and 1926.  It was not to England they went then because there was no employment to be found in it.  They went to America and most of them never returned.  To-day, however, with the greatest facility, a person can get an air ticket or a rail ticket and be in England the next day.  Invariably, they will find better pay than they are getting at home in any job we are likely to offer them.  There is no denying that.  I do not think there is a person in any occupation in this country who could not point out that from a monetary point of view, his services would be better rewarded if he went to work in England, whether he is a professional man, a tradesman, an artisan of any kind or even a labourer.</P>
    <P>That is not everything.  There is much more to offer here than mere monetary gain.  It must be remembered that while many of those who emigrate are already leaving employment here, we do not deny that there is a percentage, much too big a percentage, who have to go for economic reasons and that is the percentage with which we are concerned.  There are factories in the country where there is good employment.  There are factories in my county from which people have emigrated to find employment in England or in America.  However, there are also people who have to go due to economic conditions.</P>
    <P>I was present at an official luncheon on one occasion in my county at which his Lordship, Most Reverend Dr. McNeely, spoke.  He seldom speaks and when he does he speaks wisely.  He said in regard to emigration that if we could reach the position&mdash;and he <Col N="88" /> believed that everybody concerned was doing everything possible to reach that position&mdash;where we could offer work to those who wanted to go, then at least we could not be blamed for letting them go.</P>
    <P>That is the answer.  Nobody wants to stop emigration compulsorily.  Let there be free movement but if we could reach the position where we could say: &ldquo;If you wish to stay there is a job for you,&rdquo; then the finger of responsibility does not point at the Government.  Unfortunately, that stage has not been reached yet and the economic situation is not entirely responsible for it either.  It is only part of the cause.  Social reasons may tend as much towards driving them out as any other reasons.</P>
    <P>To work towards finding more employment, creating better employment and the expansion of the economy generally is the only solution but that solution will not come overnight. Let us see are we moving in that direction.  The people outside who take an interest in the affairs of this House are not fools.  They are quite well able to judge whether the efforts being made are genuine, whether they have been effective and what their ultimate outcome will be.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> as enunciated by this Government, there are laid down two sound principles which are being followed.  The end is to expand our economy and create the necessary opportunities which must ultimately absorb the surplus labour from the land.  What are these efforts?  Under every single heading that is calculated or designed to improve our economy, there is greater activity, more money is being given annually and in general, the economy is being expanded as planned.  That programme aimed at an average annual increase of two per cent.  in real national income and those are the standards by which we must be guided.  That target has been exceeded and a rate of four per cent. has been achieved.</P>
    <P>We have given more money to afforestation.  I remember the time when the Opposition preached that <Col N="89" /> afforestation would solve all our problems overnight.  The figure for afforestation has reached the highest ever recorded and the activity under afforestation is the highest ever achieved and is still going apace.  In fact, in my constituency, the complaints I am getting now are that we are taking over too much land for afforestation, that it should be left for the farmers.</P>
    <P>We have put more money into tourism.  I remember when the Coalition suggested a tax on tourists.  I remember when it was said that they were coming in to spend paper money and to take away our food.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. MacBride, who was then a member of the House and an integral part of the Coalition Government.  We do not hear any word of that now.  Tourism is now regarded and accepted as the second biggest industry we have.  We are giving it every possible encouragement. I did not hear a single complaint about it in the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>In regard to fisheries, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands has made it possible, by a training scheme, for every decent fisherman who so desires to equip himself to go to sea with the necessary knowledge and, by paying down a very low percentage of the cost, to go with one of the best equipped boats that there can be, to the fishing grounds, so as to increase our catching power and to expand the industry.  We have set up processing stations and ice-plants to offset glut and to stabilise the price of fish generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flanagan, must be aware that during his entire period in that office, during which he was responsible for fisheries, not one herring was exported from this country, not one attempt was made to find markets for fish.  I do not want to <Col N="90" /> go into the other shortcomings.  The more he did, the better I would like it but there is a terrible lot of cod&mdash; if I may quote the Leader of the Opposition, and I am not punning&mdash; talked from the other side of the House about fishing.  We are going about the development of fisheries in accordance with the best advice we can get and we are putting into it all the moneys necessary to expand the industry.  The important factor is that it should give employment to a large and expanding number of people and contribute to our balance of payments because every fish taken out of the sea is real production and a contribution to the national wealth.  We have a long way to go and we are moving rapidly towards expansion of the industry.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to agriculture. Apart from our new plan for the small farms, which I particularly welcome and advocate, we are asking the taxpayers to support agriculture to the extent of £36½ million.  No Deputy and nobody outside this House can accuse this Government of not making a genuine effort towards the expansion of our economy in every possible direction.</P>
      <P>There was discussion here about the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  That White Paper was misrepresented by the previous speaker.  He called it a pay pause and a signal to tighten your belt.  He knows as well as I do that it is neither of these things, that it is a very intelligent document, well regarded by the responsible people throughout the country, particularly the small farmers about whom I am talking, particularly by the people who have to stand by and watch others getting increases which they cannot get.  If that White Paper points out, as it does in the simplest language, that the Government should not be pressed for increases until the expansion of the economy justifies them, I think it is a very sane type of thing and I guarantee that no sensible Government who will ever be in power are likely to regard it as anything but a very sane document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all sections of the community <Col N="91" /> to consider, not merely one section.  There was a great deal of talk about equality and not asking one section to carry the burden more than another.  That is exactly what <i>Closing the Gap</i> means&mdash;absolute equality for all sections; that no one section should be allowed to pass another until it is justified by an increase in national wealth or production, an increase which, fortunately, we are getting.</P>
    <P>If there was some slowing down in progress last year, that does not necessarily mean that we had sunk back to the position in which we were in 1957. Remember, if exports last year showed a decline, they were £21 million more than they were prior to 1951&mdash;a very marked increase.  Remember, there was an increase in real national income last year also.  But we are taking the easing off as a necessary warning and we issued that White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> as a very sane, logical document which explains in the simplest terms what is good government and good national housekeeping and I think even all sections of organised labour agree with the principles contained in that White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every section would like to get more.  When Deputy Flanagan was talking, he gave everyone an increase and reduced taxation at the same time.  We give an increase every time it is justified and the sooner we can give one, the better we like it, when it is justified by an expansion in our economy.  What was the system adopted by the previous Government? Instead of a White Paper, there was a credit squeeze when things had got out of hand for so long that drastic measures had to be taken.  If they had issued the necessary warning, supported by practical effort, prior to that period of depression, the credit squeeze, which squeezed them out of office, would never have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the time when they had to notify every Department to ease off <Col N="92" /> development, that money was not available.  We do not gain much by recalling and recriminating across the floor of the House but recrimination has become such a feature of the debate on this Vote on Account that one is tempted to remind people of some of the things of which it is not so nice for them to be reminded.</P>
    <P>I listened to my colleague from Donegal talking about housing. Figures were quoted from both sides of the House regarding housing activities. I will quote no figures, but I will ask Fine Gael to do one thing: go out and ask any contractor in the 26 Counties what is the position in building to-day compared with what it was in the Coalition Government's period of office.  I am prepared to accept his answer in every single case.  Go out to the providers, the builders' suppliers, or anyone associated with the building industry in any way whatever, and ask what is the position of the building industry now as compared with what it was prior to 1957, now that sufficient operatives are not available to carry out the biggest building programme the country has ever experienced.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the people in the country despair when they hear nonsense of that kind thrown back and forth across the House?  Let us talk sense.  If we make mistakes, let us own up to them.  If we make a slip let us make the effort and get the acceleration to go ahead again.  Let us show the people that we are intelligent, determined and interested in doing good.  If Fine Gael succeed in getting into office with the type of effort Deputy Flanagan has given us, they will be assured of one thing&mdash;and Deputies can quote a speech I made from this side of the House in 1958&mdash; that is, that we will come back in a very short period stronger than ever before.  Fine Gael cannot tell the people that they will provide thousands and millions of pounds, and reduce this and that, because that is not acceptable to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I will give Fine Gael some advice for nothing.  If they expect to get back into power, they will do so only by being logical and by preaching something acceptable to the people.  No one <Col N="93" /> has a monopoly of the brains of the country.  We do not claim that we have, and Fine Gael have not.  The people will not accept anything nowadays. We are becoming politically mature and Fine Gael cannot tell them that they will increase the price of wheat and reduce the price of bread, or increase the price of milk and reduce the price of butter, or give £1,000 to every man who has a bit of land, and not increase taxation.  No one will accept that, but if Fine Gael want to do that, that is their concern, but they should have some regard for the people who put us here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan dealt with the Common Market to some extent.  I shall not make a specific statement about the Common Market, but he made a few remarks which I think were unfair.  He said that no planning whatever was done, and he tried to deride the whole idea.  We all know in the broader sense what the Common Market will eventually mean to us. It will mean that we will become part of a very large community in which we will have common rights with other member states for the sale of our products.  It does not entail much specialised preparation other than what the Government have been very meticulous about doing already.</P>
    <P>Our industrialists are very able. They have had to face a good deal of criticism since 1932.  If they are in a position today in which most of them can face competition in any world market, they were brought to that position by the foresight of Fianna Fáil, and particularly of the present Taoiseach.  I remember when it was rather unpopular in this House to talk about Irish manufactured goods and I remember that when I went into shops, they apologised because they could only give me shoes made in Ireland, or something else made in Ireland, because they were compelled by the big bad wolves of Fianna Fáil to have Irish-made goods on sale.  We have come a long way since, thank God.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage in which we have confidence in ourselves.  We realise that we can produce in every <Col N="94" /> sphere of industrial activity as well as or better than any other country in the world.  If we have reached that stage, a fair amount of thanks is due to the much-maligned tariff walls which protected our industries in their teeth cutting stages, and which gave the necessary protection and encouragement to people to invest their money in these industries.  Without the protection of those tariff walls, those industries would never have come into being, and they are now industries which can talk about entering a Common Market.  If we had not got them, we would have very little right to talk about entering a Common Market, but they are there and we are proud of them.  They are expanding and increasing every day and we hope they will be dispersed over the entire country as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I listened to some remarks in the course of the debate regarding foreign investment in this country.  Some speakers accused us of leaning completely towards foreigners and others took credit for initiating the original encouragement which brought foreign capital here.  It is the same old slogan: when anything good was done, it was the Coalition Government who did it, and when anything bad was done, it was Fianna Fáil who did it.</P>

      <P>He is not the only one who says that.  Deputy Dillon had a similar paradox about housing.  He gave figures to show the number of houses built by Fine Gael&mdash;he was talking about local authority houses&mdash; as compared with the number built by Fianna Fáil, and he accused Fianna Fáil of not doing as well as they should have done in building local authority houses.  Then when he came to a year in which Fianna Fáil had a good record, and good figures which were incontrovertible, he said that was due to the planning that had taken place years before, that you cannot go on with a housing programme unless it was planned at least three to five years before.  On that reckoning&mdash;<Col N="95" /> they were only three years in office&mdash; we must have planned the entire programme they carried out.  That was an attempt to have it both ways and, as I say, no one is deluded by it.</P>
      <P>We have experienced in the past few years a very heartening activity in every sector of the national community, in industry, in agriculture and in the various branches, but the most important thing, apart from the definite expansion which is going on, is the renewal of confidence, which is a confirmation of what we have preached for many years&mdash;faith in ourselves.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go back but in the years immediately preceding 1957, if there was one thing more noticeable than another during that period of time, it was the gloom and dismay and the pall of despondency which seemed to hang over the Government's activity or lack of activity.  It was not easy to dispel, and though Deputies do not like to be reminded of it, the people outside the House are well aware that what I am saying is a fact.  I remember responsible people saying to me at the time&mdash;people who have since put money into industry&mdash;&ldquo;I think there is no hope for this country.  I believe that.  I think we cannot do it.  There is something wrong.&rdquo;  We have got away from that attitude and that is the most valuable asset that has emerged from the definite attempt to expand and increase production since that time.</P>
      <P>We are moving forward with confidence. People are prepared to part with their savings and to invest in projects of a big variety.  They are confident in doing so.  They are not actuated by patriotism alone.  They do it because it is rewarding, and it is remunerative.  They are confident that what they are investing in is gilt-edged. That did not come about easily, and if I were to make one boast for our Party more than another, I claim that we, the Fianna Fáil Government, are entirely responsible for bringing that about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan made wild statements about the cost of living, extravagant statements which I know he did not expect anyone to believe, but he <Col N="96" /> did not explain why in the years 1954 to 1957, the cost of living went up by 11 points.  Would not one expect a speaker from that side of the House to say: &ldquo;We know the trend is upwards.  It was that way when we were in power and we could not arrest it.  In fact, we let it get out of hand&rdquo;? It is only natural to expect that that will continue.  I do not think there is any country in the world that can point to a downward trend.  We are not alone in that and we do not take any consolation from the fact.  We know that we cannot be accused of directly causing a trend.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan made some peculiar statement about the Coalition Government reducing the price of butter by 7½. or 8d. a lb.  I was not trying to be derogatory when I interrupted him and said I could not remember it happening.  I cannot remember. I do know that during one period we were importing butter from other countries, and possibly it was cheaper. I cannot quite remember.  It was not a very palatable butter, but I suppose we were glad to get it at the time.  I do not think any Government can be proud of a situation in which we have to import what should be one of the basic products of our fundamental industry, agriculture.</P>
    <P>We now have increased milk production. We are spending several million pounds&mdash;I think the exact figure is £6,100,000&mdash;to keep the price of our dairy products up.  While Deputy Flanagan was trying to give courage to those who are advocating a better price for milk, he was doing it in a very blackguardly sense because he knows it would embarrass the Government. I think that, having regard to everything, we are doing well in that direction and our efforts to dispose of milk and milk products over the past number of years cannot be derided by anyone.  I think we are meeting with a generous amount of success in that direction, and that is due to very good handling on the part of those responsible for it.</P>
    <P>I would not say that <i>Closing the Gap</i> has been misrepresented, but attempts have been made to misrepresent that White Paper.  Most people today appreciate the need for producing <Col N="97" /> it and the logic of the message it conveys.  I think some people on the Opposition side of the House found some comfort in the fact that our imports increased last year, because they believe that an increase in our adverse trade balance might hasten the day when they could sufficiently misrepresent the situation and get back into power&mdash;and not for any other reason.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the people on the Fine Gael benches that when one considers that over 62 per cent. of those imports represent materials for industry and agriculture, and that 13 per cent. of those imports were directly concerned with capital equipment for new projects, one realises that, however large the increase in imports may be, it has this very good side, too.  The fact that much of it was in connection with agriculture, and particularly with agricultural machinery is, to my mind, encouraging.</P>
    <P>I do not think any serious-minded Deputy, speaking from his heart, can find any real fault with the genuine effort the Government are making to expand our economy.  Let me repeat what other members on this side of the House have already said.  We will bank on one particular thing in pursuing that programme, and the policy which we have laid before the people. We will make known to them at every stage the progress, or otherwise, which the nation is making, what our intentions are, what we propose to do, and how we will do it.  We believe, as the Taoiseach said, that if the people were given all the facts, without any varnish or attempt at political expediency, they would be able to differentiate between two lines of political propaganda&mdash;that which I have just mentioned and that expounded by the Deputy who spoke last from the other side of the House and who was prepared to give all things to all people at all times, this Utopia around the corner.</P>
    <P>While many harsh things have been said from the Labour benches, some very constructive and helpful suggestions have been made as well.  It is only right to recognise that fact.  We <Col N="98" /> do not expect to be praised by the Opposition, but we appreciate the constructive approach of the Labour Party on this occasion.  They say, as I say, that this £167 million is a colossal sum.  However, if we were to put into the Estimates all the expenditure advocated by Opposition speakers, the figure would be twice that sum, although these same speakers started off by condemning the huge amount in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>I think we have reached political maturity in this country.  We now realise&mdash;if some of us in this House do not, the people outside do&mdash;that we cannot have it both ways.  If we are to give benefits to various sections of the community, somebody has to pay. Our policy is to give those benefits in accordance with the ability of the nation to pay, to bring up the economy to meet an increasing standard of living and to justify increases and to put an all-out effort into the expansion of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been tempted to make a contribution because of certain statements made during the past hour and a half.  It is usual to take advantage of this debate on the Vote on Account to express views on the wisdom or otherwise of Government expenditure.  Criticism by an Opposition Deputy, however, does not necessarily mean that he or his Party intend to deprive the Government of the right to the money necessary for the carrying on of State services prior to the various Estimates being passed. The Labour Party have no intention of voting against this Vote on Account.  We have actually decided we will support the Government.  We do that, not because we are afraid of a general election, but because, whoever is in power, the essential services of this country must go on.  The foolishness of a vote against providing this one-third of the necessary moneys must be obvious.  What would happen if the Labour Party along with Fine Gael and Independents put out the Government?  You would have a general election.  You could not have that election in the period within <Col N="99" /> which that money would be required for Government services.  The Civil Service, teachers, Garda&mdash;all would have their pay held up.  Surely no sane Party would accept that and leave the country without the necessary means of carrying on while a general election was taking place?</P>
      <P>It can be taken as certain, therefore, that any criticism we make is made in all honesty.  The fact we have decided to vote with the Government on this Vote on Account does not mean an endorsement of Government policy, but means we recognise that essential things must be carried on. Deputy Corish gave in pretty good detail the Labour Party's policy in relation to this Government.  I do not propose to go over the ground covered by the Leader of our Party. What induced me to speak was this question of the emphasis being laid, and rightly laid, on production.</P>
      <P>I believe production is the key to the prosperity of the country, but you must look at it from the worker's point of view.  Unfortunately, you must take unemployment into account. While admitting that unemployment has been reduced since 1957, or any other year you like to take, it is unfortunately true that approximately 70,000 people have to seek work each year and cannot get that work because it is not available for them.  On top of that we have&mdash;I think I am quoting the Taoiseach's figure; certainly I am not trying to misquote him&mdash;20,000 men, women, boys and girls who have to leave this country every year.  That means that in any one year at least 90,000 people are unable to get work and many of them have to flee out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the background against which workers are asked to produce more.  I know workers.  I have been in contact with them for the past 20 years.  I know the answers I have got when I have asked for that production in the national interest.  &ldquo;Do you suggest that we should work ourselves out of a job?  Do you suggest we should produce twice as much this week as we did last week and run the risk that at the end of a short period <Col N="100" /> we will be laid off?  If we are not laid off, do you suggest we should produce more so that our colleagues will be laid off?&rdquo;  That is the problem so far as increase in production is concerned. I suggest it is a very human feeling that should be taken into consideration. Until the Government can provide machinery so that assurances can be given to the working people that production will be used as a method of expanding work rather than, as in the past, a method of reducing the labour content in factories, you will find it very difficult to get production.</P>
    <P>I should like to clarify that slightly. By expanding work I mean when the money from increased production is ploughed back into the industry in the form of either reduced prices on the selling market, thus attracting larger sales, or improved machinery rather than being diverted, as in the past, to bigger profits for both directors and shareholders.  Until we are assured that money is being used to attract and expand industry, I am afraid that workers will take the view that increased production is not only not helpful to them but is a grave danger to themselves and to their fellows.</P>
    <P>In like manner, I think, although I have no knowledge at all of agriculture, that the farmer has much the same view about increased production of crops.  Farmers have said to me: &ldquo;When cabbage is scarce, we get a good price.  When there is a bad year with potatoes, the price doubles.&rdquo;  I am afraid&mdash;and I can well understand it&mdash;that those engaged in agriculture have learned a sad lesson.  They have learned, up to this anyhow, that, due to bad marketing, increased production has led not to increased prosperity but to a reduced price for their commodities. It is very difficult to appeal for increased production under those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government should bend their efforts towards giving workers the assurances which they feel are absolutely necessary in order to secure their co-operation and, in the case of farmers, a guaranteed price or, alternatively, a guarantee that any surplus will be marketed at a reasonable price in the light of the cost of production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> I was very interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach assure us that most of the workers welcome the White Paper. I am afraid he must be living in a world completely divorced from this one if he got that impression from the statement made by the Congress of Irish Trade Unions.  Certainly, most people whom I know, having read that statement, got the very opposite impression from the Congress that the workers welcome the White Paper or the pay pause or the wages standstill&mdash;call it what you like.  Without question, it was a statement from the Government that, in so far as it lay within their control, it would apply to all State servants, officials and bodies towards which the State contributed money such as semi-State bodies, county councils and various other bodies which they subsidise.  It was a direct statement that they could look for no further increases until certain things had happened.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there was a direct advice to the Labour Court not to grant further increases and an advice to private industry to refuse to agree to further increases for workers.  That, of course, had to be challenged by the trade union movement.  It was leading us to complete State control.  I am glad the Government have changed their view in that respect.</P>
    <P>During the debate, they gave assurances that there was a misunderstanding. We accept that there may have been a misunderstanding but, as the White Paper went&mdash;the closing of the gap, as Deputy J. Brennan called it&mdash; we feel that if the gap is to be closed, it should not be closed completely at the expense of the working class people.  If restraint has to be applied, not only should it be applied to wages and earnings but also to the wages and earnings that are called profits: the profits made by shareholders, directors and various other people.  They, too, should share the burden with the working class.</P>
    <P>Looking back since the introduction of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> two or three years ago, during all the time that has since elapsed, at dinners and on all occasions, various <Col N="102" /> Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and, indeed, managers of factories, have spoken in glowing terms of the upward sweep of the economy, of the prosperity coming upon us.  Even as recently as Budget Day, 1962, the Minister for Finance dealt for practically two hours with the wonderful outlook for this country.  Then, in less than a short 12 months, we suddenly have this pay pause, this wages standstill, slapped at us.  I wonder what happened.  Was it an error over the years or was it just a panic because we are £99.7 million out of balance? Whatever the reason, there has been a complete change in the view of the Government in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are not anxious to condemn this Government or any Government for what they spend, if we feel it is spent in the interest of the majority of the people.  We do not grudge the Irish farmer the reward to which he is justly entitled for his labour.  Neither do we feel that the man who invests in industry should not get a worthwhile return for the capital he has invested.</P>
    <P>This is the largest Estimate that this country has known.  The Labour Party have no quarrel with that fact. As Deputy Corish says, our main interest is in how the money is spent. We desire to see it spent in the wisest way.  We desire to see it devoted to the people who need it most.  Naturally, from our point of view, social welfare, health services and other services which, in the main, concern the worker, are our principal consideration.</P>
    <P>Inasmuch as a good deal of additional expenditure in the year 1963-64 is earmarked for improvements in directions where we believe money requires to be spent, we are in complete agreement with the Government. However, inasmuch as certain semi-State bodies which receive direct aid from the Government need supervision, I endorse what the leader of my Party suggested, namely, that the Government and this House owe it to the country to establish a committee of some sort to examine, supervise and, if necessary, demand an explanation of how vast sums of money have been spent in years past.</P>
    <P>I realise that in this debate it is not <Col N="103" /> permissible to go into details on this or, in fact, on any particular part of any Estimate, but there is one other point I should like to make before I conclude.  We believe that where a good deal of money, a huge amount of money, is being devoted to giving grants for the development or enlargement of industry, a scheme with which the Labour Party are in complete agreement, many of our native industries which were established in a small way before these grants were available, which are crammed into small buildings and which have had to use machinery unsuitable for expansion, find, when they make application for these grants, that they get a much less ready response than if they had come from outside this country.</P>
    <P>Only last evening, an industrialist, who, with a little credit or a small grant, would be able to double his staff, was refused either credit facilities or a grant to enlarge his business. He said his only fault was that he had been an officer in the Irish Army and not an officer in the British Army or the German Army.  As far as Government expenditure goes to provide employment and give improved social services, the Labour Party have decided to vote the money to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Book of Estimates presented for the coming financial year certainly indicates a heavy growth in Government expenditure. This Government, if they have done little else, have achieved a series of records.  For the first time, the adverse trade balance has gone over £100 million.  For the first time, Government expenditure will exceed £200 million which is another record. For the first time the national debt exceeds £500 million and the cost of living index figure has reached 160, representing an increase of 25 points since 1957.  At the same time, our exports are declining and imports increasing.  That does not indicate a very healthy state in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate demand throughout the country as a whole has risen by over £2 million and the greater portion of <Col N="104" /> that is due directly to Government legislation.  Very little of it is due to actions over which the local authorities have control.  Since Fianna Fáil took office, the price of every commodity, bread, butter, tobacco, beer, bus fares and rates have increased. That is an entirely different story from what Fianna Fáil led us to believe would happen if they were elected to government in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the announcements made in 1957, after Fianna Fáil took office, was a plan to modernise the Civil Service.  This plan was to introduce new methods and techniques which would result in a substantial reduction in the number of civil servants.  I want to make it clear that I have nothing against civil servants.  I think they are doing a good job of work.  They are as up to date, as intelligent and as industrious as any civil servant in the world.  The one comment I have to make, a comment which has been made by many members of this House, is that this country could be run by a far smaller number of civil servants than we have at the present time. When the Taoiseach took office in 1957 he believed the same thing and told us he had a plan which would bring about this result.  In 1956-57, the last year of the inter-Party Government, the number of permanent civil servants was 18,460.  For the present year, there are 20,635, which represents an increase of 2,175.  Those figures do not appear to fit in with the plan the Taoiseach told us he had to reduce the number of civil servants when he told us that the Civil Service had grown too big and too costly for a country of our size and that a reduction was needed immediately.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why Fianna Fáil were elected in 1957.  I thought the country had got enough of them from 1932 to 1948.  I thought the country had remembered the effects of the Economic War and the effects of Fianna Fáil policy in general and that was the end of them.  However, they landed back in office and I often wondered why.  According to the Taoiseach, they came back to office because they had a dynamic policy, a plan vigorously to tackle the twin evils of unemployment and emigration, a <Col N="105" /> plan to provide 100,000 new jobs that would put the 90,000 then unemployed back to work.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to blame the 90,000 unemployed, their wives and members of their families for coming out and supporting Fianna Fáil at that time. If any one of us happened to be an unemployed person at that time and some responsible person made a statement that he would provide jobs for us if elected to Government, we would have come out and voted for him and it would be very hard to blame us. That was part of Fianna Fáil's dynamic policy.  Now, after a number of years have passed, it is only fair to ask what has become of those plans and what results have come from them.</P>
    <P>Since 1956, 300,000 of the cream of the youth of this country have emigrated, which constitutes another record in itself.</P>

      <P>It is a tragic thing. If they were middle-aged or old people, it would not be quite so bad, but this number is made up in the main of young men and women aged between 18 and 30 and without them, any country will get on very badly.  As so many employable people have emigrated&mdash;and certainly people between 18 and 30 are employable&mdash; one would expect a big drop in the unemployment position but, unfortunately, that is not so.  In 1956, there were 445,000 people in agricultural employment and in 1961 the number was 409,000, a reduction of 36,000.  In non-agricultural employment, we had 718,000 in 1956 and only 712,000 in 1961, a total decrease of 42,000.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance apparently does not agree with the housing figures. Very few of us will forget the campaign carried out by Fianna Fáil in the years 1954 to 1957.  It was not confined to Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Every Fianna Fáil county councillor, every Fianna Fáil henchman, was going around the country shouting that the Government were &ldquo;bust&rdquo; and there was no money for housing.</P>

In 1956-57, the last year of the inter-Party Government, the figure for local authority housing was 4,784 and in the year 1961-62 the figure was 1,238, a decrease of 3,456.  Are those figures correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJBurke" hpid="Mr. J.J. Burke Mr. J.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure for State-aided houses, that is almost all other houses, in 1956-57, was 4,647 and in 1961-62 it was 4,099.  Just how bad were the inter-Party Government? The figure is lower all the time. Taking the two categories of houses, the reduction was 5,000.  The number employed has fallen from 6,285 to 2,556 in 1961-62.  That is the result <Col N="107" /> apparently of the Fianna Fáil dynamic policy.  It means paying a whole lot more to keep them in office and getting far less from them.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, who represents the same constituency as I represent and who has been a member of the council for a long time, knows, every Deputy and every county councillor is continually approached by people who are looking for work or for houses.  They have a perfect right to approach any public representative if they are willing to work or to approach him for help to get a house if they are willing to pay a fair rent for it.  I wonder what is the Government's answer to those problems.  Have they any answer?  Is the answer just to go on increasing their own expenditure?  That appears to be their answer.  As far as I can see, most of their spending is not what I call productive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of it is prestige expenditure.  We have, in my view, colossal waste of money on main roads at the present time and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is quite familiar with that as he does a lot of travelling around.  No one would object to spending a reasonable amount on main roads to put them into reasonable repair and that could be done, I think, without lavish expense by adding to them the three, four or five feet which is available instead of making them three times their width and rooting houses and trees out of the way at the cost of a colossal amount of money.  The money could be far better spent in other directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of prestige spending to which I personally object very much is giving huge grants to private companies or private individuals to build luxury hotels.  If those people want to expand their premises in order to make a fortune for themselves by catering for millionaires or people with plenty of money, the ordinary <Col N="108" /> taxpayer should not be asked to foot the bill.  If a businessman in a small town or village tries to renovate his premises or does it up a bit in order to keep the little trade he has, a valuer is sent down&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Board of Works knows a little about it&mdash;and the valuation of his premises is increased and the rates go up accordingly.  That is all the help he gets to improve his premises but if he happens to be a wealthy man or a company and puts up a million pound hotel, he will get all the aid he wants.</P>
    <P>There is another thing to which I object and I hope I make myself clear. There is plenty of money for foreigners who set up industries here.  Nobody objects to giving grants to set up any industry, if the industry has a reasonable chance of survival and gives reasonable employment, but so far as I can see, many of the industries which were set up in the past ten years gave very little employment and appear to have a very slender chance, if any, of survival.  In fact, very many have gone to the wall at the present time.</P>
    <P>We have another institution, Irish Shipping.  It might be a very nice thing and a very good thing if we could afford it.  We have ships chartered to half the world&mdash;I do not know what the figure is but I am sure it is at a loss&mdash;but we have no ship between here and Britain where 80 per cent of our exports go and where 80 per cent of our passengers go.  Often cattle, a very important export, have to wait over a day here for want of shipping and it is a well-known fact that people often have to queue overnight at Dún Laoghaire or other ports waiting for a boat.  Would it not be far better, if we must have such a thing as Irish Shipping, to put a ship or two on these routes than have them on charter all over the world for anything that can be got for them?</P>
    <P>The Government are continually telling the man in the street to save while they have plenty of money to lavish on luxury hotels and to squander in every way possible.  If they are in any way sincere in their exhortations to people to save, they should set the good example themselves.  They could <Col N="109" /> effect a very great saving in this House by abolishing at least two of the present Ministries or Departments. The House generally will agree that we could get on quite well without the Department of Justice as such and that one Minister and one Department could handle Defence and Justice. That is not an original suggestion as far as I am concerned.  In fact, it was first suggested by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party who is now a Minister. I wonder does he agree still&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that all he is? However, he will be promoted after a while.  There could be a very definite saving by amalgamating those two Departments.  Another obvious thing to do is to abolish the Department of Transport and Power altogether, to abolish that Ministry, The greatest case made for the abolition of the Department of Transport and Power is made by the Minister himself because every time a question is put to him in this House, the same answer is given: &ldquo;I have no function in the matter.&rdquo; That is perfectly true.  He has no function in very many matters in that direction.  That Department should be abolished and whatever little bit of business there is could be carried on by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any businessman with commonsense who examines his business will find out what section of it is paying and he will naturally try to expand and develop in every way the section that is paying.  Would it not be reasonable to ask the Government to expand and improve agriculture, as it is the only industry that is paying at the present time?  From the Taoiseach's statement to-day or yesterday&mdash;I do not know whether it was in London or coming from London&mdash;it appears that the Government have at last realised that the only commodities we can export at a profit are livestock and livestock products.  It is reasonable to expect the Government to do something to expand the output from the land and provide a reasonable market for that produce.  The Government <Col N="110" /> should have money to expand and develop the marketing system for agricultural produce.  I remember £250,000 being voted some years ago but what has been done with it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little coming from it.  If that is the only effort that has come from the £250,000 something else had better be tried. Every section of the community, wage earners and salary earners, and so on, have had their incomes increased in the past five or six years.  Does the Minister realise that the income of the farmers has gone down by over £20 million?  Does he expect a small farmer to stay there and keep going? The small farmer who works a very long day and whose wife works just as hard as he does are able to earn only about half a labourer's wages. Who could expect them to stay on the land in those conditions?</P>
      <P>If something is not done and done very quickly to relieve the plight of these small farmers, the West in a very short time will become completely denuded of population.  These people are closing the doors and going away and it is very hard to blame them. That is a tragic thing and it will have very far-reaching repercussions because those small farms were the only real factories this country ever had or ever will have.  It is there the calf was produced, the pig was produced, the lamb was produced and all the things we can export at a profit from which real money was obtained to pay, among other things, the salaries and wages of the people who have got increases in the past few years.  If they go, where is the money to come from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A short time ago, the Government published a very attractive-looking scheme under which uneconomic holdings were to be brought to an economic level.  We were very pleased to see that scheme, especially in my constituency in Roscommon because 81 per cent. of the farms there are under £20 valuation.  It can be described as a congested area.  What is happening there?  When a farm of land, a fairly extensive farm at that in <Col N="111" /> the middle of a congested area, comes on the market, the Land Commission either do not bid for it at all or they bid for it in land bonds which are not cashable at the present time or if they are, only at a very reduced rate.  The man who wants to sell his farm will sell it to somebody who will pay him cash.  The Government will slide out of it on the ground that they were outbid, whereas in actual fact they were never really interested&mdash;they were only playacting.  If they were interested, they would pay the market value in hard cash which is the only currency anyone is inclined to accept nowadays.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands is not here because he told us what the Government are doing for the farmers in the west by way of building up creameries there.  The Deputy should know that it is the considered opinion of a body of men who are competent to judge that the only way the creamery industry can survive is by closing three-quarters of the present units.  That has been done with very great success on the Continent.  By the use of modern transport, milk can be brought distances up to 50 miles economically.</P>
    <P>The factor that is jeopardising many creameries and separating stations at the moment is insufficient intake of milk.  If there are too many creameries and separating stations, there is bound to be insufficient intake at each of them.  I mention that matter for a specific reason.  The small farmers of Roscommon and North Galway subscribed £6,000 out of their own pockets to help to establish a creamery in Athleague for Roscommon and North Galway.  The Government gave a considerable grant.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands reminded me that through his good offices, that grant was increased.  That may be so and, if it is so, I am very thankful to him.  But what did the Government do then?  Having given a grant to set up this creamery in Athleague, a short time afterwards, they gave another big grant to set up another creamery in Cloonbeirne in North Galway, within a few miles of the Athleague creamery.  If that is not <Col N="112" /> madness, I do not know what to say, because that area was well catered for. As a matter of fact, there are shareholders of the Roscommon creamery in that area, which could be well catered for by Roscommon and Claremorris. The result will be a serious loss to the farmers and to the Government because there will certainly be insufficient intake of milk in each of these creameries and, consequently, higher running costs and a lesser price for milk.  Any loss incurred on a creamery must come out of the milk and the farmers will get less for their milk.  The price is bad enough at the moment.  One or other of these creameries will eventually close down.</P>
    <P>It is high time the farmers did something definite for themselves and forced whatever Government are in office to give them justice.  Every section of the community has its organisation or union and these organisations have succeeded in obtaining justice for the people they represent. I am very glad to see such farmers' organisations as the NFA and Macra na Feirme in existence at the present time but I should very much like to see a combined farmers' organisation representing every section of the farming community and completely non-political. When we arrive at that stage, the farmers may come into their own.</P>
    <P>As was mentioned a short time ago, nearly all our trade is with Britain and the major portion of that trade is in agricultural produce.  When trade talks are proceeding between the British Government and our Government, it is amazing to find the Minister for Agriculture, who should be and who, I believe, is looking after the farmers' interests in this Government left at home.</P>

      <P>I must bow to your ruling, Sir.  I thought it would be relevant on the basis that money is wasted if the proper man is not sent. In any case, I shall not pursue the <Col N="113" /> matter.  I should like to say that is not the way things were handled in 1948 when Deputy Dillon went to London and negotiated agreements there that were of enormous benefit to this country, agreements which the Danes are looking for at the present time.  I hope Deputy Dillon will be in a position to go to London very soon again.  If not, I do not know what will happen.</P>
      <P>I do not know what kind of planning or what kind of policy it is on the part of the Government to export good millable wheat at £16 10s. per ton and import pollard at £22 per ton.  On very many occasions, it was the same ship that brought in the pollard at £22 per ton and brought away far better feeding stuff at £16 10s. a ton.  The sane and sensible thing to do would be to make that excellent feedingstuff available to the farmers at £16 10s. a ton rather than export it at that figure.</P>
      <P>We have heard quite a number of Government speakers expounding the record of Fianna Fáil in connection with various social services, including the old age pension.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance spent a long time on that matter here the other day.  I do not know where the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance got his figures or how he came to believe that the Fianna Fáil Party had done anything worth while for the old age pensioners because the figures certainly would not indicate that they did.  I should like to quote briefly the record of Fianna Fáil in regard to the old age pension.  An old age pension of 10/-a week was given by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government on 6th April, 1928, and there was no increase whatever during the 16 years that Fianna Fáil were in office from 1932 to 1948. I wonder how that fact escaped the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

As far as I can see ,the next increase came in January, 1949, when the inter-Party Government took office.  A Bill was introduced which added 7/6d. to the basic rate of old age pension and at the same time, legislation was introduced to make the means test much less severe.  Again, in 1951 another 2/6d. was given to the old age pensioner.</P>

If our produce were properly marketed, we would have in return more employment and more contentment.  I sincerely hope the Independent Deputies, who have been keeping the Government in office for the past year and a half, have at last seen the light and that they will turn them out at the first available opportunity, which I expect to be very shortly.

    <Speaker pid="NicholasEgan" hpid="Mr. N. Egan Mr. N. Egan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to pay tribute to the constructive approach of the Leader of the Labour Party in his speech and also to the similarly constructive approach of <Col N="116" /> his colleague, Deputy Kyne.  However, Deputy Kyne made reference to the White Paper, and I must say I cannot agree with his interpretation of it.  He said the Government were acting in the role of dictator as far as wages are concerned.  I want to answer that by quoting one paragraph from the last page of the White Paper which, I think, contains the essence of the meaning of the White Paper.  It is this:</P>
      <P>Employee incomes in general, as well as profits and other non-agricultural incomes, have risen significantly over the last few years. Farmers have done less well ... it is important that the cost of what they buy should not be further raised by wages, salaries and other incomes increasing out of line with national production.</P>
      <P>What is wrong with that paragraph? Is that not the height of common sense and economic sense?  I cannot see how Deputy Kyne can object to that or how he can read into it something antagonistic to the working man. Deputy Burke, who has just gone out, put over the same idea as expressed in the White Paper in somewhat different language.  He said the incomes of all sections have increased in the past five or six years, except those of the farmers.  Of course, Deputy Burke went on to say he wondered why Fianna Fáil got back to power after 1957.  He thought the people should be sick and tired of them after all the bad things they did during their terms of office since 1932 and after the Economic War.  I wonder when will Fine Gael stop talking about the Economic War?  I am always surprised they mention it at all.  After all, we won the Economic War.</P>

      <P>The people Fine Gael said suffered as a result of the Economic War put us back stronger than ever after it was won.  If anybody cares to look up the results in the farming constituencies, he will find that they supported us particularly well after the Economic War.  They expressed their full approval of what <Col N="117" /> Fianna Fáil achieved and expressed in no uncertain terms their disapproval of Fine Gael tactics.  I hope for the sake of their own reputation in that period Fine Gael will forget about it in future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde, a prominent Fine Gael front bencher, followed the Taoiseach in this debate.  One of his first complaints was that Fine Gael no sooner had produced a policy than Fianna Fáil adopted it.  He went on to say the country was inevitably heading for a disaster unless the Government adopted a new policy&mdash;presumably a policy other than the stolen Fine Gael policy, as they are so fond of calling it. That kind of logic is typical of Fine Gael.  That is the kind of logic they have applied to their consideration of this Vote on Account.  They have criticised the amount involved.  They have thrown up their hands in horror at the enormous burden, as they allege, imposed on the taxpayers, but not one of them&mdash;I listened to speech after speech here by Fine Gael&mdash;gave one specific item which they thought should be cut out altogether or reduced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman led off for Fine Gael.  He is an ex-Minister for Finance.  He made a rather long speech.  I read it very carefully.  It was a maze of figures, some of them not very clearly presented, and some of them of very doubtful accuracy; I failed to find one suggestion from Deputy Sweetman as to where this Vote on Account could be cut down, where some item could be cut out, or expenditure reduced in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the main Estimates now.  There is an increase of £2 million for remuneration of civil servants, teachers, gardaí, members of the Defence Forces, and some health authority staffs, bringing the total up to £53½ million.  That is accounted for almost entirely by the eighth round of wage and salary increases.  The increase of £3,250,000 for Social Welfare and Health brings the Estimate to £40 million.  The increase of £1,600,000 for Education brings the Estimate up to £20,600,000.  The biggest increase of all, £8,100,000, brings the Estimate <Col N="118" /> for Agriculture up to £36½ million. All these increases on these four main Estimates amount to very nearly £15 million&mdash;£14½ million to be exact &mdash;and make up approximately the total increase in the Estimates for 1963-64.</P>
    <P>The speeches made by the Fine Gael speakers here have been a jungle of irrelevancies.  Some of them, indeed, spoke the most outlandish nonsense. Not from one of them did any suggestion come as to where or how the figure of £14½ million could be reduced.  Deputy Dillon made one nebulous suggestion about wheat going out and Russian pollard coming in.  I notice he did not pursue that matter today when the Minister for Agriculture answered a question in relation to it; he was very shy about following it up.  Indeed, he left it to his colleague, Deputy Donegan, and, for some reason, he did not pursue it very far either.</P>
    <P>Being a farmer, and representing a farming constituency, and being from the intensive tillage county of Offaly, I am very pleased that the Estimate for Agriculture has been increased so substantially by over £8 million.  That is an indication, a clear unambiguous indication, that the Government are determined to help the farmers to the greatest extent possible.  Now, in the recent White Paper there was an appeal for the stabilisation of incomes in accordance with production.  That appeal should meet with a good response.  It is of the utmost importance to the country as a whole but it has a greater significance for the farming community than for any other section.  The appeal is a reasonable one.  I cannot see anything unreasonable in it.  Neither can any other farmer. It has the approval of every thinking person in the country.</P>
    <P>A certain interpretation has been put on that appeal for purely political motives.  If that appeal is responded to in the way it should be, that £36½ million in the Estimate for Agriculture can be expended with much greater benefit and much greater advantage to the farming community. It is regrettable that the Fine Gael Party by their attitude of bitter opposition <Col N="119" /> to the appeal in the White Paper should so callously disregard the interests of the farmers.  A whole-hearted response by all sections of the community to the appeal is quite obviously in the best interests of the farmers.  Does anyone in Fine Gael deny that?  If they think otherwise I can assure them they will be made quite well aware of the true feeling when they meet the farmers in their constituencies and they will be brought severely to account for their opposition to the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister for Finance back with us again and to see him looking well.  I assure him that the people of the midlands in general, and the farmers in particular, are very grateful that the finances of this country are in such capable hands at this very critical time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main theme of the speeches of the Government Party in the course of this debate is the honesty of this Government in bringing the facts of political life to the public.  Most speakers on the Fianna Fáil side have emphasised that Fianna Fáil have always told the people the truth, no matter how unpopular the truth may be.  They take pride in this type of speech and it has been reiterated by all the backbenchers, having been propounded in the first instance by members of the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to examine the truth of that statement by Fianna Fáil.  We had a White Paper which, to put it bluntly, if the Government had got away with it meant a wage freeze and the Government and their supporters in the House have said: &ldquo;We want the public to know the facts; we are not like the previous Government who would not tell the people what the position was.&rdquo;  I think it is quite apparent that the situation as outlined in the White Paper&mdash;the deterioration in our balance of payments position, the increased number of unemployed, the reduction in exports&mdash;was known to the Government for some time past and prior to January, but I am convinced that the situation disclosed in <Col N="120" /> the White Paper, which is practically the same as what took place in 1956, would not have been made known to the public, were it not for the fact that the Common Market bluff had been called.</P>
    <P>During the war years, the Fianna Fáil Government were telling all those who disagreed with them: &ldquo;Do not criticise the Government because there is a war on; do not upset the applecart; it is unpatriotic to criticise the Government.&rdquo; That was the theme of the war years.  The theme for the past 12 months was&mdash;and it will be the major theme for the coming 12 months&mdash;&ldquo;Do not criticise us on any of these counts because we are deep in negotiation on Ireland's admission to the Common Market.&rdquo;  That was what the Taoiseach had in mind when on so many occasions he said abroad recently: &ldquo;We shall be in the Common Market by 1964.  There is no doubt about it.  We shall do everything we are asked to do.  To hell with what we stood for up to the present.&rdquo;  He got what was coming to him.  This man, who put on his European clothes overnight, was exposed in all his nakedness, politically speaking, when Ireland's application was not even reached on the collapse of the negotiations on the British application.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government were left in the position that, having depended on the Common Market gamble to prevent criticism of their policy over the past five years, when they found that the gamble was not going to come off, they had no option but to come to the House and tell the public that things were not as good as they pretended they were before Christmas.  Suppose some people outside the House are gullible enough to believe that Fianna Fáil are honest in their approach, why should they get political kudos for telling the truth about the situation?  Why has that situation arisen?  Is that not the real question that should be asked now? Why did the situation develop which led to the issue of the White Paper which, if they were stronger politically in the House, they would have no hesitation in putting teeth into?</P>
    <P>Can they blame that situation on <Col N="121" /> foreign trade or the terms of foreign payment?  Can they blame it on anything outside the country such, for instance, as the Suez crisis which the former Government blamed?  Can they blame it on a recession in Britain, on the Common Market, on the EFTA countries or on America?  How has it arisen that the Government cannot balance their books at the end of the year; that the rate of expansion, small though it has been, has slowed down considerably in the past 12 months; that a greater number of people left the country last year than in any year in the past ten years?  Who is responsible for that?  Who was in control, in Government, for the past six years? Somebody must take the blame and it is not the ordinary citizen.  It is not the Opposition because they had no taste of power in the past six years. It cannot be pinned on any political Party except the Government and they must take the rap for the serious situation disclosed in the figures presented to the House.  They cannot face about and have the audacity to say: &ldquo;Are we not honest men to tell the people this serious situation has arisen?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They suggest the people are mature. I think they are reaching the stage of maturity when they will say: &ldquo;All right, you are honest.  The situation is bad but you made it bad.  What kind of incompetents have been in power for the past five years to allow this situation to arise?&rdquo;  That is the question that must be asked and must be answered.  When it will be answered is another matter.  I believe the Government should be made to answer it in the shortest possible time.  Many in the House and outside it do not agree with me.  Many ask: &ldquo;Whom can you put in?&rdquo;  There are many people in Ireland who say: &ldquo;Yes, the Government are incompetent.  Fianna Fáil are incompetent and are dishonest but what is the alternative?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the political position today.  How can we deal with that situation?  If the Government maintain&mdash;and I agree with them on this&mdash;that the public are now mature, then the decision should be left to the electorate and if they feel they have <Col N="122" /> had enough of Fianna Fáil for the present and want this &ldquo;stagnating backwater of Fine Gael&rdquo; to take over for the next three years, that is the public's right.  But I have the feeling that if the public are given the chance it may take two or three elections and when they are over and the air is cleared we shall have Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on the one side of the House, where they should be today.  There is not a democratic country in the world that I know where the Opposition and the Government agree on all fundamental points.  The approach of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to every single item of major importance is exactly the same.  I have been saying that since I came to the House but as evidence in support of it I can quote a short statement made by the present Minister for Finance as reported in the Dáil Debates of 11th March, 1959:</P>
    <P>If Deputies will bear with me, I should like to give four quotations from four Budget statements.  I should like Deputies to make a note of them and to ascribe the speeches to their authors.  Deputy McGilligan made one; Deputy Sweetman made another, Deputy MacEntee made another; and I made another.  I defy any Deputy to say who said what. I say that to show that there is really not much between us.</P>
    <P>That statement was made by the present Minister for Finance in 1959. The gap has not widened since on major issues between himself and his opposite number, Deputy Sweetman.</P>
    <P>The situation is that we have this mock political battle in this House, a struggle for political power, for the plums that a change of Government can bring to the other group, while there is no difference in approach by either group to solutions for the major problems of to-day.  The former Leader of this Government who is now outside Party politics said on one occasion in this House that if the system we had did not work, he was prepared to go outside it.  I cannot criticise him but I can say that this system has been in operation since he left.  It was the same system as Fine Gael worked when they were in Government. <Col N="123" /> That system has failed and the Government know it has failed and the Opposition know it has failed. What did they do?  They tried the back-door method of changing the system.</P>
    <P>They preached free trade publicly and free private enterprise and then they come in and say that we must plan X, Y and Z.  Did you ever hear anything as contradictory as people who worship at the shrine of private enterprise saying we must plan ahead; we must organise if we are going to have free trade and be dependent on private enterprise?  They are all mixed up in their approach.  In lip service, they are so wedded to the idea of private enterprise that they have not the honesty to say that private enterprise has been a disastrous failure in this country in so far as producing the goods is concerned.  &ldquo;Goods&rdquo; to the Irish people mean how many of our people are allowed to live and work in Ireland at a reasonable wage.  To me, that is the test of any Government: to how many people can we give the opportunity to say: &ldquo;We need not board the boat at Dún Laoghaire or go by air to get work outside the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is depressing to hear in this House the exchange of views to the effect: &ldquo;When you were in office 50,000 people left the country&rdquo; and the reply: &ldquo;Oh no, there were only 40,000.&rdquo;  That is the degre of difference between them, as if these human beings were only statistics to be hurled about.  It is even more depressing when you read that in London the Minister for External Affairs goes on St. Patrick's Day with a big beam on his face to see shamrock being blessed in a church in Soho and then watches a parade of Irish people, 90 per cent of whom would like to work in Ireland.  What kind of audacity or neck have our Cabinet Ministers got that they can go to London and presume on the patriotism and patience of Irish citizens, whom they drove out of the country during the past 30 years, that they will receive them with open arms? It makes me wonder when I see photographs of IRA veterans with their <Col N="124" /> chests full of medals marching up and down in London on St. Pakrick's Day, and having the right to march there, when only 30 or 40 years ago, their aim was to drive the ancient enemy out of this country so that they would build it up to live in with their children. Where are they now?  They are in London, Manchester, Liverpool and every major centre in Britain.</P>
    <P>Do you think they would come back? No, but they will wear their medals on St. Patrick's Day and they will send their children to school in Britain where there is no means test and where they will have a chance of reaching the highest educational standards. They would not come back nor will they send their children here in order to experience the degrading medical service which we have but they will accept the benefits of the welfare state which is available to them in Britain and find nothing immoral about it.  That is the type of double-thinking which we have.  It would be immoral here to have the means test removed or to say that every person should have the same right to get on and to make a living here.  We are getting out of that backwater now and the Irish people are a lot more mature than some years ago when that type of propaganda was given out inside and outside churches and inside and outside this House by people for their own political reasons and for dirty ends.</P>
    <P>When I hear Deputies saying that they believe in private enterprise, I should like them to give concrete examples of what private enterprise has done in the past 25 to 30 years without State assistance in the form of grants or loans belonging to the people.  I should like to hear of one industry which has provided largescale employment without a State grant or loan.  An industry is not private enterprise, to my mind, if it has to come to the State to get the assistance of the people's money to help it make more money.  Such industries may not be described as <i>entrepeneurs</i> in the true sense of the word.  They are people who batten on the public's money in order to make more money themselves.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that any expansion <Col N="125" /> which has taken place since the 26 Counties got their freedom has been through State or semi-State companies or State or semi-State organisations? Is it not a fact that when this or the previous Government want to boast of what they did, they proudly point to the work of the ESB, Bord na Móna or the sugar company?  They look with pride at what Aer Lingus is doing. Is it not in such ventures that success has been achieved?  Are they not the property of the people?  I do not at this stage propose to criticise the manner in which some of them are run.  Some of them are run so badly that I do not blame people for saying that they do not want any more State enterprises, if they are to be run like such-and-such a State company.</P>
    <P>That is where this House failed on many occasions.  It has given too much scope to some of these companies, too much freedom.  To me the fact that the only strikes which are likely to take place in the near future are in State or semi-State organisations is a danger signal.  As far as I can gather, no other strike is looming up.  To my mind, that is due to the incompetent individuals who have been put in charge of the State concerns.  I believe that the proper choice of material, in the sense of manpower, has not been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I would refer to it only briefly in passing.  The public will require an answer to the fact that many of the people appointed to these jobs by the Government will have pensions ranging from £15 to £30 a week, while in some of those same companies, employees' pensions will range from 12/- to 15/- a week.  When we have a situation like that, there is something radically wrong and it is the Government's duty on behalf of the public to step in and remedy grievances of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me, the great test of a Government is the number of people who can get work in their own country as a result of Government planning.  I am sure the Minister for Finance, when <Col N="126" /> replying, will have his usual quota of figures on the achievements of this Government in the field of employment. I challenge him to deny or contradict the accuracy of the figures I now propose to give.  Is it or is it not a fact that between 1957 and 1962, a total of 20,633 new jobs were created in industry and that that is the maximum figure for new jobs created as a result of this Government's efforts in the industrial field?  Is that figure correct or was the reply given to me recently during questions wrong?  Is it correct to say that in the industrial field again in 1962 a total of 3,600 new jobs were provided?  If it is true that in this field only 3,600 new jobs were provided in that year, I can only say it is a long way from the number of jobs needed.</P>
    <P>I think it is accepted by all Parties in the House that if we are to reduce the figures of unemployment to a percentage normal in a society where full employment pertains&mdash;say, 2 to 3 per cent&mdash;and if we are, at the same time, to remedy the emigration problem, we need yearly 20,000 new jobs.  Have this Government shown any signs in theirs efforts up to date of providing 20,000 new jobs a year to solve the two problems I have mentioned?  I know we will be told that last year there were 10,000 more people at work than in 1961.  I want to make it quite clear that, to my mind, that figure does not disclose the true situation because that figure embraces the number employed in afforestation and the figures for employment in afforestation refer only to certain times of the year.  Employment in afforestation is not all the year round employment and I, therefore, do not accept that the employment figure for afforestation gives a true picture of the number in permanent employment in the country.</P>
    <P>I think it is a fair criticism to say that in a period of almost six years the Government provided fewer than 21,000 new jobs in spite of all the ballyhoo they have given us about industrialists coming in, and about all the grants made available to encourage the setting up of industries in the country.  The figure is worse than that. I should like the Minister to tell us <Col N="127" /> whether it is true or not that the numbers in employment in 1961 were 40,000 fewer than in 1956.  I am satisfied that is so, that we had 40,000 fewer people at work in 1961 than in 1956-57.  Where is all this nonsense going to end?  Do they think they will bluff the people forever by saying they are providing plenty of employment, that emigration is going down, when we know the situation is anything but as they try to suggest it is?</P>
    <P>There is no getting away from the fact that the numbers employed today are substantially fewer than in 1956-57. When will we get back even to that figure?  I know we will be told that the previous Government left everything in a mess.  I do not think that type of propaganda will hoodwink anybody inside or outside the House today when the Government have had the benefit of an unbroken period of office, a second round, in fact, since 1957.  It is fair political propaganda to say the previous Government were responsible if they were out of office for only two or three years.  I am not standing up for the previous Government but they have been out of office now during the past six years.  Nobody can blame the previous Government now.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that the Government must at this time stand or fall on what they have done during the past six years?  That figure of 20,000 odd jobs between 1957 and 1962 is a very poor return when you consider the promises that were made.  I do not have to remind the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach that they got into power on the basis of pledges to provide 100,000 new jobs.  I well recall the Taoiseach unfolding the blueprint he had ready, if he got back into office, for the provision of 100,000 new jobs by Fianna Fáil.  They are six years in and the total is only 20,000 new jobs given and an overall reduction in the number employed.</P>
    <P>So far, I have not given any agricultural figures but I think it is no harm now to refer to the fact that at the moment there are roughly 400,000 people engaged in agriculture&mdash;on the land, in fishing and afforestation. Reference was made during the <Col N="128" /> debate, I think, by Deputy McGilligan, to the Report on Small Farms issued by an inter-Departmental committee. Many Deputies failed to read the small print in that report in which that group of civil servants made it clear that, in their view, the number on the land would have to go down still further, that there were too many on the land.  On the basis that we have 400,000 people on the land, in afforestation and fishing, the reduction, according to this report, would approach one-third of the total.  That means that if we are to continue with this type of Government, we will lose another 120,000 people off the land.</P>
    <P>I know we will be told: &ldquo;Sure, this is happening all over the world&rdquo;.  We have daft Ministers coming in here telling us that is the situation in France, in Germany, in Belgium and in Holland.  I ask the House and the people to look at the density of population, the number of people per acre, in these other countries and to compare it with our under-populated countryside.  That is the first comparison I would ask the House to make.  I think it is a disgrace and a crime against the Irish people to say that more Irish men and women must leave the land in the next few years in order, if you like, to make farming a paying proposition.  It is being held out as something that is inevitable.</P>
    <P>I would say that the first fallacy there is that because it happens in Europe, it is necessary that it must happen here.  In those countries with which the comparison is made, there are five to seven times more people per square mile living on the land than here.  It is necessary to remove them.  However, even when they do go in those countries, they go into the cities and large towns and are absorbed in employment very often in industries processing the raw materials produced in the countryside.</P>
    <P>What is the position in rural Ireland?  If people leave the land there, they do not go into our cities and towns but are lost in every sense of the word to Ireland.  There is no point in telling me that it is inevitable in Europe and, because it is inevitable in Europe, it is inevitable in Ireland. <Col N="129" /> It is an outrage that our finest people of rural stock must tear up their roots, because civil servants and the Government say it is inevitable in Europe, and find their way to Britain.</P>
    <P>Suppose we accept it will happen and then ask the Government what they will do about it.  Have they any plans in mind?  According to the Minister for Lands, they have plans ready in the Land Commission which will enable the Government to enlarge the size of holdings made available to the small uneconomic holder.  Instead of getting 25 to 30 acres, as heretofore, under the new scheme the uneconomic holder will get 45 to 50 acres.</P>
    <P>It is ten years since I, in the course of cross-examination&mdash;against the wishes of the Ceann Comhairle&mdash; extracted from the then Taoiseach, who is now up in the Park, some views in this connection.  I had a motion before the House to increase the number of holdings in Ireland, in line with the direction given in the Constitution. I urged that, for the purpose, the Land Commission should be asked to create a large pool of land by buying up lands in the Midlands and elsewhere.  I was told by the then Taoiseach that there is not enough land in Ireland to meet the requirement I had outlined.  Now, ten years later, his Minister tells us it is intended to increase the size of standard holdings from 25 to 30 acres and to make it 50 acres.  If this Government could not get enough land ten years ago to create a number of economic holdings of 25 acres, where will they get the land now to create holdings of 50 acres?  They must know in their hearts that our small farmers will not swallow that type of propaganda.</P>
    <P>This Government have now shown their true beliefs in and their true approach to the rural problem in the shape of repressive legislation which will enable the Government to take Paddy Murphy's five acres or seven acres or ten acres if he must leave the West of Ireland for economic reasons to work in Britain.  If he spends a day over five years in Britain where he is trying to get a bit of money together to enable him to come home and to make a living at home, <Col N="130" /> the Land Commission will now be empowered to take over his little bit of land.  Therefore, if more land will be available it will be at the expense of the small farmer who must emigrate from the West of Ireland, for economic reasons.</P>
    <P>There is not the slightest intention of touching the rancher, the retired colonel or the speculator who is buying up land in the Midlands and in the choice parts of the country.  He does not buy land in ten-acre lots but in lots of hundreds of acres.  If you do things in a big way in this country you will get away with them.  We have only to look at what happens in our courts.  The bigger you are the better your chance in all walks of life. If you want to do something crooked, do it in a big way.  If you want to get away with land purchase, buy the biggest farm of land.  It does not matter what your nationality: you will get the same rights here as a native.</P>
    <P>I am looked upon as an odd crank when I suggest that before we look to the comfort of the foreigner in the matter of land we must look to the rights of the Irish people.  I do not speak in any sense as a person who dislikes foreigners.  In my own way, and at my own expense, I may do a lot more travelling outside this country than a lot of people here.  I have nothing in the world against foreigners but I do not think they have a right over Irish people to Irish land.  I do not think they are entitled to come in here and pay a bloated price for land, thus shoving up the cost on the Irish people.</P>
    <P>As recently as a week ago, the Minister for lands stated in this House that the Government had made more money available this year for the relief of congestion by the purchase of land than ever before.  What is the position? An acre of land today costs almost three times what it cost ten years ago. If the allocation in the Estimate for the Department of Lands is bigger to-day than that of ten years ago it does not mean that more land is being made available by the State for the relief of congestion.  It simply means that more money is being expended on the purchase of land because the foreigner <Col N="131" /> with spare money is pushing up the price of land.</P>
    <P>We are told the problem is not significant.  I am not interested in what Government spokesmen say.  It is very significant that the price of land in Germany is three times that of land in Ireland.  If foreigners bought only 10,000 acres in Ireland they, nevertheless, would shove up the price of land here on those who need and deserve it. It is not the actual amount of land that is bought as much as the value put upon it.  Therefore, if land is acquired by the Land Commission, it is acquired at that new value which in turn falls upon the Irish tenant who is paying an inflated price.</P>
    <P>The Government sent emissaries to various countries and they went on the wireless in France and Germany, and so on, and said to their audience, in effect: &ldquo;You will get the same rights in Ireland as the Irish people.&rdquo; The result is that all sorts of chancers have come into this State on the Céad Míle Fáilte of Ministers and their henchmen every time they leave this country.</P>
    <P>As a result of a report on the conditions of the small farmer, another Government plan has been in course of preparation in the past six months to improve conditions.  What have we now?  In each county in Ireland, a planning committee is set up.  It is composed of civil servants, members of the Land Commission, members of the Office of Public Works, members of the agricultural committee, and so on.  All sorts of people are gathered together to advise on what developments can be brought about, through the State, in County Roscommon, Galway, and every other county in Ireland.  This is the latest gag this Government have thought up.  The public, then, are supposed to come along and say to this bunch of civil servants, in effect: &ldquo;What do you think of such and such a proposal?  We have a new proposal here.  Will you think it over?&rdquo;  The reply is, in effect: &ldquo;Yes, we shall think it over and submit it to our headquarters&rdquo;&mdash;and when it goes to headquarters that is the end of it.</P>
    <P>However, it is just another device to kill time&mdash;to postpone the day when <Col N="132" /> the Government must do something. This is the latest device in 1963.  If Deputies do not believe me, I would remind them of the last device used by this Government.  It was in 1959. The Taoiseach asked every local authority in Ireland to submit suggestions for State investment in important public projects of economic merit. Every county council in Ireland sat down and made out a list of what they calculated would be suitable for their areas.  It is all coming back to the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary now.  We can see his mind ticking over.  We all got together and discussed what would be a project of economic merit.</P>
    <P>All those suggestions were sent on to headquarters and they were all examined but, at this stage, all I can do is give a brief idea of what happened in my county.  The Roscommon County Council submitted a large number of projects.  One was to the effect that the sugar company be directed to establish an industry for the growing and processing of fruit and vegetables in the west of Ireland as a positive step towards stemming the haemorrhage of emigration that was draining away people from the country.  That motion of mine was accepted by the council and sent on to the Government, to the Office of the Taoiseach. The Office of the Taoiseach referred it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and they sat on it for quite a while before they wrote back to the Roscommon County Council.  This is what the Government had to say in 1959 about the processing of fruit and vegetables, the Government who today are taking credit for setting up the deep-freeze processing of fruit and vegetables which the sugar company has initiated:</P>
    <P>Your Council have proposed the establishment of several industries, mainly for the processing of agricultural produce.  With regard to these, I am to say that the establishment of industry in any locality is primarily a matter for private enterprise and the initiative of the local people.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister would like to obtain a copy of this letter, it is one <Col N="133" /> sent by the Department of Finance to the Secretary of the Roscommon County Council and dated 2nd November, 1960.  This is another sentence in this letter which I want to bring to the notice of the House:</P>
    <P>Your Council have suggested the establishment of a State company on the lines of the Irish Sugar Company to develop fruit and vegetable growing and to process and market the produce.  The Government are keenly interested in efforts to coordinate and stimulate progress in regard to fruit and vegetable processing and the Economic Development Branch is actively engaged in an examination of the possibilities of increasing exports of processed fruits and vegetables.  The Branch's examination to date, however, indicates that the problem at the moment is one of utilising surplus capacity rather than of establishing new concerns.</P>
    <P>This wonderful market for fruit and vegetables, both fresh and processed, was wide open to us to move into in 1959, a market worth £1,000 million, and all the Government had to say was that the problem at the moment was one of utilising surplus capacity rather than establishing new concerns.  We are not supplying any more than one per cent of the British market in fruit and vegetables and it is the one market in Britain in which we have favoured treatment.  There is no tariff; there is no question of our fruit and vegetables being treated like our sugar exports about which Deputy Corry is so rightly worried.</P>
    <P>We have the same right to sell fruit and vegetables, processed or unprocessed, in the British market as the British farmer has.  He has no subsidy to help him.  What have we done about it?  I will not labour the matter now.  It is something I will deal with on the particular Estimate but I mention it in passing to show up this Government and their failure to move along the right line.  I think the sugar company is doing a good day's work in that field but I say this to the Government and to the members of the Government from the west of Ireland, <Col N="134" /> that all they have shown to that part of the country is lip sympathy.  If they were serious in what they say, the sugar company would be directed, as a State company, to move into the west of Ireland and to extend and to expand there.  But not a word has been spoken.</P>
    <P>For that, I can only blame the silent and well-disciplined Deputies on the back benches of the Fianna Fáil Party who come into the House on tiptoes and who go into the Party room with their heads bowed.  They are still back at the stage of genuflecting to the lord of the manor and they treat their Taoiseach in the same way as the landlords of days gone by.  These representatives from the west of Ireland are decent men as individuals but they should be taken out and politically kicked across the Shannon. I say that about every one of them. Nothing has come to the west of Ireland and it is their fault.</P>

      <P>I will now go back to the Parliamentary Secretary who spoke about afforestation and tried to suggest that the figures for that Department are something of which the Government should be proud.  In a reply to a recent Parliamentary Question, it was shown that the numbers employed in Cork and Kerry were almost double those for the whole province of Connacht.  Where is Connacht getting its share?  In Wicklow and Wexford, the numbers employed exceeded the entire number employed in the province of Connacht. <Col N="135" /> Where is the West getting its share there?  We were told that the West would get special treatment but the special treatment for the West is a quick and speedy exit to Britain.</P>
      <P>On afforestation, what are the facts? I have not said this before in this House but the reason I first came into public life was afforestation.  The first time I was associated with public life was because of afforestation.  I had a personal interest in the growing of timber and like the innocent I was, I came into politics.  Fianna Fáil were in office at that time and I could not believe that any Government could be so neglectful of expanding what could be a major concern for future generations. I had on my mind the negligence of the Government on afforestation and I listened to excuses in this House and outside it from Minister after Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party who were responsible for afforestation.</P>
      <P>What did they tell me?  That they could not get net wire and that rabbits would eat the afforestation.  Imagine that as one of the excuses for holding up a big afforestation programme for years.  The Party with which I was associated in 1948 failed in many things but on that issue they changed the outlook of the people in this House and now we have 25,000 acres planted each year.  I cannot but bring home to the Fianna Fáil Party that they insisted time after time in this House that we could not reach a figure of 25,000 acres a year but they are boasting about it now because they were driven into it and forced to do it.  I often was tempted to believe that the reason we had not more afforestation was that the timber was there in the heads already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned a while ago the situation about emigration.  What is happening over in England?  There was a display of Irish goods in the West End over the past ten days to help our export drive and I think Córas Tráchtála, Bord Fáilte and some other people joined in this display.  What I want to know is why that was run in competition with, or at the same time as, the Ideal Homes Exhibition in <Col N="136" /> London.  The Ideal Homes Exhibition, as many here know, is a tremendous affair.  There were 25 nations exhibiting in it and over 500 leading firms from all parts of the world had goods on display.  There were such things as agricultural products in the finished article like sausages, meat and processed foods from New Zealand and all over the world.  Firms' representatives and products were to be seen at this exhibition, but there was no Irish stand there and there was no Irish firm except one from the Six Counties. There was no Irish Government stand, no Bord Fáilte stand, no stand by private enterprise from this part of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why?  Why can we afford to spend money on embassies, luxurious ones?  Why can we afford to spend plenty of money on the people who run them when we cannot afford to spend money on an exhibition of that nature?  I have referred to this often before.  Instead of Bord Fáilte being at one end of the street, Córas Tráchtála at the other and Aer Lingus at another spot, all three should be combined in one allIrish house.  If it cost a million pounds, it would be money well spent in London if all the Irish groups were in it, Bord Fáilte, a manufacturing and industrial display centre, Aer Lingus and the tourist people.  We should have one there like the Finnish house and not have things as we have at the moment when Irish goods are exhibited, not in the window, but down a corridor at the back where you would not go unless you were brought by the hand and stuffed with Irish whiskey or Irish stout as a form of generosity.</P>
    <P>The only place where I see Irish whiskey used outside the State, the only Irish whiskey I see which is got rid of, is in the form of presents.  We have reached the fantastic stage where as much Scotch whisky is drunk in Ireland as Irish whiskey is drunk abroad.  If I had time to check on the figures, I think I could prove that more Scotch whisky is drunk in Ireland than Irish whiskey is consumed outside the State.  What does that lead to?  What conclusion can be reached except the jocose one?  That <Col N="137" /> in the past ten years Irish distillers have been proved wrong in their approach to their marketing problems. They are not producing the type of whiskey suitable for the palate to-day. I personally like a pot-still whiskey, but that does not mean that the people I meet like it or that they should like it.  As I saw to my sorrow, the majority prefer a light type of whiskey and if they do, they should get it.  The customer should count.  The result of this thick-headed lack of foresight on the part of the distillers here has left Ireland in the position that while the sales of Scotch whisky in America last year reached £47 million, sales of Irish whiskey were only in the region of £175,000, not even one per cent.</P>
    <P>Why is that?  I am told, and I have no reason to doubt it, that there are 20 million people of Irish descent in America who are mad to help Ireland. There is no shortage of them.  There were 20 million Irish people over there on St. Patrick's Day.  Would it not be possible for some Government, if not this incompetent bunch who are in now, to take the necessary action to set up a distillery, a national one, to produce the right type of whiskey for America and for the foreign market? Why has it not been done up to this? We are told that private enterprise should not be interfered with.  I do not want anybody to take out the distillers and shoot them.  They should be left as they are.  Nobody should acquire their distilling premises or their rights but the State should do the same as was done in the case of the sugar company and set up an Irish distillery. They should bring in foreign chemists and foreign blenders and as the Government know, they will produce the proper blend which can be sold abroad.</P>
    <P>The Government know as well as I do that that proposition was put to them a number of years ago by a very prominent American distributor who suggested to the Government that instead of sending out individuals to sell a few bottles of whiskey, they should use his distributing agency in America where it would be sold on a percentage basis because he had the outlets and the stores.  But we said no and insisted on sending Mr. X and <Col N="138" /> Mr. Y and Mr. Z to America to sell Irish whiskey.</P>
    <P>The Government paid out £80,000 a year out of State funds, out of the public pocket, to help the distillers to sell their produce in America&mdash;the group who said: &ldquo;We want no State aid; we are private enterprise&rdquo;.  When it came to the point, however, the Government said: &ldquo;For every £ you spend in America to sell your product, we will put up a £ with it&rdquo;.  The distillers put up £80,000 and the Government put up £80,000 so £160,000 was spent on publicity in America, as big an amount as we made by selling whiskey there.  That is the situation in Ireland because we will not interfere with private enterprise or take the necessary steps to expand on lines on which expansion is vital to the future security of the country.</P>
    <P>I could not paint a picture for Deputies of the importance of the sale of £10 million worth of a liquor like Irish whiskey or an Irish product abroad or what it would mean to the Irish people.  Even the £45 million or £50 million cattle trade would be less important than the £10 million worth of whiskey because of the employment content in the distilling trade and in all the other industries that arise from and flow from this industry.  It would give vast employment.  There would be no comparison as far as employment content is concerned between the production of whiskey and the production of cattle, which means in Ireland today the farmer getting up in the morning and having a good yawn, counting the cattle, getting CIE to bring them to the mart and getting rid of them.  It is admitted by every economist worth his salt that the employment content in the cattle industry is negligible in comparison with that of other agricultural lines.  Why do we not encourage such lines?  We have the finest land in the world for the growing of barley.  Would anybody think that a Government like this deserve support or credit when they allow such neglect of Irish industries that could be extended?</P>
    <P>I may sound very critical but I do not stand up here to praise; I believe <Col N="139" /> in hitting where it is necessary.  In the past few months, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have been telling the House and the country of the grants that are available for the modernisation of plants, factories and industrial concerns, and telling us of the wonderful spirit that is apparent in our industrialists all over the country, that they are getting ready for the Common Market.  Let us all recall that the Taoiseach's forecast was: &ldquo;We are going to be in the Common Market as full members by January, 1964.&rdquo;  We were to be ready for the full blast of competition; our industries would be ready; the technical assistance grants were being availed of and our industrialists were facing up to the problems of modernisation and redundancy.</P>
    <P>Legislation was passed here recently which offered substantial grants and attractions in the financial sense to all these so-called industrialists.  They were guaranteed against loss.  They were guaranteed freedom from taxation over a period of years for their modernisation campaign.  What is the true position?  Will the House accept a statement made by a civil servant on this?  Civil servants, especially the higher civil servants, are non-political in their approach and are prepared to say what they believe to be true, to give the facts.  Let me repeat that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have time and time again in this House pointed out that they were satisfied with the approach of industrialists to the accepting of the technical assistance grants which were being made available. I want to quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 8th of this month a report of a statement made in Greystones by Mr. Murray, the Assistant-Secretary, Department of Finance, to the Irish Management Institute:</P>
    <P>Very few firms had taken advantage of schemes of technical assistance grants.</P>
    <P>That statement was made in spite of the ballyhoo made here in this House by the Taoiseach and the Minister for <Col N="140" /> Industry and Commerce that these gentlemen, these industrialists, were ready for the Common Market.  Mr. Murray went on to say:</P>
    <P>Even more depressing, many firms were not aware of the schemes' existence.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, said in the past few months that Ireland was in a backwater, if the pets of the Government were not even aware of the grants that were being made available from the people's money to help them to modernise?</P>
    <P>However, in regard to a number of those firms who have been given grants for modernisation and automation we do know what is happening. In many instances those technical assistance grants have meant that large numbers of the workers are being displaced and that machines are being installed which are now doing the work that was done by manual labour or by human skill.  That is the march of progress.  I do not dispute the fact that automation and modernisation are necessary and must be pursued but I do believe that side by side with that modernisation the worker who is displaced must be given alternative employment.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for any Government to hand out £50,000 to any company in this State to expand moryah its export potential and in the course of expanding it to reduce the number of its workers unless a guarantee is given that these workers are to be absorbed in some other industry.  The proof of how little this Government like the worker or how little regard they have for him lies in the fact that this House passed legislation very recently giving technical assistance grants and all sorts of cakes and incentives to the industrialist to modernise and get ready for the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Did they bring in any legislation to see that the displaced worker would be given the benefit of retraining grants, that he would not lose his job or that if he did lose his job he would get compensation while he would be retrained for another job?  Not at all.  The policy pursued is automate <Col N="141" /> and emigrate.  There has not been the slightest attempt on the part of the Government to replace in alternative employment a single individual who has been displaced as a result of the modernisation campaign.</P>
    <P>That is the industrial field.  What has been happening in the agricultural line?  When a boy or a girl becomes surplus on the land is there any retraining grant for him or for her? What happens?  They have to take the boat for Britain or America.  I have yet to hear a trade union insisting that a worker in rural Ireland or a farm labourer was entitled to retraining or to redundancy payment.  It is only those in a strong position who are able to negotiate and they negotiate only for themselves.  It is every man for himself in this matter.  The Government should look after the interests of all the citizens, help the weaker sections of our community, help those who are being displaced.  It is poor consolation to our people in rural Ireland to be told by the economists and by Ministers here: &ldquo;It is inevitable that you leave the land.  It is the inevitable line all over Europe and because the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, says so, it must be the same in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Government are facing a very tough period.  Our exports are going down.  I will say this for the Minister for Finance in all sincerity&mdash;although I do not think he has great regard for what I have to say&mdash;that he is the ablest man in this Cabinet.  I believe that.  He has got his Party out of more awkward holes than any other Minister they ever had.  He is not appreciated in his own Party.</P>
    <P>As far as exports are concerned, the so-called drive, the dynamic, that was there 18 months ago has gone and the figures are going down.  We will be given all sorts of explanations.  Why should that happen if the Government are right in stating that there has been a dynamic approach since they came into office?  Why should there be a slowing down?  Why should we reach the stage this year, for instance, that in relation to the EEC countries, the group we were breaking our necks to join, our imports in the past 12 months <Col N="142" /> have increased by over £8 million while our exports to the Common Market countries have decreased by almost £¾ million?  That represents a very serious situation.  We are importing at the moment £43 million worth from the Common Market countries and exporting to them roughly only £10.7 million worth.  The adverse balance there has gone up by over £8.5 million in the past 12 months and we are not in the EEC.  How do we propose to reverse that situation if we become full members of EEC, as the Government have suggested we should?</P>
    <P>How do we propose to transport our goods to the continent of Europe? What shipping have we?  Where is it? Is it available?  Is it not a fact that as far as shipping is concerned, we are completely dependent on groups outside this country which could tie a noose around our exports if they so desired?  Anybody who has read the papers in the past couple of days knows what has happened in regard to certain Irish exports, that the West Indies shipping group have decided that they will not allow certain shipping lines to come into Dublin.  Have we any answer to that?  Have we ever decided to go into the shipping business in a proper way and carry our own produce?</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have mentioned that the ships of Irish Shipping Limited are on charter service.  The simplest way to explain what they are doing is to say that they are out on hire, on hackney service.  It is only a group of nitwits that would allow the Irish Shipping fleet, which should be carrying Irish goods all the time, to be on hire service for the benefit of every other country, carrying goods between New Zealand, Canada and Australia, while the rates for transportation of goods from here to Britain are pushed up by the carrying companies and we cannot do a thing about it.</P>
    <P>Why have this great Government, who talk about their patriotism, not sought to establish a shipping line between this country and Britain over the past 30 years?  Is it not a fact that when the establishment of Irish Shipping Limited was first mooted, the <Col N="143" /> present Taoiseach only laughed at the idea; and that he had said six months before Irish Shipping Limited was established that there was no need for an Irish shipping service and was forced through circumstances six months afterwards to change his tune? If Deputies wish, I will produce the quotations from the Taoiseach's remarks in that regard.  Irish Shipping Limited is in existence but is used on the wrong lines.</P>
    <P>At the present time, a great deal of lip service is being paid to the idea that we could export Irish processed farm products to countries in the Middle East and to the newly emergent African states.  What are we doing about it?  There are Deputies talking about the price of milk.  There is a market for processed milk in many forms in these newly emergent countries.  Have we made any attempt to capture that market?  I have listened to NFA and Creamery Milk Suppliers' delegations talking nonsense on this issue.  Their argument is that these countries have not got the money to pay for these commodities.  Why cannot we make a barter arrangement with these countries?  We import fruit, cocoa and other products from these countries.  Why cannot we exchange Irish milk products for these goods? Why do we have to look for pounds, shillings and pence?  If the farmer gets his money for the milk he sends to the creamery, it makes no difference to him if there is a barter transaction carried out by the Government in relation to the manufactured products.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why such an arrangement is not negotiated by the Government if they are serious about getting a market for Irish farm products. The solution to that problem is to increase output and to export rather than to talk about increasing the price of milk in existing circumstances, shoving up the price of the finished product to the Irish consumer and, on top of that, forcing him to pay a subsidy on the sale of the commodity in Britain.</P>
    <P>This Government will not face reality.  They have no policy.  They live <Col N="144" /> from day to day, from week to week. They say they are pragmatic in their approach.  If one is pragmatic in one's approach to major issues, such an approach should not be allowed when it comes to running the State.  The people need a guiding light, some political philosophy and its ruthless pursuit for the benefit of the community. Those on both sides of this House who have worshipped at the shrine of private enterprise, which means that the strong get stronger and the weak go to the wall, who have believed in that philosophy and that free-for-all, have now brought this country to the stage that we will be accepted into no camp, that we are not welcome in Europe and that as far as Britain is concerned, we are going over asking a Tory Government if they can give us any hope or encouragement.</P>
    <P>We are not a viable outfit.  We are an undeveloped country, whether we like it or not.  It would be a great day for this country if we accepted the fact that we are undeveloped and started from scratch.  We have undoubtedly a first-class roads system, a communications system, a reasonable housing situation, but we have to accept at the same time that we are undeveloped.  We must come down from the clouds and cease to ape the imperialist standards of countries that were glorious in former days, moryah. We have to spend on the right lines the money made available by the Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>The first thing we will have to have is a series of elections.  I do not like any more than any other Deputy the idea of having to fight an election&mdash;I have not big moneybags behind me&mdash; but the discomfort and inconvenience of fighting an election are as nothing in comparison with the interests of the community.  If we say that the public are mature in their thinking, we should give the public a chance to prove their maturity.  I believe there is only one way to get that shown, that is, by a general election, as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The attitude of these two major Parties who were born out of misfortune, born out of tragedy, who grew <Col N="145" /> up and created this unnatural division through tragedy and misfortune, must be ended before there can be a healthy approach to Irish politics.  There must be a healthy approach to the left and to the right.  What we have here are two rights and, in this case, two rights make a wrong.  If those two Parties are not prepared to sink the personal bitterness between them now, let the public do it.  I challenge those major Parties to produce for the public one major issue in respect of which they differ in any degree whatever on the manner in which it could be solved.</P>
    <P>To my mind, we have here a big machine which has been creaking in its running for the past 30 years.  All we have had is a different set of drivers of this antiquated creaking machine.  We have had Fianna Fáil tinkering with the machine, and when they are driving it, it goes anywhere it likes.  It is no solution to have their twin brothers, Fine Gael, because when they are driving, it is a group-driven machine.  That machine will have to be scrapped before it is too late and the Irish people should be given that opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy McQuillan on his very able speech, but I disagree with him when he brackets the Government Party with the major Opposition Party.  I fully appreciate that as a young man in politics, it would be impertinent of me to go back over the history of this State.  My view is that it should be let lie.  I feel that on this occasion I should point out that the difference between the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party is that when the Fine Gael Party were preaching the importance of the British market, we were termed West Britons, pro-British, and everything else that stood for.  At the same time, the Fianna Fáil Party were parading up and down the country using the tricolour at election times, when no other Party had the right to it.  They were termed the Republican Party, and they were flag waving, drum beating, bluffing and gulling the most gullible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we find now?  We find that the Taoiseach of the Government <Col N="146" /> Party is now in Britain on his knees to the British Government trying to salvage something after the breakdown of the EEC discussions.  If there is a comparison between the two Parties, is it that the Fine Gael Party have changed their policy, or is it that the Fianna Fáil Party have changed their policy?  I feel that it is very difficult, especially for a young Deputy, to get up in this House to criticise certain Bill when those Bills contain the old ideas of the Cumann na nGaedheal and Fine Gael Governments.</P>
    <P>Sometimes certain newspaper reporters refer to the fact that the Fine Gael Party are not offering strong enough opposition to the Fianna Fáil Government.  That may be so.  I feel that one major reason for that is the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government have come around to the way of thinking that has been preached since the foundation of the State by the Party to which I belong.  I heard Deputy Brennan from Donegal criticising the Fine Gael approach to this debate. He said we were offering no constructive criticism whatever.  Is he disappointed? Does he want us to tell the Government how to run the country so that he can take a leaf out of the Fine Gael Book again?  When he criticises the Fine Gael Party and praises the Labour Party, he is trying to play a second trick on the Labour Party with an eye to the oncoming general election.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this country has reached political maturity.  That seems to be a Fianna Fáil phrase up and down the country, and especially on the part of some of my colleagues in the Donegal County Council.  As a young man in Irish politics, I want to ask one question.  I appreciate the seriousness of the question.  I should like to ask: if we have reached political maturity, why have not the Government a closer co-operation with the Stormont Government which by them is often termed &ldquo;puppet&rdquo;?  I have very little respect for certain things that happen in the Six Counties but, as Christians who believe that each man is entitled to his own opinion, I feel that the hour of truth has arrived <Col N="147" /> when we must politically appreciate that the right of the Protestant boy born in Belfast to Unionist views, must be appreciated by the Catholic boy born in Dublin with a national outlook. If we cannot agree on certain things, at least we could agree to differ, and between the Unionist boy in Belfast and the nationalist boy in the Republic, they might make this country better than it is to-day.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday, I read in the paper that Deputy Noel Lemass is expounding certain theories about this country in the USA.  He claims that this is a land of tax-free opportunity.  Some time ago, I read in the <i>Daily Mail</i> that the Taoiseach described this country as a land of tax-free opportunity. He also described it as &ldquo;behind the green curtain&rdquo;.  I wonder do the ratepayers, and especially the ratepayers in Donegal, think it is?  I wonder, when the rate collector calls to the farmyard in the Lagan Valley or the Finn Valley looking for his yearly demands, do the ratepayers really think this is a land of tax-free opportunity?  In Donegal, the county manager is looking for an increase of 9/6 in the £.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed miserably, and I think if they were an honest Government and wanted to put the facts before the people they should say: &ldquo;Fair enough, we are putting the facts before the people.  We want to know what the country thinks about them&rdquo;, and leave it to the people to decide.  They should put the facts fairly and squarely before the people, but I would be very suspicious that possibly when all the chips were down and the die was cast, the Cabinet, with all their years of experience, would not again try to gull the most gullible.</P>
    <P>Numerous speakers on the Opposition benches have said that the Government are in power by virtue of one fact and one fact only, that is: &ldquo;100,000 new jobs; get your husbands back to work.&rdquo;  We find that after six years, there are 20,000 new jobs, but that something like 59,000 have emigrated during any one year in that period.  In my constituency, that <Col N="148" /> would represent the disappearance of a village such as Ramelton, Moville or Carndonagh every week or the disappearance of a village like Rathmullen, Kilmacrennan, Creeslough or Malin town every fortnight.  These are the facts and I put them in that context so the people may have them in a simple form.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about agriculture. Last year, we had different Fianna Fáil speakers boasting about the agricultural grant.  Might I remind the Minister that in Donegal on a valuation of £55, a farmer pays £62 15s. if he employs two workmen, whereas in Meath for the same valuation, a farmer employing two workmen, pays £38 11s.  That is not fair. Deputy Browne from North Mayo asked that there should be equalisation of rates.  When the Land Commission divide farms in Donegal, it is done purely on a political basis.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir.  We have questions across the House about the price of oats.  We have the Minister for Agriculture telling us he has no control over the price of oats.  This is 1963.  In a by-election in North-East Donegal in 1948, when my leader, Deputy Dillon, was Minister for Agriculture, the price of oats was exactly the same as today.  That by-election was won and lost on the price of oats.  We had Fianna Fáil speakers talking about the price of oats and saying the farmers were being robbed. Does any farmer in Donegal think of <Col N="149" /> what the cost of living was in 1948 as compared with today?  We have certain happenings at local government level with which I completely disagree.  We had increases to rate collectors in Donegal.</P>

I might surprise Fianna Fáil by saying I give them credit for the greatest piece of social welfare legislation ever introduced in this Parliament, namely, free beef.  Free beef and <Col N="150" /> the dole have kept them in office. False promises have kept them in office.  I feel the time has come when they should consider giving the electorate a chance of deciding if they have achieved in the past six years what they promised.</P>
      <P>In relation to CIE, I feel a better and cheaper transport system could be achieved if half the work now given to CIE were handed over to private enterprise.  If the Minister would consider allowing private enterprise to draw ground limestone, the farmers would have a cheaper system of transport, and, therefore, more money to purchase ground limestone.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands seems to be very interested in this debate.  I would ask him to pay particular attention to the fisheries on Lough Foyle.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister for Finance to have another look at the question I asked him some weeks ago about the possibility of abolishing passbooks for crossing the Border.  I would ask him to appreciate that in Donegal, we must, of necessity, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle indeed well knows, pass through the Border <Col N="151" /> twice to come to our capital city.  The British authorities close the customs posts at nine o'clock and a vehicle can pass through freely after that hour. However, any person leaving the capital city, wishing to return to Donegal, must, if he has to pass through the customs post after midnight, take out a &ldquo;request&rdquo; costing him 2/-; that applies to both going in and coming out.  Fianna Fáil have always said that we do not want the Border.  Here is one way in which they can prove their assertion: Discontinue the present system of book stamping, which is obsolete, antiquated, out of date.  I have spoken to different customs officers about it and they feel the time is now opportune to discontinue this system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is now in its third week and pretty well all that can be said has been said.  The present bill is, indeed, a formidable one in the region of £165 million.  The question we have to ask ourselves is where will we get the money and who will benefit by it.  Looking through the Estimates we see where the money will go.  As the Taoiseach has said, £150 million of it goes to service four particular items.  The largest item, some £53½ million, is Civil Service salaries.  There is an increase there of £2 million on last year's figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> When talking of the Civil Service, we are talking of Government agencies at our disposal in the various Departments. Now, there have been no positive suggestions from any speaker here as to how or where we could reduce this amount.  We know that this matter has engaged the attention of the Minister for many years.  All of us who visit Government Departments can say that our civil servants are doing a good job.  They are not wasting time.  They are not sleeping in their offices, or hibernating in nooks or crannies.  Accepting that we have an efficient Civil Service, and accepting that its members are not overpaid, we are left with no alternative but to meet the bill when it is presented to this House.  No amount of wishful thinking or talking will reduce the amount by one iota.</P>
    <P>Accepting the principles I have outlined, we see that Civil Service salaries take pretty well one-third of the whole bill.  In every debate, and during Question Time, in this House, we hear constant demands for more and more information, more and more specialised investigation, more and more specialised examination.  All these call for the appointment of yet more civil servants, adding still further to the bill.  If, as a Government, we want to be well-informed, then there is no use harping on the cost of paying for the information.  We want it.  We must pay for it.</P>
    <P>The next largest item comes under Social Welfare.  This year, the sum approximates to £40 million, representing an increase of £3,250,000 on last year.  Now £40 million is 25 per cent of the total bill this year.  I have not heard from any part of this House any suggestion as to how this bill could be reduced.  I have heard criticisms that many of our social services are not good enough.  There is a general demand for expanded social services.  One cannot expand these services on the one hand and, at the same time, reduce the cost of the services.  I believe in expanded social services.  I believe the country can pay for them.  The policy of this Government right through from their accession to office in 1932 has been one of continually strengthening and improving <Col N="153" /> our social services.  I hope that will ever be the pattern, taking from those who have something and giving to those who have little or nothing.</P>
    <P>When I was young, beggars were prevalent on the highways and every town of any size had a poorhouse usually filled.  That was so up to 1935 but gradually that type of person disappeared and no longer do we see the man with the bag of bottles on his back.  All these social services merit commendation of the Government for introducing them.  There is a long list of them and the bill continues to expand.  I hope that trend will continue so that more can be given to the weaker sections, those not able to, or who lack initiative or who, for some reason, cannot obtain a reasonable measure of sustenance, which, God knows, is all we are giving them.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Estimates, we see the next heaviest item is for agriculture and agricultural aids, £36,600,000, an increase this year of £8.1 million. Opposition members say we are doing nothing for agriculture but if you take this amount of money, I do not know any other industry getting such tremendous aid and support as our main industry, agriculture.  I am pleased to record that it is showing improvement this year.  Productivity on the land is increasing, with increases in livestock, cattle, sheep and pigs. Despite the flippant and cynical remarks to the contrary, there is abroad a feeling that it is time we were up and doing, that opportunity is here, that help and support are available and that we should use it.  Further to encourage that awareness and alertness, the Government propose this year an increase of £8.1 million.</P>
    <P>Planning to increase sales of dairy produce, pigs and bacon is being fairly well done.  There will always, of course, be room for improvement but we are going on the right lines.  The pre-packaging of butter, for instance, before it leaves the country, presenting our products in a marketable manner and well-packed and clearly distinguished by our marks will ultimately achieve the desired result.  It might be said that the marketing of bacon and rashers in prepacked form could <Col N="154" /> be considered.  It is done in other countries: it could be done here.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable increase in the use of fertilisers.  Use of limestone is up by about 50 per cent. This is also evidence that our farmers are at last beginning to move, that awareness and alertness exist.  In Sligo alone, one finds the NFA, the Irish Countrywomen, Macra na Feirme and Macra na Tuaithe all meeting jointly, discussing and deciding what they can do for their district to get things moving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  Progress has been, and is being, made in education but in parts the system needs an overhaul.  I have asked myself many times: is the present system suited both to industry and to agriculture? Is there still too much accent on the academic side, and are we still persisting too long in pursuit of the professions of solicitor, doctor and teacher?  Are we training our boys and girls to take up jobs in industry?  More needs to be done on these lines.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the general overall economic picture, I think we can say progress has been made during the past year&mdash;perhaps not as bright or as wonderful as we would hope, but progress has been recorded.  The economy is in a sound position and we are going ahead with confidence in the future.</P>
      <P>I have listened to criticisms of Government policy but it was not real criticism.  It was rather a lot of loose talk.  We have heard comparisons between 1948 and 1963, between 1953 and 1956, and between 1954 and 1955.  We have heard arguments about what went wrong with housing in 1956 and why Fianna Fáil would not build more houses in 1961, 1962 and 1963. There has been a complete lack of sincerity in all the speeches made here. One hears Fine Gael trying to justify running away from their responsibilities, as they did, and trying to whitewash the abysmal picture, but one has only to read the reports of any recognised economist dealing with those vital years, and the results in the years following, to realise the type of government and leadership given during those years.  Whatever the external elements may have been, a chance was taken and it did not come off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said that we were gambling. In so far as this Party is concerned, <Col N="156" /> it never took a gamble; it backed its promises by planned action to get out of the mess created by the inter-Party Government in 1954, 1955 and 1956, and indeed in 1957, because its aftermath was not curbed until about mid-1958. Our gross national product, instead of advancing, was retarded by some ten per cent to 12 per cent, during that period.  When one realises that our gross national product was only as far forward in 1958 as in 1953, there could be no better proof of the failure of that inter-Party Government.</P>

      <P>The national programme proceeds apace, ever expanding and ever developing.  The industrial field and the agricultural field grow together.  In an article written in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> by Alfred Kuehn, in a survey of industry, the writer comes up with a rather important factor.  He writes:</P>
      <P>The dependence of agriculture on Irish industry is rather marked. More than twice the amount sold by farmers to export traders is at present sold to industry for further processing.  When industrial exports declined or stagnated from 1954 to 1956 the sale of agricultural products to industry also declined. When the former rose, as they did continuously from 1957, sales of agricultural products to industry also increased.</P>
      <P>Those are not my words, but this inter-dependence of one industry on another is clearly demonstrated there. Anybody who studies this pattern of transportable goods as against agriculture will see that the same pattern emerges.  A good manufacturing industry always brings agriculture with it.  Whether it is because of a new breakthrough of information, a better form of planning or the creation of a new impetus, I am not qualified to say, but people who observe these things report them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said I would not delay the House and I do not propose to do so.  All I wish to add is that this Government, by their efforts since 1957, have arrested the economic decline, and believe me, the economy was slithering down at an extraordinary rate at that time.  They have continued during the years to build up the nation <Col N="158" /> and now again we begin to see the economy expanding.  That economic expansion is continuing and the fact that our annual rate of progress is as high as six per cent is indicative of the success of the Government's expansion programme.</P>

      <P>There is wholesale emigration from the constituency.  Day after day, homes are being closed.  I recently travelled to Dublin by a train and a fellow traveller was a young man, a Fianna Fáil supporter.  I told him about the serious emigration situation and his reply was that the Irish people were of a wandering disposition anyway.  I conceded that may be but pointed out that when a young man gets married and settles down, it is a remarkable thing to find him putting a lock on the door and moving out, bag and baggage, to England.  He had to admit that was the truth.</P>
      <P>We have this happening day after day in my constituency.  Every day, the locks are being put on the doors, the lights are going out in homes that were once happy.  My advice is that the sooner the Government step in and give more attention to the small farmers up there, the better.  Every such farm is a unit in the economy of the west of Ireland, and a very useful unit it could be, too.  But the smallholders on these farms have to go because under present conditions it is impossible for them to eke out a living.  A simple solution is to provide more work, even of a temporary nature, during the winter months.  At the moment, the county council provide certain relief works but because of modern machinery and consequent quicker methods, the jobs last only two or three weeks and those people have to go home again.  In every town I visit, at every meeting I attend, the story is the same.  At a meeting in Charlestown recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in connection with the closing of a railway line, I was approached by numerous people seeking employment.  In all cases I had to give them the same answer. Where is the prosperity Deputy Gallagher was speaking about?  If he comes around the constituency with me, I guarantee that I will prove the reverse to him and I am issuing that challenge to him now.</P>
      <P>We are considering this year Estimates for well over £100 million, despite the fact that our population has dwindled to 2¾ million.  That is a sad thing.  There must be something terribly wrong when it takes over £100 million to administer the affairs of 26 counties with a population of only 2¾ million.  We find in Sligo, and in many other towns like it, that owners of hotels who have been quite prosperous have been lucky enough to qualify for very substantial grants in order to build up their hotels to Grade A establishments and thus cater for some fellow who comes here for a few weeks of the year while down town you meet numerous people living with in-laws in houses unfit for habitation, all begging for decent accommodation. Those anomalies exist while thousands of pounds are being spent on building luxury hotels to put up a big show for the people who come here for a few weeks of the year. It is sad that we should have to say those things.  However, I am prepared to prove them to anybody who will come down and spend two days with me in my constituency.  I have proved them now.  I have challenged Deputy Gallagher on it.</P>
      <P>A White Paper has been presented to us here.  Many people who have given long and faithful service in this country are approaching Deputies to-day asking us when some increase will be given to them, in relation to their pension scheme.  Those would be ex-CIE men and ex-postmen who have given maybe 40, 50 or 55 years' service to the country, trudging the byroads and boreens delivering letters.  I do not know if it still continues but up to this they have been turned out without any pension at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have ex-CIE men in towns today <Col N="161" /> with a paltry little pension that is not fit to keep them going.  We have ex-teachers who are continually writing to us asking when that part of their pension that was retrospective would be paid to them.  I got a reply on a few occasions that it would be dealt with but I suppose it was a case of putting it on the long finger in a form of an answer.</P>
    <P>We have thousands of young Gardaí today who are not content.  They refrained from taking strike action almost 12 months ago on condition that arbitration would be set up and that their case would be settled.  I do not think they have got an opportunity yet of putting their case before anybody.  It was left a dead letter.</P>
    <P>As a farmer from the West, I think it is most important for the Government to divert some of the money that is lavishly being spent on some road schemes towards helping the small farmer to tide over these hard times. What is really making it difficult for the farmer today is the cost of living. Before this, he could live completely on the small farm and there was no need to make this case at all for him simply because he bought his requirements at a normal price.  But now butter, sugar, bread, flour and everything else has gone out of reach of this man who is waiting for his creamery cheque for about five months of the year in bad parts of the country. Where will he get money for the rest of the year?  He may sell a few calves but his income will be very limited. More consideration should be given to him than is given at the moment &mdash;instead of pegging the money into big hotels and spending thousands upon thousands upon road schemes.  The roads concerned would very well be able to carry the traffic until some of our farms are built up.</P>
    <P>I have been down south recently and I saw a road scheme being carried out.  It crossed fields.  There were seven heavy rollers on it and there was a uniformed employee at each end of that scheme.  I know there is a lot to be said for great roads and for building up our country but surely, with the flow of emigration at its present rate &mdash;and they are not going for pleasure <Col N="162" />&mdash;a little more attention and a little more money should be given to and spent on the farmers and the townspeople first.  There are good roads in many parts of the south which are quite capable of carrying the present traffic until such time as the situation has been rectified and then by all means let us turn to the good roads.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of rates. In the West, they have gone to 50/-in the £ in Leitrim and 62/- in the £, I think, in Mayo.  Mayo is not my constituency.  However, rates in Leitrim at 50/- in the £ are exorbitant.  This is all due to the fact that a Health Act was passed some years ago and it was left to the county council to bear half the cost of it.  I would ask the Government to make it a national charge in future.  If that is not done, then, at our present progress, we shall continue to succeed in closing doors. When one goes into the villages and towns in my constituency one cannot but notice that they are almost stripped of population.  There is no employment. The shopkeeper of today will make very sure that he will not have assistants.  He will deal with the problem himself and he will have no difficulty.  He is only too glad to see you come in to buy some item from him.  I appeal to the Government to make their Health Act a national charge instead of having it run up to the rate of about 18/6 in the £, which I think it is in Leitrim now.</P>
    <P>I have been approached from various sources lately by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association.  I was asked by them to impress on the Government the necessity of increasing the milk price.  Some of them told me only one increase has been given in the past 11 years.  In view of increases all round in the cost of living, that certainly surprises me.  I come from rural Ireland and I understand the position.  We have farmers today whose milk test result may be good and who are paid at the rate of 1/3 and 1/4 and up to 1/7 but the people unfortunate enough not to get a good result at the creamery are the people who suffer.  An increase should be given all round to these people because they are hardly able to survive.  On the subject of education <Col N="163" /> in my constituency many appeals are made to me about the condition of schools.</P>

I appeal to the Government and to the Minister to take note of all those things that I have dealt with.  I certainly hope something will be done for the farmers and the townspeople.  Always remember that when the farmers are baling out, the towns become ghost towns.  There is no point in making a case for the farmers in my area without making a case for the townspeople because when one section goes, the other goes. Emigration is very serious.  It arises from the fact that there is no employment. We who are councillors, Deputies, and so on, would be only too glad very often to tell these people we could do something for them but the answer has to be in the negative every time.  The employment is not there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question put to the Minister today with the answer to which we were dissatisfied, asked that the Minister amend any recent change he had made in the limitations on the export of horses so as to avoid any serious losses to the Irish farmer. There are many ways of amending a particular matter.  Any amendments to be made are up to the Minister and the purpose of the question was to give the Minister an opportunity to amend the limitations as he saw fit. However, the Minister, in the supplementaries to the question seemed to avoid the entire point at issue.  I quote the supplementaries as follows:</P>
      <P>Mr. Donegan: Does the Minister not realise that this means a minimum loss of £15 per head on horses sold by the Irish farmers, that as a result fewer farm horses will be bred and that if this continues there will not be a horse in Ireland in ten years?</P>
      <P>Mr. Smith: I do not realise what the present policy or the day to day policy of the Fine Gael Party is but in 1953 that Party voted for a motion to prohibit the export of all horses.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: Not true.</P>
      <P>Mr. Smith: It is on the records of the House.  They voted for the prohibition of the export of all horses at a time when there was no means of processing horses in this country, and now they are concerned about an order I make altering the age at which horses may be exported from seven years to five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would answer that as Deputy Dillon did by saying &ldquo;not true&rdquo; and <Col N="165" /> would refer the Minister to Volume 143, Columns 597 and 598 where he will discover that this was a free vote of the House and that over one-third of the members of the Fine Gael Party voted for the motion as he has described and that none of the members voted for the other side.  He will also find that a Minister and some Deputies of his Party voted with them on that motion so confirming the fact that this was a free vote and had nothing to do with Party politics.</P>
    <P>The duty of any Irish Minister for Agriculture is to get the best price possible for the products of the Irish farmer.  The farmer must pay for everything he gets in the open market and therefore he must get the highest possible price available to the Minister to get for him.  The sole responsibility devolves on the Minister in that regard.  One finds from the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for the last years for which one can get accurate information that, in 1958, live horses were exported to the value of £2,233,000 that in 1959, the value was £2,389,000 and that in 1960, the value was £3,265,000.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that these were all exported for slaughter but I do suggest that a large proportion of them were and if there is to be a loss, as there seems to be, of £15 a head, then the Irish farmer is losing something in the region of half a million pounds a year.  We on this side of the House must clarify our position exactly.  We are not concerned as to how the Minister gets over that position.  Our consideration is to see that the farmer gets the highest prices.  How that is to be done, the marketing and the humanities, is the Minister's concern. On that he will be judged.  That is his responsibility.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to say that the decent humanities are not being observed and that export must be stopped, it is his duty to see that the farmer gets an equal price at home. If he wants to prohibit the export of horses, then it surely is his responsibility to provide, by subsidy or other means, the difference that will mean that the Irish farmer will get the same price.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> The last paragraph of the question asked:</P>
    <P>And if he will now amend this recent change, so as to avoid serious loss to the Irish farmer?</P>
    <P>We do not mind how the Minister amends it but it is the right of the Irish farmer, if he has to buy his goods in a free market or behind a tariff wall, to sell in a free market.  Therefore the responsibility devolves on the Government to see that he gets the same price.</P>
    <P>The British Government want to give their industrial workers cheap meat and they allow free export of cattle to the British market but they provide subsidies for their farmers so that they will not lose money.  There is no reason why the Minister cannot do that.  If he takes a certain action which interferes with the profits of the Irish farmers, it is our duty, as a responsible Opposition, to see that he answers for that and we will do just that.  Is this to be the start of many such things?  If there is to be trouble in relation to cruelty to livestock, and I would be the last to encourage cruelty to any animal, least of all to the horse, then are we to be told that we cannot export our cattle?  Are we to be told that we will have to take a lower price and slaughter them at home?</P>
    <P>A definite precedent has now been established and there is only one action open to the Minister as I see it. If he is going to kill the trade, and that is what he is doing, then he must provide a subsidy to ensure that the Irish farmer will not be at any loss. That is the reason we are raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This half-hour is available to Deputies to raise matters arising from Parliamentary Questions, when Deputies claim that they have not received all the information they should receive. I have been here in this House on a good many occasions when this half-hour was used for that purpose but I can say truthfully that I cannot recall an occasion when a question was raised on the Adjournment with less reason.  On a matter of this nature, it <Col N="167" /> is all very well for Deputy Donegan to have views of his own.  However, I am quite sure the proposal he suggests here would not have the support of the majority of his Party.  When a Deputy is elected to this House, what he says and the questions he asks should reflect what the Party as a whole are thinking.</P>
      <P>I referred today at Question Time to the fact that a motion was discussed here&mdash;I gave the volume and the column numbers&mdash;in 1953.  A division was taken on that motion.  The motion was to the effect that a prohibition should be imposed on the export of horses, without qualification or limitation. I agree that the vote was a free vote but if you look down the list of those who voted for and against, you will find that as usual the Fine Gael Party, in the main, absented themselves. That has been their history and a long-established practice of theirs in my own memory.  On this occasion, many of them who did not want to commit themselves, who did not want to be for or against, absented themselves but the important thing is that all the Fine Gael Deputies who were here voted for a prohibition on the export of horses.  They did that, although they as a Party, as the major element in a Government we had here for two periods, closed down the only place that was established here for the export of horse flesh.  With no facilities of any kind available except the facilities Fine Gael destroyed by deliberate act, the irresponsible ones amongst them voted lightheartedly for a motion for total prohibition.</P>
      <P>I should not be expected to take the antics of Deputy Donegan seriously in this matter.  I pride myself on having handled this whole business of the horse trade magnificently.  I say that not because it is a conclusion I have arrived at myself but a conclusion that is supported by the evidence, written and otherwise, that has passed through my Department to myself.  This is a subject to which I gave very serious thought and on which I took a very firm and intelligent stand, keeping in mind all the time a number of vital considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> I shall try to recount from memory what these considerations were.  First, in this House and outside it, I have strenuously defended the principle that horses should be exported the same as any other animals, that is, after those who are responsible for their export have taken all possible precautions to see that the animals are not exposed to any undue hardship.  Secondly, I take the view that it would not be a bad idea if we built up here a means of handling most of these animals through processing and through the development of a market for horseflesh.</P>
    <P>After the Government which Deputy Donegan supported had closed the first attempt at providing that service, this Government announced their willingness to permit, subject to the approval of our veterinary people as to the type of premises, and so on, the establishment of a number of concerns here to handle this trade in the way I have described.  Because for some time after that announcement of policy there were no developments, I used to have to take jibing questions here from the members of Deputy Donegan's Party.  When three concerns capable of dealing with this problem of the export of horses made their appearance, I then made an order as from a certain date providing that horses over the age of seven years would not be allowed to be exported for that trade.  I selected the age of seven not altogether because it was possible to determine with certainty that the age of an animal was seven but because I was anxious to preserve the principle that horses should be exported, that there was really nothing objectionable in exporting them.  I was also anxious to ensure that those who had provided the accommodation to handle horseflesh in the way I have briefly described would not secure a monopoly, that there would be at least some check on the prices they paid for live horses.</P>
    <P>When I made that order, I made it clear on a number of occasions that it was my intention to review it, and after a period of two years and without pressure from anybody interested, with the knowledge that I myself had of <Col N="169" /> what was taking place, I reviewed it. I amended the order and changed the age from seven to five so as to avoid confusion.  At five, it is not necessary to have an expert to read, as it were, a horse's mouth to know he is five years and more.  I did that because there was an inclination to offer horses for export that were more than seven years old.  There is always the prospect of disagreement amongst those who might examine the animal as to whether he was seven, eight, nine or ten years of age.  The age of five years was a clearcut age and the fact that an animal was that age would be discernible even to those who were not fully expert in judging horses.</P>
    <P>I do not take this question on the Adjournment really seriously.  I have looked over the discussion that took place in 1953 and have read some of the contributions made here by Deputies of the Party opposite.  I should like to give some useful advice to that Party.  I have referred to it as the Cumann na nGaedheal Party. That is what they were called when I first knew them.  They changed their ways and their name so often that one is inclined to lose track of them.  I would give them this advice, that in an important matter such as this, they should try to have some policy.  I hope they would like to have themselves regarded as a responsible Party <Col N="170" /> and, as such, the major part of their work here is to take their responsibility seriously, not to be always so frivolous, not to be always seeking the jibe, irrespective of whether it fits in with any pattern of policy as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>I pride myself on the fact-and I am supported by quite a few people who have shown a great interest in this business from every point of view, even by those who were interested in it from the cruelty angle&mdash; that I have tried to preserve the principle that the horse, like any other animal, should be and can be exported. I have tried in the case of those who have established themselves here to handle horseflesh to put the only brake on them that I could impose to ensure that they would not secure their raw materials without some form of competition.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that Deputy Donegan should be allowed by his leaders and by those who, I hope, are more responsible and who take a more reasoned and solid view on these matters, to indulge in antics like this and commit his Party to such an irresponsible course.</P>
