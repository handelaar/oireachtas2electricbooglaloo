      <P>I am advised that the supply of material for corneal grafting is adequate.  Some time ago, when the matter was previously under consideration in my Department, it was decided, following consultation with those mainly concerned in Dublin with the performance of this operation, that a publicity campaign was undesirable but arrangements were put in train to ensure a regular source of supply, as needed.  No approach has been made <Col N="367" /> to my Department about the matter by the body mentioned in the question.</P>
      <P>The wider question of the regulation of the supply and storage of material for use in the transplantation of human organs, tissues, etc. generally is at present under consideration in my Department, but it is too early to say yet what action, if any, may be considered necessary or desirable following that consideration.</P>

      <P>I regard it as desirable that, where it can be arranged, all nurses providing public services should have available to them the facility of participating in an adequate super-annuation scheme.  I cannot, however, accept the implication in the question that I have ministerial responsibility to provide special pensions for all aged nurses, whether they had been engaged in providing public services or not; but wherever it is within my competence in individual cases, I do my utmost to translate my sympathy into practical help.</P>

Pressure of other urgent work on the architectural staff in the Office of Public Works, who are engaged on the Garda building programme, which involves the erection of over 200 new stations has, unfortunately, caused some delay in the case of Fethard.

      <P>Under the provisions of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, registered friendly societies have power to mortgage any land they may hold.  This is considered to imply that such societies have borrowing powers to such amount as could be raised by mortgage on the land they may hold.</P>
      <P>Friendly societies may, out of a separate fund, to be formed by the contributions or deposits of members, make loans to members under certain conditions.  Members may not invest more than £200 in the fund and members borrowing from the fund may not owe more than £50.  A society may also invest its funds in accordance with the Act without limit as to amount.  Otherwise the Friendly Societies Acts do not confer on friendly societies any power of lending money.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Co-operative Societies examined the law as it affects credit unions and their report contains certain recommendations on this subject. The report, which will be published in due course, is being examined and the question of the introduction of legislation will be considered in the light of the Committee's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics available in my Department are not in a form which would enable the details sought by the Deputy to be compiled without an inordinate amount of time and research.  An analysis of lettings of cottages erected by county councils between June, 1958, and March, 1962, and in respect of which letting certificates had been submitted to my Department, showed that approximately 95 per cent qualified for the <Col N="377" /> payment of subsidy at the rate of 66? per cent of subsidisable loan charges.</P>
      <P>As regards (a), section 14 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1958, provided for the increase from 60 per cent to 66? per cent in the rate of subsidy in respect of dwellings provided by county councils after 30th June, 1958, for families displaced from their previous accommodation by operations of the county council under the Housing Acts.  The section also provided for the payment of the higher subsidy towards the rehousing of families, including families previously living as subtenants in labourers' cottages, on medical, compassionate or other similar grounds where the circumstances of the persons concerned would not permit them to be rehoused without the aid of such subsidy.  The answer to (b) is in the negative.  As regards (c), while no schemes were formulated by county councils specifically as schemes in respect of which subsidy at the rate of 33? per cent would be payable, it will be seen from my reply to the first part of the Question that that rate of subsidy applied to a relatively small number of the dwellings provided by county councils in the course of their normal building programmes since June, 1958, the date from which the differential subsidy system became applicable in rural areas.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the Summer Time Order, 1963.</P>
      <P>The Order provides that the period of Summer Time in 1964 will be from 22nd March to 25th October which is a week longer than the period we had in 1963.  If the Order were not made the period of Summer Time would be from 19th April to 4th October.  In effect, the Order lengthens the period of Summer Time by seven weeks altogether &mdash; four weeks in the spring and three weeks in the autumn.</P>
      <P>The period proposed is that which has already been fixed for Britain and the Six Counties and it is to synchronise with them that we have made the Order.  Otherwise, while we would have the same time as they have for the greater part of the year, there would be short periods in spring and autumn when we would differ from them by an hour.  I need hardly stress that failure to synchronise would cause serious difficulties in relation to cross-Channel traffic, postal services, and so on.  It is to avoid this that the Order is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress on Thursday afternoon last, I was commenting on the fact that the cost of the erection of houses, and whether or not it is possible to erect a cheaper house, had been under discussion over the previous couple of days.  We sometimes find that when houses have been completed, though nobody seems to worry a whole lot about the design or anything else beforehand, somebody suddenly finds a lot of things wrong with them and then, of course, the complaint comes too late.</P>
      <P>I was rather surprised to find that the Department of Local Government have, themselves, been responsible for a considerable amount of interference with the design of houses, the result of which has been that a much worse house has been built than the ones formerly erected by local authorities.  I have in mind in particular one sanctioned about two years ago and which seems to be in fairly general use at present, a design in which there is only one fireplace and no outoffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite understand somebody living in a big town or in the city not understanding the necessity to have a fairly sizable outoffice, but for the life of me I cannot understand people who were born and reared in country <Col N="391" /> districts suggesting that a very small fuel shed attached to the house is sufficient to meet the needs of people who will live in these houses.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that the design of the house has cut down the cost but I suggest the Minister and his experts should insist, in future, that a decent type of house be built.  It is false economy to build a house that is too small, with too low a ceiling and with ventilation almost impossible because there are no fireplaces or openings in most of the rooms, except the window.  The Minister will probably understand the type of house to which I am referring.  A couple of years ago, the officials &ldquo;plugged&rdquo; this house and up to now insisted it was the ideal type.</P>
    <P>During Question Time, there was a reference to the building of a second cottage on a vested council cottage plot.  While I am aware the Minister has given permission to suspend certain orders in some counties to allow this to be done, I think the request made by Deputy Norton that the Minister should bring to the notice of local authorities the right to ask to have these orders suspended was a fair one.  I am aware, as Deputy Clinton said, that as recently as the night after the question was answered, the Dublin County Manager said there was no authority for doing that.  While I am aware a county manager can be made to do certain things or be suspended if he does not, that necessity should not arise.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he could solve this problem very easily by having a simple circular sent to local authorities informing them of their rights in this matter.  In my constituency of Meath, there are a number of people who find it nearly impossible to get sites for houses.  They can get sites on vested council plots, but, so far, permission to build has not been given.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to ensure that the information is passed along to the local authorities so that the matter can be put in hand without any further delay.</P>
    <P>One other question I addressed to <Col N="392" /> the Minister concerns those who do not qualify for the two-thirds subsidy. The position about a number of these people is that they get a loan of a house when they get married.  They are given permission to use the house until they get one of their own, but the position nine or ten years afterwards usually is that they are still living in the house, with the owner nagging them, telling them the house is needed and asking them to get out. The house does not belong to the persons living in it and they should, therefore, be able to get a local authority house.  We have the situation of somebody working for an employer.He is not such a good employer, but he owns a house of sorts.  The person is living in that house but he cannot have a house built for him because the house is declared capable of repair by some engineer who has inspected it.  I bet the Minister anything he likes that the engineer who states that house is capable of repair would not be prepared to live very long in it himself, but he thinks it is good enough for a labouring man and his family.  The result is that those in the house are condemned to stay there.  The owner has no intention of repairing it and the unfortunate occupant cannot get out of it.  The house is not in the class which would get the two-third subsidy and these people must remain. The Minister should look into this serious problem.  If he does, I think he will be anxious to help.</P>
    <P>I should like now to pass from houses to roads.  This year in Meath the Minister did something which possibly was according to the rules but which has caused grave upset.  He has not given any county road grants, and we have lost a total of £98,000 as a result.  I know the Minister can say he has given an additional £100,000 for arterial roads, but everybody appreciates the difference &mdash; arterial road grants are spent in one or two areas whereas county road grants are spent over the whole county.  Up to ten years ago, the number of employees in most county councils was double or treble what it is today.  The average in Meath was <Col N="393" /> 800; today it is about 320.  It is surely not too much to ask that in view of the reduction in the number of employees, those employees should be guaranteed full-time employment. But how can they be if there is such fluctuation in grants, if last year we got £98,000 more than we are getting this year?</P>
    <P>While the Minister may say this is a matter entirely for the local authority, when he examines it, I think he will agree that it must be governed by the amount of money made available at Local Government level.  Arterial road grants are all right in their own way.  While it is a grand thing to have roads from Dublin to Galway, Cork and Belfast on which you can travel, if you wish, at 70 m.p.h. &mdash; and many people do, ignoring the 30 m.p.h. limit through towns as well &mdash; many of us feel it is far more important to have decent county roads.  The extraordinary thing is that the wider the roads are made and the better the surface, the more accidents occur and the more people are killed.  We had a recent tragic example of that in Meath.  We have an unenviable record there.  We have great roads, but we have more road accidents and deaths than any other county in Ireland.  I do not know what the explanation for that is, but that is what has happened.  The number has increased by five over the past couple of days, and that occurred on a wide, straight stretch of road.  I am not blaming the Minister for this &mdash; heaven knows, I blame him for enough &mdash; but something must be done and a halt must be called somewhere.  I suggest the money being spent on arterial roads should be diverted to county roads. The narrow county road, which can barely carry two vehicles together, is far more suitable for the expenditure of large sums of money than the main roads between the cities on which the money is being showered at present. The Minister may not agree with me, but it has reached the stage where something must be done.</P>
    <P>A question I put down to the Minister on employment has brought out one peculiar thing.  In replies given to me over the past few days, it has emerged there are more pensionable <Col N="394" /> servants employed by local authorities in many cases than there are full-time employees.  This is something the Minister should look into.  It seems peculiar if you find a local authority with 420 pensionable servants &mdash; people who were formerly full-time employees but who are now casual &mdash; and a total of 320 or 330 full-time employees.  It is a bit of a hardship on somebody, and the Minister might consider dealing with it.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that 15 years after the passing of the Local Government Superannuation Act, which gave pensions of sorts to the servants of local authorities, there are still three county councils who have not adopted that Act.  I know there is no provision in the Act to force these people to adopt it.  I suggest that possibly something could be done to try to persuade county councillors &mdash; county managers, I suppose, are mainly responsible for not having attempted to do something about it &mdash; to change their attitude.  It is too bad to find that sort of thing continuing.</P>
    <P>One thing that has been very noticeable in the past few years is the number of county council quarries which have closed down and have been replaced, in the main, by big quarries opened by private concerns.  In a number of cases, the companies who are operating these quarries are paying much higher wages than the local authorities and are also operating on an entirely mechanical basis.  While another Minister has been responsible for trying to encourage rural industry, surely the Minister will agree with me that it is rather odd to see existing rural industries being closed down.  I am referring to these local authority quarries because while there may be a difference of a few hundred pounds at the end of the year in the amount of money which road material costs now and road material cost when the local authorities were preparing it themselves, I think it is right to say that the loss to the local authority is very much greater than that couple of hundred pounds which is saved and if the national loss is taken into account, it very often runs into thousands of pounds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> I think it is false economy where men who are getting £6 or £7 a week for working a full week in quarries find they are out of a job and have to go to the labour exchange while the work which they were doing is being done by a big contractor.  If we count the money which has to be paid from the national purse to those who are on the labour exchange and weigh it against the savings of the local authority, we shall find that the country as a whole comes out of it very much on the debit side.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, as one of his predecessors did before, could have a look at this problem and see if some advice could not be given to the local authority that it is not such a good thing to rush to close down a local quarry in order to get a contractor to supply the material.  I am aware that there are one or two local authorities who are insisting on preparing and quarrying their own material and I ask that the Minister would try to have that practice retained in as many counties as possible because it does give much badly-needed rural employment.</P>
    <P>The question of rates of wages is something which is discussed on another level and I do not intend to raise the matter here except to point out that people who are employed doing good work on the roads are entitled to a decent rate of wages.  It is rather a pity when we find some local authorities still dragging behind and trying to give the impression that it is entirely unskilled people who are working on the roads.  They must have skill; if they have not, they would not be able to do the job they are doing.</P>
    <P>One question I should like the Minister to take up with the local authorities is that of lay-by facilities.  We know that where roads are straightened and turns taken out, it is usual in some counties to create a lay-by.  We have reached the stage where there is such a volume of traffic that something must be done to prevent vehicles, particularly heavy lorries, from parking on the roadway and if there are sufficient lay-bys, there should be no necessity for parking on the roads.  It is bad enough in the daylight but when done at night, <Col N="396" /> it is really a menace.  Far too many lives have been lost by indiscriminate parking of vehicles.</P>
    <P>One thing has been brought to my notice about which I think something should be done.  It is that when a local authority make a lay-by and put up a sign, they feel they have done their share.  I feel they have not, that there should also be receptacles for rubbish provided and an attempt made to clean up the place occasionally.  If at all possible, some type of portable toilet facilities should be provided for people who stop at the lay-by.  This may seem a little odd but I have got complaints from people, including one clergyman, who had a lay-by at his gate.  He had no objection to the lay-by being created there.  There was a turn on the road which was removed and it was an ideal place for it but he could not use the field behind it, between the lay-by and his house and he has not been able to go there with his family since the lay-by was created. I think this is a really serious matter because it occurs again and again and it could easily be prevented by having even portable toilet facilities provided.</P>
    <P>There is another matter the Minister possibly cannot do very much about except to bring it to the notice of the local authorities, that is, the collection of refuse.  It is a function of the local authorities.  When they collect it, it seems there is an objection to taking in areas where new houses have been built and where there are no receptacles or no way of doing away with refuse.  Surely there should be some facilities for having rubbish removed at least every few weeks?  The problem does not end there because we find that where local authorities have those dumps, as they are called, very often dead beasts and all sorts of refuse, pieces of bread and food of all kinds are dumped there, with the result that it is not long until rats appear and very often you have swarms of rats around the place until you wonder would it not have been much better not to have any dump at all than to have a dump and have the whole area infested with rats brought there because the dump is not properly treated.  I suggest that all those dumps <Col N="397" /> should be regularly laid with poison or they should be very well covered with earth so that this infestation will not recur.</P>
    <P>One final matter: the question of derelict sites grants.  Would the Minister consider in regard to grants that have been made for derelict sites, that encouragement should be given to try to find in the centre of towns and villages, the unsightly houses and have them taken away, and have houses built there rather than build on the outskirts of the town, thus making it a straggling town?  Surely an effort could be made to have something done about that?</P>
    <P>With regard to amenity grants, we know how hard it is to get small sea-side areas included in any of these but if the Minister would consider having a special type of a grant applied to them, I think it would be very well received because apparently they are completely shut out any time the bigger grants are being considered. When the Minister is giving an amenity grant, would he not consider that there could be no better amenity than housing sites?  Would he consider empowering local authorities to acquire housing sites to be financed from the amenity grants schemes?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are but few matters to which I should like to refer and one is this hardy annual of roads.  It is unquestionably true that the Minister and his Department are doing trojan work to implement and carry out the road plan of 1945 which was initiated by the then Government as a post-war development and which we now know was very necessary.  Irrespective of what may be said about extravagance, it is self-evident to any who care to study the position that it is vitally <Col N="398" /> essential that there should be a set standard of roadmaking in all counties. With the disappearance of the railways, a progressive Minister for Local Government must now ensure that the roads are brought up to a certain standard, being thereby rendered capable of taking care of the increased volume of heavy traffic passing over them.</P>
    <P>Road grants are allocated usually on a mileage basis.  Now, the terrain varies from county to county.  In my constituency, we have a great number of lakes and rivers and bogs and we believe that there should be special grants, if at all possible, to enable us to deal efficiently with the big backlog of road work requiring to be done. We have some 1,200 miles of <i>culs-desac</i> and throughroads in my county. These do not come within the jurisdiction of the county council at the moment.  We know we could take these over under existing legislation when repaired under rural improvement schemes but we are deterred from doing so because of the enormous cost involved in putting them into a proper state of repair and subsequently maintaining them.  It is, too, very difficult to get the necessary local contributions, especially for through lanes, from some of the people using them.  With the disappearance of quite a large mileage of untarred roads each year, we believe there is now a case to be made for some extra grant to enable county councils, such as ours, which have still 600 miles of county road untarred, to take over these <i>culsde-sac</i> and to maintain them or even in cases to allow the county council to pay the local contribution to the rural improvement scheme.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to sabotage the rural improvement scheme because I know that excellent work has been done under that scheme as operated by the Department of Finance.  Almost one-third of the population of my constituency live along lanes and throughroads.  We were told recently by the county manager that it would cost an extra 2/6d.  on the rates to make 45 miles per year on these lanes catering for three or more families. <Col N="399" /> Therefore, I think a case can be made for some extra financial assistance.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, let me say that it is something in which this Government have always taken a very keen interest.  Good housing means better health and greater happiness in the home.  That, in turn, means less money spent in hospitals and dispensaries.It has been the aim of the Government to provide sufficient money to enable local authorities and private individuals to provide decent homes.  The Minister is setting aside £2,750,000 this year for private housing grants; that represents an increase of £250,000 over last year's provision. This money will be welcomed by those who will avail of it to build new homes for themselves and their families or put existing homes into a proper state of repair.  The Minister told us that 24,442 grants were paid last year, and that proves that the grants are being availed of by the people. We are aware that there are 20,000 unfit dwellings still in rural Ireland. Allowing for 50 per cent of these being occupied by one or two persons, we are left with the figure of 10,000.  That is a fairly big figure.  The housing of these people is something we must tackle We must not rest until we have eradicated all unfit dwellings, thereby improving the housing of our people and raising the standard of living.  I am glad of the provision to enable county councils to provide building sites for those willing to build their own homes. Many people find it difficult to get sites, particularly near towns or villages, and it is near towns and villages they are anxious to build in order to avail of amenities like water and sewerage.</P>
    <P>Housing is going ahead full swing, no matter what some people may say.  A vast change has taken place over the entire country.  Anyone who wishes to see the improvement need only travel the main roads, the boreens and the lanes.  In every townland, even up <i>culs-de-sac</i>, one sees houses being built or reconstructed through the medium of grants.  The change is a tremendous one.  I should not have dealt with this matter at all were it not that an <Col N="400" /> Opposition Deputy stated it did not seem to make much difference what Government was in power; things would go on in much the same way. The people in my constituency do not believe that.  We have bitter memories of what happened during 1956 and 1957 when, in the middle of winter, a county manager gave us some sad news.</P>
    <P>The Opposition had a majority on the county council then, though I admit immediately that in our county council we all try to do our best irrespective of political affiliation.  On the advice of the county manager, however, they decided to stop the supplementary housing grants in our county almost overnight.  That was responsible for the stoppage which took place in relation to people building their own homes.  Without the supplementary grant few would attempt to build.</P>
    <P>I should like to read now a paragraph from our local paper, dated 17th November, 1956, which states that the county manager said that &ldquo;the last meeting of the council authorised him to get a loan of £60,000 to provide for schemes of supplementary housing grants.  Since then more applications have been received, providing for an additional £15,000.  He had not yet received the £60,000 and he was not likely to get it for some time.  In his opinion, the scheme should be suspended until such time as the financial position had eased.&rdquo;  I submit that the county manager was following the direction issued by the then Minister for Local Government to all local authorities to go slow on this matter of building houses, or providing supplementary grants for private individuals, because the money was not available.  Again when pressed by some members of the council, he said: &ldquo;You authorised me to borrow £60,000 and I have not got it yet from the Local Loans Fund.  I will not get it until the application is made as a result of the national loan.&rdquo;  I should also like to refer to a heading in another copy of our local paper in 1957, in broad, bold print: &ldquo;The manager says banks refuse to give money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> I am not quoting this for the sake of being political but in order to let our people know the difference to the rural communities that can be brought about by the type of Government, the type of Minister for Local Government, we have in charge of such important services as roads and housing. We small farmers and workers in Cavan still feel the pinch of those disastrous years.  Indeed, our council have had to go back since 1960 and pay outstanding arrears of supplementary housing grants to many people who were caught in that squeeze.  Unfortunately, we have a number of people entitled to payments for new houses under that heading who have received nothing yet.</P>
    <P>I state this merely because no amount of figures which people may be inclined to produce can contradict the evidence available to the ordinary man in the street if he keeps his eyes open.  If he takes the trouble, he will find things are much better now than they were in those disastrous years of the Coalition.  The present Government have been tackling the problem splendidly, but the local authorities, in their housing programmes, are coming up against a scarcity of skilled men.  In my constituency, new houses are going up all the time but we still have to face this skilled labour scarcity problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by again congratulating the Minister and his Department for the splendid work they are doing in pushing ahead with the housing drive.  As a Party, we shall not be content until every person in need of a house is the proud owner of one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would be inclined to embark immediately on a contradiction of the last speaker's rather fanciful figures, but before I do so, there are a number of other things of immediate importance to the city of Dublin and to the country with which I feel I must deal.  Deputy Sherwin, in his speech last week, suggested that the most important thing for any member of the Dublin City Council to do was to attend meetings of the Housing Committee &mdash; An Coiste Teaghlachais. <Col N="402" /> I shall say, for the benefit of the people of this city and the country generally, that the most useless thing any member of the city council could do is to spend his time attending meetings of the different committees at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>We all know that a man must render an account of every idle word he says, and I cannot think of any more idle way of spending the afternoon than sitting at a committee meeting for three hours or so talking, talking, and patting one's fellow members on the back so that when an awkward situation arises, one can say: &ldquo;We met weekly and talked&rdquo;.  The fact is that these meetings are arranged by a number of professional politicians and by a few fortunate councillors who can get off from their employment at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>It is well known that the average man who minds his business and, by doing so, is not a burden on society, finds it extremely difficult to attend committee meetings of the Dublin City Council at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, convened for the convenience of the full time professional politicians, the more fortunate councillors who can get off from their employment or their professions and the officials who are disinclined to attend meetings of committees at other hours.</P>
      <P>For some years past, efforts have been made by some members of the City Council to have the times of committee meetings changed, but so long as there remain on the council a majority of full-time politicians and councillors who can get off from their employment, so long will it be impossible for several members to attend what I call these selective committee meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the past few years, we had the appalling instance of a hardworking member of the Dublin City Council being declared bankrupt because he was so devoted to his municipal business that his professional work suffered as a result and he got into difficulties.  What some members of the Corporation who speak so loudly here would like to see happening is that several other members would get into similar difficulties.  I do <Col N="403" /> not think that is good for local government and I do not make any apologies for the members of the City Council who attend to their day's work and to the clients who consult them rather than spending the afternoon attending committee meetings arranged at awkward hours to suit the professional politicians and the officials, who spend their time talking and clapping each other on the back.</P>
    <P>Now that that has been got out of the way, let us look at the results of the alleged hardworking Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation. Since June of this year, that work has mainly been in defending themselves and the officials against the justifiable wrath of the homeless people of this city.  To some extent they have been successful in doing that, but let us see whether or not they deserve to be left free from attack.</P>
    <P>There are now on the Dublin Corporation's housing lists 10,000 families urgently in need of housing accommodation.Of those 10,000 who are now accepted as being in urgent need of housing accommodation, there are about 1,200 families who have been evicted since June last.  Take off the 1,200 you have got out of dangerous buildings in the past few months and you are still left with 8,800 in urgent need of alternative housing accommodation.Even if the wind had not blown in June, even if the rain had not fallen in such unprecedented quantities and force, as we are led to believe, there would still be 8,800 homeless families listed &mdash; some 25,000 to 30,000 human beings without decent living accommodation.</P>
    <P>So An Coiste Teaghlachais have fallen down on the job of making reasonable accommodation available for those people.  We are told a further cause of the burden on housing in Dublin at the present time is the unprecedented flow back of emigrants from abroad.  Deputy P.J. Burke, whistling past the Fianna Fáil graveyard, said this was due to the pleasant prosperity of the city over the past three years.  Deputy Sherwin said it was not due to that but to the new rent restriction laws in Britain.  The fact is <Col N="404" /> that on 30th September of this year I received in response to a query a letter from the principal officer of the Housing Department of Dublin Corporation telling me that the figures for returned emigrants seeking accommodation were not readily available.</P>
    <P>Yet the City Manager and the officials of the Corporation, together with the professional politicians of the Housing Committee, have been telling us and the people of this city that the housing problem was due to emigrants returning.  We know there has always been a departure and return of people in Dublin and that there has been nothing unusual or particularly significant in it in recent years.  It has always been there and the same situation, I should imagine, operates in every county in Ireland.  There are always people on the waiting lists who have returned from abroad.</P>
    <P>Since October, 1958, we do know, however, that some 549 returned families have been housed by Dublin Corporation.That is a very small percentage of the total number of applicants now accepted by the Dublin Corporation as being in need of rehousing.Housing has been provided for 549 returned emigrants since October, 1958 but during all that time there have been no less than 7,000 families requiring housing accommodation.  So that, even returned emigrants form an insignificantly small percentage of the total demand on houses in this city. Notwithstanding all that, Dublin Corporation has failed to provide a sufficient number of houses year in and year out over the past seven years since this Fianna Fáil Government took office.</P>
    <P>Now we have the farcical situation of a Minister for Local Government throwing the blame on the Dublin Corporation and a Fianna Fáil Lord Mayor making public and, I think contemptible, apology for the failure of the Corporation over the past six or seven years.  What the people of this country are concerned about is that there should be in office a Minister for Local Government who was aware that for the past seven years Dublin Corporation was not providing for its housing requirements, that that <Col N="405" /> Minister failed to impress upon the Dublin Corporation the need to provide adequate housing and that he failed to provide the necessary money.</P>
    <P>Here, some months ago, in reply to a question of mine, the Minister for Local Government conceded that in the year 1956/57 over £6 million was made available by the then Government for the housing needs in Dublin and he then admitted that in that year of that £6 million odd the Corporation had spent about £4 million.  So that, in the year 1956/57 it was not a question of the Government of the day not providing the money, as Deputy Dolan and others would have us understand; it was a question of the Dublin Corporation, dominated by the Fianna Fáil Party and with the connivance of some members of the Labour Party, deliberately setting about embarrassing the then Government and, the rot in housing having been started by them in the year 1956/57, the rate of decay accelerated year by year after that, because the Fianna Fáil Government made it clear to the Dublin Corporation and every other local authority in the State that they were to cut down on housing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello very properly quoted from the <i>Economic Programme</i> of 1957.  In that paper, the Government stated that there would be a drift away from social investment; there would be a drift away from housing investment.  That was their determined policy and they got every county manager and city manager in this country to fall in line and they in turn indoctrinated the councillors to accept that the housing difficulties of this country had been more or less solved and that there was no need to pursue the housing programme with the same urgency and the same deliberation as had been shown by previous Governments, including, indeed, previous Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>There is on the records of this House&mdash;unfortunately I have been unable to trace it, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;a letter from the Department of Local Government to the Cork Corporation.  In 1958, in reply to a request from the Cork Corporation for money for housing purposes, the Minister <Col N="406" /> for Local Government at that time directed the Secretary of the Department to write stating that the money would not be made available because the Cork Corporation, amongst other things, had not made allowance for the solution to the housing problem which would be provided by emigration.  The Government then accepted emigration as a solution to the housing problem, not the building of new houses, not the provision of money to build new houses.  Local authorities were not directed to build houses but, rather, to avail of the safety value of emigration to avoid any embarrassing consequences to the local authority if there was still a demand on the part of people to have new houses built.</P>
    <P>I have referred, Sir, to the neglect by Dublin Corporation of this question of dangerous buildings.  The Minister for Local Government, following the tragedies of June this year when two old people in Bolton Street and two young children in Fenian Street lost their lives, set up an inquiry&mdash;a local inquiry.  It is important that this House should appreciate how limited this inquiry was.  It was a local inquiry, so local that it concerned itself only with one house in Bolton Street and three houses in Fenian Street, but this inquiry which has been paraded since as an answer to all charges about the neglect by Dublin Corporation and the Department of Local Government was, in fact, limited to only an architectural or engineering examination as to the cause of the collapse of the structures in Bolton Street and Fenian Street. But, if we read this report carefully, in between the lines, we find an appalling situation.  It states on page 10 that about three months before the collapse of the houses in Fenian Street the top flat was inspected by two officials from the Health Office of Dublin Corporation and the tenant pointed out the crack as it was then to be seen.  At that time this crack had extended to about an inch at the top and was about 18 inches long.  He gave evidence that subsequent to this the crack extended in width at the top to about two inches and started to get longer down the wall.</P>
    <P>This report goes on to point out <Col N="407" /> that the two inspectors of the Dublin Corporation did not report the crack which then at the top was about an inch wide and descended for 18 inches down the wall; and it then goes on to point out that there was no further examination of this house until it was a mass of rubble lying on top of the bodies of two unfortunate dead children.Does that not indicate that Dublin Corporation had tended to make light of the dangerous buildings in Dublin?</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin boasted here that he was the only councillor who attended that inquiry.  The significant thing is that he was not subjected to any cross-examination.  You do not subject a man to cross-examination if you do not treat his evidence seriously and I fear that is the plight of poor Deputy Sherwin.  But Deputy Sherwin in the course of his evidence, according to newspaper reports, did say that he had complained about several buildings being dangerous over several years but that nothing had been done about them.  I believe he was telling the truth when he said that.  I, too, have complained about many houses being in a dangerous condition for several years past but nothing was done about them.  But, since June of this year, I know that certainly eleven of the houses that I had complained about several years ago have been condemned, have since been closed up and the people evicted from them.  But I was wasting my sweet breath upon the desert air of the Corporation Dangerous Buildings Section and of the Department of Local Government in making complaints about these buildings for several years.  I am sure there is not a Dublin Deputy, certainly there is not a Dublin councillor, who has not had similar experience.</P>
    <P>Allegations are now being made that the blame for the Dublin housing situation lies not on the Corporation but upon unscrupulous landlords who failed to execute their duty as property owners.  The interesting thing is that this is not a new development.  The Act which first imposed a statutory obligation upon local authorities to inspect and control dangerous buildings was passed in the nineteenth century, <Col N="408" /> and that statutory obligation has been there on the Dublin Corporation and on other local authorities ever since the nineteenth century.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that if the Minister for Local Government were sure that his hands were clean in this matter he would dismiss those officials and, indeed, the council, who clearly failed to discharge their statutory obligation for several years past.  The fact that they had failed to discharge their obligation was known to the Department of Local Government.  In reply to a question from my colleague, Deputy Declan Costello, on the 5th February of this year, as reported at column 903, volume 199, No. 7 of the Dáil reports, the Minister for Local Government said that the number of houses ordered to be demolished was 3,399, but the number of houses actually demolished was 3,011, leaving 388 houses still standing which were so dangerous that orders had been made for their demolition.</P>
    <P>In June this year, when the houses in Bolton Street and Fenian Street collapsed, the number of buildings affected with dangerous buildings notices was 59&mdash;only 59.  But then, in a matter of three months, over 300 more houses were found to be dangerous and in need of immediate demolition; and then we had, what we have not had here for 100 years, since the battering ram was wielded by a foreign administration, Dublin Corporation evicting thousands of people in the city of Dublin on to the streets with this kind of attitude&mdash;if you are old and feeble and have not got a family then you can go to the night shelter, the men on one floor and their womenfolk on the floor below.  All the rest got was offers of alternative accommodation which, having regard to the accommodation which they previously had, was certainly far from being fair.  Then what attitude did the Dublin Corporation adopt?  Was it one of apology?  Not at all.  It was one of sneering at the people who complained, stating that they had no right to complain, that the Dublin Corporation was protecting them from death or from a worse fate.  Was there ever on the part of the Dublin Corporation <Col N="409" /> or on the part of the Department of Local Government any acknowledgment that they had failed for years past to discharge their statutory obligation to condemn and close up those dangerous buildings?  Oh no!  Why? Because the Minister for Local Government did not want to be presented with the situation in which the housing application lists of Dublin Corporation were swollen.  Throughout all these years there have been about 7,000 people looking for houses from the Dublin Corporation.  If added to that figure were all the people in dangerous buildings who had not applied, you would have a situation in which there were not fewer, at the best of times, than 10,000 people in need of housing by the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>That is the situation from which the Minister cannot escape no matter how he tries to do so.  It appears that the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;the Minister for Local Government, the Taoiseach and others&mdash;are like concerned animals.  They know they have done wrong; they know they have failed and their only response is to snarl at those who dare to criticise.  But we will continue to criticise, even if the worst thing they can say is that we are trying to make political capital out of the situation.</P>
    <P>The fact then is that it is the Minister's fault, and the Government's fault, if they allow us the opportunity, if you like, to make political capital out of that situation.  If the Minister wants to throw the blame on to the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation, he is welcome to do so.  But whatever the Minister, or the Taoiseach, says about the people not wanting an election, you can be sure there are 10,000 families in Dublin, or more, who would gladly take the opportunity to throw out of office a Government which failed so miserably to provide within a reasonable time houses for those who were so urgently in need of them.  That opportunity will come very soon, but it cannot come soon enough.</P>
    <P>What do we find now but a situation that Deputy Dolan wants to glory over. He says great progress has now been made in the housing drive.  Let us have a look at it.  Taking the year 1956-57 &mdash;a shocking year according to Deputy <Col N="410" /> Dolan and his colleagues&mdash;the number of local authority houses built in Ireland was 4,784.  The number of new dwellings provided in the same year by the Dublin Corporation was 1,564, and all Deputy Dolan can do is to produce a press cutting and quote a heading in a newspaper saying that the County Manager stated he could not get money from the bank.  I do not know anything about the financial standing of Deputy Dolan's county council, but this I do know, that it was a great deal easier to get money to build 1,238 houses, which were built last year, than it was to get the money to build 4,784, which we built in one year when we were in power.  If Fine Gael had been satisfied then to provide only one-quarter of the number of houses they did provide.  I am quite sure that there would have been no difficulty whatsoever in getting the money to do it, notwithstanding the fact that the world at that time stood on the brink of a holocaust and notwithstanding the fact that at that time this country for over six months had been building up reserves of all kinds of materials because of the world situation in which it seemed that this country, among all the countries of the world, was going to be plunged into an international crisis which might well last for several years.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Government at that time could have adopted the attitude of Fianna Fáil in 1938-39 and done nothing about it and left the country short of vital materials.  They could have clamped down on every businessman, and on every farmer building up his stocks then.  That would have been the easiest thing to do.  But they did not do that.  They allowed buying to go on.  It was necessary to fill the warehouses to provide against the Emergency.  If in the light of that, the banks got tighter on credit, it is no wonder they did.  Notwithstanding that, the Dublin Corporation failed to make use of all the money made available to them and handed back to the new administration £2 million to spend on houses in Dublin, or whatever way it would.  Notwithstanding the fact that the incoming Fianna Fáil Government got £2 million back, they reduced the number of local authority houses built in the following <Col N="411" /> year by 1,300 but that was not quite enough for their destructive intentions.</P>
    <P>The axe had not been firmly enough implanted, so they cut it down by 1,600 in the following year. Notwithstanding the fact that, according to Deputy Dolan, the money was being pushed out by the Government, they brought about a reduction in the number of local authority houses of 3,000 in a year alone.  We have not yet recovered from that position.  With the exception of the year 1959-60, when it stood at 1,238 houses, there has been a steady decline in the number of local authority houses built.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is something even Deputy Dolan can pretend to boast about, no matter how much he or his colleagues may seek to boast about how easy it is to get money now. The fact is it is always easier to get 5/-than £1; it is always easier to get £5 than £100.  But I would not be stupid enough to boast about the fact that I could get a loan of 5/-.  I would not try to jeer at somebody who could not get the loan of £1.  All the figures which I have given and which have been given by the Minister for Local Government clearly establish that the Government in 1956/57 made money available but that money was not used.</P>
    <P>Let us return to this dangerous buildings situation and examine the charge that is being made that it was the unscrupulous landlords alone who brought about the tragedy of the dangerous Dublin buildings.  Dublin Corporation have for years owned an institution known as the North Dublin Union.  In recent years, they transferred the ownership of that to the Dublin Health Authority but for the purpose of this debate and the principle involved, it is clearly the responsibility of the Dublin Corporation.  Some years ago, in reply to an urgent call from the Legion of Mary, that institution was made available to provide care and a home for unmarried mothers and their babies.  Whether we like to admit it or not, that problem is with us and it is one which our society is obliged to try to answer.</P>
    <P>But one of the buildings the Dublin <Col N="412" /> Corporation had neglected to take any steps about was the North Dublin Union and we had the crying scandal of the Dublin Corporation issuing a seven-day notice to the Legion of Mary, to the unmarried mothers and their helpless children, to get out of that building because it was in such a deplorably dangerous condition.  Now, is that something which happened overnight because of the rain, wind and thunder of last June?  Did that create that situation?</P>
    <P>Some years ago, one of the voluntary helpers of the Legion of Mary was climbing the stairs of that institution when the stairs collapsed and the unfortunate girl is now crippled for life.  The only solution the Dublin Corporation could provide at that time was to say: &ldquo;Do not use that part of the building again.&rdquo;  That part of the building was sealed off and apparently it would wait until some mother and her helpless child had fallen through some floor or the like of that before the Dublin Corporation or the Department of Local Government would have lived up to their moral responsibility primarily but the statutory responsibility as well as far as legislation covering dangerous buildings is concerned.Is it any wonder a Catholic priest in Liverpool should have written a letter which some of us would have been ashamed to publish, saying that it was a crying shame that the like of that could have happened in the capital city of this country.  But it did because of the gross, total and culpable neglect of the Dublin Corporation in failing to inspect and provide alternative accommodation for the dangerous buildings of this city.</P>
    <P>No amount of verbiage and no amount of local inquiries can ever conceal the scandalous failure of the Minister for Local Government in that connection.  He knew, or should have known, there were dangerous buildings in this city.  One does not need to have statistics to know.  One has only to enter one of these buildings to find out what their condition is.  I do not mind saying I personally have had to argue with my conscience about going into some of these buildings in case I might not come out <Col N="413" /> alive and leave a widow and children unprovided for.  Many Dublin buildings were in such a condition that the floors seemed to sag when somebody trod on them and the sky could be seen through the holes in the roof.  In many of them, the doors had to be shaved and cut in order to stop them jamming.</P>
    <P>All of that was of no consequence to the Minister for Local Government or the Dublin Corporation until four people were killed.  However, I suppose out of the misfortune of the ill wind of last June some good will come because the dangerous buildings department of Dublin Corporation cannot any longer be accused of being guilty of neglect.  I do not intend unduly to criticise their activities now but I think they are going berserk altogether.  We now have the farcical situation in which the sanitary services and the dangerous buildings sections of Dublin Corporation, who have been more or less inactive for years, are now chasing one another around making contradictory orders in respect of the same premises.</P>
    <P>In more than one instance, it has been my experience that the sanitary services department has issued temporary notices requiring repairs to a building when another Corporation department had already served in respect of them dangerous building notices or <i>vice versa</i>.  It has happened in the one week that Dublin Corporation have made separate applications in the district court in respect of the one premises, one, for a sanitary services order and the other, for a dangerous buildings order.  It is quite clear there will have to be some rationalisation of the two departments, if we are not to have an already ridiculous situation become even more ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The local inquiry which was conducted, while no doubt properly conducted by a most eminent senior counsel.Mr. Condon, is hardly worthy to be called an inquiry because it was frightfully biased.  The only person or authority represented before this inquiry by learned counsel was the accused party, Dublin Corporation.  Nobody else had any senior counsel or lawyers available at that local inquiry.  The Minister can answer that had anybody sought the <Col N="414" /> assistance of counsel, he would not have been stopped.  But, after all, the unfortunate poor people who are at present housed in these dangerous buildings are unlikely to be able to pay the bill of learned counsel of the calibre of Mr. Kevin Kenny, S.C., Mr. R. McGonigal, S.C., Mr. Thomas Finlay, S.C., Mr. Bacon, B.L., and Mr. Dermot Walshe, Solicitor, Law Agent of the Dublin Corporation who all represented the Corporation.</P>
    <P>Can anybody imagine anything coming out of such an inquiry which might adequately place the blame?  They were there to ensure that this inquiry did not go outside the terms of reference, which were to consider merely the structural failure of a building at Bolton Street and three buildings at Fenian Street. But, notwithstanding the limited nature of the inquiry, Mr. Condon found himself obliged to emphasise that it had emerged from the inquiry that Dublin Corporation had never complied with Section 27 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931.  Mr. Condon says:</P>
    <P>This Section provides for inspection of its District by a Local Authority with a view to ascertaining whether any dwellinghouse therein is unfit for human habitation, and provides that for that purpose it shall be the duty of the Local Authority to comply with such regulations and to keep such records as the Minister may prescribe.  Regulations were prescribed by Statutory Rule and Order, No. 5 of 1936, The Housing (Inspection of Districts) Regulations, 1936. Regulation 6 provides for a report which will follow inspection and will deal with a number of matters, including at sub-heading (h) any defects which may tend to render the house dangerous, or injurious to the health of the inhabitants.  It is provided by Regulation 7 that a record shall be kept in the form of a book or on separate sheets or cards of the inspection of the District of the Local Authority.  No such records or books have been kept by the Dublin Corporation at any time.</P>
    <P>Therefore we have a situation in which Mr. Condon, who was appointed to make the inquiry, finds himself obliged to record that the Dublin Corporation <Col N="415" /> had failed to comply with regulations that had been made to deal with dangerous buildings.  Why have they not done it?  Because the word had gone forth from the Custom House six years ago that there was to be a slowing down on the housing programme in accordance with the Government's <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which boasted of the fact that there was to be a drift away from social investment such as housing.  The result is the failure of the Dublin Corporation to take steps to examine the housing needs of this city and to provide for them.</P>
    <P>Today I asked the Minister for Local Government if he would consider having steps taken, by legislation, if necessary, to empower Dublin Corporation to acquire, either permanently or temporarily, all vacant buildings in the city suitable for living accommodation.I regard this matter as an extremely urgent one.  The Minister pointed out in his reply that Dublin Corporation already have power to acquire buildings which are considered to be suitable for the housing of the working class.  That is a very limited statutory definition and that power is not sufficient or, if it is sufficient, there is no inclination on the part of the Minister for Local Government or Dublin Corporation or any other local authority to avail of it.</P>
    <P>One hesitates before suggesting that any extreme measures be taken in relation to control and ownership of private property but there is a crisis. If Dublin were to be bombed tomorrow in warfare and 10,000 families rendered homeless, I am quite certain that nobody would hesitate to use such powers as there are or to create such new powers as might be necessary to take over vacant buildings or insufficiently used buildings.  It is necessary to regard the housing situation in Dublin as in the nature of an emergency and to take steps accordingly.  It is only necessary to take over vacant buildings for a number of years and I would strongly urge upon the Minister that he should seriously consider an extension of the powers already there and should remove such statutory limitations as <Col N="416" /> there may be now on the definition of fitness for housing of the working class. There are many changes in the housing needs of our people since the statutory conditions were first created and if we are to tackle the problem seriously, we need to be more realistic than to rely upon legislation which does not meet the needs of the people at the present time.</P>
    <P>In an effort to create an alibi for the Corporation's inactivity, some people have been suggesting that the underlying cause of the dangerous buildings situation was that the existing laws were totally inadequate to meet the situation.  There is no need to labour the obvious answer to that.  Only 59 houses were condemned as dangerous in June; within three months, 359 houses were condemned as dangerous. In June of this year, there were some 989 families in 300 houses which were obviously dangerous and in need of demolition and replacement, but nothing was done about it until a tragedy occurred, and then it was discovered miraculously that all the powers in the existing laws were adequate to evict nearly 3,000 people in a matter of a few months.</P>
    <P>It must be quite clear that it is not a question of existing laws not being adequate but a question of the deplorable and culpable failure of the Dublin Corporation and the Department of Local Government to use such powers as were there.  I do not think any rational person can argue otherwise.If it was possible to use the powers from June to September, it was possible to use them beforehand, if there were even the least will to use them, but unfortunately that will was not there.</P>
    <P>In the course of an address to which Deputy Sherwin entertained us last week, he resorted to the minute books of the Dublin Corporation to put forward a number of arguments which pleased the Minister for Local Government or at least caused him to smile. I shall also avail of the same text books because they contain a great deal of illuminating information.  He suggested that the only concern of many councillors in 1959 and 1960 was not the need for new houses but the <Col N="417" /> large number of idle houses about which he said the ratepayers were complaining because of the fact the Corporation were obviously not getting any rent from them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin knows well that the essence of our complaint at that time was not that there were large numbers of houses which nobody would go into but that Dublin Corporation housing section was failing to re-let the houses quickly enough.  Deputy Sherwin quoted from page 270 of the minutes of Dublin Corporation in 1960.  He referred to a question of mine when I asked the City Manager to state the number of Corporation tenant houses and flats vacant for any reason whatsoever on the first day of each of the past 12 months, and the manager in reply stated that he had not got the information in such detail but that the number on the 28th of September was 117.  Then Deputy Sherwin went into an impassioned oration, saying the only thing that concerned Deputy Ryan then was that there were 117 houses vacant on one day, and suggesting that there were so many vacant houses then that the Dublin Corporation could not get people to go into them.</P>
    <P>Let us examine that thesis for a moment.  In the same year, 1960, I had occasion to address a question to the Minister for Local Government which is reported at column 1250, volume 179, of the Official Report of 3rd March, 1960.  I asked whether the Minister was aware of the long delays in the re-letting of vacant Dublin Corporation houses; and whether in view of the considerable annoyance caused by such delays to the large number of applicants for such houses and the serious loss of income to the Corporation, he would hold a public inquiry into the matter.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion there of any complaint by me that there were more houses than applicants.  There never was any suggestion on the part of any Fine Gael member of Dublin Corporation or of this House that there were too many houses lying idle to meet the demands that were being made upon them for accommodation. Our complaint then and ever since has been, although there is a great improvement <Col N="418" /> in the speed of re-letting, that there is an unduly long delay between the time a house becomes vacant and the time it is re-let.  The Minister for Local Government was not even then aware of the delays. He said:</P>
    <P>I am not aware that undue delays occur in re-letting Dublin Corporation houses which become vacant. The matter would not be appropriate for investigation by way of a public inquiry.  I am prepared to look into the facts of any case where specific evidence of unreasonable delay in re-letting may be furnished to me.</P>
    <P>I said:</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that he is probably being hoodwinked by the Housing Department of the Dublin Corporation, still, if the Minister takes a stroll through the different building estates, he will see that up to 200 houses are closed up with corrugated iron.  In many cases they have been lying idle for over two months.</P>
    <P>The Minister then said:</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept the allegation that I am being hoodwinked by the Housing Department of Dublin Corporation, and I wonder if, during his stroll through the housing estates, the Deputy actually counted 200 houses unoccupied.</P>
    <P>I had not actually counted the houses but the City Manager had given us the figure of 200 vacant houses lying idle to be re-let in connection with another matter.</P>
    <P>Some time in 1960, the council considered and unanimously accepted a motion moved by the late Councillor Miss Swanton demanding that houses be more expeditiously decorated and re-let.  That was the sole purpose of my question in 1960, to which Deputy Sherwin referred, to prove that there was undue delay on the part of the Corporation in the re-letting of vacant houses.</P>
    <P>Let us examine Deputy Sherwin's thesis that our complaint was solely as to the large number of houses.  Reported at page 62 of the same minutes of the City Council of Dublin, the City Manager told us that in March, 1960, the number of families who had <Col N="419" /> applied for housing by the Corporation was 7,362.  Are we to understand from Deputy Sherwin that his allegation is that there could not be found one family in those 7,362 families who would have accepted the houses vacant in 1961 that he so proudly boasted of in this House as an indication of the fact that the Dublin Corporation Housing Department had adequately provided for the housing needs of the people of this city?  Is there anything in this contention that the effect of all this is that of the 7,000 odd people who applied for housing, there was nobody who would take the 117 houses lying idle in 1960 and to which I had to draw the attention of the City Council?</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin then referred to the reply to another question in the same minutes which indicated that there were 625 tenants in Ballyfermot seeking transfers.  This was the estate that nobody would go to, he alleges because 625 people wanted to get out of it. But of these 625, only 326 wanted to leave Ballyfermot.  There is always, in Dublin Corporation, a large number of people seeking transfers.  This is not peculiar to Ballyfermot, as Deputy Sherwin must know, even though he does not represent Ballyfermot and I do.  In the same year, in answer to a question on page 334 of the same report, the City Manager stated that the number of tenants seeking transfer at that time was 3,293.  Having regard to the vastness of Ballyfermot, which is the largest housing estate in the city, there is nothing unusual in the fact that 326 people were seeking transfers from there when the number of people seeking transfers in the whole city was over 3,000.</P>
    <P>We are told at page 335 that the rate of applications for transfers in the city of Dublin was 185 per month.  Yet Deputy Sherwin has the audacity to try to mislead the House and to mislead the Minister for Local Government, who knows nothing of the housing problems of Dublin Corporation, into thinking that people wanted to leave Ballyfermot in 1960 to the extent that nobody would go into it.  At that time there were 7,300, families looking for houses.  I am sure that out of that number there were many more than <Col N="420" /> 117 who would gladly have accepted a house in Ballyfermot or anywhere else and would gladly have done so since.</P>
    <P>It is hard to catch up on an untruth particularly one that is published for political motives.  Deputy Sherwin made suggestions about lawyers and said that they should not be listened to here because they were so well able to present their case.  If that were the only qualification for being a lawyer, then Deputy Sherwin would be a senior counsel.  He has presented a very bad case very well here but on the figures I have quoted from the same bound volume of the minutes of Dublin City Council, every one of his arguments is shown to be completely shallow.</P>
    <P>Even if we take the Ballyfermot situation and the number of houses that were idle there, we find that at the best, or worst, as the case may be, there were more people on the waiting list for Ballyfermot alone than there were houses available there.  Even if the whole 117 houses Deputy Sherwin refers to as being lying idle were in Ballyfermot alone, there were, in 1961, 365 families awaiting accommodation in Ballyfermot about the time that Deputy Sherwin boasts there were 117 houses idle.</P>
    <P>In order to show that the picture never changed very greatly, I refer to another reply on page 353 of the 1961 minutes of the Dublin City Council in which it is stated that 6,150 families were seeking accommodation from Dublin Corporation as from December, 1961.  Deputy Sherwin, like an unskilled boxer in the ring, decided that Fine Gael were not enough to beat.  He then looked to Deputy Barron to hit and at the same time support him.  We find at page 19 of the 1959 minutes of the Dublin City Council the motion to which Deputy Sherwin referred.  It was moved by Councillor Barron and was seconded by Councillor Brady, a colleague of the Minister's, and was to the effect that the council was of the opinion that no further building by the Corporation on the perimeter sites of the city should be carried out until every available site reserved for municipal building in the centre of the city was built on.  The motion was put and an amendment was then moved by Councillor <Col N="421" /> Moore and seconded by Deputy Mrs. Lynch that the motion be referred to An Coiste Teaghlachais.  The amendment was carried and was then put as a substantive motion and was carried.  There was no division.  This was not an effort by Deputy Barron or anyone else to slow down the housing drive&mdash;far from it.</P>
    <P>The next item on the agenda, which was moved by Deputy Barron and seconded by Councillor Clarke, a Fine Gael councillor, called on the Government to bring forward the 1959 building programme.  There was no slowing down there.  It called on the Minister for Local Government to bring forward the building programme so as to give immediate employment to the building operatives &ldquo;whose present plight warrants concern of both Government and City Council&rdquo;.  The motion was put and an amendment was moved by Deputy Briscoe and seconded by Deputy N. Lemass that the Council called on An Coiste Teaghlachais to bring forward the 1959 building programme and to give immediate employment to the building operatives.  The amendment having been carried was put as a substantive motion and carried.  You had unanimity in the Dublin Corporation in 1959; they were crying out for the bringing forward of the housing programme.</P>
    <P>Just what was done?  In that year, 1959-60, when this unanimous plea was made, with the support of Deputy N. Lemass and Deputy Briscoe and others, only 460 houses were being built against 1,564 built two years before that, when the Government of that day were supposed to be falling down on the job.  However, two years later, there was complete unanimity, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour, Clann na Poblachta members in Dublin Corporation were crying out for the Government and the Housing Department of the Corporation to come to the aid of the unfortunate building labourers who could not get work, with the sequel, of course, that people could not get houses because only some 400 were being built.  How did the Department or the Housing Section of the Corporation respond to the <Col N="422" /> pleas?  There were 279 houses built the following year.</P>
    <P>Is there any shame left on the Fianna Fáil benches?  Is there any respect left for truth on the Fianna Fáil benches?  Is there any understanding of figures on their part? They have made a complete botch of the housing situation in Dublin and they have it on their consciences&mdash; that is why they shout so loudly&mdash; that there are 10,000 homeless families or families living in overcrowded conditions or in unhealthy conditions.  Do the people or the members of this House know the position?  The Chief Medical Officer in Dublin may say today of a family that the members are reeking with tuberculosis, that the house is a wet and filthy hovel, that there is every form of vermin in it, but they will not be housed out of it as long as the walls and floors and ceilings are not likely to collapse on them within 24 hours.</P>
    <P>That is the situation and I defy anyone to look up the records of the Corporation even for decades past to see if ever such a miserable situation as that existed.  Not in the worst days of foreign landlordism has there been such a situation of a local authority being neglectful of its duty.  This is because this Government said enough has been spent on social investment and the corollary was that it was more important to give money so that ships would sail the seas under any flag than our own, more important to give a facade of economic activity than to provide for the social needs of the people of this city who are urgently crying out for a very necessary item of decent human living, that is, reasonable housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is with no pleasure that we emphasise these points but we would be failing in our duty if we did not do so. Even if we are to be smeared as being the only people who want to get rid of the Government, which does not particularly upset us, we will continue to embarrass the Fianna Fáil Party and those who accepted their bidding about the housing needs in this city. The sooner the people get the opportunity to return to power a Party who will quadruple the housing output of <Col N="423" /> this city, the better and the sooner we will achieve something like a real answer to the appalling housing problems.</P>
    <P>Let us consider again just how serious the Minister for Local Government is about the building situation. We have asked him for several years past to state the housing needs of the various counties and local authorities. He told us that he started such an inquiry in 1961.  Here we are in 1963 and we do not know the end of it. We are still waiting for figures.  Figures, statistics and red tape are apparently more important and must be considered before the simple decision can be taken: &ldquo;Build houses no matter how you build them and house the people and we will provide for whatever difficulties that may create.&rdquo;  Certainly they would be minor compared with the difficulties which have been created now and for the future because of the housing situation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>If you take the 10,000 families who are accepted as being in need of housing now in Dublin, you are not at the end of it.  The Corporation do not know the extent of the dangerous building problem or of the health problem because, according to Mr. Condon, they have not even begun to carry out the inspection or the inquiry which they are obliged to carry out under law and under regulation.  They had only two inspectors up to June. Now they have 14, which is an improvement, although they are tripping one another up.  It does not suffice to say that it is the Dublin Corporation who are responsible or An Coiste Teaghlachais.  Plainly, if he has any function at all, it is the function of the Minister for Local Government to see that the local authorities do their duty.</P>
    <P>My only criticism of the previous Fine Gael Minister for Local Government is that in 1956 he did not carry out his threat to abolish the Dublin Corporation.  If he had done so, it would be clear where the responsibility lay.  Those who started the rot in 1956/57 apparently wallowed in it ever since and all they can do is boast that when we were building four times the number of houses, we sometimes found <Col N="424" /> it difficult to get the money.  If they want to quadruple the housing output, I will assure them the Fine Gael Party will not embarrass them by saying: &ldquo;You will find it difficult to get the money&rdquo;.  We would much prefer to see the houses being built.</P>
    <P>Another matter which causes me considerable disappointment is the continued failure of the Government to assist Dublin Corporation to formulate a tenant-purchase scheme. This is a very real problem.  Dublin Corporation now have over 42,000 tenants.  They are by far the biggest landlords in this city.  That is creating untold difficulties, as any member of the Dublin Corporation will tell you. The whole Housing Department has become excessively and unnecessarily costly in the maintenance angle and often fails to provide the reasonable amenities for these tenants.</P>
    <P>Some time ago Dublin Corporation considered proposals for tenant purchase schemes.  We are satisfied it is feasible only if the Government maintain the subsidies on tenant-purchase houses that are now available for tenanted houses.  Such subsidies are continued by the Government in respect of tenant-purchase houses in rural Ireland.  It baffles us why the Government will not maintain similar subsidies in city areas.  The Minister told me on one occasion that there is not the same land hunger in the city as there is in the country and that there is not the same social need in the city as there is in the country.  Anybody who makes such a statement is not aware of the pride of Dublin Corporation tenants in their houses, of their anxiety to live in their own houses and, in time, to pass them on to their families.</P>
    <P>Problems continually arise where younger members of the family want to succeed to the tenancy of their parents.  Invariably, this is refused, and for perhaps apparently fair reasons.  We believe it would be better to develop&mdash; gradually, if necessary, and area by area, if necessary&mdash;a tenant-purchase scheme.  We acknowledge that it will create unusual difficulties in the early stages.  Some people will avail of the scheme while others will not.  In the <Col N="425" /> long run, we believe it will be good and socially desirable.  It will release for future housing purposes much of the money now tied up in these houses.  On that account, I appeal to the establishment, and I am sure others will join with me in this appeal, to see their way to continue this subsidy if Dublin Corporation introduce a tenant-purchase scheme.  I cannot understand the economics which justify refusal.  Presumably it will not cost any more to continue the subsidy for tenant-purchase houses.  It should not cost any money at all that is not now being paid or that will not be paid in the future but it will mean that, sooner or later, when the houses are actually purchased by the occupants, the subsidy will cease.  Therefore, in the long run, it would appear to be of benefit to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of diesel fumes which are becoming an increasing problem.  I do not think we can lightly disregard medical research in various places into the relationship between cancer and noxious fumes in cities.  I do not want to create a scare about it but we have an increasing amount of diesel fumes in our cities and towns.  Apart from the medical aspect, it is not very pleasant.</P>
    <P>The only benefit we experienced in the transport strike earlier this year was that Dublin people were surprised to note how clear the air became. Even a street like Grafton Street, in the middle of the busy peak rush in the evenings or in the mornings, had a comparatively clear atmosphere compared with before and after the strike when buses were going down the street.  That experience is all the more surprising when we consider that there were far more mechanicallypropelled vehicles on the roads at that time.  There were far more cars.  The density of traffic was greater but the buses were not there and they are the most extensive users of diesel oil in the city.  I understand there is a law which makes it an offence to expel an excessive amount of exhaust fumes but it is not being used&mdash;certainly not against CIE who are by far the greatest offenders in this regard.</P>
    <P>I believe we do not have to go <Col N="426" /> abroad to understand our problems or to do anything about them and what I shall say now does not qualify that view which I hold.  If we go to our sister city, Belfast, we find that, with as large a bus fleet, it has not got exhausts that are so dirty.  The atmosphere of that city, which at one time was regarded as dirtier than Dublin because of the location of so much industry there, is in many respects much cleaner now than the atmosphere of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Our research work at present indicates an increasing amount of pollution in Dublin City notwithstanding the fact that a not inconsiderable number of factories are going over to cleaner forms of fuel.  The increasing pollution of the air of Dublin, created in the main by the exhausts of diesel buses, will seriously and radically have to be controlled.  The attitude must not be not to prosecute CIE because they are a State body. Certainly, they are the greatest offenders.</P>
    <P>I come now to plunge into the canal. I fear bureaucracy when it starts thinking of anything.  It is now a few years ago since a rumour leaked out that the ESB proposed to demolish the finest examples of eighteenth century architecture we have available in these islands.  At the time, there was an official denial that the matter was under consideration and there was an indication that nothing would happen without everybody being given an opportunity to express their views and exert their influence on the decision. We know what has happened since. The matter is practically a closed book now.  The deed is done.</P>
    <P>About six months ago, I asked the City Manager whether there were proposals afoot to close the Grand Canal and to sink sewers in the bottom.  We received a typical bureaucratic reply to the effect that there was no decision in the matter and that, therefore, nobody had a right to complain about it.  In that way, bureaucracy, in relation to the canal as in relation to the eighteenth century Georgian houses, tried to stifle criticism, tried to prevent those opposed to such a notion from making their views known before the <Col N="427" /> decision and the subsequent act was a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    <P>We now know that the Streets Committee of the Dublin Corporation have decided this.  How do committees decide these things?  They decide them on verbal recommendations from officials.One of the disadvantages of a committee meeting such as that of Dublin Corporation or of any other local authority is that most of those in attendance want to get the work done without being bothered by &ldquo;cranks&rdquo; who may hold other points of view, because &ldquo;the officials are always right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A reasonable alternative is available which will answer the sewerage needs of Dublin and preserve the Grand Canal as an amenity and as something to contribute to the economic welfare of this city and this State. The trouble is that this is not now being considered.  The only thing that, as I see it, will ever be approved is the closing of the Grand Canal and the sinking of sewers in the bottom of it and the subsequent filling in of it.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of this case which were not taken into consideration because nobody wanted to do so.  At present, Dublin Corporation have thousands of acres of what the town planners love to call &ldquo;open spaces&rdquo; but which I call municipal eyesores, deliberately created.  What have we had for years and what shall we continue to have in undeveloped Corporation sites and elsewhere?  These open spaces will be deliberately left and not developed as parks until the houses built around them have exhausted anything from one-quarter to one-third of their life span.  Therefore, the open spaces, which are supposed to be enjoyed by the people who are the tenants of or were born in the houses, are left there and are certainly not available until a second generation comes.</P>
    <P>What relevancy has that to the Grand Canal proposal?  It has this. Even if they can go ahead with their plan, it will have to be maintained as a public park, and nobody has bothered to say what will be the cost of railing in that public park and maintaining it.  Even a rough guess leads me to the suggestion that if one-tenth of the amount required to maintain <Col N="428" /> it as a park were now spent on keeping it reasonably clean, it would not be the eyesore it so often is at present.</P>
    <P>There is a reasonable alternative available which I would ask the Department to adopt without further delay.  Dublin needs new sewerage on the south side.  At present we have a huge housing area in Ballyfermot.  We are unable to provide urgently required industrial employment adjacent to Ballyfermot because we have not the necessary sewerage.  We are held up in potential housing expansion in south Dublin because of the lack of sewerage, and from time to time we experience flooding because of that lack of sewerage.  To meet that, a reasonable compromise is available.  I would urge it be adopted because it will mean the provision of sewerage sooner than if we were to wait for the cessation of all traffic on the canal. Secondly, it would also mean that it would be possible to provide this sewerage without the undesirable action of closing the Grand Canal. That compromise is to sink the required sewerage in the bed of the canal and then to fill the canal with water again instead of dry filling&mdash;a simple engineering act.</P>
    <P>Most Dublin &ldquo;jackeens&rdquo; like myself will have seen stretches of the canal drained from time to time.  All that is needed to drain a stretch to put down sewer pipes is to open the lock gates nearest the sea on the stretch in question.  If that is done and some excavation is done on the bed of the canal, and the accumulation of old mattresses, dead animals and muck of the last century is removed, it would be quite feasible to put down the pipes and fill it up, not with rocks, but with water.  If that is done, it will provide a much cleaner canal than we have at present.  The draught will be more than adequate for any of the boats which now use or will use the canal.  The reason I am emphasising this is that if this is not done, we are going to carry on for the next decade arguing about whether we should close the canal or not or whether we should sink the sewer pipes along some other route.  A compromise which I think <Col N="429" /> will meet most people is to put the sewers on the bed of the canal and fill it up with water.  In the process, we will be able to do something with the lock gates and so on which are sorely in need of attention.</P>
    <P>The justification for this has been set out daily in the newspapers and I shall not expand on it to any great extent.  Bord Fáilte have now invested £100,000 in the development of boating holidays on the Shannon.  Whatever one may think about Bord Fáilte or of any Government or municipal council &mdash;after all, we know they have not done the wisest things from time to time&mdash;we all know that the oil companies would not pour their money down the drain.  They are controlled by shrewd businessmen.  It is very interesting that more than one oil company in recent times has been providing free fuel for boats on the Shannon.  Why are they doing that? Because they want to get the goodwill of the boat owners and to increase the number of boats on the Shannon.  They see ahead of us the day on which the Shannon will be covered with as many boats as the Norfolk Broads at present.The banks will then be lined with petrol stations like the roads at present.They see that the development of boating holidays here, and on the Shannon in particular, is a desirable thing and almost certain to come.</P>
    <P>The solution suggested by the City Manager in Dublin is to close the canal only from Inchicore to the sea and provide a ferry service on the road for such boats as come to the North Wall or Ringsend.  I am not a boating man. I have no particular interest in this matter.  I am just looking at the logic of it and the attitude of those who have boats.  Any boating man will tell you that you cannot successfully carry a boat any long distance on the road.  If we are to tell the British holidaymaker that the only way he can bring his boat to the Shannon is that it must be swung off the ship in Dublin on to CIE trucks, then he will not come at all.  The vibration of the lorry and the handling will almost certainly do not inconsiderable damage.  People with boats regard them as things of great beauty and cherish them and they will <Col N="430" /> not have them manhandled, which must happen no matter how careful the workers are.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government in reply to a Dáil question stated he was considering the matter, with the assistance of Government Departments and other agencies. It is proper that Dublin Corporation and the Minister for Local Government should be aware of these matters.  If Dublin Corporation close the Grand Canal, they may consider they are responsible for providing the alternative transport.  Goodness only knows what that will cost.  As Deputy Sherwin knows, it is costing us a great deal to ferry people to and fro across the river. What will it cost if there is a statutory obligation on the Corporation to ferry the boats of millionaires from the North Wall or Ringsend to Inchicore? There is sufficient traffic on the roads at present without having to ferry long trailers carrying expensive boats.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the summer recess, many of us learned with much sorrow that the Minister for Local Government had allowed the ESB to go ahead with their demolition scheme in Fitzwilliam Street.  One of the difficulties in this regard is that we do not know the extent of the permission. When this matter was raised originally in Dublin Corporation, we were given to understand by the manager that nothing would be done until the matter was properly considered and everybody given an opportunity to express their views.  When the matter at last arrived in Dublin Corporation, we were told by the manager that our views were of no consequence to himself or to the Corporation because there was nothing he could do about the matter, except to make the general plan of development that was required before the rebuilding of Fitzwilliam Street in its present form would be permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the matter went to the Department of Local Government where it lay and, I believe, would still lie, if it had not been for the collapse of some <Col N="431" /> neglected buildings in other parts of Dublin last June.  Would the Minister say if the permission which he has given now is so extensive that the ESB need not come to him again?  I may be wrong but I understand at present in order even to rebuild Fitzwilliam Street with the Georgian facade, something like what can be seen at the moment, general building permission would have to be given.  Am I right in thinking that is the sole extent of the permission or does it go further?  If it does, the people of Dublin should know exactly to what extent it has gone.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of irrelevant argument has crept into this issue.  Some people who had no thoughts about the matter began to have them as soon as the Earl of Pembroke indicated his objection.  Then they said: &ldquo;What is Irish is good; what is foreign is bad and therefore Fitzwilliam Street must go.&rdquo;  I can think of no stronger evidence of poverty of thought if that is the kind of attitude that is to determine what the architectural future of this city is to be.  Those who want these houses preserved are not making the argument that they are the best example of Georgian architecture because they are not, but they are a vital part of the eighteenth century architectural facade which is unbeatable anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>While there are people who believe in preserving everything regardless of cost, I do not join them, but as a Dubliner proud of his city, I sincerely believe there is a duty on us to preserve in Dublin the best of Georgian architecture and that is only to be found in any large degree in Fitzwilliam Square, Fitzwilliam Street and Merrion Square&mdash;except that it has been partly interfered with.  I should like to see those three units alone preserved and if that were to be the price of sacrificing all else of eighteenth century architecture in this city, it would be worth while to retain these three and we would have done a good piece of work and fulfilled our obligations to future generations.</P>
    <P>There is no comparison between the <Col N="432" /> decay of dangerous buildings in some parts of the city and the present condition of ESB-occupied houses at Fitzwilliam Street where the condition is not due to decay but to the deliberate action of the ESB in tearing out the guts of these houses and using them for a purpose for which they were never intended or could even be reasonably used.  What merits serious consideration is that over the past 20 years various architects and engineers told the Board of the need to stop ripping out the interior of those houses, to stop demolishing party walls.  Over the past 30 years, even, they told the ESB, I think, of the need to do certain work to preserve these houses when it could have been done at a reasonable cost but the Board deliberately chose to ignore the advice of their own advisers.  I say that fully conscious of the fact that I am disclosing as it were some of the internal business of the ESB.  If it is any consolation to them, they will never find out how I know it. I think the Minister has an obligation to see that what is best in eighteenth century architecture is preserved.  This is not only a right but a duty to future generations.  If, as we now know is the case, the ESB have failed in their duty and have deliberately defaulted, then I believe the Minister should not facilitate the ESB in the deliberate destruction of these houses.</P>
    <P>In case anybody doubts the veracity of my remarks, I say to him: &ldquo;Look around the rest of Fitzwilliam Street, Fitzwilliam Square and Merrion Street and Merrion Square and see if you can find one building even approaching the dangerous condition and state of decay in which the ESB buildings are.&rdquo;  They will not find one there.  You may find them in Baggot Street or in some back streets nearby where the houses have grown old, due to neglect and perhaps the poverty of the owner and the fact that they were turned into tenements. You will not find any of them in the area I mentioned in the same condition as those which the ESB decided, apparently 20 years ago, to do away with because they considered there was a more convenient way of managing their affairs.</P>
    <P>We do not think that is fair or that <Col N="433" /> the Department of Local Government should let them away with it.  If the Minister lacks any statutory power to prevent this, I ask him to come to the House and take those powers so as to preserve for this city and country some of the best examples of Irish eighteenth century architecture.  It is extraordinary how some people are upset by the description of Georgian and they relate it to British kings, but the fact is that these houses were built with the sweat and labour of Irishmen at a time when Dublin was a capital city before the Act of Union and are something of which we can be proud.  These squares and streets are the result of Irish, not foreign, local government, when you had the Wide Streets Commission specifying the width of the streets. Those houses were occupied by some of the best and most patriotic Irishmen from the very time they were built. They are worth preserving and we hope no indifference or recklessness on the part of the Minister or anybody else will permit them to be demolished and taken from us.  Perhaps they must be demolished now but the facade can be rebuilt on similar lines as has been done by others.  If it can be done by others, I do not see why the ESB should get away with it.  A good deal has been done in that regard by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, Cement Limited and others with reasonable success.  There are those who would criticise it in one way or another and say it is not the same as the original but it is a reasonable compromise.</P>
    <P>Having said that, in case our words are not heard, I shall add: If the ESB are let away with this, it would be grossly unfair to oblige anybody else to make any effort to preserve eighteenth century architecture.  I say: &ldquo;For goodness sake, do not try to compromise it by erecting the design which won the ESB competition.&rdquo;  I am not reflecting on the design itself which is a very skilful one deserving every credit but why try to match new buildings with the rest of that eighteenth century architecture if everybody is to be allowed to do the same as the ESB, and, if everybody is not being allowed to do that, why are the ESB allowed to do it?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> This design which won the award was regarded as acceptable because it fits in with the rest of the eighteenth century architecture but why oblige the ESB even to try to fit in with that architecture if everybody else is to be allowed to demolish it.  If everybody else is to be obliged to adhere to their duties, then let the ESB do so also.</P>
    <P>It is quite shocking to see all the eyesores around this city and throughout the country.  There are things that horrify one.  One does not have to travel far to find them: you have the Berlin Wall in Kildare Place, and many other examples of horrible building constructions.  Who put them up?  Why, either the Government or the Dublin Corporation.  They are the greatest destroyers of all that is worthwhile in this city.  They seem to take a particular pride almost in destroying. It is quite useless to criticise them. They have a chance now to redeem themselves in relation to Fitzwilliam Street.</P>
    <P>Next I want to deal with traffic.  My first complaint is that Dublin Corporation are not sufficiently aware&mdash;indeed not aware at all, perhaps&mdash;of the need to expedite road repairs.  If one goes to Belfast, one finds that road works and road repairs in the centre of the city are done at weekends when traffic density is light.  The men of course get double or treble pay.  They work 24 hours round the clock under are lights. Here, we work a five-day week and leave the weekend as days of idleness. But it is on these days that traffic is lightest.</P>
    <P>The result of the present system is the creation of the most appalling chaos, a chaos that is costing far more than the extra we would pay the men for working 24 hours round the clock at the weekends.  The cost does not appear in the estimates of the Dublin Corporation or in the Estimates of the Department.  It is a concealed loss, but it is nevertheless a loss.  What is also causing loss and inconvenience, quite unnecessary inconvenience, is the lack of consideration shown by the Dublin Corporation in erecting detour notices. I give as an instance South Circular Road-Heytesbury Street, where work is in progress at the moment.  The <Col N="435" /> Corporation have erected signs prohibiting traffic entering Heytesbury Street from the South Circular Road, but there is no advance warning.  I have seen many motorists and heavy trucks entering Heytesbury Street. Then, in the middle of a junction controlled by traffic lights, they have either to reverse or do a U-turn in order to continue on their way to their destinations.</P>
    <P>That situation lasted for a couple of weeks.  Now it has been aggravated. The next parallel route was used by lorries and vans and cars; these drivers got used to the idea that Heytesbury Street was prohibited to them.  Last Saturday morning, there was chaos at the end of that parallel street because, without any warning whatsoever, a notice appeared saying &ldquo;No through road.&rdquo;  Motorists had proceeded the best part of a quarter of a mile from the South Circular Road before they discovered that the Dublin Corporation had blocked off that exit as well. No warning was given.  Last Saturday morning, and on many occasions since, one saw motorists and lorry drivers in a blue knot trying to find a way out or creep through some of the side streets in the area.  They were obviously swearing and using unmentionable language behind their wheels.  A little thought on the part of the Dublin Corporation would have avoided all this.</P>
    <P>All that is necessary is advance warning signs.  Apparently the Dublin Corporation, and other local authorities, too, have no regard to the need to give advance warning signs.  This is an age of movement.  All our roads are crammed with traffic.  It is bad enough when all the traffic is going in the one direction, but, when Dublin Corporation create a situation in which people simply do not know where they are going, the already aggravated situation becomes really acute.  It may well be there is need to devise some new system of advance warning signs.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department have done good work in standardising traffic signs.  I would ask them now to get down to seriously considering the need for advance warning signs and adequate detour notices when road repairs <Col N="436" /> are taking place.  I do not want to bore the House with other instances but there is one particular instance I should like to mention here.  The whole centre city is cut up with roadworks at the moment.  The justification for my criticism here is amply supported no matter what route one elects to take into the city.  Adequate detour notices are not given.</P>
    <P>One classic example is at Lower Kimmage Road.  Work is in progress there on five days of the week.  It comes to a standstill at the weekend.  The only detour notice facing people coming along Lower Kimmage Road seeking to reach one of the main crossroads in the south-west end of the city is a scruffy-looking notice stuck in a tar barrel.  It says &ldquo;Detour&rdquo;.  It is at an angle of 45 degrees almost as if one were to go down through Deputy Sherwin's subway.  Underneath that, written in yellow chalk, someone has scribbled a very poor &ldquo;KCR&rdquo;.  This is beyond the roadway one should use to make the detour.  Several people who have come up the road to visit my house have found themselves two miles away because they went along Kimmage Road to the end of Captain's Road where there is another barrier; they turned and found themselves up in the heart of Crumlin.  I am sure Deputy N. Lemass knows the location. He will appreciate how unfortunate the situation is and how pitiful it is when a little consideration and forethought on the part of officialdom would avoid it all.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need to provide what are called clearways in Britain and Northern Ireland.  That side of the road upon which the greatest volume of traffic moves is completely free of all parked cars.  On roads into the city, parking should be forbidden between the hours of 8.15 a.m. and 9.45 a.m. This would be a simple solution to our traffic problems.  It is very frustrating that the Dublin Corporation and the Department fail to take action.  In the evening time on roads leading out of the city no parking should be permitted on the lefthand side between 5 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  Instead of that, Dublin Corporation and the Department permit people to park on these <Col N="437" /> roads at a time when parking should be prohibited altogether.  Take Rathmines Road.  It is a very narrow road. Deputy N. Lemass will agree with me in this: if there is parking on both sides, there can be only two lanes of traffic.  Dublin Corporation have erected parking signs which permit parking between 8.0 a.m. and 6.30 p.m. on both sides of the road.  Parking should be prohibited here altogether on the side of the road carrying the greater flow of traffic during peak hours.</P>
    <P>On that account I would urge the Minister to bring these clearways into operation as soon as possible.They would allow double and treble lines of traffic in the right directions at the right time of day.  If it is not done soon, the present situation of single line traffic on high density roads will continue.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that investigations should be carried out by the Department of Lands in order to ascertain what areas of land and what type of land have been purchased by aliens in the last five years, with a view to introducing any controls which may be found necessary on the purchase of agricultural land in Ireland by aliens.&mdash;(Deputy Tully.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt last week with the position regarding not alone agricultural land but of all types of countryside in Ireland and with the lack of interest shown by the Government in holding on to those lands for the benefit of our native population. The argument is used by the Government against anybody like myself who protests against this sale of land to non-nationals, that this is a narrowminded, bigoted attitude and is contrary to the international outlook of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> I would say to the Minister and to his Leader that the people have become bewildered and bewitched by the fuss that is being made of the Taoiseach by bigger nations.  It is a well-known fact that if somebody in power, some wealthy individual, wants to impress an ignoramus, he wines and dines him and pats him on the back.  I do not suggest the Taoiseach is an ignoramus but I submit he is far too big for his boots, and the fact that he was allowed to look at this famous wall in Berlin has given him the idea that he is now a world leader instead of the leader of a very small country.</P>
    <P>One has begun to wonder whether his idea of Ireland is that we have as much land here as there is in the prairies of America and that we can satisfy the demands for land not only of our own people but of all the foreigners who wish to come in.  It is time an end were put to the gallop of this firm of auctioneers, which is how I would describe the Government. They have hawked the land of this country all over the world.  When a foreigner comes in here to set up a factory under our industrial development programme, why is it necessary for him to bring in five or six of his colleagues to buy land as well?  I do not think that is necessary.</P>
    <P>The grants and other incentives made available by the Government to attract industrialists should be sufficient in themselves, without also allowing those people to buy up all sporting and amenity rights as well as the best agricultural land in the country.  It has been suggested by the Minister that the 25 per cent purchase tax on land is enough to keep away those people.  However, is it not a fact that the price of agricultural land in Germany today is three times what it is here?  On that basis, is it not an attractive proposition for a German to buy Irish land and pay the 25 per cent purchase tax?</P>
    <P>Is it not also a fact that much of our undeveloped land is being sold to non-nationals, that they have been availing of our grants under the Land Project to develop those lands and that they have then been selling again to their compatriots or to other foreigners, thus <Col N="439" /> making a considerable profit?  Is it not a fact that because of these transactions, there is an insufficiency of land to meet the legitimate needs of small farmers and other poor people throughout rural Ireland?</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 17th February, 1961, carried a report of a speech made by the Minister at a Fianna Fáil comhairle ceanntar meeting in Dublin.  According to the report, the Minister pointed out that there was a minimum of 60,000 to 80,000 small farmers still trying to derive a subsistence livelihood from uneconomic holdings and that those farmers had a strong and reasonable claim for the enlargement of their holdings.  That was the Minister's view in 1961, and in the past two years, we have extracted from him figures which cannot be contradicted.</P>
    <P>According to figures given to us, 14,000 acres of land have been purchased here by non-nationals since the new land register came into operation. If we take those 14,000 acres and the Minister's estimate of 50-acre economic holdings, these 14,000 acres now in the hands of foreigners would have given economic holdings to 250 families. Which would have been the better&mdash;to let this land get into the hands of foreigners or to settle it on 250 families who would then have economic holdings?Which would be the greater benefit to the State?  Yet we have still got the small farmers pulling up their roots and clearing out of the country.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 years, I have been told on many occasions by this Minister, and by his former Leader, the present President, that the pool of land was drying up and that it would be impossible to give economic holdings to all the people in the country who should have them.  I should like to know if that situation has come about because the Land Commission were overworked in the creation of new holdings or because the Land Commission have done so little that the pool of land was allowed to get into the hands of non-nationals.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, in the past two years, 14,000 acres of good land with <Col N="440" /> which the Government could have created 250 new holdings have found their way into the hands of foreigners. Consequently, 250 families have had to get the boat.  Of course, that figure of 14,000 acres is a reduced figure by comparison with what took place since the end of the war in 1945.  I gave the figures here last week and I do not propose to trouble the House with them again, but Commissioner Mansfield, a man of the highest integrity who had been in the Land Commission for years, gave figures towards the end of 1950 to prove that more than 100,000 acres of the finest land in Ireland had passed into the hands of non-nationals between 1945 and 1950.</P>
    <P>In the period from 1950 to 1961, there is not the slightest doubt that at least a further 100,000 acres of good land were purchased by non-nationals, making, for the entire period since the war, a total of at least 200,000 acres purchased by foreigners.  If you break that figure into lots of 50 acres, it would mean that more than 4,000 families could have been given economic holdings in that period. Having considered that figure, if we then examine the number of new holdings created each year by the Land Commission, the number of people taken from the congested areas, we find that the Land Commission and the Minister are clapping themselves on the back if they take 80 people from the congested areas and give them new holdings in the midlands or elsewhere. That is their record in the creation of completely new economic holdings whereas the amount of land that is going into the hands of people who have no right to it would create, on average, 250 new holdings annually of 50 acres each.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why this Government should try to pretend any longer that they are interested in the welfare of the small farmer.  The very fact that they have suggested an increase to 50 acres in addition to allowing the foreigner complete right of purchase in this country is proof positive that they want to get rid of the small farmer and the congest, not by giving them economic holdings but by putting them on the boat for <Col N="441" /> England.  That is the answer because the Government cannot suggest that they are serious about ending congestion and creating economic holdings of 50 acres if all the good land in the country is being purchased by non-nationals and what is left is purchased by ranchers within the country.</P>
    <P>I am precluded under the terms of the motion from dealing with the second group that I have mentioned and must concentrate on the amount of land that has been allowed to pass into the hands of non-nationals.  The Minister's statement that we have to have reciprocal arrangements, due to the 1934 Aliens Act, that we must allow foreigners to have the same rights here as citizens have, is something that the public should consider very seriously.  I am trying to find out in what country similar rights are available to foreigners.  Take the six countries that are members of the EEC.  Has a German, for instance, the right to walk in and purchase any amount of land he likes in France?  Is it contained in the laws of these member States that a non-national has the same rights as a national to purchase agricultural land?  I have asked this Government and a former Government to produce evidence to that effect.  It has never been produced.  We seem to be one of the foolish little nations who say it is all right; that if the foreigner wants to come in here we will allow him because of reciprocal arrangements.</P>
    <P>If this country were as big as America, Russia or China and there was plenty of land to spare, I do not think there would be any objection at all to an influx of people who would help to develop the land but the amount of land available in Ireland is very limited.  It is not suggestive of a parochial mentality to assert that the first right to that limited pool of land is vested in the Irish people who have waited for years to get land.  I am told that we should respect the right of free sale.  I want to say that free sale of land to non-nationals makes nonsense of free sale.  I do not object to any Irishman selling his land within the State provided that that land is made available to other Irishmen.  The laws <Col N="442" /> made by the State should be for the protection of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in condemning inside this House and outside it the suggestion that a farmer should have the right to sell his land to a non-national.Apparently, the view taken by a number of people is &ldquo;Good luck to a man if he can get £20,000 or £10,000 for land from a non-national&rdquo;. My view is that that temptation should be removed; that it should not be possible to reach the stage where a man might be tempted to sell his land to a non-national.  If the sale of land to non-nationals were justifiable, could not every acre of Irish land be purchased by non-nationals?</P>
    <P>I do not think the value of land should be allowed to be inflated to a point that would harm the agricultural community in general and, therefore, in the long run, harm the country.</P>
    <P>As far as this motion is concerned, I am speaking to it because I should like to be on record and so that whatever Minister occupies the Front Bench in six weeks' time may be aware of the views expressed in this House.  Even though the present Minister is now beginning to realise that the path pursued by himself and his advisers on this question of land has been the wrong one, it is rather late in the day for him to change; he will not be in a position to do much about it after tomorrow night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that Deputies are given an opportunity once more to air their views and express their opinions on what is one of the most important problems affecting rural Ireland today. This is a matter which should engage the active attention and very serious consideration of any responsible Government and demands positive action. We have had the experience over the past number of years of large tracts of land being bought up by non-nationals. For the record, let me say that non-nationals have bought extensive tracts of Irish land, not for the love of Ireland, not because of an anxiety to engage in Irish farming, but simply for the purpose of getting all that they <Col N="443" /> possibly could get out of the land. Having achieved that object, they will possibly agree that Ireland is a very happy hunting ground for foreigners.</P>
      <P>That is most regrettable from the point of view of farmers' sons, smallholders and others who are well prepared, financed and equipped to work land.  Many of them are to be found in Britain.  It is well known that Irishmen who used to migrate to Scotland for seasonal work and then return to their homes in Ireland now tend to settle in Scotland.</P>
      <P>In relation to the purchase of Irish land by aliens, the Government have done nothing whatever to prevent what can be described as a very serious national problem, a problem to which the Minister for Lands and the Government in general have closed their eyes. I do not know if it has been referred to by any other Deputy who spoke on this motion, but the Minister for Agriculture spoke some time ago in Mullingar and the text of his speech at the time was that he was pleased there were so many non-nationals in the country setting an example to Irish farmers in relation to hard work.  It is deplorable that any Minister of State should declare in public that he welcomes non-nationals here simply because they can be put into competition with and be held up as an example to Irish farmers.  That statement has degraded and belittled our Irish farmers who probably are the best farmers in the world if they get a little encouragement and assistance and are allowed a measure of freedom.</P>
      <P>It is well known that there is no assessment whatever in the Land Commission in relation to the amount of land bought by aliens in recent years and that the statistics that are available are in no way accurate because there is no register kept in the Land Commission.</P>

That Bill was opposed by the Minister for Lands and by the Fianna Fáil Party. If it had been accepted at the time by the Government, there would be a proper assessment today of the amount <Col N="445" /> of land that was purchased by aliens in recent years.</P>

      <P>Neither he nor anybody else has a proper assessment of the urgency or the extent of this problem.  There are in every county in Ireland today foreigners buying up land and I venture to say &mdash; I am sure the Minister knows it quite well &mdash; that the amount of duty they have to pay under the Finance Act is insufficient to keep them out.  They realise that the investing of money in land is a sound investment and they look upon Ireland as probably the one place in the world where they can get what suits them, a peaceful country, an attractive countryside, and fishing and shooting facilities.  If they wanted to buy land in any part of the continent, they could not possibly obtain it as reasonably as they can get it here.  The amount of duty they have to pay is negligible and they are prepared to pay it in order to make for themselves a paradise in this country, while our own people are forced to emigrate, our small farmers forced to take conacre land and while we have a congestion problem which makes it necessary for the Government to bring in next week or the week after special legislation in the nature of a Land Bill to deal with the problem.</P>

I should like to hear from the Minister for Lands what are the actual figures by way of acreage of agricultural land that has been bought by aliens over the past 12 years.  I do not expect the Minister to answer that right away but I give him notice that I shall put down a question so that he will have an opportunity of answering it next Wednesday.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied there is no machinery in the Land Commission to give us the proper picture of the amount of land that has been purchased by aliens in recent years and that is why I want to accuse the Minister for Lands and the Government for giving this matter not alone the blind eye but the deaf ear.  Even within the past few months, quite a number of farms have been bought up by aliens, of which the Minister is well aware.</P>

      <P>On the one hand, the Land Commission are anxious to obtain land for the relief of congestion while, on the other, aliens are allowed to purchase land, thus depriving deserving Irish applicants of the right to live on the land of this country.  The Land Commission are about 100 years out of date in regard to this whole problem.  The prospect of bringing them up to date is very remote unless there is some revolutionary change and there is no sign of such a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposed bitterly to the freedom which is being allowed to aliens to buy up land in this country.  The Land Commission have stood idly by, although there was nothing to stop <Col N="447" /> them, when they saw aliens about to take over estates, from intervening, acquiring the lands and making them available for the relief of congestion. I want to assure the House that part of the land policy of Fine Gael will be to take positive action to stop the purchase of land by aliens.  Not alone will that action be taken but it will be done within 48 hours of Fine Gael Government coming into office here.  It is action which is long overdue, action which has not been taken by the Government and which has been put on the long finger by them.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have some job to convince this House about the number of farms being bought by aliens if he is to rely on the figures provided by the Finance Act.  There are many ways by which the stamp duty imposed in that Act can be evaded.  I am satisfied that the Minister has not got the proper figures to give the House and that the problem is much greater than he tells us it is.  The Minister would tell us that this is not a big problem, that these people are buying up worthless land, land and houses that nobody else would buy.  I have known them to buy some of the best land in this country.</P>
    <P>It is most regrettable that any Government should stand idly by while the alien invasion takes place.  The land is being bought up by aliens who have endless cheque books.  We are selling out to those people and I want to accuse the Fianna Fáil Party of selling out the land of this country to aliens, thereby depriving our small farmers and farmers' sons who are anxious to marry and bring up their families here of an opportunity to do so.  Rural Ireland is diminishing.  We see schools closing, homesteads disappearing and a queer type of emigration in which not only one person but whole families are on the trot out of the country.</P>
    <P>This is a great national ill and one which we can remedy only by restoring confidence in the land, by bringing back our people and by creating better conditions of life for them on the land. That is something for which the Government have now no policy, have no promise of a policy for the future and <Col N="448" /> have a bad record in the past.  This motion has been put down by the Labour Party to focus attention on one of the great national evils of our day. The failure of the Government to act in this matter is a national disgrace, is imposing hardship on our people and is causing discontent in those areas where land is being purchased by aliens.  Immediately after the general election which will take place in the next few months, this is one of the problems which will immediately be tackled by the incoming Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has covered a wide field and I am going to comment briefly on some of the statements made by the Minister.  First of all, he posed a fair question when he asked what investigation we would suggest. We would suggest that the Department of Lands be put in a position to check on all aliens who purchase land, not on all aliens who register their purchases.  These are two entirely different things.  Having investigated that, where he finds that land has been bought by aliens for the purpose of holding property and stashing away their money, whether it be ill-gotten or otherwise, the Land Commission should be empowered to take over that land and divide it.</P>
      <P>I am sure the landless men of this country have been heartened by the statement of the Minister that the Irish Government have protected their right to go out to any country in Europe and purchase property there.  Is it the suggestion that people in this country should go abroad and have a guaranteed right to purchase land in other countries while they cannot buy an acre of land here?  The only manner in which you can get land in this country now is if some relative of yours has land, dies and leaves it to you.  In the case of every farm going up for sale, there are some of these aliens around the corner waiting to rush in and buy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have misunderstood what I said.  What I did <Col N="449" /> say was that our people had the right to buy land in England or America, if they so desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not suggesting that we should insist on our right to buy land abroad so that foreigners should be free to come over here in their thousands and buy our land?  On two occasions in the debate, the Minister made reference to a member of the other House who sold land to aliens and he has also made reference to the stamp duty that has to be paid.  Was stamp duty paid on the purchase of the land to which he has referred on these two occasions? It was not.  What the Minister said could not be done has been done.  The land to which he refers has been bought by a company registered as an Irish company.  Now that he has that information, let us see what he will do with it.</P>
      <P>It is all right to come in here and make statements that this is right or that is not right.  I know what I am talking about when I tell the Minister that land is being bought in this country by foreigners and that the stamp duty on the sale is not being paid because I am aware that it is not being paid.  The only register is the register which is kept when the information is passed to the Land Commission that the stamp duty has been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be unfair and my Party are not going to be unfair about this problem but we feel very sore about it.  When the Minister states that it is not a problem which need worry anybody, or when he asks why should we worry about it, that it is only one-fifth of the land which is taken over annually by the Land Commission, does he realise what he is saying, that for every five acres the Land Commission take over to divide among Irish people, one acre is bought by somebody outside the country?  Does he realise what will happen eventually if that is allowed to continue?  I think the Minister did not go into the matter fully.  I live in an area where this is happening day after day.  If I did not take an interest in it, people, whether supporters of mine or supporters of Fianna Fáil, would soon tell me what is happening.  It is my duty to pass the <Col N="450" /> information along to the Minister and to the House and that is what I am doing this evening and what I did on the last evening.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of permission to purchase land abroad, I should like to inform the Minister that it cannot be done in Holland. I paid a compliment to the Dutch farmers who came here because they are farmers.  Nobody, even if he has the money, can buy land in Holland unless he is a farmer and can prove he is a farmer.  He must have graduated through an agricultural college or have had practical experience of farming.  Yet people can come here from the centre of Berlin, Paris, or elsewhere, and go straight into the countryside and buy a farm.  The thing that really annoys me is that then they erect a sign which says &ldquo;So-and-so stud farm&rdquo; and the Land Commission inspector dare not look across the fence at it because it is sacrosanct. Do we not know that a lot of stud farms have all the horses with horns on them?  It is just a big joke to call it a stud farm in order to prevent the Land Commission from taking action.</P>
    <P>If the Minister desires, I can give him facts and figures.  I do not propose to act as a common informer here but I have been challenged, as others have been, regarding whether or not these things are happening.  If the Minister wants information, he can have it. This matter has gone far enough and, as I said, there is one way of putting an end to it.  The Minister also referred to 5,500 acres which were bought in the west of Ireland as being worth only twopence an acre.  It is rather a pity that the Forestry Commission did not take possession of that land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It was rejected by the Forestry Division five years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been very poor, if it was rejected by the Forestry Division.  I agree that there are such places but they are very few.  The land which is bought in Meath was certainly not worth only twopence an acre.  One other thing about it is that we have been told that on record for slightly over two years, 1,155 acres in Meath alone have been bought for <Col N="451" /> over £83,000.  I do not know whether or not somebody is trying to be funny about all this but if the Minister could spare the time in one day, I could show him that acreage of land bought in County Meath without going too far from the borders of County Dublin. He would be amazed to find all the land which has been bought openly by these people.  I do not know how they are getting away with that and there seems to be no record of it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the pool of land was drying up and that it would not be possible to give everybody the portion of land he was looking for.  All my time in public life I have been claiming that the people who should get land are those who would use it, those who were born and reared on it. They are mainly the small farmer and his sons and the farm labourer who has been working all his life on the land and perhaps knows more about it than the people for whom he works. Why should the pool not dry up if in one county in two years 1,100 acres have been taken over and have passed out of the hands of the Land Commission?I think that the pool is not drying up.  Not alone land held by aliens but quite a lot of land held by so-called Irishmen could be dealt with in the same way.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to the amount of land bought or taken over before records were kept.  I cannot prove this but my information is exactly the same as his, that before records were kept, the amount of land which was being bought was very much greater, but it eased off considerably in the past two years.  I am told that because a loophole has been found, it is speeding up again.  That is why I am anxious that the Minister should use the power which he has. It would be too bad if the matter were allowed to go too far.  I am sure everybody in this House is anxious that the matter be dealt with properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason this motion was put down was to bring these matters to the notice of the House.  It has got a fairly good hearing and the Minister will agree that he has not had it all his own way when the matter was being <Col N="452" /> discussed.  The facts have been given on both sides.  The Minister's comment that most of the speeches were made for political purposes could just as well have been left out.  Personally, I do not care whether the people who read about this or hear about it are supporters of mine or not.  It is immaterial to me.  I can assure the Minister that his Party's supporters in County Meath are as anxious to have this straightened out as my supporters are and therefore the question of making political capital out of it does not arise.  The Minister has assured us that he has adequate powers and assures us that having gone into the information he has collected, such as it is, over the past two years, he can now deal with the matter.  We do not want to force the issue but if the Minister is prepared to deal with the matter, we are prepared to say: &ldquo;Go ahead and deal with it; you say you have the information and the power&rdquo;, and if it is not dealt with in the way we think it should be, well, there will be another day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, following a general increase in wages, a proportionate increase (apart from Budget increases) should be granted immediately to all those in receipt of social welfare benefits, because a general increase in wages is usually followed by a general increase in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have waited a long time to introduce this motion.  I was not certain when it <Col N="453" /> would come up until I was informed today that it might come up tonight. Naturally, when it comes up suddenly, one is not as well prepared as one would wish to be.  I should like to be able to speak until 7.30 p.m., and to speak again, but I do not think I shall be able to do so.</P>
    <P>The question of social benefits first arose in a haphazard manner.  We know that in or around 1911, old age pensions were first introduced by Lloyd George.  To do that, he had to introduce surtax.  There was much opposition to this proposal, especially by those who were asked to pay for it. It is only since then, and gradually, that we have had other benefits.  All those benefits should relate in some way to some figure.  I am taking the labourer's wage as a case in point.</P>
    <P>Let us accept that at present a labourer's wage is £10 a week.  Therefore, there ought to be a reassessment of what the various beneficiaries should get &mdash; whether the person be a single man, a young man, an old age pensioner, a widow, a dependent, and so on.  There ought to be a complete reassessment and there ought to be an improved scale, in relation to what the labourer earns to maintain a wife and family, if he happens to be married.</P>
    <P>Social beneficiaries have never received a sufficient income in relation to the cost of living and in relation to the wages paid to a labourer, that is, £10 a week at present.  Benefits are very much advanced in Britain compared to here.  We are told they have to pay for them and we know that Britain is a far wealthier country than this.  The social benefits in the North are far superior to ours.  They are similar to those obtaining in Britain and are subsidised or paid for by the British Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Within the past year or two, this Government said they aimed to increase social benefits and to bring them as near as possible to the British level.  That will depend on increased productivity and on the general economic wealth of the country.  That should be the aim: the Government say it is the aim.</P>
    <P>A Select Committee ought to be set <Col N="454" /> up to go into the whole question of what each person or couple or family ought to receive and, having established that, allowing, among other things, for the cost of living and for the age question because age has much to do with it.  For instance, if you consider that an old man should get, say, 50/- you might not consider that a young man should get that amount, because young men have ways and means of earning money.  They can go away; they can join the Army, and so on.  It is, perhaps, not a good thing to encourage a young man but, allowing for the age difference, there should be a reassessment in the light of modern standards.  It should not relate to past standards.</P>
    <P>In the past, whatever benefits were granted were granted in a begrudging manner.  I understand that when old age pensions were first paid in Britain the amount was 5/- a week.  There are many people who sympathise with this class of people but when they are asked to contribute they do not want to do so.  Prior to 1911, as we all know, old people died in the workhouse.  There was no unemployment assistance.  From our readings about the Famine period we know that starving people were housed in huge workhouses.  We know that people lived largely on potatoes and salt and that large numbers of them had to emigrate.  There was no assistance.  Even contributions to assist those in the workhouses were objected to by the big ground landlords.  In fact, some of the landlords shipped many of those people in the workhouses to America in the coffin ships.  They considered it cheaper to do so.  It is a very difficult matter when it comes to the wherewithal.  However, we have advanced since then.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the French Revolution was not commenced by any organised body but by mobs of unemployed, destitute people.  The other people took it up afterwards.  There was a complete disregard, over the ages, for the old, the destitute and the feeble.  About 50 years ago, we made a start but I am not satisfied that what they receive now is a just amount, taking into consideration the cost of living and other aspects of the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> A man who has to live on an old age pension ought to receive at least a quarter of the amount an employed manual worker earns.  We cannot encourage young people in this respect but we cannot let them starve or we should have more crime.  A new figure should be reached for all the various classes I have in mind.  Then we ought to consider how they may receive increases because they must receive increases from time to time just like wage earners.  Up to now, it has been pot luck.  It depends on the Government, on the Minister, on whether the Government are strong or weak.  Nothing is regularised and it ought to be.</P>
    <P>The fate of the people I speak for should not depend on the whims of any Government or Minister.  They ought to have the right to receive an increase in proportion either to the increased cost of living or at least wage increases. Nowadays, wage increases are general. We heard talk about the eighth round increase, and so on.  Whenever there is a round of increases, two general increases follow.  All the people who pay those increases automatically increase the cost of their goods or services.Later, the Government, being the largest employer and having to meet the same demands, increase taxation to pay their employees and all the people depending on them.  Therefore, a general increase in wages is followed immediately or thereabouts by a general increase in the cost of living.  The State will increase the cost of living because they must pay the same increases to their employees.  I would like to see all this regularised.  I do not like to see these people being treated as pawns, depending on the whim of the Minister, on the health of our finances, on whether an election is due or not.  There should be some way by which they would get an immediate increase.</P>
    <P>As time passes, we are organising in this direction.  We are now told that wages should be related to productivity and national income.  The Labour people, both here and in England, have begun to see the importance of this relationship.  Some individuals <Col N="456" /> think that the old way is the best.  It is not.  If you do not relate increases to the ability of people to pay, you can do serious harm to the very people expecting some additional support.  Consultation is now taking place to relate wage increases to these other conditions.</P>
    <P>Likewise, increases granted to those in receipt of social benefits should also be related to something.  Old age pensioners should not be made the pawn.  From time to time we have people tear jerking and seeking votes. If there was a procedure by which those in receipt of social benefits would obtain those benefits as of right, there would be no need for individuals or groups of politicians to cash in on this because it would be no longer their business.  That is the principle behind my motion.  It is up to the Minister to do something about a reassessment along the lines I have suggested.  I have a right to speak again, and I know this is a matter on which a lot of Deputies would like to express themselves.</P>
    <P>The motion on the Order Paper contains a reference &ldquo;apart from budget increases&rdquo;.  I should like to explain that.  At Budget time, a Minister may give an increase of a shilling or anything else; but if, within a few months, there is a general round of wage increases, independent of that shilling or whatever it is, a proportionate increase should be given.  I should like to hear the views of other Deputies on the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion.  I agree with Deputy Sherwin that the suggestion behind it is certainly worthy of consideration, and I feel, and my colleague, Deputy MacEoin feels, that Independent Deputies who go to the trouble of putting down a motion of this sort are at least entitled to the courtesy of having it discussed in the House.  There is something attractive about the proposal, that, if it is possible <Col N="457" /> to do so, a Government should try, when increases in the cost of living take place, at least to balance up the position of those in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>On reading Deputy Sherwin's motion &mdash;perhaps I had better not be too critical of it since I am in the position of seconding it &mdash; it seems to me he may be putting the cart before the horse in that in his motion he refers to a general increase in wages usually followed by a general increase in the cost of living.  I think our experience here over the years, and certainly in the last decade or so, is that wage increases have been sought and secured because of increases in the cost of living and in particular, because of increases in the cost of living deliberately imposed by successive Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin will recollect, as I do, that when Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1951, one of their first actions &mdash;in fact, the principal feature of their first Budget after returning to office&mdash; was to interfere with the structure of food commodities in operation at the time, and by deliberate, positive Government action the prices of essential commodities were increased.  The recipients of social welfare benefits, and, indeed, workers generally, found it more expensive to live.  As a result, wage demands were made and granted. There was another general election which put Fianna Fáil out of office, and a period of stability followed; but on the return of Fianna Fáil to office in 1957, the then Fianna Fáil Government, again in their first Budget, swept away the remainder of the food subsidies, with a saving of about £9 million to the Exchequer.  But the result, as far as the workers and the recipients of social welfare benefits were concerned, was that, again by deliberate, positive Government action, the cost of living was increased.  The cost of food and clothing, the essentials of life was increased on these people and consequently and naturally they sought compensatory benefits. The workers sought increased wages and secured them and the recipients of social benefits had to be compensated to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something attractive in the <Col N="458" /> idea behind this motion.  I disagree with Deputy Sherwin in that in his motion he seems to attribute cost of living increases solely to increased wages; I think our experience over the years is that they were principally due to deliberate actions of Fianna Fáil Governments.  In any event, when the increases occur, the weaker sections of the community, those who can least bear the strain, and those who nowadays, once food subsidies have been removed, have no buffer against increased prices, are clearly those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  The only person who can deal with that situation, can remedy it in any way, is obviously the giver of the social benefits, the State.  If anything can be done to balance up increases in the cost of living, particularly when those increases are caused by State action, the remedying measures obviously must also be taken by the State.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the consequences of this motion would be in regard to legislation and I should like to hear the views of the Minister for Social Welfare on it.  As Deputy Sherwin rightly pointed out, it is one thing to have the cost of living going up and then have the Minister for Social Welfare, as the Government's spokesman in the matter, announcing some small compensatory benefit to these people.  Frequently, our experience is that in almost all cases the benefits given by way of compensation for price increases do not, in fact, compensate the recipients at all.  With the increases that have taken place in the cost of living over the years, I think I am not inaccurate, certainly not grossly inaccurate, in saying that since virtually the foundation of the State, there has been no real increase as compared with present day prices in the value of the benefits to recipients of social welfare allowances.</P>
    <P>We are now in a situation, in discussing this motion, in which the Government by recent budgetary provisions have caused a situation where, again by deliberate positive action on their part, there is to be an increase in the cost of living and where, on their own admission, something like £13.5 million is to be collected by a turnover <Col N="459" /> tax.  On the statement of the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech, it is clear that threequarters of that sum is to be collected from the basic essentials of life, food, fuel and clothing.</P>
    <P>It is equally clear that the people for whom Deputy Sherwin speaks in this motion will contribute very largely to the revenue to be gained by the Government from the turnover tax.  I do not want to be taken as endeavouring to conceal it or put a gloss on anything: it is true that the Government are making compensatory payments because of the increases they are bringing about but I have no doubt that these compensatory payments will, in fact, not compensate the people for the losses incurred by reason of the 2½ per cent tax.</P>
    <P>That is exactly the kind of problem Deputy Sherwin is dealing with in this motion: that it should not be the case of the Government cracking down on the food, fuel and clothing of the people and other basic essentials through their financial policy and then doling them out some kind of sop to try to soften the blow.  The case he is making is that for the future we shall get away from that and have some kind of automatic arrangement whereby if wages are increased to offset a cost of living increase, social welfare benefits should be automatically increased.</P>
    <P>I do not know what machinery would be necessary to bring that about. I do not pretend to know the full extent of the problems that might be created for the Minister for Social Welfare or the Minister for Finance in implementing such an arrangement. We must get that kind of information from the Minister and the Government.It may well be that such a suggestion would not be feasible.  It is for the Minister to let us know but this motion is worth discussing and the idea is worth considering and I should like to have the Minister's views on it.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I support this motion and I hope when the Minister speaks on it he will not term Deputy Sherwin's <Col N="460" /> action irresponsible.  Ministerial pronouncements in the past few weeks have usually described statements on national policy or otherwise by members of Parties other than Fianna Fáil as irresponsible if the policy advocated is not in accord with Fianna Fáil policy.  I hope Deputy Sherwin's action will not come to be so described when the Minister speaks.  Having regard to the present situation, I have no doubt the Deputy will be spared that ordeal, as I am sure the Minister will be very cautious in approaching a motion proposed by a man who carries such great weight as Deputy Sherwin does at present.</P>
      <P>We must bear in mind that since Fianna Fáil took office in 1957, taxation has increased more than 50 per cent, without taking into account the tax which comes into operation next Friday, the turnover tax and which has been the subject of many discussions in the past few months.  We know that will increase the taxation level sharply, and it is not unreasonable to assume that it will result in netting £16 or £17 million and not just the £10 or £11 million the Minister for Finance told us about some months ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has made great play with the many advances which Fianna Fáil have made in increasing social welfare benefits. Let us see what the present position is.  The non-contributory old age pensioner today gets 32/6 weekly. When old age pensions were first introduced by the British Government away back in 1908, the rate of pension was 5/- per week.  Because of the decline in money values, that 5/- bought just as much, I am convinced, 50 years ago as does the present non-contributory 32/6.  For old age pensioners, who have no other income, the standard of living has not improved over the past 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a great extent, the same could be said of all the other benefits. Undoubtedly, social welfare recipients &mdash;old age pensioners, widows, and those unfortunate enough not to be able to obtain employment and who have to go to the employment exchange for unemployment assistance &mdash; have found great difficulties over the past <Col N="461" /> years because of the declining value of money and rising costs, rising costs for which the present Government are to a great extent responsible.  I think it would be helpful to them if the suggestions in a motion such as this were to find their way into the Statute Book.  Like Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, I believe there will be no great difficulty in drafting the legislation necessary to implement Deputy Sherwin's motion. As I interpret it, he asks that where there is a wage increase, and where the cost of living increases, or prices increase, there should be a proportionate increase in the allowances paid by the Department of Social Welfare. I need not dwell further on this matter, other than to say the Labour Party support the proposal and hope the House will approve Deputy Sherwin's motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of this motion demonstrates clearly that Deputy Sherwin has been in this House only during the period in office of Fianna Fáil Governments.  The motion implies that increases in social welfare benefits come almost automatically with every Budget.  During the period in which Deputy Sherwin has been in this House, it is true that there has been this continuous process of improving social welfare benefits.  Other Deputies, however, who have been longer in this House realise that that process has been anything but continuous.  During the period of the two Coalition Governments &mdash; the alternative Government to Fianna Fáil &mdash; these payments remained practically static.  It has not, therefore, been the normal thing for increases to come with every Budget, except under Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The giving of an increase involves a decision by the Government to do something to improve social welfare payments.  That decision involves complementary action by the Minister for Finance to that taken by the Minister for Social Welfare.  It also involves a decision by Dáil Éireann to enable the Minister for Finance to provide the necessary moneys.  These two separate actions have always to be taken in deciding to grant increases in social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> Deputy Sherwin is anxious that there should be some automatic method to make increases available. That would involve, of course, some automatic arrangement by which the increased money needed would also be made available.  We have made it clear that we intend, so far as it is possible, to balance our Budgets, to see that expenditure is covered by revenue.  While we appreciate that there may be a temporary worsening of the position on occasion for social welfare recipients, we, in Fianna Fáil, still stand by the principle that it is our duty to the people to make arrangements for the collecting of the necessary money before we allocate more money.  During the period in office of the two Coalition Governments, we have seen the result of Government cynically refraining from making these necessary arrangements. The tax arrangements made in the last Budget are a step forward, but only a step.  It is still necessary to make a positive decision in regard to the steps to be taken to provide money for social welfare increases.</P>
    <P>It is not necessarily a result of wage increases that there should be also an increase in the cost of living.  That has not always been the experience.  It is true that wage increases that are not justified by increases in productivity will be likely to have that effect, but, where the wage increases are accompanied or preceded by a commensurate gain in productivity, there need not be a proportionate effect on the cost of living.  In the last years for which information is available, the round of wage increases in 1959 and early 1960, it is interesting to note that weekly earnings in manufacturing industry rose by five per cent in 1959 and by seven per cent in 1960, while the consumer price index actually dropped by 1½ per cent in 1959 and increased by less than three per cent in 1960.  It is clear, therefore, that what was happening in that case was not, as Deputy O'Higgins tried to convey, a question of the workers chasing increases in the cost of living but rather of the workers benefiting from the increased prosperity that resulted from the change of Government in 1957.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are taking a number of motions with this Estimate and the principal item under discussion seems to be housing, always a prominent subject in a debate of this nature. We on this side of the House claim that the collapse of the housing programme in Dublin city resulted from the Coalition Government's mishandling of the situation, mainly in 1956. Deputies opposite, by referring to the production of new houses in 1956 and 1957, try to show this is not correct and that instant houses can be provided at the will of the Government. This contradicts Deputy Dillon who quite frankly admitted in the House that from the time a development scheme is proposed until it is completed a number of years must elapse.</P>
      <P>I should like now to take a look at some of the matters published in the newspapers in 1956 and show that not only did Deputy Briscoe and I accuse the Government then and still accuse the administration of that day for the situation from which we are suffering even now, but several other members of the Dublin City Council also did. Several of these reports quote statements made by me and I propose to read them now, since I was one of those attacked most regularly by Fine Gael in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On page 4 of the <i>Irish Press</i> for 7th November, 1956, I was reported as making reference to the then Minister who had made a statement to the effect that the money for the completion of the SDA scheme was in fact <Col N="464" /> there but that the Corporation, and particularly Deputy Briscoe and I, were sabotaging the scheme by not spending this money.  What I said then, as reported accurately in the paper, was that if moneys which were available for activities in progress under the housing of the working class Acts were transferred to the SDA loans, it would result in the complete disruption of Corporation contracts, that it would lead to the laying-off of men on the direct labour schemes, that all further site development would have to be abandoned, that the final assault on the slums and their replacement by decent flats would be held up and that it would take years to recover the position.</P>
    <P>Time has proved how right I was. In the <i>Irish Press</i> of 13th November, 1956, a letter appeared, following a conference in the City Hall, Dublin, repudiating statements made by the Minister for Local Government, particularly in relation to SDA loans, and pointing out that the Corporation needed an unqualified assurance that £2,800,000 would be forthcoming in cash in the next 12 months to deal with SDA cases alone.  Councillor Denis Larkin, the Chairman of the Housing Committee, is quoted as having said:</P>
    <P>The Corporation could not be expected to enter into contracts binding themselves to an ultimate expenditure of £6 million without some assurance that the money would be made available.</P>
    <P>That was the opinion of the Labour Party Chairman of the Dublin Housing Committee at that time.</P>
    <P>On 13th November, 1956, a report appeared on page 3 of the <i>Irish Press</i> referring to the schemes then held up as being: completion of schemes in progress, £465,700; direct labour, £137,700; contract schemes at Finglas East, £20,600, and at Walkinstown, £32,200; other schemes in the programme, £1,386,750; site development works, £330,914; supplementary grants, £100,000; repair grants, £80,000; acquisition, £100,000; miscellaneous, £50,000, making a total capital expenditure of £2,700,864 which, in <Col N="465" /> addition to the £500,000 already spent on SDA schemes and the moneys required for the North Dublin drainage scheme, would completely liquidate the £4 million which was to be made available to the Corporation in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>That was the situation in 1956.  In 1957-58, we were to be given money already spent by the Corporation.  In fact, the money came after the complete disruption of the building programme.The £180,000 for the repair and acquisition grants that should have been made available at that time might have saved the lives that Deputy Ryan was so concerned about here today. That is the root of the problem.</P>
    <P>Again, I refer to the pages of the <i>Irish Press</i> for 14th November, 1956. The then Minister for Local Government, Deputy O'Donnell, said the Government had guaranteed sufficient money, but I on that occasion, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the date mentioned, pointed out that at a meeting of the Dublin City Council on 10th August of that year, it was reported to the Housing Committee by the City Manager that unless an additional £500,000 were found for the 1956-57 period, it would be necessary to reduce the direct labour schemes in progress from £278,200 to £130,000, to abandon Finglas East schemes to the amount of £61,000, to abandon Walkinstown direct labour schemes of £42,800, and to abandon other schemes to a total of £69,000.  I also pointed out it would be necessary to reduce site development from £158,000 to £154,500, to eliminate anticipated expenditure of £26,000 on repair grants, effecting a complete saving of £441,600.  The Corporation bankers agreed to advance the £500,000 which meant the money allocated by the Government would have been spent by the time the Corporation got it.</P>
    <P>These facts are not taken from statements by the City Manager alone but from statements by Councillor Denis Larkin and other public representatives.I should mention that bodies such as the Dublin Council of Trade Unions were also interested.  On 14th November, 1956, the Dublin Council of Trade Unions passed a resolution which urged:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> that the congress should act in conjunction with the Provisional United Organisation of the trade union movement and concern themselves with the easing of the credit squeeze which, together with the import levy, has caused widespread unemployment.</P>
    <P>In October of that year, the bulletin of the Federation of Builders, Contractors and Allied Employers stated:</P>
    <P>Housing schemes, hospitals, schools, public works of every kind, were axed last September with an abruptness which left the whole building and civil engineering industry well-nigh stricken.</P>
    <P>Mr. Seán MacBride, a former Deputy, and a man whose vote was keeping in the Government of that day, lecturing in O'Connell Hall was reported on 9th November, 1956, page 4, <i>Irish Press</i>, as saying the savage credit squeeze on top of the levies had been disastrous, but he still, as I say, continued to support the Government for some months after that.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the best-known trade union leaders to speak out at that time, the Secretary to the Irish Congress of Unions, Mr. Leo Crawford, said as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i>, page 4, 4th December, 1956:</P>
    <P>Recently, representatives of the building unions had found that plans were being held up on flimsy excuses and that tenders had been lying in the Department for four months while workers were fleeing the country.</P>
    <P>On page 11 of the same paper, Mr. Denis Larkin, Chairman of the Housing Committee, Labour Deputy supporting the Government at that time, pointed out that approval for building houses in Bluebell took four months; that previously such approval would have only taken two weeks.  He also pointed out that approval of the development at Gloucester Place took six months.  He said &mdash; I quote:</P>
    <P>The Finglas No. 2 scheme had been lying there for almost six months&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, in the Department of Local Government&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" />&mdash;and regarding St. Anne's area, the Corporation spent time making report after report.</P>
    <P>What it boils down to is the fact that there was such delay in sanction coming to the Corporation that the Corporation found it could not complete its target.</P>
    <P>The Provisional United Trade Union Organisation is reported also in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 14th December, 1956. I quote &mdash; this is from a resolution which they passed:</P>
    <P>We further demand that all the administrative factors delaying local authority housing and other schemes be urgently reviewed and the necessary steps taken to eliminate delays at all levels.</P>
    <P>On 19th November, 1956, page 6, <i>Irish Press</i>, Mr. P.J. Tobin, in an address on behalf of the Engineers Association, is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>Because of the &ldquo;credit squeeze&rdquo; the building industry is experiencing such a slump as had not been known for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>Surely, it is clear that it was not only Deputy Briscoe and I who exposed this situation to the people of the country?  Are all these people the saboteurs that Deputy Briscoe and I are supposed to be?  These are reputable people from trade unions and trade organisations.  If Fine Gael think they are saboteurs, let them say so.</P>
    <P>Over and over again, Deputy Dillon, Deputy Sweetman and Deputy O'Donnell in particular have refused to admit the facts.  They are trying to mislead the public as to what exactly was the situation in 1956/57 as they are now doing in relation to the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>In volume 192, column 947, Deputy Dillon is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>...I hope we have seen the last for my time in Dáil Éireann of the shameless, unscrupulous, heartless fraud perpetrated by Deputy Noel Lemass and Deputy Briscoe in the Dublin Corporation when they refused the people of this city the <Col N="468" /> money to build their homes, not because there was any scarcity but because they wanted to purchase votes by falsehood from a deceived and frustrated electorate...</P>
    <P>Do these remarks apply to Mr. Leo Crawford, to the leaders of the engineering, trade union and builders' associations, to Mr. MacBride and Mr. Larkin, former Deputies?  I do not know.  If they apply to Deputy Briscoe and to me, they must apply to the others.</P>
    <P>In reply to that statement, in column 955 of the same volume, I said:</P>
    <P>...not so long ago in this House I read copies of the letters that passed between the then Government and the City Manager.  What the letters prove conclusively is that the then Government had to make funds available to Dublin Corporation from the Local Loans Fund because the Bank of Ireland refused to accept their guarantee as sound collateral.  That is the situation that existed in 1956-57.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, not to be outdone, in columns 968 and 969, comes back in the same tone:</P>
    <P>The other matter I want to mention is this and it is typical of the reckless irresponsibility of an individual like Deputy Noel Lemass. Can you conceive of a Fianna Fáil Deputy who was Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation, getting up in Dáil Éireann and saying that in 1957 the Government bankers, the Bank of Ireland, refused to accept the guarantee of the Irish Government for a loan for the Dublin Corporation?The statement, of course, is without a shadow of foundation; there is not a scintilla of truth in it.</P>
    <P>For some reason, when I proved that what I said was true and absolutely true, from corporation documents and letters that transpired at the time, the Press, that is, the Press in general, being more impressed apparently by Deputy Dillon's flow of oratory, failed to lay particular stress on the proven fact.  I believe it is the kernel of the <Col N="469" /> whole point that not only did the bankers believe that the Government was bad collateral, the same thing applied to private business as well, as I will go on to show, as I have shown here before, but still Deputy Dillon comes back with these outbursts which are completely contrary to the situation at that time.</P>
    <P>I will repeat some of the remarks which appeared in volume 195 of 8th May, 1962, column 356.  I had referred to a report of the minutes of the Municipal Council for the city of Dublin, 1956.  I said:</P>
    <P>It is a letter from the City Manager to the Lord Mayor, Alderman and Councillors, and is dated June 11th, 1956:</P>
    <P>On April 16th the City Council were informed of a letter from An Taoiseach regarding the financing of the Corporation capital works for 1956/57 which indicated that if the Corporation were unable to raise the full £3,000,000 required, the Government would make good the deficiency by advances from public funds.  In the light of An Taoiseach's letter, An Coiste Airgeadais authorised me (the City Manager) to communicate with the Bank of Ireland with a view to securing overdraft accommodation from the bank for capital purposes pending the availability of money guaranteed by the Government.  The Bank on the 7th instant, stated that they</P>
    <P>&mdash; that is the 7th June &mdash;</P>
    <P>were not in a position to assist the Corporation in financing its capital requirements.</P>
    <P>Irresponsible statements?  Was the City Manager irresponsible in sending a report to the Council?  If there is any irresponsible statement, it is when the Leader of the Opposition gets carried away with his own fluency and forgets what he is talking about, which is quite regularly.  We got the money eventually by the sale of Government securities.</P>
    <P>When I said that before, Deputy Sweetman said I was talking nonsense. So, in that regard, I should like to quote Deputy Sweetman.  Deputy <Col N="470" /> Sweetman, as reported on 30th November, 1956, in the <i>Irish Press</i>, said:</P>
    <P>The public capital expenditure programme on its present scale was not being sustained by voluntary savings of the public, even as supplemented by the proceeds of special import levies.  The deficiency had had to be made good by the sales of sterling investments by the Government and the banking system sales which had reduced these to a low level.</P>
    <P>In spite of these sales Fianna Fáil had to pay other bills which were outstanding when we took over office in 1957.  As I say, the housing programme collapsed in these circumstances.It has not fully recovered yet but in the last year or two it is showing great signs of recovery.</P>
    <P>In order to overcome the embarrassing position in which the then Government found themselves, a new, what shall I call it, panic measure, was introduced.  A circular No. H.12/56, H.263/1/1 dated June 29th, 1956, from the Department of Local Government to Dublin Corporation in relation to guarantee schemes for advances by building societies for private housing says:</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to refer to the Department's circular letter H.10/56 of the 9th June, 1956, and to state that arrangements have been agreed with the principal building societies on the basis of a scheme for guarantees in relation to advances for private housing.  The guarantee will operate only in relation to advances for the erection or purchase of new dwelling houses owner-occupied.</P>
    <P>At column 285, volume 195, of the Official Report of the 3rd May, 1962, Deputy Sweetman is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>I shall tell the Deputy what the circumstances were.  The circumstances were that Deputy Noel Lemass and Deputy Briscoe were clamouring all over the country that there was no money to be got.  The facts were that in those years they were getting over £1,500,000 more <Col N="471" /> money than they were given by Deputy Dr. Ryan.  Deputy Noel Lemass and Deputy Briscoe deliberately went out on a campaign to prevent people erecting their own houses under the Small Dwellings Acts.</P>
    <P>However, as I have said in contradiction of that statement by Deputy Sweetman, it was necessary to sell our securities, our collateral for external trade, in order to pay for some of the bills that were incurred.  It is all right for Fine Gael to go out with beautiful handbills: &ldquo;Fine Gael for lower taxes and better times.&rdquo;  As it turned out we got neither lower taxes nor better times. It may be alleged our taxes are a little higher now but they are certainly better times.</P>
    <P>In earlier remarks I have nailed the lie to the wall for all to see.  The complete disregard for the truth of the situation over the years is enough to make me at least a little vexed. Regardless of what documentation we can place before the House we get the same thing over again.  I have nailed Deputy Dillon's lie and Deputy Sweetman's lie &mdash; outside the House a lie; untruth in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw the word &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo;.  I refer to an untruth which was published in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 6th November, 1956, page 5, column 4.  Deputy O'Donnell is reported as saying that a number of loans had been approved under the housing guarantee scheme by building societies.  Inspired by that I wrote to all the registered building societies: the Provident Building Society, the Irish Civil Service Permanent Building Society, the Educational Building Society, the Irish Industrial Benefit Building Society, the Working Man's Benefit Building Society, the Metropolitan Building Society, the Irish Civil Service Building Society, the Ireland Benefit Building Society, the City and Provincial Building Society, the Guinness Permanent Building Society. Not only was there no loan guarantee up to 6th December, not to mind the 6th November when the statement was made by Deputy O'Donnell, but it was indicated that no building society was prepared to work a scheme on the guarantee of recovery from anybody who failed to pay.  They say you need neck to get into politics; I think you only need neck to get into Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>I wish to quote from a speech made by the then Deputy Larkin in 1957. Not only does he give his opinion about the housing situation but he makes it quite clear that in his opinion the then Minister did not know anything about his Department at all.  The Chairman of the Housing Committee, then Deputy Larkin, did not think much of the Minister although his vote helped to put him back in office.  The Government had already changed when the then Deputy Larkin said, as reported at column 1009, volume 161, of the Official Report of the 8th May, 1957:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It surprises me that a former Minister for Local Government who would normally be expected to have some real knowledge of the position <Col N="473" /> could, when speaking on the Estimate of his successor, refer with some disparagement to the fact that Corporation building has extended too far out from the city centre.</P>
    <P>That was the opinion of Deputy Larkin about the former Minister for Local Government in the Government whose method of handling the finances brought about the difficulties the worst of which we are feeling today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin has explained what has happened since then.  Personally I believe that Councillor Larkin was over-conservative, as were the majority of the members of the Corporation, in his approach to housing matters.  I advocated in 1957 that whether or not there was then a demand for houses in Dublin, site development and the condemnation of old buildings should be proceeded with at a much greater speed.  I proposed that a tall block of buildings should be erected in the Dominic Street area with lifts and with small flatlets for old people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to a motion before the Corporation in 1959 which was proposed by Deputy Barron and seconded by Deputy Brady to the effect that building on the perimeter of the city should cease until such time as all the available city building sites had been built on.  I supported Deputy Brady on that occasion and, if I remember correctly, he described Dublin as an apple rotten at the core. Dublin city was, and is to a certain extent, sweet and clean on the outside but rotten at the core.  Even the ESB buildings about which Deputy Ryan is so concerned are subsiding into the ground.  I agreed with that resolution and I argue now that if it had been proceeded with at that time by the Corporation, the crisis we are experiencing today would not have come about.  I accuse in particular Councillor Larkin who, as Chairman of the Housing Committee, probably had the most influence, of being too conservative in his approach.  He was probably afraid that he would find himself in a financial position similar to that in which he found himself in 1956 and was afraid to take any chances.</P>
    <P>Another resolution proposed by <Col N="474" /> Deputy Briscoe and seconded by me said that the housing programme of the Corporation was in the first instance, a matter for the Corporation and in the second instance, for the Minister.  If the Minister was not approving of the Corporation's schemes or was holding up the money for them, there would be some purpose in the motion before us now.  If the money was being held up by the Department of Local Government, then there would be some cause for complaint but that has not happened. There has been no hold up of money for housing since Fianna Fáil came into office.  That first Fianna Fáil Budget was not an easy Budget but it did put the country back on its feet.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has brought many Bills before this House and on every piece of legislation that has come from his Department, he has had full consultation with the interested bodies.  On the occasion of the recent Town Planning Bill, he read his Second Stage speech and then agreed to an adjournment for some weeks in order to allow local authorities and other interested bodies to consider the implications of the measure. He sent experts to the various local authorities to explain the provisions of the Bill and came back to the House with many amendments.  Every piece of legislation that has been brought in by the present Minister has been brought in, not on political grounds, but with the maximum amount of co-operation he could obtain from the various interested people.</P>
    <P>We all agree that more and better dwellings, more convenient dwellings and more communal facilities are greatly desirable.  In this regard there was a report in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> of the 21st September, 1963, on building in America.  Some of the statements in that report are applicable to this country.  Some of the recommendations have been adopted here but one matter to which I would like to refer is the opposition there to prefabricated construction from various trade union bodies.  Perhaps the members of the unions were afraid that a lower labour content would be required for the erection of prefabricated <Col N="475" /> houses.  However, it is a fact that for every 100 skilled building workers we can bring back here we can put 400 labourers to work.  Building work is being held up here for lack of skilled workers.</P>
    <P>Pre-fabrication has been agreed to in certain cases such as school building.Dublin Corporation have bought caravans for one unit families.  I was critical of this at the beginning but I have now come to the view that it may be the better arrangement.  When the crisis is over these caravans will be easily disposed of while the prefabricated buildings might be more difficult to get rid of.</P>
    <P>This is the quotation from the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> to which I would like to draw attention:</P>
    <P>Many union leaders block the introduction of modern performance codes because they fear loss of jobs. Yet they probably would be better off.  Craft unions in St. Louis&mdash; together with certain suppliers and contractors &mdash; fought a bitter seven-year battle to stave off a new performance code.  The new code was finally pushed through in 1961, and local construction costs have since come down 16 per cent, setting off a building boom which has given union members more work than ever.</P>
    <P>My argument is that if we can cut down the cost of small dwellings by the adoption of performance codes, more people will be able to buy them and thereby relieve the pressure on the Corporation to some extent and create more employment in the building industry as a whole.  I believe from statements by the Minister that some of these matters may already have been taken care of.  But in the new Housing Bill, due in 1964, deposits for SDA houses must be reduced to a minimum and red tape and legal fees must also be cut down to the minimum.I have no doubt that the Minister, who has solved many problems pertaining to his Department, will seriously consider these matters and incorporate them in whatever legislation may be necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> I believe that all the available sites in Dublin city, including the controversial site at Sutton, will have been built on by the end of the decade and a problem will arise.  Assuming that the present <i>Programme For Economic Expansion</i> continues at the rate indicated in the White Paper, and that we have a growing population and a growing demand for houses, what are we going to do when that programme has been completed and all the building sites have been built on?  This is a problem that also deserves great consideration.  I am in favour of the single house to the family.  I prefer to see young children being brought up in housing development as distinct from flat development.  In certain flat developments social difficulties can arise.  Social officers have been appointed by the Corporation and are doing great work in dealing with these problems but in view of the land available to the Corporation they must have a new look at the building of a tall block.  In the minutes of the Special Meeting held by the Dublin City Council on the 21st September, 1959 at 7 p.m. on page 211, there is a letter to Mr. Hanly, Housing Architect's Department, Mountjoy Square, re: Dominick Street &mdash; Tower Block &mdash; Contract 1B, which states:</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>I confirm having submitted proposals to reduce the cost of the plan at the above.</P>
    <P>I just want to read the relevant portion which says:</P>
    <P>On this basis, it will be seen that the building cost per flat, whether one-roomed, two-roomed or three-roomed will be only about £100 per flat dearer than at Gardiner Street (the exact figures to be computed in consultation with the City Quantity Surveyor).</P>
    <P>It was estimated that the tall block would cost £100 per flat more than the existing type of structure.  The Corporation Housing Committee did recommend that we should seek tenders for this tall block and with the desire not to hold up any other development it was decided to tender <Col N="477" /> separately for the traditional block and separately for the tall block.  A contractor who submitted tenders for that scheme told me that if he could quote for the entire scheme, that is for the traditional block along with the tall block, he would be able to quote a so much lower figure that he would reduce the cost per room in the tall block by £200.</P>
    <P>The time has come to re-examine this question of high buildings.  I believe the Dominick Street plan was a good one because it provided mainly for old people.  It was up to the Corporation to control that type of development because if there were young families there there could be difficulties and even tragedies through the children playing with the automatic lifts. I would prefer to see an old person going up 16 or 20 storeys in a lift than to see them living in a caravan on the boundaries of my constituency.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge only one housing proposal was sent back to the Corporation for reconsideration.  Perhaps I should not mention this now but to my mind the Minister's officials apparently considered that the Corporation had made a wrong decision. Almost immediately, and almost without consultation, they resubmitted their original suggestion and it was then adopted by the Minister.  The result was that the flats which were to be available last Easter are not yet available.I will query that situation when the final costs are available, which I suppose will be in about six or eight months' time.</P>
    <P>Getting away from housing, which is only one of the items which come up under this Department, I should like to read two letters.  I am not sure whether this matter has already been dealt with in the new Planning Act which we hope to see fully in operation very soon.  One of them is from the Minister to me and it is dated 2nd September, 1958, and he informs me:</P>
    <P>I have received your letter of the 15th instant.  A local authority has power under Section 11 (1) (d) of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, to sell or lease houses on land acquired by the authority.  It is assumed that &ldquo;house&rdquo; includes a residential shop.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> The Dublin Corporation took the opposite view.  They said it was not possible to sell a shop assuming that there was a dwelling overhead.  That is a matter which would require to be thought out by the Attorney General as distinct from the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>On behalf of people I represent, apart from my constituents, that is, members of various commercial travellers' organisations, I should like to say that we have been somewhat disappointed with the Joint Committee on Electoral Law.  We still find that 4,000 or perhaps 5,000 travellers will be unable to vote on polling days if they are held in midweek.  They have also disagreed in their report with the National Holiday.  I should like serious thought to be given to this problem because provision is made for men in the Army, and so on, to exercise the franchise, but a commercial traveller based in Dublin who is working anywhere except around the city area cannot vote because it would interfere with his firm's work.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the opposition which always arises when it is proposed to by-pass a village or town with a new main road.  Local agitators to my mind should bear one thing in mind.  When an industrialist plans to set up a new factory, one of his first considerations is the availability of the nearest port.  For instance, one of the present controversies is in relation to the proposed by-pass of Swords.  Swords has a few factories.  I am sorry if I am treading on the toes of the Minister for Social Welfare and Deputy Burke regarding Swords.  However, it has some factories.But the traffic on the road to Dublin port is rapidly growing and slowing down.  This means an increase in the cost of bringing in raw materials and in exporting finished goods.</P>
    <P>By having a fast highway between Swords and Dublin port, that town will have a far better chance of attracting industrialists to the area and, in the long run, the traders and local inhabitants will prosper to a much greater extent.  The first to realise this fact were the Romans.  They nearly conquered the world by their conception of road conveyance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> In this regard, I should like again to support Deputy Sherwin.  We must have a bridge or tunnel east of Butt Bridge, let it be a tariff bridge or tunnel.  I am sure it will pay for itself. Experience in other countries has shown that such development can be made to pay for itself.  I was in the office of an oil company official not so long ago.  He showed me a map and pointed to the cost of transporting oil from the petrol depot at Alexandra Road to Ringsend.  This is a matter of national importance and it might be undertaken on a national basis as distinct from a local basis.</P>
    <P>I would urge also the further extension of one-way streets to speed the flow of traffic.  The most obvious are the two sides of the quays which should be made one-way.  Discussions should be entered into between the Department of Local Government, the Corporation and the trade unions with a view to getting some agreement regarding centre city street repairs.  In Belfast, I find that such repairs on main roads are done between 7 and 12 p.m.; each shift completes the resurfacing of one section of the road.  I would advocate something like that as distinct from Deputy Ryan's advocacy that the workers work on the Sabbath.</P>
    <P>With regard to road safety, the first thing we should do is to teach the drivers how to drive.  The sooner we have tests the better.  Most accidents are caused by bad driving.  According to the statistics made available to us, particularly during the various debates on Intoxicating Liqour Bills, drink plays a much lesser part in accidents than one would imagine from reading the public press.  Furthermore, speed plays a lesser part in accidents than we might be led to believe in the press.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the main cause of accidents is bad driving.  One of the things in bad driving which is in my opinion the greatest cause of accidents is too fast overtaking.  On drunken driving blood tests, there are one or two aspects on which I should like to comment.  I take it that these blood tests will be taken at the local police station.  I should like adequate <Col N="480" /> assurances, assuming these regulations are brought into force, that there will be proper sterilisation of the needles and that full hygienic and safe means are used for taking these blood samples.  I have a fear that the normal practices in hospitals for such a test may not obtain to the same degree of care and safety in the police stations.</P>
    <P>There is only one true test, that is, a reflex test such as has to be passed by British police car drivers.  I do not know whether the same test is applied here.  The driver is put into a dummy motor car and is given the controls.  A road comes towards him. Somebody runs out.  A cat jumps up. A car appears at a corner, and so on. The reflexes and reactions of the driver are recorded with a view to discovering if he is capable of passing the test. If it were practicable to get such equipment into most of our police stations, I believe it would be a most effective test.</P>
    <P>If I sleep a little later in the morning and then just have a cup of coffee and work through the day without lunch and tea and then take a quota of four and a half small ones and drink them back, within a very few minutes, I should be incapable of driving. However, if I eat all through the day and have one or two small ones while waiting for a big meal in the evening and, after that meal, take four drinks they will not render me or Deputy O'Donnell or many others incapable of driving.  Therefore, it is important that we should get a reliable reflex test.</P>
    <P>I know that reflex tests are carried out now but I should be glad if we could get more reliable reflex tests. Then, when a policeman goes into court with his prosecution, he will be on much sounder grounds than he would otherwise be, even adopting the report which has been laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    <P>Some of the parking laws are extremely silly.  One in particular is that you are allowed to park on the public street for six hours at night.  I understand you must either have your parking lights on or, alternatively, you must park within a certain distance of a street light.  These hours at night <Col N="481" /> create an impossible situation. Workers' real earnings have gone up. Many people living in what can be described as tenements or poorer flat type dwellings in the city have no garage and park their car on the street. If they leave it there for one minute over six hours at night, they may be fined 10/- on the spot &mdash; and that fine, seven days a week, would be a bit heavy, to put it mildly, on the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Consider the position of people who stay in many of the better class hotels in the city which have no garages. For instance, how many cars are parked outside hotels which are within walking distance of this assembly for over six hours at night?  I have the regulations but I have not yet interpreted them all.  I understand this law is still in force but it should be repealed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Regarding other parking regulations, they are constantly under review and are subject to revision after a reasonable period of time.  I should like also to make a point to the traders in Dublin City who consider they are losing trade through lack of parking facilities.  This is a general complaint throughout the country.  Only one local authority, so far as I know, examined the situation objectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They found that 60 per cent of the cars parked in the streets belonged to the traders themselves, the traders being too lazy to park their cars elsewhere and to walk a few hundred yards.  In Dublin, once you pass Parnell Square, you have no difficulty in parking your car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear from my reading of the new Local Government (Town and Regional) Planning Act, 1962, regarding the surfacing of laneways.  Can any laneway the Corporation wish to surface now be surfaced or must it still be a through lane or a lane of public utility?  I should like clarification on this.  I understand Deputy Timmons was considering putting down a question.If he has done so and has received an answer, I shall be talking to him later.  Some lanes are in a very <Col N="482" /> sorry state.  I have one particular lane in mind.  I sought counsel's opinion as to whether an injunction might be sought against the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or the Corporation.This was a lane left in reasonably good condition by the builder. Subsequently, a Posts and Telegraphs cable was run through it.  The Corporation were charged with resurfacing it again.  The local inhabitants claimed it was not resurfaced as well as it had been before the Department went in.  After various investigations, we found this was supposed to be the Corporation's responsibility.</P>
    <P>The residents were not very worried at that time because every laneway within a two-mile radius was being cemented by the public works department.That continued until such time as this question about public utility or through lanes arose.  The particular lane to which I am referring was a deadend.  Unless it is put into proper condition, the Corporation cannot take it in charge, and unless it is in charge, the Corporation cannot enter upon it. I believe some aspects of this were dealt with in the 1962 Act.  I have gone through it but I have not been able to find the reference.  Perhaps we will get some information on it.</P>
    <P>I do not want this to be considered a hardy annual.  However, I should like to read an extract from a debate in the British House of Parliament during the debate on the Second Stage of the Nelson Pillar (Dublin) Bill on February 13th, 1891, when a speaker quoted from a book called <i>History of Dublin</i>, which may be of interest here.  As is well known, I am one of the advocates of getting the Pillar out of the middle of O'Connell Street.  The quotation is as follows:</P>
    <P>The design of this triumphal column was given by William Wilkins, Architect, Fellow of Caius College, Cambridge.  It is of the most ponderous proportions which is not relieved by the least decoration. Its vast unsightly pedestal is nothing better than a quarry of cut stone, and the clumsy shaft is divested of either base or what can properly be called a capital.  Yet, with all this baldness and deformity, it might <Col N="483" /> have had a good effect when viewed at a distance, or placed anywhere else, but it not only obtrudes its blemishes on every passenger, but actually spoils and blocks up our finest street, and literally darkens the two other streets opposite to it which, though spacious enough, look like lanes.  There were objections to this site at first, but they are now become still stronger since the building of the new post office close to it, for, by contrast, it in a great measure, destroys the effect of one of the largest and finest porticoes in Europe.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I should like to mention that a Bill was passed in 1882 which incorporated a company called the &ldquo;Moore Street Market and North Dublin City Improvement Company&rdquo; and this company has power to take down and recreate Nelson Pillar on another site and then hand it over to the Board of Works for maintenance. I should like the Minister to investigate whether he has power to take over this company and then to do the necessary with this monstrosity in the middle of the city.</P>

      <P>Next I want to deal with the matter coming under the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce but relating directly to Dublin Corporation.  I wish to quote from the minutes of a monthly meeting of the Dublin City Council held in the Council Chamber, City Hall, Cork Hill, on Monday, 6th July, 1959, at 7 p.m.  I am quoting from page 181, item 193, a letter numbered 7192/1959 from the Public Health Department, dated 26th June, 1959, to V. G. O'Brien, Esqr., Assistant Principal Officer, Finance Department, regarding student laboratory technicians. This letter states:</P>
      <P>At the meeting of the City Council on 2nd March, 1959, the following motion was referred to An Coiste Sláinte concerning the recruitment of the above-mentioned employees:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> That we, the members of the Dublin City Council, recommend to the City Manager that the positions of student laboratory technicians (chemical) in the City Laboratory should not be a closed trade, and that all persons wishing to compete should not be denied the opportunity if they are not related to former Corporation or present Corporation employees.</P>
    <P>An Coiste Sláinte considered the matter at their meeting on 10th March and decided to ask the City Manager to report on the feasibility of implementing the terms of the Resolution.  The matter was considered in your Department and a report was made by the Principal Officer on 16th June to the following effect:</P>
    <P>The conditions relating to the recruitment of boys in the Corporation service are based on an agreement of long standing with the Irish Municipal Employees' Trade Union.  There are in all 50 boys employed, of whom 3 are Student Laboratory Technicians.With the exception of these three the recruitment of boys is confined to sons of deceased employees.  In the case of the three Student Laboratory Technicians these are selected from sons of employees, deceased employees, and sons of pensioned employees.  If any change were proposed at this stage it would mean re-opening with the Union the whole question of the conditions attaching to the recruitment of boys and undoubtedly this would lead to the re-opening of other matters which are at present deemed to be settled.  It is not considered that the time is opportune to raise the question of any such revision but the views expressed in the resolution can be noted in the event of the revision of conditions coming up for consideration in the future.</P>
    <P>The City Manager on 16th June approved this report for submission to An Coiste Sláinte, and the matter accordingly came before the meeting <Col N="485" /> of that Committee on the same day. Having discussed the Report, they made the following Order:</P>
    <P>Do not recommend any change in present policy or recruitment.</P>
    <P>The time has come to consider this matter quite seriously and to reopen negotiations with the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I wish to reply to a few points raised by Deputy Ryan, who represents the same constituency as I represent.I have already referred to his remarks regarding Fitzwilliam Street and the intention of the ESB to build proper accommodation for their employees there.  I suggest Deputy Ryan go along, look at these houses and see that they are subsiding in their foundations.  I would then ask him to go down to O'Connell Street and have a look at Sean MacDermott Street, look at this wonderful eighteenth century architecture, and then come and honestly say that this is of great value to our city or that these buildings are an asset to the tenants in them.  I know the conditions prevailing at that time made it opportune to preserve these houses as they have been preserved.  But let Deputy Ryan have a look at them; let him go into them.  They cost £1,000 per room to preserve.  Let him then reconsider what he is saying about the offices of the ESB.  I agree with him in regard to Merrion Square, but in regard to the Fitzwilliam Street offices, there is only one sensible thing to do &mdash; demolish them and rebuild.</P>
    <P>The only complaint I have to make against the ESB is that they do not pay full rates although they enter into commercial competition with traders. This is to be deplored.  If they are going to do genuine retail trade, then Dublin Corporation should extract the full rateable valuation from them.  On the other hand, where their offices and showrooms are concerned, the arrangements existing at the moment are good but I understand they are opening shops throughout the country and I understand all these shops have special concessions concerning rates.  Whatever people may say about State enterprise interfering with private enterprise, I should not worry, provided the <Col N="486" /> two forms of enterprise have equal rights and are equal in every other respect.</P>
    <P>The only thing that I agree with in what Deputy Ryan said is that there is certain overlapping in the sanitary services department and the dangerous buildings department of Dublin Corporation.That is inevitable and until such time as new offices, which I hope to see in my lifetime, are provided, this type of overlapping is bound to occur because the Corporation offices are too widely distributed to have efficient management.</P>
    <P>I dealt also with the point he made when he quoted Deputy Sweetman and when he explained that Deputy Sweetman was building up reserves while in fact he was selling serurities. In regard to the canals, Deputy Ryan said that they were full of dead animals, fifth and muck and yet he wants them preserved and cleaned up and said that the Board of Works or Bord Fáilte or somebody would take them over.  I am a sailing man and I saw the centre keel being laid for the first of the Shannon cruisers that were to be built at Dún Laoghaire.  At least two of them were accepted.  I do not think the second one was paid for and the boat builder concerned as a result of getting into this new booming industry went into voluntary liquidation&mdash; I believe it was voluntary.  I attended a regatta at Hadson Bay and one boat came down by the canal.  I know why. They wanted to get their picture in the paper and that is the only reason. They knew they would not win any races.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, a sentence in a letter from me that appeared in the <i>Evening Press</i> last night is slightly wrongly phrased.  It would seem I am saying that my constituents are a danger to the health and safety of the community but it is the canals I am referring to.  Once a year Dublin Corporation present medals for bravery and I should say that half of these go to people who dived into the canals to save children from drowning.  Unfortunately, they are not all saved.  In the last two years, to my knowledge, three people have been killed as a result of the hump on Harold's Cross Bridge. I also get complaints, as I am sure <Col N="487" /> Deputy Ryan does since he represents the same constituency, that rats coming from the canal are getting into artisans' dwellings at Harold's Cross or Corporation dwellings further up. I think there was a scare some years ago about Weil's disease which it was thought had arisen from infestation by rats from the canals.  That was when they were being really used.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Shannon will develop as a good boating centre but I submit that it does not need the Grand Canal to succeed.  The Minister has been very patient in listening to the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>This token supplementary Estimate is mainly concerned with housing, but before dealing with that, would it be in order to suggest that the Minister should have a chat with the Minister for Transport and Power so that the railways would not be torn up thus putting further transport on the roads?  Would he also have a word with the Minister for Justice about speed?  The great mistake made was that there was not a maximum speed.  There should be a maximum speed of 60 m.p.h. because our roads are not fit for higher speeds as I think rural Deputies will agree.  There should also be a law about dimming lights. Many accidents occur at night because people will not dim, and blind an oncoming driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good to be here as a member of Dublin Corporation since 1950, and to listen to people condemning the Corporation, people who are not members and people who although members are not regular attenders.  I suppose you will always have that while a person in public life is anxious to have his name <Col N="488" /> in the paper and have his constituents read it and think that he is a great fellow although what he says at a public meeting or in the Dáil may be of no consequence or quite irrelevant.</P>
    <P>There is a motion here and an amending motion in regard to housing and particularly housing in Dublin city and county.  Not being a representative of Dublin county, I do not know much of what is happening there but from what I hear from members not only of Dublin County Council but from members of other councils, there is no doubt that there is a shortage of housing.  There is a shortage of housing in Dublin but we can explain that in a moment.  The position in Dublin city is altogether different.  I say without fear of contradiction that no city in Europe has done as much to house its citizens as has Dublin in conjunction with different Governments in the past 30 years.  One would imagine that nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, when four-fifths of the work was finished, this regrettable emergency occurred.  The first of the houses that fell, fell because the houses at either side were taken away.  Some blame may be attached to the Corporation because they did not send inspectors there to see that the house left standing was in a safe condition.  Otherwise no blame attaches to the Corporation, or to any members of the Corporation, in connection with that.  That emergency followed on the deaths of two people in Bolton Street and two children in Fenian Street, children who were in a shop buying sweets and who were told to clear off.  Unfortunately, they went the wrong way while the people who told them to clear off went the other way and escaped.</P>
    <P>There is an emergency in Dublin at present.  It has been caused by returning emigrants, by early marriage on the part of our young people, by people from the rural areas coming up to Dublin to find work.  Our inspectors will not take chances, and they are quite right not to do so.  We find ourselves in the position then that we are not able to house all those whom we would wish to house.  Dublin Corporation have not painted a false picture.  That has been stated here.  That is not so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> The motion mentioned a decline in house building.  There was a decline. In 1956, we built 1,341 houses and flats; in 1957, 1,564; in 1958, 1,567; in 1959, 460; in 1960, 505 and in 1961 279.  In 1962 we built 612 and, this year, between flats and houses we have 1,400 in course of construction, not to mention areas in which flats will be constructed in the future.</P>
    <P>In the financial year 1957-58, we had 1,294 vacancies because of people either dying or going to England.  In 1958-59, we had 1,393 vacancies.  We had that number of houses or flats to house our people.  In 1959-60, we had 1,605 vacancies; in 1960-61, we had 1,260 vacancies.  Adding those vacancies to the houses and flats built gives an interesting result.  In 1957-58, there were 1,294 vacancies; we built 1,564 new dwellings, which represents roughly 2,800 dwellings for our people. In 1958-59, we had 1,393 vacancies; we built 1,567 dwellings.  That gives a total of nearly 3,000 dwellings for our people.  In 1959-60, we had a grand total of 1,605 vacancies, and adding those to the 460 dwellings built in 1959, you have 2,000 dwellings for our people.</P>
    <P>Why was there a drop in house building and flat building in the city of Dublin?  Why did our people object to going out on the fringe of the city? So great was the objection that I tabled a motion asking that we suspend building on the fringe and concentrate on flats in the city.  One of the main objections to going out was the prohibitive bus fares.  There are hundreds of examples I could give; I shall quote just one.  There is a man living in Ballyfermot who works where I live now; bus fares cost him 17/- a week. When tenants went out, they were back in the following week because of bus fares.  I endorse every word Deputy Sherwin has said in that regard.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that building be suspended on the fringe was not accepted.  The decision was to keep on building on the fringe and, at the same time, build as many flats as possible. I made a suggestion &mdash; Deputy Sherwin will bear me out in this &mdash; that the Corporation should buy up large houses and put the prospective tenants <Col N="490" /> into them until flats were ready. Nothing was done about that suggestion.</P>
    <P>Let no one tell me Dublin Corporation were negligent about house building.In face of the vacancies, how could they be?  These vacancies came about because of the position in Britain. That position lasted for a year or two. As everyone knows, Governments spend a great deal of money before an election in order to be elected again. That is what happened in Britain.  Our nationals who went over there were able to earn from £20 to £40 a week. That situation continued for three or four years.</P>
    <P>I leave it to sensible people to assess the position.  We concentrated on flats in the city.  Flats take longer to build than do ordinary houses.  The area has to be cleared.  There is always the person who tries to get the most out of the Corporation for his property. Time is taken up completing plans. The drawings have to be sent to the Department of Local Government.  If they are all right, they are approved.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is because the Minister has not sufficient staff, but there have been considerable delays in our flat building programme from the time the drawings are sent for approval to the time they come back.  I would refer specifically to a scheme of flats for Charlemont Street.  Drawings which had been sent to the Department early in April did not come back until six months later and carried suggestions for alterations in regard to car parks and other matters.  The position is that by the time the bills of quantities have been drawn up and the scheme advertised, it will be another six months.  Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that from the time the Corporation approve a scheme until the occupants move in, a period of at least three years elapses.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the Corporation are not to blame for these delays.  A motion on the Order Paper suggests abolishing the Housing Committee.  Earlier this century, people in central Europe tried to abolish bodies of this type and they wound up by being abolished themselves.In every administrative area in the country, the manager is responsible <Col N="491" /> for housing commitments but the housing committees consider proposals and make representations.  People who suggest abolishing these committees do not know anything about the situation. We heard a Deputy talk of the people who attend these committee meetings and who do nothing at all otherwise. Let me say that they attend these meeting in their own time and at their own expense in the interests of the citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not want to mention names, and the Minister may be aware of this himself, but the principal officer in charge of housing in the city of Dublin has made a vocation of his job.  Not only is he interested in housing but he has also been responsible for getting small industries going to help the people in the fringe areas of Dublin.  As Deputy Sherwin has said &mdash; and he should know since he attends practically every meeting of the Housing Committee &mdash; we in Dublin Corporation have now nearly got back to the position we were in.  I should like here to mention the question of the caravans and to make it quite clear that we have adopted their use entirely as a temporary measure.</P>
    <P>If Dublin Corporation are to be blamed at all in the matter of housing, it is because of their efforts on behalf of the larger, the younger and growing families.  They have tried to house these first and perhaps they may be blamed for not having taken care earlier of a bigger percentage of the smaller families.  Perhaps they could be blamed for not building earlier more one-room and two-room flats for the older people.  The Minister and his officials should be able to decide whether we were correct in that.  I would repeat that our decision to provide caravans was purely as a temporary expedient for the relief of the older people who had been living in dangerous buildings.</P>
    <P>Deputies have spoken about the building of skyscraper blocks of flats with 13 or 14 storeys.  They may be suitable across the water or in France but if families, with eight or nine children flocking around after them, were to be housed in such conditions, the death toll would, I fear, be much greater than that of the roads at the present time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> Apart from building houses directly for the people, Dublin Corporation have also been making it possible for people to build their own houses. They have been giving supplementary grants of 50 per cent of what the Government provide and now they are prepared to give grants equal to those provided by the Department &mdash; the entire £275 under certain conditions. They also give repair grants and loans to people who would otherwise be unable to get such facilities from building societies or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word in passing about the density regulations in regard to local authority house building in the city of Dublin.  I submit the density should be greater.  If it were, many more people could be housed. When our proposals to build houses in the city perimeter were being discussed, we had to consider the position in the city after the people had moved into those houses.  Shopkeepers lost their clients; schools lost their attendances; and the churches had dwindling congregations.  They were all points we had to consider and that is why I have been an advocate of building more flats in the city.</P>
    <P>I think the blame for the present delay in the provision of more flats in the city lies with the Department who favour larger blocks of flats whereas the Housing Committee favour smaller blocks.  There are several condemned buildings in the city which, if demolished and cleared, would provide ideal sites for smaller blocks of flats.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, the Corporation had a direct labour scheme.  Under that scheme, we got a better house built than we got from any contractor. The first group of houses built under that scheme were cheaper by about £10 to £14 a house but after that they were a little dearer.  Nevertheless, the direct labour scheme should never have been abolished.  I do not know who was responsible for its abolition. The case was made that the Corporation would get a cheaper house from a contractor.  That may be the case but they do not get as good a house.  The house built by direct labour does not cost as much for maintenance.  The maintenance of the Corporation's <Col N="493" /> housing estate of 42,000 flats and houses amounts to £750,000 annually. I believe that had the Corporation a direct labour scheme, the tenders for the houses we are building now would not be so high.  Some people have influence.  The Corporation had to abandon the direct labour scheme and it would be a very useful thing if we had it now.</P>
    <P>I have made it pretty plain that even though there is a shortage of housing in Dublin, the Corporation of Dublin are not to blame for it.  The reason for the small number of houses being built for two or three years was the vacancy rate as a result of people leaving to go to England where they could earn three or four times what they could earn in this city.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the question of house purchase.  The Corporation had a purchase scheme in respect of St. Anne's estate.  It transpired that the Corporation could not get tenants for some of the houses.  If a person produced a certificate to the effect that he was getting married within a month, he would get a house.  The reason is that the houses are too far out from the centre of the city.  The Corporation abandoned the purchase scheme.  They are prepared to give loans and grants but they have had too much trouble with the purchase scheme.  They found that people would not avail of it because they did not want to go so far out.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest that where houses are condemned, the Corporation should have power to take them over, demolish them and build a block of flats on the site.  In that way, more people could be housed in the city area.  It would also mean that small sites would not be left derelict for years, pending acquisition of surrounding sites.  The Minister should consider giving the Corporation that power and advising the Assistant City Manager and the Council accordingly.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the canals.  I have listened to such references <i>ad nauseam</i>.  The Corporation have no power in relation to the closing of the canals.  Plans were drawn up for the improvement of Leeson Street Bridge but nothing has been done.  The Corporation officials did <Col N="494" /> not know what was going to happen in relation to the canal.  I hope the canals will not be closed.  CIE were not satisfied until they got the canals.  The canals were able to pay a small dividend when owned by the canal company but CIE diverted the traffic formerly carried on the canals to the road and the canals are not paying.  The canals can provide a beautiful vista.  I hope the Minister will not allow his officials to destroy it.  At present, of course, the canal is choked with weeds and rubbish dumped in it.  The canals could be used to develop tourism and I hope the Minister will not be a party to having them closed.  The Corporation have no power to close them. Unless legislation is passed to close them, they cannot be closed.</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult at this stage to understand how anybody can justify such designations as &ldquo;Minister for Local Government&rdquo; and &ldquo;Department of Local Government&rdquo; because there is no such thing as local government in this country. Local government ended when the managerial system came into operation and since then we have had a whole set-up of little puppet dictators, little small gods, who rule counties, corporations, urban councils and the other types of local organisations which had existed up to that time.  As far as local representatives are concerned, they have no standing, good, bad or indifferent.Everybody knows that.  The only position they fill is to receive all the mud which can be slung, to fix the rates, and to accept all blame for anything which goes wrong.  Local bodies have practically no power and that is a most unfortunate state of affairs.  It happens to be the case.  I am not blaming the present Minister for it.  He had nothing to do with the setting up of this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an impertinence to introduce in this House a Vote for Local Government when there is no such thing as local government in this country and has not been for years.  The ordinary people have no say at all in the running of local affairs, unless there is a weak county manager or some other weak officials on whom pressure can be brought to bear.  There is the central Government which dictates, <Col N="495" /> and has for years been dictating, the way in which everything must be carried out.  In my opinion, that is wrong and the Minister for Local Government, as an ordinary countryman himself, should look into this matter and give back to the local authorities some semblance of the powers they had.  When they had these powers, people got on very well without any dictation from Dublin.</P>
    <P>This pseudo-motion has been put down by the Fine Gael Party who hold the copyright for all types of fakes and jokes which have operated in this country since 1922.  It is a rich joke. They are attempting to climb on the Labour bandwagon.  The only difference between the two Parties is the question as to which of them is the more conservative and which of them is running after the Unionists of the North the faster.  It appears to be Fine Gael because they have more or less decided to link up with them.  They appear to want to welcome in these people although they are afraid to go to meet them in case they might have rotten eggs thrown at them.  Against such a background nobody could take this motion seriously.</P>
    <P>Let us go back to 1932.  Is there anybody in the House who remembers 1932?  As far as I see, with one or two exceptions, all the people who are here are older than I am.  Everybody remembers the type of houses that existed in 1932.  The more odious predecessors of Fine Gael, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, spent their time telling the people they had spent all the money they collected in this country on building bridges which the people who were out against them, and rightly so, had knocked down.  Incidentally, all these bridges had to be knocked down since and rebuilt because they were erected so badly.  There was not a house built in this country up to 1932 and my friend, Deputy Calleary from North Mayo, will confirm that. Certainly there were no houses built in my county.  It was after 1932 when there was a change of Government that the houses were built.  The houses were built by the Fianna Fáil Government and let us not be fooling ourselves about that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> There is also the famous Fine Gael architecture.  Anything that was built by the British, such as Nelson Pillar and the famous Fitzwilliam Street building which the ESB want demolished, they want to preserve. Anything the British built should be knocked down as far as it can be if the last big storm did not knock it down.  I make no apology to any Irishman for saying that.  We are now our own bosses and it is time we showed them we are not afraid to take down the buildings they put up with the blood of Irishmen.</P>
    <P>It is very popular to attack a Minister.  There is more to be gained by attacking a Minister than by attacking, say, a county secretary. Whether you get more popularity or not for it, you certainly get more publicity.  I should like to ask what has the Minister to do with the fact that there is a scarcity of houses in County Mayo or anywhere else? Does that scarcity not arise purely and simply because the local bureaucrats are completely and entirely irresponsible?  I remember in 1956 that 600 houses were vacant in one area of Dublin.  It is absurd to build houses when there are three times as many houses as are required.  In 1956, a grant could not be got for a house.  As a public representative on that occasion, I could not go out into the streets because I would be eaten alive.  Everybody was after me: why is my grant not paid?  I could not pay it out of my own pocket even if I were a very rich man.  However, when there was a change of Government in 1957, they were all paid.</P>
    <P>It is because people went to England in 1955 and 1956 that houses are not available today.  It takes years and years to right such a situation.  Plans have been made for the building of houses.  It could not be anticipated that people would be rushing back to this country.  There was a man from my own part of the country who came to Dublin a fortnight ago with the intention of going to England.  He went into a public house and met somebody there who, on finding out that he was going to England to get a building job, told him there was no need for him to go to England, that he would <Col N="497" /> get a job here.  That man earned £75 in a fortnight and has been guaranteed work for ten years to come.  How much work would he have got in 1956? Not as much as sixpence worth.</P>
    <P>In my county, there is a scarcity of houses.  The Minister for Local Government is not responsible for that. The bureaucrats must be made to understand that not only do the people want houses but that they are able to pay for them.  The Minister ought to make the county managers, the county secretaries and the county engineers &ldquo;buck up&rdquo;.  It is true that grants are available for houses, but what about the sites?  It often costs as much to buy a site as it does to go half-way in building a house.</P>
    <P>The Minister has brought out regulations aimed at trying to clear up derelict sites and to make them available for some good purpose.  What has happened?  How many applications has he got from my county for grants in relation to derelict sites?  We have not got five applications in my county for grants under that scheme.  If the local authorities acted in accordance with the powers they now have, these sites would be taken over and could be made available to people for building houses at a low cost.  That would save the local authorities much expense in the long run.  They do not do this and surely the Minister must be aware of it.  He must see the joke in all this. They have the powers; they can get the grants, acquire the sites and make them available to me or anybody else to build a house.  We usually build good houses, better than were built under the British regime, houses that will have a high valuation with consequent high rates and that would be a big asset to the county.</P>
    <P>What do the local authorities do? Nothing at all.  They ignore the fact that they have these powers.  They let people pay £300 or £400 for a site, as many people have to do.  That is a shame and a disgrace and I urge the Minister to do something about it.</P>
    <P>There is another important point.  In any county where we have a high emigration rate, as we have had since the Famine years, you are bound to have a considerable number of old people.  Some of them have wives <Col N="498" /> and some have not because they never had enough money to go looking for a woman.  There are only one or two of them in the house, but yet if they want to get a grant, they must have a big house.  People such as these do not want a big house, they want a small house.  It is important that they should get a grant for a small house.  While the Land Commission are not the most progressive body in the country, they have seen through this joke and they have come to the point where they will allow a man to build a small house.  The Department of Local Government should do the same.  The Minister should take steps to ensure that instead of building five-roomed houses, local authorities should be able to build a two-roomed house and hand it over at a reasonable cost to the type of person who wants it.</P>
    <P>We live up in the clouds, up in the air, and the sooner we come down to earth in these matters the better because if we do not, the day will come when we will be brought down to earth.  There is also the question of the man looking for a housing loan who might be earning £50 a week.  Yet if a mortgage is wanted on a local authority house, he possibly will not get it because a stupid Act was passed in 1936 which stipulates that it is illegal to have a second mortgage on a local authority house.  Some of these houses were built in 1916 and there is only about £5 outstanding on them now.  Yet if a man wants to raise a loan to purchase the goodwill of that house, he cannot get a mortgage on it.</P>
    <P>Surely that is ridiculous.  The value of house property is going up and nobody should worry about this matter so long as a man is entitled to a house and to a site.  In my county, if you want to get a loan for a house, you would want to start when you are going to school if you intend to get the loan at 21 years of age.  You have officials and you switch them round. By the time one man is trained, he goes to a softer job.  He will not go to a harder one.  The next fellow who comes does not know what it is all about and there is writing to the first fellow to get the particulars.  By the time it finally ends up, the fellow who started to look for the loan is in <Col N="499" /> England.  The whole position is fantastic and ridiculous and the Minister should do something about it because it is a shame that it should happen.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of water and sewerage schemes.  The Minister has brought in a great many new regulations in regard to these schemes but neither regulations nor talk will put in a water or sewerage scheme or build a house.  All these regulations are interpreted in different ways by the officials of the various local authorities.There is also the important matter that a very influential section of the community already have water and sewerage schemes and these people take the attitude that once they have got them they are all right.  They realise that if the community at large get these schemes, they will have to pay for them, even though they themselves have them already.</P>
    <P>These big shots, these self-appointed big shots, go to the trouble of calling meetings to try to urge the people not to allow in piped water or sewerage schemes.  The people who call these meetings and urge ordinary individuals to do these things are not the ordinary five-eighths.  They are the big shots. Surely, in 1963, if we have any sense, we should realise that it is time that we got piped water supplies and piped sewerage facilities.  In no circumstances would I make any apology for saying that.  It is very unfair that these people who have some local pull can try to prevent local authorities from doing these things.  I want to assure the Minister, whether or not he knows it, that that is going on.  It is not the man on the dole who is organising these meetings.  The people in rural areas have been paying long enough for the water and sewerage schemes in urban areas and small towns and it is time they got something in return.</P>
    <P>In regard to roads, Deputy Flanagan from Mayo made a few statements last week with which I thoroughly agreed. It appears to me that the people in charge of the road programme have gone mad.  They must have gone well beyond the lunatic fringe.  If you took a crowd of people from a lunatic asylum, they would not do what is being done.  There is a road out of <Col N="500" /> the city to the west which is a death trap.  After a few miles, you come to what I regard, not as a road, but as an extended aerodrome.  I do not know of any type of plane today which could not land easily on this type of runway which is being extended westward until a railway bridge or some other type of bridge gets in the way.  Why they did not take away the bridge before they started the runway, I cannot understand but then I am not acquainted with the workings of the official mind.  No layman is.  I suppose if he were, he would not be in this country or he would have gone into a mental home.  The thing is so daft that only somebody who left a mental home would do these things.  At Maynooth there is a scheme which has to be seen to be believed.  It was bad enough before the place was touched but now it must be the laughing stock of Europe.  It is purely a death trap and this is after tens of thousands of pounds have been spent on it.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is now a regulation of the Department that any major road going westward, whatever about any other direction, must be 56-feet wide.  I know of one man who built one of the finest houses I have seen. He thought it was well back from the road and that he would be safe for the rest of his life, but he is as near now to the road as I am to the corner over there and if things go on as they have been, he will be out in the middle of the road, or certainly on the side of it.  I do not know who thinks of these things.  They just do not make sense. There is no necessity for them.</P>
    <P>You will have seen a photograph in the newspapers, either yesterday or today, of two cars which crashed on one of the widest roads in Ireland but which has one of the highest death rolls.  In America, they have started to put twists on the roads instead of taking them out.  I do not know how many people realise that but it is true. For years they were building straight roads but they found that they were death traps and now they have started putting in turns to try to reduce the accidents.  After all, cars were made to go around turns as well as for travelling on straight stretches.  It is <Col N="501" /> no strain on the car or on the driver to go around a turn.  As long as you have thousands of miles of what I would call green roads, with nothing but potholes and rubbish on them, it is a public scandal that millions of pounds should be spent on unnecessary improvements to roads which are already reasonably good.  However, the officials have gone mad.  I hope the Minister will get the necessary tablets and administer them to the proper people to try to bring back some sanity to this whole thing.</P>
    <P>You have also the question of speed limits which are another joke.  A man can drive at 30 miles an hour through a town and then he can drive at 90 miles an hour when he gets outside the town.  Apart from any other consideration, the people who framed these regulations must have known that we have a great many youthful drivers today and their great boast is to say that they got from Dublin to Belmullet in the shortest possible time.  They are frustrated in this because they must travel through certain towns at 30 miles an hour, or in some places 40 miles an hour, and they are going to overcome that frustration by increasing their normal speed from 60 miles per hour to 70 or 80 miles an hour. That is what is happening.</P>
    <P>In many places you have superintendents or other people in authority who did not want the trouble of enforcing speed limits and said they did not want any speed limits.  There are no speed limits in half the places in my constituency, although the lives of the people there are just as valuable as in any other area.  There is no speed limit through Newport, or through Mulranny, which is on the way to the biggest tourist area in the west of Ireland.  There is no speed limit in the town in which I live, or in Westport.  That must be a joke to anyone who knows anything about that area.  It is silly enough not to have a speed limit in those areas but it is stupid to find a situation in which a man can travel at 120 miles an hour as long as he does not see a 30 mile an hour or a 40 mile an hour sign in front of him.  Surely that is the essence of absurdity?</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to see children going <Col N="502" /> to national school and being told to walk on the left-hand side of the road, but to see them going to secondary school and being walked on the left-hand side of the road is worse and it is time to look around.  When I asked the Minister for Justice about that some time ago, he told me that he had no power to make any regulations to compel people to walk on the right-hand side of the road.  He said it was a matter for the Commissioner.  Surely when a man can buy a murder licence for £1 &mdash; it is very cheap; if he wanted to get a shotgun he would have to pay 50/- and he could probably only shoot one person at a time &mdash; and can sit into a high-powered car, is it not time that regulations were issued to require people to walk on the right-hand side of the road?  Surely it would save scores of lives.  Anybody must know that.</P>
    <P>People will not do a thing today unless they are made to do it.  When their bosses are so indifferent to this kind of thing &mdash; I will call them their bosses &mdash; the people treat it as a joke, but it is a very unfortunate joke.  It is very unfortunate that people cannot walk along the left-hand side of the road, especially at night, wearing black or blue clothes.  They will not be seen by traffic and will end up in the next world: I do not know what part of it they go to.  It is rather a sad commentary on our position today.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I think that any Minister for local Government who has the welfare of our people at heart &mdash; as I have no doubt the present Minister has &mdash; must look into this matter carefully and must do something about it.  It is a very important matter.  It is all right to issue notices to fellows to drive cars this way, that way and the other way. However, as far as I can see, the ordinary pedestrians are very often mainly at fault, simply and solely because they are doing what they were taught to do.  That is the unfortunate thing.  It is now past time they were reminded they are doing wrong.</P>
    <P>It took a world war and the loss of thousands of lives before the English &mdash; who have not much wits, anyway, at best &mdash; took steps to alter the position.  But, in a country like this, <Col N="503" /> where we all know the right thing to do, even though 100 per cent of us will not even dream of doing it, I think it is past time steps were taken to alter that position.  The Minister is morally bound to take steps in that matter and to have instructions issued as to what action he will take to ensure that the people in the future will walk on the right hand side of the roads, that is, if you call them roads in most places.  However, whether or not they are roads, we shall have to accept them until we reach the time when we can make them better.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to the Minister that, even though I have spoken strongly, my criticisms are not aimed at him as an individual.  Goodness knows, whatever we have got it is from him we have got it: I want to be honest about that.  However, I should not be fair to the people I represent or to the public if I did not state openly exactly what I think &mdash; and I am not the type of fellow who worries about giving a fellow a bite instead of a kiss, if necessary and where it is necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not take some of the Opposition people seriously because those who clamour against the present Government and say that all they do is wrong are, of course, not right.  It is very easy to be a good propagandist when you are in Opposition and when you do not have to fulfil any of the promises you make.  We know that if there were an alternative Government, it would certainly be a Government of solicitors, lawyers and that ilk&mdash; and we know what they are.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The housing problem in Dublin seems rather to have hit the headlines probably, largely due to the unfortunate deaths here in the past few months. According to the figures given by Deputy Ryan, there are 100,000 unfit houses in Dublin.  The report of our medical officer of health states that we have 1,000 unfit houses in South Tipperary and with a population there of 70,000, it is parallel to the Dublin <Col N="504" /> situation of 100,000 unsuitable houses for a population of 700,000.</P>
      <P>Without any statistics, I think that anybody who has to go around a rural area &mdash; I am sure most of the counties are the same as South Tipperary&mdash; during election time &mdash; and I suppose we shall be repeating that soon again &mdash; will see immediately that there is a far larger number of unfit houses than one would glean by simply driving through the country.  When you drive through a town or city, it is easy to see at one glance the number of unfit houses in certain areas but that is not so apparent in rural areas until you delve more deeply and travel around from place to place and visit each house.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been inclined at times to lay a certain amount of blame on local authorities for the recent drop in housing activities.  If he were sitting in any county council chamber and questioning the officials I can assure him they are quite prepared to divest themselves of all responsibility in the matter and are prepared to put a considerable amount of blame upon the Custom House.  One reason persistently offered is the difficulty of getting contractors, particularly as regards isolated cottages in the countryside.  The blame there, again, is fixed upon the Custom House in so far as they have too rigidly stuck to a fixed figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, our engineer has put up a suggestion &mdash; I think it follows the view of the Department &mdash; to the effect that he would try to come to an agreement on a fixed price for rural cottages so that the contractors would know where they are going and would be encouraged to undertake the work. That would depart, in effect, from the system of public tendering which, to a certain extent, has broken down.  I do not mind how they are built.  I do not mind whether they are built on such a modified scheme or whether they will go in for prefabrication or direct labour but clearly there has been a falling-off, which has been proved statistically, in public authority building in my constituency while at the same time I think there has been an increase in private building.  Even as regards the question of giving employment, surely it is more defensible to <Col N="505" /> build houses for our people and thereby give employment than to pay £350,000 per ship to Mr. Verolme down in Cork to give corresponding employment on ships that will never carry Irish produce and will never sail the Irish seas?</P>
    <P>The question of vested cottages is one which has frequently caused us some concern.  I advert particularly to the question of vested cottages which have been closed down.  I do not know how serious this problem is. One merely hears statements from various county councils that so many are shut down in this area and so many are shut down in the other area. Neither do I know if we have made any survey of the number of vested cottages shut down in each local authority area.  I should like particularly to know from the Minister whether the number of vested cottages being abandoned or shut down is increasing. I cannot give any guidance because one merely hears statements made and there are no statistical data or survey figures with which I am familiar on that matter.</P>
    <P>Regarding derelict sites I do not know how much activity is taking place under the various authorities for their abolition.  One particular case came to my notice recently, where a man was apparently refused money for the work he did on clearing up a derelict site.  One got the impression he was being refused because the site had not been inspected beforehand by a Local Government official.  I sent the details to the Minister and he very promptly ordered that the man be paid immediately.  I thank him for that. However, I afterwards saw the instructions given to these particular people, and it strikes me it is not sufficiently borne in upon them that this is a prerequisite to their getting the money for clearing up the derelict sites.  The ordinary countryman is inclined to overlook these little details and later on finds himself in difficulty because he has half completed or completed the work by the time the local officer arrives.  If it is a regulation that a local official must inspect the site before an owner proceeds to clear it up, surely that could be modified? <Col N="506" /> Surely one of our local engineers should suffice to see a particular site and give the man the go-ahead within a few days?  If the Department do not trust the local engineer there is no difficulty in their making a spot check of any figure given in respect of a site. By that method you could considerably speed up work and allow the man wishing to clear up the derelict site to get on with the work immediately and at his own convenience.</P>
    <P>There is one small point to which I should like to advert.  I mentioned it also last year.  I noticed, for example, that when Deputy Ritchie Ryan was speaking here he had a bound copy of the minutes of Dublin Corporation and, I think, the manager's report before him.  It is extraordinary that in none of the county councils, where huge amounts of money are being spent &mdash; in my constituency last year £1,750,000 &mdash; there is such thing as a manager's annual report.  This causes no inconvenience to the senior officials in the Custom House, but for outside institutions, for economists and for the general information of public organisations, surely, when such a large amount of money is being spent, it is not too much to ask that the county manager should provide the people with an annual report?  Already subsidiary bodies, such as the committee of agriculture, the medical officer of health and the vocational committee submit a report.  Neither have we any report from our urban bodies and corporations.  There is no engineer's report.  They are spending a huge amount of money on rural water supply schemes in my constituency. Yet, except what the people will read in the local newspapers, there is nothing in the way of an annual report that the public might read and satisfy themselves that all this money is being well and reasonably spent and that they are getting something in return. It would be good public relations and certainly would reduce a considerable amount of public criticism, which at times is all too vocal as regards local bodies.</P>
    <P>In regard to small urban bodies, the particular one in the town where I live, Cashel, is the second lowest rated in the country.  The time has arrived <Col N="507" /> when we should consider the abolition of the small urban bodies.  In this modern age it is quite impossible for a small urban body to provide the necessary public health and social services which the community demands and which the community is able to obtain elsewhere.  For instance, in Cashel all we have to spend is £27,000.  You can do very little with £27,000 in a small urban body and yet you have to provide all the paraphernalia of local administration for your £27,000, whereas the county council last year spent, as I said, about £1,750,000.</P>
    <P>This is very apparent when you come to consider such public health matters as sewerage.  Most of the villages in my constituency have a modern sewerage system either completed or in the process of being secured.  Yet the public sewerage system in Cashel is an open sewer leaving the town and passing one or two miles into the county council hinterland.  We find difficulty in getting a few pounds to cover one part of that sewer in the urban district area to keep the rats from infesting the local peoples' houses and to prevent children from falling into the open public sewer.  We cannot do otherwise because 1d in the £ produces only £20, and you have not the money to provide the necessary sewage treatment for the community.  The Minister will reply there is nothing to prevent a larger outside body such as the county council moving in and building houses in the centre of the urban body's area or doing work of that nature.  While there may be nothing legal to prevent them doing so, it is another matter when you get up in the council chamber and ask the councillors from all over the county to provide the money for the urban area in which you live. They become very local in their patriotism when that situation arises. I can assure the House that it is the situation with us, and I am sure it is the same situation elsewhere when similar conditions arise.  Therefore, I would submit the time has arrived when we should, in the interest of social development, consider the abolition <Col N="508" /> of the smaller urban authorities.</P>
    <P>For example, we examined the question of urbanisation in regard to Cashel.  We had discussions on it and the assistant county manager explained that we could not completely wash our hands of certain commitments; we could not be completely de-urbanised and come completely over to the county council, and that there were certain intermediate difficulties we could not share.  He seemed to be rather hazy about the position and at the end of the discussion we saw that there were difficulties which we did not realise beforehand and many of which we did not understand.  I feel this is a matter which requires departmental attention. A beginning could be made at least with the smaller urban bodies, even if it rather upset local patriotism, those that are not able to meet their commitments now.</P>
    <P>Cashel urban district council have built a large number of houses and have gone 50-50 in the Galtee water scheme.  These are heavy commitments for a low-rate urban body.  Were it not that this council have a considerable amount of money which they got some time in the past, the rates in Cashel would be intolerable.</P>
    <P>Like most rural councils, we were gravely disappointed by the switching of money by the Minister from the county road improvement scheme to the main roads for the present year. We had allocated £91,100 but he reduced that to £39,000.  He has done that all over and in our case the argument was, I think, that we had 80 per cent dust-free roads.  That has always been a bone of contention between the departmental mind and the local representative who has to meet the various deputations that visit his house every day about one road or another of the type not now being done.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Minister on one point in particular.  As is customary, we held our five area road meetings for the five electoral areas&mdash; we always hold them around Christmas &mdash; and we did so in the belief that the distribution was to be the same as the year before.  Having fixed on £91,000, we later found that the Minister had reduced that to £39,000.  It <Col N="509" /> was then suggested we should hold a second round of area road meetings but we were by then too tired and we just threw the matter to the area engineer to deal with and to spend the £39,000 as he thought fit.  I believe the Minister should have foreseen this would happen and we should have got some indication of the amount of money we would be allowed in that category so that we would not be running up a blind alley believing we were going to get a certain amount of money and leaving us in the position of promising constituents that certain roads would be done only to have to go back and tell them later on that these roads were now cut out.  Perhaps there are reasons why the Minister could not give the information earlier but it seems peculiar we could not be told beforehand and so avoid much disappointment.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, as in all others up to a few years ago, rate collectors were appointed on a poundage basis. Later, by direction of the Department &mdash; I think it came from the present Minister &mdash; we altered that to a salarycum-bonus basis.  That was said to be in the interests of economy.  About a year ago, those who were on the salary-bonus basis applied for an increase in salary and at a council meeting that increase was granted in the forenoon.  In the afternoon, a notice of motion appeared on the agenda that some of the work of one rate-collector be transferred to another. The collector whose work was to be reduced was being paid on a salary-bonus basis.  The collector who was to get the work &mdash; it was the Fethard area &mdash; was on a poundage basis. There was no suggestion that the man who was to have his work reduced would have his salary reduced.  By a majority, the county council removed the Fethard collection area which would probably represent one-third of the man's work, after having given him an increase of salary in the forenoon, and gave that area on a poundage basis to another collector with the result that South Tipperary ratepayers must pay in perpetuity about £120 more for this change.</P>
    <P>This proposition was sent to the <Col N="510" /> Minister and I am sorry to say that that Minister on whose instructions we had introduced the salary-bonus basis in the interests of economy, saw fit to sanction it.  It was an entirely political manoeuvre which placed an unnecessary impost of £120 in perpetuity on South Tipperary.  I do not begrudge the reduction of work to the man who got it with the same money; I do not begrudge the man getting the extra book and I do not begrudge people who try these things but the Minister, as a Minister, should set an example. There is no use in telling me that South Tipperary County Council did that.  If a county council, or other public body, misbehaves, it is the Minister's duty to correct that misbehaviour and not endorse it, as he did in the instance to which I refer.</P>
    <P>For some years past now in some counties the policy of amalgamating the position of relieving officer and cottage rent collector has been adopted.  Some county councils favour this; some do not.  The reasons offered for the amalgamation are that by combining the posts one is giving one man a worthwhile job; one can pay him a bit more.  Another reason is that combining the posts cuts down travelling. There is one man instead of two going to the one house.  One man can do the job.  The objection against the system is that it is wrong to have one man collecting money and the same man, perhaps on the same day, giving out money to the same house.  Whatever may be said for and against, in North Tipperary all these posts are now combined.</P>
    <P>In South Tipperary we have two relieving officers who were appointed as a result of public advertisement, one of them in 1952 and the other in, I think, 1958.  The conditions of their appointment were that when the cottage rent collector positions in their districts became vacant they would automatically secure those posts.  These two men took these appointments under these conditions.  We find now that, although the policy of amalgamation has been pursued in North Tipperary and South Tipperary, and I believe also in Cork, Waterford, and other local authority areas, these <Col N="511" /> two men have been deprived so far of these posts, and that deprivation has continued for a period of twelve months.  South Tipperary County Council passed resolutions and motions.  Later the county manager was dilatory in sending these to the Minister.  Then the Minister spent four or five months brooding on the request of the South Tipperary County Council to give permission to the manager to make the appointments to the cottage rent collector posts by combining the two appointments.</P>
    <P>A grave injustice is being done to these two men who, in all honesty, applied for these posts as publicly advertised.  There is the further aspect that, if these men are not appointed, the South Tipperary County Council may find itself subjected to an expensive legal action.  Whatever may be the technical difficulties as regards the Departments of Local Government and Social Welfare, whatever objections may have been raised under the 1956 amendment to the Local Government Act, I fail to see why these two men, who applied for jobs as publicly advertised, and who believed that everything was in order, should not now be appointed to these combined posts, remembering that such appointments are being made all over the country and that the same policy has been adopted by South Tipperary County Council and several others.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with a matter which is of considerable importance to every public representative, and of particular importance to representatives of public bodies.  We hear a great deal nowadays about incomes policy. We hear a great deal about employeremployee relationships, about conciliation, arbitration and labour courts. Recently our county manager produced to us &mdash; I believe this is true of other county councils too &mdash; a scheme for conciliation and arbitration for local government officials.  This scheme raises considerable problems for every county council and will raise considerable problems not alone for the Minister for Local Government but also for the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>It appears that the conciliation and <Col N="512" /> arbitration scheme county managers are putting before county councils all over the country &mdash; some county councils are passing this scheme, some are refusing it, and some are deferring acceptance of it &mdash; is unacceptable to the majority of local authority employees, to be precise to 60 per cent of them.  I do not know whether it is advisable to have two schemes.  I am not qualified to give an opinion on that but certain it is that, if you have an arbitration and conciliation scheme drawn up, one of the first essentials is that it should have the confidence and respect of those to whom it applies and whom it is supposed to serve.  If you have a scheme to which 60 per cent are antagonistic I submit one cannot expect such a scheme to operate successfully or secure the degree of agreement and co-operation one would hope for.  This particular scheme was strongly objected to by my county council.  We were well aware that there was considerable opposition to it.  Our County Manager, however, seemed rather annoyed that anybody should object to the scheme.  In fact, he said he thought it was a great impertinence on the part of professional organisations to object to the scheme as drawn up by the County Managers' Association.  He sounded like Caesar. We asked him to defer the scheme, but he insisted on putting it through.  His attitude was that, if others want to come in, they can come in later.</P>
    <P>The position is that 40 per cent are apparently agreeable, 60 per cent find the scheme unacceptable.  These latter represent the following professional associations: the Incorporated Law Society, the Irish Medical Association, the Irish Nurses' Association, the Agricultural Science Association, the Institute of Chemistry of Ireland, the Royal Institute of Architects, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, the Society of Radiographers, the Town Planning Institute, the Veterinary Association of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 30th October, 1963.</P>
