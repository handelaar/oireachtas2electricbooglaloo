      <P>Deputies will have learned, with profound regret, of the death last night, after a brief illness, of Deputy William Norton.  Go ndéana Dia Trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>He first became a member of Dáil Éireann in February, 1926, at the early age of 25 years and since 1932 he has sat continuously for the Kildare and Carlow-Kildare areas.  During all those years he was one of the outstanding personalities of Dáil Éireann.  He was leader of his Party from 1932 until 1960.  He was Tánaiste in the two Governments in which his Party participated and he filled ably the posts successively of Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He has been for many years a member of the Council of State.</P>
      <P>All his working life was connected with the Post Office in which he was employed for ten years before becoming General Secretary of the Post Office Workers Union in June, 1924. The members of his Union will remember him for the part he played in gaining many improvements in wages and conditions of service for Post Office staffs and in the wider sphere he will always be associated with the drive for better relations between management and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have been fellow-members of this House with him for many years will remember him as an earnest and vigorous contributor to <Col N="628" /> debates.  On every major issue he had something of value to say and said it with dignity and sincerity, which earned him the respect of all members and not least of the Deputies who were unable to agree with all he said.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton will be sadly missed by all of us here and by his constituents for whom he worked tirelessly.</P>
    <P>I ask you, Sir, to convey the sympathy of Dáil Éireann to his widow and family.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Business in the following Order: Nos. 1, 5, 16, 19, 17, 18, 20, 21 and 22.  It is proposed to take questions at 2.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>I have to inform the House that the Whips of the three main Parties have met and agreed on a programme of business for the rest of the session, with the aim of concluding the business of the session by this day week.  It is proposed to take all stages of the National Building Agency Bill, 1963, Stock Transfer Bill, 1963, Central Bank Bill, 1963, Telephone Capital Bill, 1963, Funds of Suitors Bill, 1963, Adoption Bill, Firearms Bill and Criminal Justice Bill.  It is proposed to take the following Supplementary Estimates: (1) An Chomhairle Ealaíon (Taoiseach); (2), Vote No. 19, Miscellaneous Expenses; and to finish the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following motions will be taken: (1) Approval of a draft Order to be made by the Government amending the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954&mdash;to be taken in conjunction with the Funds of Suitors Bill, 1963; (2) motion approving draft regulations to be made under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts concerning the payment of fees on slaughtering of cattle, sheep and pigs; (3) Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme; and (4) Wexford Gas Order, 1963.  To enable this business to be completed, it is agreed the House should meet for the following hours next week: Tuesday, from 3 p.m. <Col N="629" /> to 10.30 p.m.; Wednesday, from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m.; and Thursday, from 10.30 a.m. until 10.30 p.m.  There will be a debate on the Motion for the Adjournment to take place after questions on Thursday and to continue until 10.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise just one point.  There are two motions on the Order Paper, one in respect of agricultural produce and the other in respect of teachers' pensions.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night, I was commenting on the fact that the effect of this Bill is to turn a £100 State company into a £100,000 State company, a company registered under the Companies Act and I remarked that, to my mind, the Companies Acts do not provide a suitable form of control or lay down suitable procedures for the operation of State companies.  We have many State companies in this country, about 50 in all.  Some of them are registered under the Companies Act and others are set up by statute which contains all of their powers and lays down in words how they are to be operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the schedule to this Bill, it is provided that the accounts of the company shall be submitted to the Oireachtas and the Minister is given power to require such reports as he may consider fit in regard to the policy and operation of the company.  In that context, it is appropriate that we <Col N="631" /> should suggest to the Minister the ideas which occur to us.  We have many of these State companies which have come into being on a hit or miss basis, not on any doctrinaire grounds but to cater for some particular purpose in most cases not catered for by private enterprise.  In that context, I have taken issue with the Minister when I queried the function of this National Building Agency in the provision of housing finance to industrialists.  What can the Agency do in that context that cannot be done by existing means, by the building societies?</P>
    <P>To return to the question of the control of State companies in general and the National Building Agency in particular, I want to know if, some years hence, the Minister's successor is queried on the operations of this company, are we to be told that the Minister has no responsibility in the matter, that he will take the line which the Minister for Transport and Power takes when questions are put to him in regard to the operations of CIE or the ESB?  I want to know if we would be put in the position of not being able to ask parliamentary questions relating to the operations of this State company?  That is an undesirable state of affairs.  Our State companies must be made accountable to Parliament, and must be made subject to the appropriate democratic procedures.</P>
    <P>If I may give an example of the sort of thing which we must strive to avoid, I would quote the precedent of a few years back when Radio Éireann was given autonomy.  One of the first efforts of the newly autonomous Radio Éireann was to appoint a professional architect to advise them on the building of Montrose.  He invited a certain number of builders to tender for that work which was never publicly advertised. We do not want that to happen with regard to the National Building Agency.  We want to ensure that normal procedures are followed, that all contracts will be advertised for public tender and that there will be no question of dispensing this undesirable form of patronage.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was questioned regarding <Col N="632" /> that matter, he replied that he had no responsibility for the actions of the Authority, that it was a matter for the Board.  Will it be a matter for the board of the National Building Agency, in respect of which the Minister cannot be called to task in this House, if similar activities are engaged in?  That is an undesirable state of affairs and we should make it clear that it is one this House will not tolerate.</P>
    <P>The Companies Acts are completely unsuitable for providing procedures for the control of State-owned companies. They are intended to cater for the control and management of companies owned by private persons or members of the public but not by the State.  There is a procedure in company law for the protection of aggrieved minorities.  An aggrieved minority of ten per cent may requisition the Minister for Industry and Commerce to hold a sworn inquiry into the activities of the company, such as in the case of Irish Estates, Ltd.  In the case of Irish Estates, Ltd., if the holding company had not been forced by the power of public opinion to hold that sworn inquiry, this House could not have forced such an inquiry upon it.</P>
    <P>In the case of a company such as the National Building Agency, and I cast no reflection upon its present management which I recognise is first-class, if an aggrieved minority of Deputies&mdash;or the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;thought fit in the public interest, to demand a sworn inquiry into its activities, they could not do so, because all the shares are vested in the Minister for Finance.  The fundamental principle in company law of protection for an aggrieved minority is completely departed from, without providing any substitute for it, either in this Bill or any of the Acts constituting the charter of our various State companies.  It is time we got down to examining the first principles we should have regard to, as regards control of State companies which have grown upon us unawares, and play such a significant role in all economies.</P>
    <P>In many cases I concede there is much to be said for establishing autonomous bodies but I do not concede <Col N="633" /> that case has been made in respect of this measure.  I want to make, as strongly as I can, the case that we have not laid down appropriate procedures for their accountability to Parliament.  We have a most important Committee of this House, the Committee of Public Accounts, of which Deputy Jones is Chairman, and State Departments and senior civil servants are subjected in that Committee to the most rigorous examination of their accounts as reported on by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There is no substitute for that procedure laid down in this Bill in respect of the National Building Agency.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires that the accounts be drawn up in such manner as the Minister may direct and submitted to the Oireachtas but there is no question of the Committee of Public Accounts having any function in the matter.  No opportunity is given to the Committee to query officers of the company on tendering procedure or administrative policy and such matters as fundamental principles.  It is time that a body such as the Committee of Public Accounts were empowered to examine the affairs of State companies, not only their financial administration but, if possible, their efficiency and adherence to the purpose for which they were created because it seems to many of us that in many of the State companies there are examples of the operation of Parkinson's law, of jobs multiplying and so on.</P>
    <P>This might well develop into a largescale State company because in Section 9 it is contemplated that the State interest in this company could amount to as much as £2 million.  I said that I was not prepared to concede, without hearing more from the Minister, that there is a necessity for supplanting private enterprises at present catering for housing and finance, namely, the building societies, and all these industries for which the National Building Agency is catering largely, in providing houses, should be sound financial risks for building societies.  If they are not, they should not be treated as such for the investment of State moneys by the National Building Agency.</P>
    <P>It is visualised by the Minister, as he <Col N="634" /> told us last night, that the mortgages held by the National Building Agency will be acceptable security for raising loans from outside sources and that the Agency in that way may not be entirely dependent on State finance, although such loans may be guaranteed by the Minister.  That seems to be a very cumbersome and roundabout way of raising money for building purposes &mdash;that the National Building Agency should lend money to industrialists to house workers and should then, in turn, borrow from banks and building societies, bodies which could very well deal directly with the parties concerned, so far as I know.</P>
    <P>The second function of the Agency is to provide houses for Gardaí and other State servants.  The Minister has not convinced me that the Board of Works are not able to do a competent job in this respect nor that it is necessary to set up a separate company with expensive administration in order to provide houses for Gardaí in Templemore. I suggest that the accounts of the National Building Agency must be studied with much care because, while it appears that they are not making or losing much money, it is a fact that the bulk of their administrative expenses are recouped from other Departments and it is very easy to show a profit or break even when you are in that position.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I am not casting aspersions for a moment on the management or administration of the National Building Agency&mdash;quite the contrary: I understand they are first class, but I am not convinced that the need exists for this separate organisation which could very well develop into a large organisation.  I am not satisfied that we have fully considered the need for this venture.  It cannot be too strongly emphasised that all State Departments and the Civil Service generally have accepted procedures for the control of public moneys, accepted rules for advertising by public tender all contract work and accepted procedure for filling vacancies and we want to see that these standards are adhered to by our State companies and that these are not regarded, or in danger of <Col N="635" /> being regarded, as instruments for the dispensation of patronage.</P>
    <P>We have not yet seen the memorandum and articles of association of the National Building Agency and they are not available in the Library of Dáil Éireann.  To that extent, our hands are tied and we are not able to give this matter the full consideration we should like to give it.  For all I know, there may be a provision in the articles of association of the National Building Agency that only Corkmen or Galwaymen shall be employed therein.  That is an absurd example but I mention it as an example of the need for surveillance by the Opposition. If we are to give suitable consideration to a proposal such as this, I would ask the Minister to place a copy of the articles of association and the memorandum of the National Building Agency Limited in the Library of Leinster House between now and the Committee Stage, if possible.</P>
    <P>I notice that in section 3 the Minister is taking power to sell the shares held by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State, if and when he thinks fit.  It might be appropriate to insert a provision there to ensure that, if such shares are sold, they shall not be sold at a loss.  Indeed, I am not at all sure there is any need for the provision.  Our State companies have not come into being on any doctrinaire grounds but within recent years some of us have been adopting a doctrinaire approach to their continued existence.  We have been taking the view that it is undesirable that the State should have such an extensive interest in industry and in the economy.  The Minister for Finance has indicated that he wants to wash his hands of some of the shares he holds in profit-making concerns. The notion seems to be abroad that it is wrong that the State should hold these shares.  I do not think that is right.  If there is a case for the National Building Agency, or any other public venture, it is appropriate that the State should participate in such moves and, if a profit is made from such ventures, well and good.  Do <Col N="636" /> not let us become doctrinaire and think that it is wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has been taking that line recently in regard to the Sugar Company, one of the few State companies which is making a profit and doing such useful work socially and economically.  If you could get rid of the shares in CIE, there might be something to be said for this doctrinaire approach but I fail to see why we should take one line with regard to profit-making companies and another with those losing money.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not sure if there is any need for this provision.  This £100,000 capital which is now being put into the company is, as I see it, to enable them to repay the Industrial Credit Company.  It is a realistic move.  A company of this size with a share capital of £100, as it has at the moment, is rather an absurdity and it makes sense to place its capital on a more realistic basis.  From the terms of the Bill, I am not sure whether that capital of £100,000 is to be remunerated and if so, on what terms. I should be obliged if the Minister would enlighten me on that matter and if between now and the Committee Stage he would place a copy of the articles of association and the memorandum of the company in the Library. That would be most helpful to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unnecessary Bill and at the present time I would almost describe it as an undesirable Bill.  It is well known that we have an enormous building problem on our hands in various parts of the country, a problem which we do not seem able to meet adequately, or anything like adequately; yet, here is an agency which is being extended.  For what purpose?  As I see it, it has no special pool of labour of its own from which it can draw and no special pool of contractors, and it has to go out and compete with everyone else who is trying to get building done.  I do not think the type of building described is a top priority at present by any measurement.  The industrial policy is wrong.  It is wrong to push would-be industrialists into remote parts of the <Col N="637" /> country which are not built-up and where there is not a pool of working-class people.  We have in various parts created large communities of working-class people without any facilities whatever for industry in the neighbourhood. We have at the same time large numbers of people unemployed but we are trying to build up industrial centres where there are no houses and no working-class populations.  That seems to me to be an unreasonable exercise at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister has described this Agency as being an efficient agency, an Agency that has been doing a good job and providing houses economically and at the right price, in a limited way.  I suggest that the best way to keep this Agency efficient is to keep it small.  The example we have of the inefficiency of a big building agency is the Board of Works.  I have spent two or three years trying to get small but very essential extensions carried out to schools in various parts of the county.  This is an example of the big building agency that has become topheavy and completely and absolutely inefficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are dead hands other than those in the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be. Deputy Byrne has brought out the fear of political patronage of all sorts being dispensed and that fear is not without foundation.  On several occasions, architects have complained to me that unless you are known to be a strong Fianna Fáil supporter, you have not got a hope of getting a job from the Board of Works.  Many contractors feel that the same applies to the giving of contracts.  If that is the yardstick to be applied in the National Building Agency, it will be undesirable and something that can very well be avoided.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the National Building Agency was established with the primary object of facilitating the provision of houses and ancillary services required in connection with industrial expansion where the need could not be met <Col N="638" /> appropriately by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I ask why it cannot be met by local authorities.  I think local authorities, in fact, have a ready-made organisation and have powers of compulsory acquisition which the National Building Agency have not got.  I would say it will run into many difficulties in various areas because of that.  The Minister says needs cannot appropriately be supplied by local authorities or are not otherwise met by private enterprise.  Why can private enterprise not come in here and supply the need? These houses are not being built by the National Building Agency themselves. They are being built by the pool of contractors&mdash;I expect as a result of advertising contracts &mdash; and the same people will be carrying out the work.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what is new about this Agency.  The only thing is that it is a new source of finance and of credit. As Deputy Byrne says, it is a most cumbersome way to provide it.  This Bill is both unnecessary and undesirable at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in full agreement with the previous two speakers.  I do not think this Bill is necessary at all.  My reaction to it is that it imposes further State control in the building arena.  Surely we already have our local authorities who, to a certain extent, are frustrated in building by the peculiar system that obtains here under which practically everything has to be referred to the Custom House, considered there, then referred to the town and country planning organisation as to whether and where they have the right to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we shall have a National Building Agency which does not seem to have any real function whatsoever except that we are told it will build houses for the Garda Síochána and for industrial workers.  It is not so very long ago that the Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced a Bill in this House.  I particularly queried him to know if the Bill had any coverage for the purpose of providing grants for housing for industrial concerns that might be set up in remote areas.  A member of the same Government&mdash;the Minister for Local Government&mdash;now <Col N="639" /> brings a Bill into this House and states in his opening remarks that it is for the purpose of providing houses in remote areas for industrial concerns.  What is the point in having two Ministers from the same Government introducing two parallel types of legislation?  That is what is being introduced, in effect, in this legislation here.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly concur in what Deputy Byrne said.  Here is a National Building Agency&mdash;with all the powers of the State and with the money of the Department of Finance behind it&mdash;put into competition with private enterprise. Is it an acceptance on the part of the Government that private enterprise is not able to give us the things we need in this country?  Is private enterprise not able to give us or is the investment in private enterprise not able to give us the houses for industrial concerns?</P>
    <P>Surely, if it is economic to set up an industry here, if it is economic to site the industry itself, it should be possible, without having national planning, to provide houses in the area where the industry is located under the aegis of private building agencies.  I think this is a retrograde step.  It is a step we have been taking gradually here in this free country of ours.  We are gradually producing legislation which gives State enterprise control over everything.</P>
    <P>If I want to build a house anywhere, if I want&mdash;even nowadays, I understand&mdash;to change the size of the windows in my house I am subject to the jurisdiction of the local authority, with an appeal to the Minister.  In other words, I am not a free agent to build or alter my property as I wish to do.  Is the National Building Agency, which is affiliated to a certain extent to the Minister's Department&mdash;I understand the directors will be civil servants from the Custom House&mdash;subject to the restrictions that I, as a private individual or any building agency or private investment building society, is subject to, as well?</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise what Deputy Byrne stressed.  Is this Agency another of these concerns that will not be under <Col N="640" /> Parliamentary control?  I do not believe in complete ministerial control which often means control by those who advise the Minister&mdash;the bureaucrats or civil servants.  However, if we are to have State investment and if Dáil Éireann votes money for this Agency&mdash; to the extent, I gather, of £100,000&mdash;I believe that Deputies elected by the people under the democratic system that exists here should have the right to come in and query it.  Are we to be allowed to ask questions about this National Building Agency?</P>
    <P>Supposing it is brought to my notice that a contract has been placed and that the contractor is possibly not, according to the best advice one has received, the person who has submitted the most suitable tender or who will build more economically or who seems to have the full qualifications. Supposing I ask the Minister a question about it.  Will I be told that the Dáil had set up a National Building Agency and that he has no function in the matter?  That may not be the case: I do not know.  Deputy Byrne has made that very trenchant point.  I want to make it, too.  The Minister, when replying, should tell us about it.</P>
    <P>The other point the Minister made in relation to this Bill was that it was for the purpose of building houses for Civic Guards.  That has been done before in this country.  Such houses have been built for Civic Guards and State officials down through the years. I do not know who built them, whether or not it was the Office of Public Works.  However, I know the houses were built&mdash;perhaps not as quickly as they should be.  Perhaps there is a growing demand for these types of houses.  In what way will the National Building Agency increase the prospects of building these types of houses? Is it because the National Building Agency has amongst its directors members of the Custom House that they are all likely to agree with the suggestion that these houses should be built or not built?  In other words, is it a further admission that this country, under private enterprise, is able to do nothing for itself, that everything is gradually and slowly to be turned over to the State?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> Since I have had the privilege of being in public life during the past dozen years or so, I have fought against and contested this gradual encroachment by the State on everything. This Bill is just another step along those lines.  It is a step to place under the control of officials or under the control of State or quasi-State companies&mdash;this appears to be somewhat more than that: it appears to be a complete State company&mdash;the affairs of the private individual.  If so, I think this Bill is unnecessary and I want to protest against it because I think it is no more than another step in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened, but with waning interest, to that which has been said by speakers here this morning. Each speaker in succession trotted out the same sort of argument and asked the same question as to why this Agency should be in existence at all.  The fact is that it has been in existence and operating for some considerable time now.  That surely answers the query raised by those Deputies who want to know what it will do.  It is already doing and its use should, therefore, be self-evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a permanent basis for financing the operations of the Agency.  The Bill has been used here for the purpose of discussing the housing situation in Dublin and throughout the country. The question was asked; are the local authorities not capable of providing all the houses needed and, if they are not, should public interest not do so?  On the one hand, we have the argument that there are not enough houses in Dublin and throughout the country; on the other hand, we have it suggested that this building Agency is superimposed on and superfluous to local authority and private enterprise building.  If local authorities and private enterprise were capable of meeting all needs, there would never have been any necessity to set up a National Building Agency.  Local authorities and private enterprise do not cater for the provision of houses for new industries.  That is the primary <Col N="642" /> reason why it was found necessary to provide some machinery whereunder that type of housing could be provided. The building of houses for the Garda Síochána and other State bodies which may require housing is in large measure incidental to the purpose for which the Agency was intended in the first instance.</P>
    <P>With regard to criticism of the Agency that it is not subject to enough control, that its accounts will not be vetted, that it is not answerable to this House and that the shareholders will not have the protection that would be given them in a normal company, all that criticism is not well founded. As has been pointed out by some speakers here, directors will be appointed.  They will be subject to removal from office at any time by the Minister for Local Government. That indicates that the Minister for Local Government of the day would in fact be subject to very severe criticism, or praise, as the case might be, although that is unlikely from an Opposition, if a good job of work is done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fears expressed about the House having no function or an effort being made to get away from having any responsibility for what the Agency may do, all I can say is that, so far as I am concerned, I shall feel myself quite free to give to the House a full account of the operations of the Agency whenever a demand is made for such information through the normal channels.  As far as I am concerned, there need be no doubt whatsoever about that.  Indeed, I am sure any Minister for Local Government will be only too happy to keep the House informed.</P>
    <P>Criticism was made that this Agency would be dispensing patronage by way of contract and in the appointment of architects.  The only dispensing that has been done so far in regard to contracts is that they have been dispensed to those who gave the best value for money.  That can be proved by the houses completed at figures which the local authorities could not touch or could not negotiate.  That is one of the reasons why the Agency <Col N="643" /> has so much freedom.  Take away that freedom and you immediately take away the effectiveness of the Agency. It is absolutely essential they should have freedom to get in and get on with the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>But we are dealing with public money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim is to get the work done as fast as possible and as economically as possible.  During its short existence, the Agency has proved itself most effective.  It can get a job done, and at a price, which those who have had the job for years are not capable of getting done at anything like the same price.  It is all very fine to say the Agency is in competition with local authorities.  That is true only in the sense that they are drawing from the same pool of contractors and the same pool of skilled labour.  It has to be remembered, however, that the contractors employed by the Agency would not be building some other houses for private enterprise if, in fact, they were not building houses under the Agency.  Who will say that houses built for the Garda are not effectively helping in the housing drive?  These houses represent additional housing units available to house our citizens. On that basis, the argument that we are taking away from the effort to provide houses falls to the ground.</P>
      <P>With regard to the appointment of architects, I know one architect by name, though I do not think I would recognise him if I were to meet him right now.  He is a seconded officer. Other architects have been appointed whose names I do not know.  If there is political patronage, then it must be operated by the Opposition Parties, which is rather unlikely, I think, in the circumstances.  The seconded architect cannot be said to be a patronage appointment.  Neither can the others for that matter.  If there were political patronage, then surely I should know their names.  I do not know their names.  I do not know them to see. I do not even know how many we are employing at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been alleged that this £100 is <Col N="644" /> now being blown into something much bigger and only the Lord knows what it will run to in the future.  If it runs into a £1 million company, I would see nothing wrong in that because, should the need arise, and remembering what a good job it is doing, it might be absolutely essential that it should grow in order to meet increasing demand.  That is not to say that it will grow into a £1 million company, but, should it grow to that, then it will have improved itself in reaching that size.</P>
    <P>It was stated that since the Agency is composed of directors from the Department of Local Government&mdash; although in fact there are two from outside Departments&mdash;it will not be subject to the same restrictions as private interests and will not have to conform to planning regulations and so on.  The Agency will be subject to these restrictions.  Furthermore, because of their association with the Department, they will be restricted to the letter of the law.  Unlike private individuals, they will be unable to take a chance and have support later from various sides of the House.  Ignorance or any other plea will not excuse them for doing something not in conformity with the regulations.  So far as that fear is concerned, therefore, I can assure the House that no such preference will be given.  In fact, the reverse will be the case.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy, having first said it was unnecessary, went on to say that to be efficient the Agency should be kept small.  Actually, it is quite small. The number of staff employed relative to the building operations on hand is very small.  By the very nature of their function, to build houses on request, the Agency will always be relatively small in relation to the volume of work.  So far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned, the wish at all times will be to keep it as small as is consistent with doing a good job.</P>
    <P>Exception was taken to section 3. This section was considered necessary by the parliamentary draftsman to give the Minister for Finance effective power to buy or sell shares.  This eventuality is very remote, but, if it should arise, the power is there.  The <Col N="645" /> Agency could do without this section so far as its function is concerned, but it has been put in as a long-term safeguard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones wondered if the Agency would carry out operations in small centres.  There is a general application of the Agency's work throughout the country.  Houses for industry have been built by the Agency or are under contract in a total of 19 counties.  If that figure were brought up to date, I think we could add a county or two.  That indicates a fairly good spread of the activities of the Agency so far as the provision of housing for industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>I was also asked if houses for Gardaí were being erected in large numbers in a few centres.  By and large, houses for Gardaí are being built in ones and twos.  In Templemore, due to the impending transfer there of the Training Depot, the number of houses immediately required was greater than in other centres.  In Templemore, 23 houses are being built.  That is the biggest single number in any centre.  It may well be that some counties may find there are few, if any, Gardaí houses being built there, while a whole lot are being built in an adjoining county.  The reason is that in the first phases of this task of providing houses for Gardaí we have to have 530 houses.  It has been found to be a better approach to concentrate these houses in regions rather than scatter the efforts of the Agency.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that the work of the Agency is going ahead satisfactorily and houses are being provided for Gardaí all over the country.  In a few years' time, the problem of finding houses, which faced Gardaí in the past, will be overcome. In some places it was not possible to transfer a man because of lack of suitable housing.  The best feature is that the houses which heretofore were occupied by Gardaí will now be made available to other members of the community.</P>
    <P>I was also asked whether the usual channels had been fully explored before the Agency began operations in the various areas.  I can only repeat <Col N="646" /> that the Agency have only begun operations where over a period the need for houses was not met by the local authority or by private enterprise. I was also asked why the building societies and commercial lending organisations might not do this work. The fact is that they just have not done it, and there is nothing we can do to impose on them the obligation to provide houses for new industries or where industries are expanding.  The fact is that private enterprise is free enterprise, and they naturally like to go where they feel the pickings are best.  If there are these rather neglected sites, somebody else has to do it and, by and large, the role of the National Building Agency is that they do it if the gap does exist, and it does exist, as Deputies know, in many parts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is a growing use being made of the Agency by industrialists.  At the start there was quite an amount of interest displayed.  There were a great number of inquiries.  Some of them proceeded to the stage of erection of houses by the Agency.  Others faded out.  From my information, those who displayed an interest at the start and lost interest after a bit are again beginning to become actively interested and are coming back now that they have seen what the Agency has done and is doing for some of their colleagues elsewhere.  In that way the use of the Agency and the work it can do is expanding in the industrial sphere. That is a good thing.  It is a good thing that we should have an Agency such as this to go in and meet the demand fairly effectively as well as economically and quickly.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further that I should have mentioned at this Stage that cannot be dealt with more effectively on Committee Stage. Finally, I would just say that the Bill, generally speaking, is a Bill which makes financial provision for the operation of the Agency, that the Agency is necessary, that the fact that it exists and is operating at the moment is proof positive that it has a role to play and, in my estimation, it is an expanding role.  The more it expands, the better all round for all of us.  That <Col N="647" /> the need for the Agency should grow is indicative of growth generally.  All of us feel&mdash;if we do not feel it now, we certainly will feel it in the time ahead&mdash; that this Agency is not only necessary but that it has been doing a good job and can do an even better job in a more widespread way in future.</P>

    <Title>Central Bank Bill, 1963&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend in three respects the Central Bank Act, 1942, which is the principal statute covering Irish central banking.  The amendments are separate and distinct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 is designed to give effect to a suggestion of the Central Bank that it should be empowered to purchase securities of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&mdash;usually known as the World Bank&mdash;which was founded at the Economic Conference held at Bretton <Col N="649" /> Woods in 1944 and of which Ireland became a member in 1957.  The Central Bank is already empowered by section 7 (1) (h) of the Act to purchase, for the purpose of or through its General Fund, securities issued by or guaranteed by any Government. Although the members of the World Bank are Governments, its Bonds are not directly guaranteed by member Governments and, therefore, are not covered by section 7 (1) (h) of the Act.  It is accordingly proposed to make an appropriate amendment to section 7 (1) (h) and to do this in general terms in order that the Central Bank will be empowered&mdash;if it so desires&mdash;to purchase securities which may be issued by any other international bank or financial institution formed by Governments.</P>
    <P>I should say that, while World Bank Bonds are not guaranteed by Governments, they are effectively backed by the status and resources of the World Bank itself, and are regarded as investments of high quality in the United States, which provides the main market for them.  Bonds have been issued by the World Bank on the international capital markets since 1947 and constitute an important part of its finances.  The proceeds of Bond issues go to finance the activities of the World Bank, and are mainly concentrated on productive projects in the less-developed countries.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is intended to replace the provisions in sections 19 (4) (a) and 23 (6) of the 1942 Act regarding the ineligibility of the Governor and Directors of the Central Bank for nomination or election to the Dáil or Seanad or as Uachtarán. The Constitution provides that every citizen who has reached his 35th year of age is eligible for election to the office of President; it does not provide that disqualifications in respect of this office may be imposed by law. It is considered therefore that the provisions in the 1942 Act that the Governor and Directors of the Central Bank are ineligible for election to the office of Uachtarán could be regarded as unconstitutional, and the Bill will repeal them.</P>
    <P>The 1942 Act also provides that the <Col N="650" /> Governor or a Director, while he holds office, shall be disqualified from being nominated or elected and from sitting or receiving payment as a member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann.  On the principle that the legislature should have first claim on a person's services, it is proposed to replace these sections by provisions that the Governor or a Director of the Central Bank who is nominated with his consent as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas, or is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, shall thereupon cease to be Governor or Director of the Bank, and that any person who is for the time being entitled to sit in either House of the Oireachtas shall, while so entitled, be disqualified from being or becoming Governor or Director of the Bank. The repeal of the existing provisions is provided for in section 3 (ii) and (iii) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, in section (3) (i) of the Bill, it is proposed, at the Central Bank's suggestion, to remove the prohibition on the payment of interest on deposits made with the Bank by Ministers of State, public authorities and the commercial banks.  Section 7 (1) (b) of the 1942 Act empowers the Central Bank to accept such deposits but, as interest may not be paid on them, the Bank has, generally speaking, not exercised this power; potential customers naturally avail themselves of the alternative of placing their cash reserves and other uncommitted funds to earn interest at call, or in short-term liquid securities, elsewhere.  The words &ldquo;not bearing interest&rdquo; were included in section 7 (1) (b) of the 1942 Act following a recommendation of the 1938 Banking Commission on the basis that the general rule at the time was that central banks did not pay interest on deposits.</P>
    <P>In post-war years, however, the tendency has been to leave such matters as payment of interest to the discretion of central banks themselves so that they can exercise their functions freely as conditions require.  The purpose of the restriction, in countries where it still applies, is to prevent central banks from competing with the commercial banks for deposits.  In Ireland, there is, however, no danger of this <Col N="651" /> as the Central Bank is not empowered to accept deposits from the public. The Central Bank considers&mdash;and the Government agree&mdash;that, in line with the evolution of its functions and with a view to strengthening the resources of its General Fund in conformity with the requirements of our expanding economy, the Bank should be free to offer such return to its possible depositors as, in the light of relevant circumstances, it might from time to time deem appropriate.</P>
    <P>In general, this Bill is of a non-contentious nature and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are small and need not give us very much trouble today.  So far as the World Bank is concerned, it is purely a technical matter to suggest that the legislation must be amended to give the Central Bank the power to invest in World Bank securities.  I think most of us believe that such power was there already and the World Bank is clearly in the same position as the participant Governments.  As I understand it, this is only an enabling section and there is nothing that empowers the Government to direct the Central Bank so to invest.  I would ask the Minister, just as a matter of record, to confirm that I am correct in that respect and that the Government have no power to direct the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>The second matter raised here is the question of the qualification of the Governor and Directors of the Central Bank to become members of this or the other House.  Without going into the method of election of the other House, I do not imagine that the fact that a person is a Governor of the Central Bank or a Director of that august body, no matter what his other qualifications may be, would be such as would ensure certain election to this Chamber.  In fact unkind people might make other suggestions as to the possibility of such membership acquiring votes.  However, I do not think we should bother ourselves very much about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> In relation to the third matter here, there are a few points about which I should like clarification.  Section 7 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, provides that the Central Bank may:</P>
    <P>receive deposits (not bearing interest) from a Minister of State or any public authority or any Associated Bank or any other bank or credit institution carrying on business wholly or partly within the State.</P>
    <P>I cannot find anywhere the definition of a credit institution and I should be glad if the Minister would enlighten me as to whether I have missed such definition either in the Act of 1942 or in one of the other Acts associated with it.  I should like to know what is involved in relation to that inclusion.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;Associated Bank&rdquo; is not defined as such in the Act of 1942 but, as far as I can recollect, it was defined in the earlier Currency Act of 1927 and, therefore, the use of that phrase is specifically clarified.  The phrase &ldquo;any other bank&rdquo;, I presume, would cover the case of a bank which is so licensed under the Central Bank Act but is not one of the Associated Banks.  However, I am not clear whether the &ldquo;credit institution&rdquo; phrase has been adequately defined in the legislation.  As we are now changing that clause of the Act, it is desirable we should know exactly where we stand.</P>
    <P>As far as I can recollect&mdash;and I should like confirmation from the Minister in this respect also&mdash;the only other place in the Central Bank legislation where there is any mention of deposits bearing or not bearing interest is section 50 which provides that deposits may not bear interest but it comes into play only when the Central Bank is prepared to certify that a licensed bank is investing more than a reasonable proportion of its funds outside the country.  It is, so to speak, a section designed to increase liquidity in Irish funds and it is not in any way a restrictive section in the sense of narrowing the credit base of a bank.</P>
    <P>I understand that as regards this amendment, the matter is purely voluntary on both sides.  The Central <Col N="653" /> Bank will be empowered to receive deposits at interest.  On the one hand, the Central Bank will not be obliged to receive such deposits and, on the other hand, no licensed bank will be obliged to make deposits at the Central Bank as a result of this legislation. It is desirable that the Minister should clarify that.  He has clarified it to some extent in the copy of his speech which he has circulated, and I must extend on this occasion my thanks to him for his courtesy in supplying the copy and to congratulate him on the speedy manner in which he reacted to the mild reproof.  It is a proper method of dealing with it and I am glad he has done it.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, if I am correct in my assumptions on this section, very little in it and certainly nothing that will make any real difference to the economy as a whole.  Certainly there is nothing in it that will shake us out of our lethargy in regard to economic expansion.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed in this are very trifling and it is perhaps peculiar that these changes, particularly in the light of the last paragraph of the Minister's speech, should be announced on the same day as the revised figures for national income and expenditure are published, figures which show that there was a very much over-optimistic assessment at an earlier date of our progress in 1962.  The increase in national product of 2½ per cent in 1962 shows a very great slowing down from 1960 and 1961 and emphasises that there has to be a very great change if the targets suggested in the Blue Book recently issued are to have any possibility of achievement.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to us since we received the figures for national income and expenditure this morning, it would appear to me that they show that in 1962 some £40 million of the increase in national product at current prices was due entirely to inflation of prices or, putting it another way, to a decline in the value of money&mdash;that only some £16 million was a real increase.  Of the balance of £56 million, £40 million represents <Col N="654" /> merely a decline in the value of money. Taking that on the figures, it would seem that as a result of the Minister's stewardship in the year 1962, the value of money decreased by just under six per cent.  That is not a thing of which any Minister for Finance can be proud&mdash;to feel that in one year the value of money decreased by six per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill will do very much to provide any alteration of that pattern and I hope that when we get to the figures for 1963, we shall find that there has not been a similar reduction in the value of the Irish pound during the current year.  I am afraid we will find it, though I do not quite understand at what actual date those figures were taken, whether they are averaged over the whole year or whether they are a global adding up of the entire GNP in the year, or whether the Central Statistics Office take them at certain dates and average out on that.</P>
    <P>One thing is quite certain, that is, that the figures in relation to national product will show a very substantial increase because of the decline in the value of money, because of increases in prices following on the imposition of the Minister's turnover tax, so that those figures for the moment will not be up because of a genuine rise in production.  A six per cent decline in the value of money in one year is a serious matter.  I think it is a matter which should engage the urgent attention of the Government to ensure that such an increase in 1962 will not be followed by a worse increase in 1964 and that Governmental policy will be devoted towards the suppression of those causes that would mean the value of our money would decline rather than that they should, by their own positive action, decrease the value of the note or coin in people's pockets.</P>

      <P>As far as the question raised by Deputy Sweetman on section 1 goes, he is right in saying it is an enabling clause.  There is no direction to the Central Bank that they must invest in World Bank Bonds and the Government will not be in a position to give them a direction to <Col N="655" /> that effect at any time.  &ldquo;Credit institution&rdquo;, as far as I know, is not defined in any of those Acts but is a general term for dealing with those various institutions dealt with in the Bill. I should like to have a look at it before the next Stage of the Bill is reached to see if there is any reason why we should deal with the definitions already given.</P>
      <P>Again in this clause there is no compulsion on the Central Bank to offer interest to commercial banks or Government Departments; neither is there compulsion on the Government or on the commercial banks to make lodgments with the Central Bank. It will be purely a voluntary effort on both sides.  This is one point on which I must disagree with Deputy Sweetman. I think it is an important function, because it will enable the Central Bank to become a most important financial institution within the State. Deputies are aware that for some years the commercial banks have been doing clearing for internal transactions with the Central Bank and it was possible to pay interest because the money was there for a specific purpose, but if a commercial bank, instead of making a lodgment with some of the finance houses in London, thought it well from the point of view of the country to make some lodgments with the Central Bank in order to provide for its liquidity, they could do it, but not because they would get interest.  This will enable the banks to increase that movement for the purpose of liquidity with the Central Bank instead of with London, and we may reach the position eventually where the greater part of that particular asset of the commercial banks will be held here rather than in London.</P>

The Deputy may be curious to know in what circumstances a Government Department would make a lodgment there.  I intend to lodge some of the assets of the Post Office Savings Bank Fund with the Central Bank to give some of the business to the Central Bank as we do at the moment, and to have a proportion of that fund in London, so that it can be at call if there is any rush on the Post Office Savings Fund.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is the tenth Telephone Capital Bill to come before Dáil Éireann since the transfer of services in 1922, and the fifth since the War.  Its <Col N="657" /> purpose is, briefly, to authorise the Minister for Finance to advance further moneys, up to a limit of £30 million, for continued development of the telephone service.  The advances will be made as required over the next five years approximately.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the telephone service falls under two heads.  Ordinary day-to-day operation and maintenance are paid for out of moneys voted annually by the Oireachtas under the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Extension and development, on the other hand, are covered by funds provided under Telephone Capital Acts.</P>
    <P>These Acts empower the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund sums, not exceeding a fixed total, for development of the telephone service.  The issues are made on foot of annual Capital Works Estimates approved by the Minister for Finance. The Acts also authorise the Minister for Finance to borrow in order to meet or repay the issues from the Central Fund.  The moneys required for repayment of the sums borrowed are provided annually under sub-head G of the Post Office Vote.</P>
    <P>The Telephone Capital Act, 1960, authorised the Minister for Finance to issue a total of £10 million for telephone development.  This amount, together with a balance on hands from previous legislation, made some £10,805,000 available for expenditure. It was intended that this would last about five years.  Owing to the rapid rise in the public demand for telephone service, however, the planned rate of expansion proved inadequate, and it was necessary to approve increased capital allocations each year. Expenditure during the three financial years ended 31st March last amounted to £8,250,000 leaving a balance of £2,555,000.  This balance is insufficient to cover the capital programme for the current financial year which is estimated to cost £4½ million.</P>
    <P>The amount of £8¼ million approximately which was spent in the last three financial years included some £4½ million for subscribers' lines and installations, over £1 million for exchanges, £2 million for trunk routes <Col N="658" /> and the balance for buildings and stockholdings.  During this period, 45,000 new subscribers' lines were connected to the system, 44,000 miles of new trunk circuits were added and over 230 kiosks were erected.  These additions represented increases of 45 per cent, 70 per cent and 60 per cent respectively over the additions made in the three preceding years.  Subscriber trunk dialling was extended to most of the major automatic exchanges and this facility is now available to 73 per cent of all subscribers.  Additional cross-channel circuits were provided&mdash; we now have over 260 as against 24 in 1946&mdash;and direct transatlantic telephone circuits were established between this country and North America.  During this period also a very considerable amount of engineering work developed on the telephone side of my Department in connection with the setting-up of the Irish television service.</P>
    <P>The provision of the direct transatlantic circuits possibly merits special mention.  Up to 1962 all our overseas telephone traffic was routed through and controlled at London.  On 1st July, 1962, a direct route from Dublin to New York was established to carry traffic to North and South America, Canada and parts of Asia. Not only has revenue been sufficient to cover the annual charges, but a handsome surplus was shown in the first year of operation and an excellent standard of service was given.  The number of circuits was increased last month from two to four.  The additional circuits will enable an even speedier service to be given to the public and it is expected that revenue will continue to be more than sufficient to meet the rental charge.</P>
    <P>The expansion and development of the service generally which I have briefly described was, of course, far greater than that achieved in any previous three year period and in normal circumstances my Department could point to it with some satisfaction. The circumstances in the past few years, however, were anything but normal.  There was an unprecedented increase in demand for telephone service, as will be illustrated by the <Col N="659" /> following figures.  Applications for new telephones, which numbered 6,700 in 1953 and 10,600 in 1958, are expected to reach 16,500 in the current year.  Between 1953 and 1958 the traffic rose from 92 million calls to 120 million, and it will be of the order of 178 million in 1963.  This spectacular growth and the inability of the developing service to keep pace with it, resulted in enlarging the waiting list for telephones.  A more serious consequence was that our trunk and exchange equipment became inadequate to cater satisfactorily for traffic during peak working hours.</P>
    <P>These deficiencies became most apparent during the Summer of 1963, when delays in effecting calls were common on many routes, and when even the automatic system suffered serious congestion at times.  These deficiencies did not grow overnight, however, and their causes were many. The principal cause was the severe shortage of capital during the 1950's, when the telephone service was afforded a low priority in the allocation of the limited finance available.  Development planning was therefore necessarily restricted to short term measures, sufficient to keep the service going rather than to cater adequately for growth and maintain necessary reserves of plant.  The consequent depression of spare capacity of lines and equipment coincided with the steep rise in public demand which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Long-term planning, and expansion of plant in advance of actual need, are especially vital in the telephone service. The provision of a large auto manual exchange involves years of work in acquiring a suitable site, erecting a building and installing equipment and necessary outlets to other centres. Moreover, trunk and local cables have to be ordered many years ahead to ensure that necessary spare circuits will be available when required by people who, when this planning should be taking place, may be a long way even from thinking of setting up their homes. It is possible by short-term planning and by using up existing spare equipment without replacing it, to keep capital costs at a low level for a time, <Col N="660" /> but unless public demand falls off&mdash;an unlikely contingency at the present stage in this country&mdash;a situation eventually develops in which there is a major hold-up on all fronts.  This situation was encountered last summer when peak public demand high-lighted the shortage of trunk circuits and exchange equipment.  As a result subscribers experienced irritating delays and difficulties in completing calls.</P>
    <P>Another general cause of complaint during the summer months was delay in securing a reply from exchanges, and particularly from Dublin trunk exchanges.  The equipment shortages to which I have referred and the difficulties which they created led to an immense spate of calls to the trunk exchanges from subscribes who experienced problems in dialling their own calls.  Not merely did this enormously increase the load of calls reaching operators, but the operators themselves, to whom I wish to pay special tribute for their untiring and patient efforts, had the same difficulties as subscribers in completing calls through the overloaded network.</P>
    <P>The explanations I have given for failure to give a sufficiently satisfactory service in 1963 would be misleading if I did not add that by no means all subscribers had trouble with calls and the best proof that the needs of the public were met in very large part is the fact that the record number of 175 million calls were effected during the past year.  The vast majority of these calls were made without trouble or delay.  It is estimated that in the case even of calls controlled by operators, which are obviously the most difficult section of the traffic handled, more than two out of every three were connected without any delay and more than four out of every five within 15 minutes.  Naturally, my Department is not satisfied with the standard recorded in these figures, and will spare no effort to improve it, but the factual picture which they give is far more favourable than the general impression which many people may have formed of the state of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned capital starvation over the years and the huge increase <Col N="661" /> in public demand as the principal reasons for the defects that exist in the telephone service.  There were other factors also that hampered the Department in its efforts to make timely provision for necessary expansion of the system.  Delivery terms for telephone equipment became longer and more uncertain.  At the same time, industrial expansion at home and abroad created a tremendous demand for skilled personnel, especially in the field of electrical engineering, and my Department was in consequence unable to recruit engineers in the numbers desired.</P>
    <P>I have considered it necessary to cover the past in some detail but my real concern is, of course, with the future.</P>
    <P>My Department is now faced with the task of bringing the telephone service up to a satisfactory standard in the shortest possible time, and of establishing adequate reserves of plant capacity to cater for future growth. In order to give the House a general picture of the amount of work involved in this, I should explain that up to 1963, apart from the main co-axial routes connecting Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dundalk and Sligo two radio links and a few short runs of cable, the service was dependent on open wire circuiting.  Plans were laid in 1959, 1960 and 1961, which are now maturing, for the bringing into service of high capacity underground cable and radio links to serve Dublin-Wicklow-Arklow, Waterford-Clonmel, Waterford-Wexford-Enniscorthy, Carlow-Athy-Portlaoise, Limerick-Rathkeale-Tralee-Killarney-Listowel and Limerick-Athlone-Galway. These schemes range in cost from about £100,000 to £250,000 each.</P>
    <P>Further plans for which contracts are at the moment under consideration include co-axial routes from Dublin to Ceannanus Mór, from Cork to Bandon, Cork to Youghal and Limerick to Tipperary.  Other trunk schemes approved and in hand amount to some £2 million and schemes approved in principle will come to about a similar sum.  Examples of the increased circuiting provided in schemes recently completed or <Col N="662" /> approaching completion are Dublin-Arklow, 100 per cent increase; Waterford-Clonmel, 100 per cent increase; and Limerick-Tralee, 200 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>All the additional circuiting to which I have referred as recently provided or due to be provided shortly, was planned and ordered a considerable time ago, and major projects now in the planning and design stages will not mature in the form of working circuits for several years.  This is something which my Department cannot control.  As I have said on several occasions the design, procurement and installation of this sort of equipment is an extremely slow business.  Of the orders for stores and works which are at present with contractors for execution more than 2¾ million pounds worth are outstanding for more than a year, 1½ million pounds worth over two years and £185,000 worth over three years.</P>
    <P>The £30 million capital expenditure provided for under the Bill now before the House represents our estimate of the cost of the works programme which it is hoped to carry out in the next five years or so.  It is an ambitious programme, which will cost almost as much as has been spent on telephone development since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>It envisages the following main tasks: the connection of 115,000 new subscribers' lines, the conversion of some hundreds of manually-operated exchanges to automatic working, the opening of an auxiliary trunk exchange in Dublin, the erection of 600 street kiosks, and the expansion of trunk circuiting in order to overtake arrears, to establish a no-delay service and to cater for expansion.  It also includes the provision of a new cross channel link.</P>
    <P>In round figures the principal expenditure heads will be: £16¼ million on subscribers' exchange lines and apparatus, £7½ million on trunk circuits, £4¾ million on equipment of new exchanges and extension of existing exchanges, £1 million on buildings and £½ a million on increased stock-holdings.</P>
    <P>This brief listing of the objectives <Col N="663" /> of the programme naturally gives no picture of the magnitude of the problems to be overcome in order to achieve them.  The hundreds of new exchanges required involve the acquisition of sites, each of which must for technical reasons be selected within a restricted area, and the design and erection of buildings.  Cables for subscribers' circuits must be laid throughout the length and breadth of the country and each cable must be designed throughout its whole course to give the number of circuits estimated to be needed by future subscribers. The most skilled engineering planning is involved in provision of trunk needs. Technical possibilities are constantly changing in this field and in order to get satisfactory results our engineers must keep abreast of all modern developments that might suit our requirements and conditions.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will be aware that while some years ago all telephone circuits consisted of pairs of wires erected on poles, later developments enabled equipment to be fitted to these wires which multiplied the speech channels.  Later still, our main backbone trunk network was laid in underground cables equipped to give hundreds of speech channels.  In recent years the circuits on shorter distance routes have been provided in cables, both aerial and underground.  In the cross-channel service the number of circuits was multiplied many times over by fitting newly-designed submarine repeaters, of which those Deputies who visited the recent Scientific Exhibition at the RDS will have seen an example.  More recently still, the development of micro-wave links which have been used on the Athlone-Galway and other routes has opened up new possibilities and they are likely to be used extensively in future on many routes which hitherto would have had to be served by underground cable.  The types of automatic exchanges becoming available have also shown radical developments and more can be expected.</P>
    <P>From the outline I have given of the works programme ahead, it will be clear that substantial increases in <Col N="664" /> engineering staff will be needed.  To ensure that the necessary quotas of trained personnel will be available in the different grades is one of the major problems confronting the Department. There is a general international shortage of electrical engineers and we have been unable in the past to get all those we need, although I may say that in our efforts to recruit them we have cut formalities to the absolute minimum.  It is, of course, possible that the recruitment situation may improve but we cannot count on this or defer other action in hopes of it.</P>
    <P>We have examined, therefore, what can be done to ensure that development will not be impeded by shortage of engineers.</P>
    <P>As a first step it was decided recently to set up a new sub-professional grade in the Department to take over some of the routine work at present done by professional engineers and release them for the higher technical work which is more properly their task and for which they are qualified. The relief that can be provided in this way is, of course, limited.  In addition, therefore, it has been decided in principle to introduce a scheme of scholarships whereby a number of young men will be selected annually to attend full-time day courses of study to enable them to acquire professional engineering qualifications.  Some of the scholarships will be offered for competition among serving sub-professional staff while the remainder will be offered for competition among Secondary School Leaving Certificate holders.</P>
    <P>This scheme will not, of course, bear fruit for some years and in the meantime the Department will adopt whatever practical short-term expedients are open to it to meet the situation.  In particular, it is hoped by giving out as much work as possible to contractors to reduce in some degree the pressure on the Department's own staff resources and the possibility is not excluded of giving part of the work of planning as well as execution of major jobs to contractors. Despite these various measures we must face the possibility that shortage of professional engineers may in some degree hamper progress. <Col N="665" /> At the workman level we have been building up the force steadily and the Estimate provision of 2,860 for the current year is 50 per cent greater than that of five years ago.  Much still remains to be done, however, and special action has been taken to step up the rate of intake especially of youths to be trained for the skilled grades, and to intensify training.  I am happy to say that we have received very full co-operation from vocational education committees in providing the additional courses which the increased intake necessitates and we are deeply grateful for this.</P>
    <P>As a five year period is needed to bring the service to the desired state of efficiency and to cater fully for traffic and for persons requiring telephones, Deputies will appreciate that in the earlier years of that period all demands on the service cannot be met in full. The most urgent item in the development programme is to expand the trunk network which suffered more than any other part of the system from the capital restrictions of the past.  I have directed my Department to give special priority to this work, even though the connection of new telephones for a large number of applicants will have to be deferred in consequence. I am fully satisfied that this is the proper course to follow in present circumstances.  It will be an unpopular course, but it is the only one that offers a reasonable prospect of eliminating quickly the possibility of conditions of congestion such as occurred in many sections of the network during the summer months of 1963.</P>
    <P>I feel that Deputies generally will acknowledge the prudence of this decision, but I would like them also to accept the implications of it, which are that the waiting list in many areas will continue to grow for some time ahead.  I cannot usefully say how long this will go on but according as essential works are completed from district to district, it will be possible to resume the connection of individual subscribers.</P>
    <P>On the same subject, I should like to emphasise that my direction to concentrate intensively on trunk work will affect some applications for telephone <Col N="666" /> service which, on the basis of earlier policy, would have been met within the next few months.  Many of these applicants were advised of their prospects at the time and will now be disappointed to learn that they will have to wait somewhat longer.  It is with great regret that I find that the general situation which has developed has made it impossible to fulfil the hopes held out to these people originally.  I hope they will be induced to be as patient as possible by the assurance which I now give that there will be no avoidable delay in giving them service.  The planned programme I have been describing will, when under way, enable the waiting list to be rapidly reduced.</P>
    <P>Completion of the programme is going to tax the capacity of the Department to the limit.  I do not wish to leave anyone in any doubt about this.  On the other hand, as I have explained, much work has already been done in advance of this Bill in the way of planning and ordering the equipment needed for the programme.  The work to be done in the remainder of this year, and next year, and indeed even further ahead depends in large degree on decisions already taken and orders already placed.  Delivery dates of some specially engineered equipment may be as long as three years.  For new exchanges to be provided in future years we have already acquired 37 sites, we are in active negotiation for acquisition of another 27 sites and a further 34 sites have been selected for acquisition.</P>
    <P>Moreover, 41 buildings for major exchanges are already completed or in course of erection or are at the planning stage.  In Dublin, a new main stores headquarters building is at the tender stage which will enable the most efficient stores handling methods to be introduced and plans are advanced for centralisation of engineering staffs at present scattered in buildings throughout the city.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word about the financial position of the telephone service.  In the commercial accounts prepared in respect of each financial year, the revenue earned by the telephone <Col N="667" /> service is shown as income. Against this is charged expenditure incurred on the operation and maintenance of the service, interest on the total capital employed, and the provision in respect of depreciation and superannuation.  Having provided for these charges the telephone service heretofore has shown a surplus of income over expenditure and has never involved any levy on the taxpayer.  If the existing rate of return on capital is maintained over the period covered by the Telephone Capital Bill, the telephone service will, over the same period, have contributed over £11 million from its own resources by way of depreciation provision and surplus revenue, and will in addition have contributed £9.25 million approximately to the Exchequer by way of interest on capital, thus substantially reducing the net draw on the Exchequer towards meeting the capital outlay provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I may sum up by saying that the task we are setting ourselves is a difficult one but difficulties are there to be overcome and we shall overcome them in one way or another.  Our ultimate aim is to have a fully automatic service and a reserve of plant and equipment that will enable new subscribers to be given telephones on demand and all calls to be connected without delay.  The present programme will not carry us as far as this but it aims at eliminating the waiting list and providing a thoroughly satisfactory call service.  If we succeed in this programme, and I have no doubt we shall, this capital sum will have been well spent.  The day is gone when the telephone was a luxury service. An adequate communications system is now an essential requirement for the expansion of all business activities and my Department is aware of the contribution it must make towards facilitating the many forms of public development on which the country depends, not to mention social activity and the convenience of individuals. The moneys to be provided under this Bill will enable these responsibilities to be met and I recommend the Bill to the House for approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill and we are pleased the Minister has brought it in for the development of the telephone service.  When the Minister's Estimate was being considered here, we put down a motion to refer it back on the ground that the telephone service was not being developed adequately.  We felt that was necessary because there was nothing like what could be regarded as an efficient telephone service.  It is one service, as the Minister has just pointed out, that is paying its way.  There are many projects which the Government have undertaken and in which the capital is not being serviced but this is one in which the capital is being serviced. From that point of view, we felt the Government should have extended the service earlier and put much more money into its development.  It gives good employment which is spread over the work involved in laying underground cables and the other types of work within the service.  It is employment which is badly needed.</P>
      <P>As the Minister also pointed out, the telephone is no longer a luxury service.  It is a necessity and has been such for many years.  The Minister sought the co-operation of the House but I thought it was in bad taste to suggest that a lot of the trouble was due to the scarcity of capital in the 1950s.  At that period the capital provided was ample to meet the demand and there is no use referring to it.  The Minister is getting co-operation and he should be very grateful for that without referring back to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to see the position in which telephones would be available practically on demand.  Week after week when the Dáil is sitting, questions are addressed to the Minister by different Deputies asking how many applications there are for telephones, when it is hoped they will be supplied and how many have been supplied over the past 12 months.  Deputies do not put down these questions merely for the purpose of annoying the Minister or creating friction.  They put them down because they are being pressed by their constituents.  I am pressed in the same manner.  Recently I wrote to the Minister about a man who has <Col N="669" /> been appointed a purchaser of livestock. I thought it would be considered very important that this man would have a telephone&mdash;engaging, as he is, in the major industry of the country, attending markets, and so on. The Minister wrote and said he regretted he could not provide a telephone within a reasonable time.  I wrote again to the Minister about it as I felt it was a very serious case but again I got the same reply, that only clergymen and doctors got priority. The Minister should give priority when important business is concerned&mdash;important not alone to this man but from the point of view of the agricultural industry in general in the country.</P>
    <P>I thought that, with the money being provided now, we would be much nearer satisfying the demand for telephones. I understand there are 10,000 applications.  According to the Minister, even applications already promised will now go back further in the list.  That is disappointing.  I thought that not alone would they not be put back but that we would get an earlier service due to this extra money.  I appreciate that it may take a long time to order heavy equipment but we feel the people will be disappointed that they are not getting the service sooner.</P>
    <P>This Bill, I might mention, was announced at the height of the Subpostmasters strike when there were protests all over the country from newspapers and from every public body about the mishandling of the telephone service and of the Post Office in general.</P>

      <P>It is a good thing that that business has been settled.  We welcome very much the scholarships. <Col N="670" /> We appreciate that there is a shortage of trained engineering personnel in the Post Office and other services at present, especially with the very large expansion which is going on, and we welcome the scholarships which have been set up.</P>
      <P>The telephone service, as I mentioned in my speech on the Estimates, should be put on the same basis as the ESB.  They should plan ahead and any subscribers who want to be connected should be able to get connection without delay.  Again, I would ask the Minister to make special provision for people in business who require to get into touch with people in different parts of the country and to give them the service which they so badly require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, we welcome anything which the Minister and the Government can do to try to improve the telephone system in this country.  Realising that we cannot have developments or improvements without the necessary money, we are prepared to support the provision for the money.  It is only fair to say, as the last speaker commented, that while the timing of the speech announcing this measure appeared to be for a political reason&mdash;I said &ldquo;appeared to be&rdquo;&mdash;we are prepared to give credit to the Minister for at least having the courage to look for what he thought was the necessary amount of money to do the job.</P>
      <P>Over the years all of us here in this House have condemned Ministers for not doing what we thought they should do and for not giving the service which we thought the public were entitled to.  It is only fair that, when a Minister decides he will try to get the necessary money to do a job, all of us should give him whatever support he needs to have that carried out.  For that reason, we welcome this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While admitting that over the past few months there has been a decided improvement, particularly in trunk dialling, nevertheless during the Summer recess this year everything went haywire.  I am sure the Minister was sick and tired of people asking questions and making personal <Col N="671" /> complaints even to him.  I have done so myself, in an attempt to get a number which I could not otherwise get. But there is one thing which was carried out and I want to record my strongest personal objection to it.  I refer to the system whereby you can have what they call double-charge priority.  If somebody wants to call from one number to a number somewhere else in the country and he dials it or it cannot be got he asks the Exchange to get it and is told, in effect: &ldquo;We are sorry.  There is a delay of one hour, two hours or three hours&rdquo;.  If people are prepared to pay double-charge, they can have the number at a snap of the fingers.  I do not think that system should be in existence.  Everybody who has a telephone or who is using a telephone and pays the charge is entitled to the same priority as somebody who has money enough to pay the double charge.  That practice should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>With regard to the training of staff to deal with the engineering problem, I think that is a good idea. Unfortunately, at the present time in this country there is a great shortage of engineers in practically every field of industry.  Possibly it may be something which will right itself in a year or so.  Possibly it is something which will never right itself.</P>
    <P>I am told that one of the biggest troubles is the amount of remuneration the engineer gets in this country compared with what he can get elsewhere. If that is so, the Minister can suggest to the Government that engineers be paid a decent rate.  There is no point in voting £30 million to the Minister to do a job if he says he has not the necessary technical staff, that they will not work for the money they are being offered and that, therefore, he cannot go ahead with the job.  If that is part of the problem, the Minister should ask to have made available the money necessary to pay those people.  Furthermore, he should continue to train not alone school-leavers, as he suggests, but also those who are working in the job.  I am aware that promotion has been given to certain people who have worked on this type of <Col N="672" /> job over the past number of years but I suggest the Minister should go even further.  Possibly my approach to this may be entirely different from his approach or from that of a number of other Deputies here.  However, I find that the man who has practical experience of a job is very often a much better man to do it than a man with a very high degree of technical skill, according to the training he got in some of the universities, but who, in fact, does not know as much about the day-to-day work of the job as the man who is at it every day.</P>
    <P>If the Minister gets his officials to check down through the list of men who are doing even menial tasks in the Post Office engineering section he will find quite a number of people who would be able to assist very much in this problem if they were given a chance.  I do not want to decry the efforts which the Minister has already made but I suggest he could go a lot further&mdash;even if it should be necessary to give a short-term course to those people before they are advanced to do that type of work.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talks about giving training to school leavers to bring them up to engineering grade for Post Office work, he should not lose sight of the fact that this is a relatively short-term job and he should ensure that those who are trained for this work will not, when the job is completed, as completed it must be in the course of time, find themselves at a dead-end, with no outlet of any kind, and with no chance of being offered employment elsewhere because they will not have certain degrees to commend them.  I appeal to the Minister to bear that fact in mind when making the arrangements he adumbrated here this morning.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about passing over some of the work to contractors.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs has been giving a uniformly high standard of work and it would be a pity if that standard were allowed to drop because of the work being given out to someone anxious to make a fast buck; there is always the danger of that if work is farmed out.  If at all <Col N="673" /> possible, the Minister should continue to do the work by direct labour.</P>
    <P>It is rather perturbing to hear that not alone may the Minister not be able to give immediate connection to subscribers who have already applied but that those who were notified they would get connection in a reasonable time must wait a little longer and possess their souls in patience so that a better service may be given to those who already have connections.  Human nature being what it is, we find it a little difficult to accept that particular piece of philosophy.  The Minister may be doing himself an injustice, but surely it should be possible to continue giving connections in many areas.</P>

      <P>That is not clear from the Minister's speech.  Where it is possible he should go ahead with giving connections.  The suggestion made by the Minister was that these people might have to wait a very long time.</P>
      <P>Now I understand that if a connection is being given to someone over three miles from an exchange, there is a charge of 8/- per furlong added on to their rent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult, I admit, to make comparisons between furlongs and £.s.d.  At least we have straightened it out.  They pay 8/- per furlong per quarter.  Now the location of exchanges is purely incidental and accidential.  If there were, for example, an exchange in Dunshaughlin the people in the area would be able to have their telephone calls at the normal charge.  In fact, the exchange for that area is in Dunboyne and there is quite a large area around Kilbricken where people have to pay extra just because the Post Office people decided to locate the exchange somewhere else. That is unfair.  On reflection, I am sure the Minister will agree that something can be done to improve that situation.</P>
      <P>I come now to poles.  The Minister stated that now most of the lines are going underground.  That is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Everett laid the first underground cable between Dublin and Sligo in 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Many cables have been laid since then.  Is it necessary now to have a pole before connection can be made to a house?  You find a single 35-foot pole outside a private house or business premises.  It is unsightly. It looks stupid.  Surely it should be possible now to effect connection with an underground cable.  These single poles are like sore thumbs defacing the countryside.  Will the Minister take steps to have something done to remedy that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the provision of kiosks, I am aware these have to be scheduled the previous year in order to ensure the programme is properly planned.  It is not, however, properly appreciated that because there are half a dozen private telephones in an area that does not answer the problem of those who have no telephones and who may require a priest, a doctor, or someone else, during the night.  People are very kind, but even the kindest people resent being disturbed night after night so that a neighbour can use the telephone.  Kiosks should be <Col N="675" /> erected.  The fact that the telephone in the local post office is not used as it should be is not the answer to this problem.  In heavily built-up areas and in the more backward parts of the country kiosks should be provided in central positions.</P>
    <P>Reverting again for a moment to the recruitment of technical staff, I suggest that staff should be recruited as far as possible from the people who have been trained in the work.  The Minister might usefully approach the Department of Defence; he would find he could get quite a number of trained personnel from the Signal Corps.  They might be glad of civilian employment and they would help considerably in implementing the programme planned. At the end of the Emergency the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash; they are to be commended for it&mdash; absorbed numbers of ex-servicemen. They are still doing that.  They were foremost in all the Departments of State in providing employment for these men.</P>
    <P>We support the Bill.  If money is needed, then this House will have to provide it.  We appreciate that every effort is being made.  I agree completely with the Minister's statement that those who operate the telephone services, particularly over the bad winter this year, deserve the gratitude of the general public.  While all of us have been very annoyed from time to time by long delays, on reflection we must agree we had a group of people who must have had the patience of Job to listen to all the complaints and still remain civil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We will give the Minister the money he seeks without objection.  At the same time, I take a little amiss the statement of the Minister regarding the shortage of capital:</P>
      <P>The principal cause was the severe shortage of capital during the 1950s when the telephone service was afforded a low priority in the allocation of the limited finance available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time the telephone service was adequate for the then demand.  In <Col N="676" /> those years also, a good deal of money was spent on the pioneering work of laying underground cables.  We shall leave the matter at that.</P>
    <P>I could make a good deal of complaint about the delay in getting an answer from exchanges.  I do not blame the people in the exchanges because, whenever I ask them, I discover it is due to their being understaffed.  Now that the Department are about to change over to automatic working, it appears to be their policy not to recruit staff for the manually operated exchanges.</P>
    <P>The telephone service from this House itself could be improved, especially at night.  Last year I said that you could dial for 15 minutes, hear the double-beat, indicating that the bell in the exchange was ringing, but not get a reply.  That position has improved very much, but there could be further improvement.</P>
    <P>The Department appear to be loth to recruit outdoor staff&mdash;the people who put up lines and instal telephones. There is practically no increase in the number of those men compared with the number of people looking for telephones.  A social revolution has taken place within the past eight or nine years.  This is illustrated by the case of a young woman, coming from a farm near a village, who married a man with a fine farm in a rather isolated area.  There was a day when such a woman would have had a servant girl as help, but to-day she cannot get anybody.  These people have to live in isolated areas, but they cannot get a telephone.  Applications from such people have been in the Minister's Department for more than a year.  Some applications have been there for years.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being generously given this money; yet he tells us that the overhaul of existing lines will take some years and that an awful lot of work remains to be done.  I take it that will cause a delay in the installation of telephones.  If this work is necessary, the Minister should allocate staff to it.  But if that allocation of staff means that the staff responsible <Col N="677" /> for the installation of telephones is depleted, he should recruit&mdash;perhaps on a temporary basis&mdash;field staff for installation work alone.</P>
    <P>I know of a man who set up in business in an office in a fine market town.  He has been a year and a half waiting for a telephone.  Yet another man who took an office in the same building got the telephone in two months.  It was said he knew somebody. If the Minister is serious, he must give attention to these many urgent applications for telephones. With respect, I think the Department have neglected that end, judging from what is happening in my constituency. I was getting so many letters from my constituents about telephones that I asked some of my colleagues if they were getting the same.  I discovered that some of them were getting even more than I was.  There should be no excuse when this money is voted.  Staff should be recruited immediately for the installation of telephones.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department recruits men on a temporary basis, and these men are glad to get the work.  However, the Department should, I feel, lend them protective clothing.  I have seen some of these men being drenched while doing urgent work.  I know the Minister will agree with this, and I ask him to make inquiries in the Department and point out that this would be an easy thing to do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope the Minister <Col N="678" /> will get on with the work and not have the unfortunate public waiting for telephones on the Kathleen Mavourneen system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure, particularly in view of the big increase in the demand for telephones during the past number of years.  I appreciate it is difficult to meet all these demands within a reasonable time.  One of my main reasons for intervening, however, is to deal with the system applied by the Department in dealing with applications for the installing of telephones.  I find that people who applied a number of years ago have not yet been catered for, although they live closer to the trunk routes than others who have received the service within a reasonably short period.  There is something wrong.  As far as possible, applications should be dealt with in strict rotation.  I know it is difficult to carry that out strictly. Naturally, when the Post Office are linking up a district, they will cover all the applications from that district but there is the consideration that some people have had to wait much longer for a telephone service than is right. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to ensure that long outstanding applications will be dealt with as quickly as possible, unless there are some valid reasons for further delay.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully referred to the question of the erection of kiosks in various centres.  It is of great advantage to have public phone booths in as many places as possible, particularly, where feasible, at crossroads in isolated and remote places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised that the Minister did not approve of the recent request made to have a telephone booth erected in Clonakilty town.  The town has a population of about 2,500 and the only public telephone kiosk there is located within 100 yards of the post office. Naturally, the local people were anxious that a second phone booth be erected at the other end of the town to facilitate the residents there.  Despite various representations made to him, the Minister saw fit to turn down the application, even though every town <Col N="679" /> and village with a population of more than 250 has a public telephone booth, in addition to the telephone that is available in the post office.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is a good idea to have a public phone booth in all towns of more than 250 population.  The Minister should reconsider the application from Clonakilty, having regard to the fact that the population of that town is ten times the number required in order to have a kiosk erected and the necessity for a telephone kiosk at the other end of the town of Clonakilty.</P>
    <P>There are long delays in getting calls in some districts.  That applies particularly to Schull and the Beara Peninsula and other districts.  Occasionally people have to wait for well over a quarter of an hour to get a call and in some isolated cases as much as half an hour.  I am surprised at the statement by the Minister that more than two out of every three were connected without any delay and not more than one out of five people have to wait for more than 15 minutes.  That is an extract from the Minister's statement. It would seem that the Minister is satisfied if not more than one out of five people have to wait for more than 15 minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Read a little more and you will see that I am not satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given the position as it is today and I consider it out of place for the Minister to suggest that one out of five should wait for 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>The Minister is now getting a good deal of money to develop the telephone services.  One important matter is the need to provide phone boxes in small post offices which will provide privacy for persons using the services. The fact that such provision is not made at present results in a big loss to the Post Office.  The Minister should address himself to that question.  If he does, the revenue from the telephone service will increase substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> I do not know whether it is wellfounded or not but there is a belief that in some places business transacted over the phone is not in any way secret.  Whether that is so or not, I am not in a position to say but I am well aware that the existence of that belief results in loss of revenue to the telephone service.  I was surprised on phoning the Minister's Department some time ago to be told that the business I wanted to discuss could not be transacted over the telephone.  That implied that a telephone conversation is not secret, even in the Minister's Department.  The Minister should address himself to this question also because it is a serious disadvantage that the belief should be held by so many citizens that business transacted on the telephone is in no way secret and that there are people who make it their business to listen in to conversations on the telephone.</P>
    <P>I have no technical knowledge of the phone system but I do know that a number of people will not use the telephone service for the purpose of transacting business as they would do if they were satisfied that the system was secret.  It is imperative that the Minister should make a statement with reference to it.  There is considerable loss of revenue involved and, also, a good deal of inconvenience to citizens who occasionally have to make long journeys to carry out business that could be transacted over the phone, if the people had confidence in the secrecy of the system.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by asking the Minister to try to do something for applicants who have been waiting for more than two years for a telephone service.  It is not asking too much to ask that applicants who have been waiting for more than two years should get immediate consideration.  I would also ask the Minister to provide privacy for people making calls in small post offices in country areas.  I would reiterate my request to the Minister to address himself to the question of the secrecy of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>Posts and Telegraphs in the problem</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has been very patient with the Minister for <Col N="681" /> that he seems to have found virtually insuperable of getting a rational telephone service in the country.  My patience, certainly, is exhausted when I see in the Minister's official statement a falsehood which he ought to be ashamed of seeking to foist on this House.  On page 4 of his manuscript, he says that the principal cause for his own shortcomings&mdash;this is his principal defence for his own failure to discharge the elementary duties of a competent Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;the principal cause, he says, of his failure was the severe shortage of capital into the 1950s when the telephone service was given a low priority in the allocation of the limited finance available.  That is a malignant falsehood.  The Minister ought to know that and it is a scandal that he would insert a paragraph of that kind in his statement.  Of course, the statement was circulated to the Press before the Minister stood up to speak here and the hope is that its contents will go unchallenged because people are concerned now to get the service and not to controvert that kind of statement. However, I intend to controvert it and I hope, having controverted it, not for the first time, by figures from the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, that falsehood will not be further repeated in this House.</P>
      <P>In 1953, according to the Minister, there were 6,700 applications outstanding for telephones; in 1951, two years before that situation rose, £1,800,000 had been made available under the Telephone Capital Acts, and in 1952 £2,600,000 was made available.  Let us read the record, and it is all available to anybody who wants to look at it in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> which is published annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the war years, issues under the Telephone Capital Acts naturally fell to a low figure because supplies were not available.  In 1946, there was only £100,000 made available; in 1947, it was £353,000; and in 1948, the first year of the inter-Party Government when the late Deputy Keyes was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the appropriation was only £335,000. In 1949, £1,225,000 was supplied under the Telephone Capital Acts; <Col N="682" /> in 1950, £1,250,000; in 1951, £1,800,000 and in 1952, £2,600,000.  It is true that Fianna Fáil came back into office in that year, and the appropriation of the following year fell to £1,950,000 and was further cut by that Fianna Fáil Administration to £1,050,000.  We returned to office in 1955 and the telephone capital issues in our first Budget amounted to £1,400,000.  The following year, 1956, they were £1,750,000, and the following year, they were £1,650,000.  Then Fianna Fáil came back to office again and in their first Budget, the appropriation under the Telephone Capital Acts was reduced from £1,650,000 to £1,150,000, by £500,000, in 1958.  In 1959, they gave £1,450,000 but they cut it again in 1960 to £1,350,000, and this at a time when demand for telephones was steeply rising.</P>
    <P>I compare that performance with the performance of Deputy Everett who was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and who, in anticipation of the demand, laid a cable from Dublin to Sligo which I believe is still providing excess capacity, and that cable was laid nearly ten years ago.  As I say, I think the House has been very patient with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Deputies from all parts of the House have had a steady stream of correspondence from constituents bitterly complaining about their inability to get telephone installations and the unsatisfactory service after the telephones have been installed.  The Minister has excused himself on the grounds that he had not the equipment, that the demand was very heavy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised that the Minister finds it hard to face the truth because he has been extended such indulgence by the House in the past and indeed I was prepared to continue that today but for the flagrant falsehood, the considered falsehood, contained in his statement which he advances as an alibi for his own deplorable performance.  It is because he has sought to shelter under slander of his predecessors that I have felt it right to expose him to the real rebuke which his deplorable administration of the Department deserves.</P>
      <P>There is no use in our pretending any longer that forbearance must be the order of the day.  I am only saying to the Minister's face what everybody else is saying behind his back, and my only regret is that the forbearance shown him so far has emboldened him to insert that falsehood in his speech, the insertion of which has called from me the correction which I now administer to him and which ought to serve as a warning that there is a limit to the patience of this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks of the inadequacy of the equipment available to him for the provision of services and he assures the House that he intends to exert himself to remedy these deficiencies as fast as he can.  The general authorisation for the Minister for Finance to make advances under the Telephone Capital Acts has been extended.  That is a necessary thing to do, of course, because the expense of the apparatus and equipment to be purchased is continually rising and, as the value of money declines, the expense of these installations will go on rising, involving a heavier and heavier capital commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no guarantee that the larger authorisation under the Telephone Capital Bill will produce any result if the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs continue the bumbling administration that has characterised their activities during the past five years, but if they put their minds resolutely <Col N="685" /> to the task, there is now authorisation under the Bill to finance all efforts to bring the matter to a successful conclusion. It all depends on whether they avail of that authorisation or not.</P>
    <P>Over and above the provision of actual equipment, it is a howling scandal in this city at the present time that one can ring 10 at any time of the day, but particularly after six o'clock in the evening, and get no reply of any kind.  I have held the instrument in my hand while the bell rang 42 times before anyone answered it.  There is some absolute failure on somebody's part if that kind of thing can happen. I would not complain if somebody answered 10 calls after a reasonable time and said: &ldquo;I am sorry; the lines are overloaded.  Will you call again?&rdquo; I would not mind if somebody answered and said there would be a delay because of overloading, but what is absolutely exasperating is to find nobody answers at all.  What is even more exasperating is that if you turn to 31 to invoke the assistance of the supervisor, there again you may have to hold the instrument until it has rung between 25 and 30 times.  That abuse is peculiarly exasperating after 6 o'clock in the evening.</P>
    <P>I believe the situation could be materially relieved if more staff were attached to the switchboards at that hour.  There appears to be a chronic conviction in the telephone organisation that, after the peak hours of business, there is a decline in demand. The fact is that the whole pattern of telephone user has changed in the past 20 years.  In the past, the peak user of the telephone was related to trade and commerce but, in the changing world in which we live, the telephone has become very much more an instrument on which the ordinary person transacts his social business, so that the peak hours now may extend well into what used to be regarded as the slack period.  Maybe it is that the telephone authorities do not think it is a matter of such urgency that that type of telephone user should have such prompt service, but I think they are wrong.  They should realise that, if they want to get business, they must cater for it.  Apparently at the present <Col N="686" /> time they do not want business.  Perhaps it is that they have too much business already for the amount of equipment they have, but that should not reduce the service to the absurd situation where the bell is allowed to ring 40 times.</P>
    <P>This seems particularly fantastic when you pick up any American magazine or advertising medium and read there the millions of dollars spent every year by the telephone companies in order to persuade people to put in the telephone or, where they have one already, to put in two.  I believe that in the modern world the telephone service should be operated by the community for the community.  It is an interesting commentary that where the telephone is operated by private enterprise in the United States of America, the company operating it has become one of the biggest companies in the United States and has a service of such a character that it is advertising for additional subscribers, whereas we are talking about 310,000 applications outstanding and that it may take two years to clear off the arrears.</P>
    <P>A lot of people may not understand the real financial implications of this whole telephone problem.  They may not realise that, as far as I am aware, the only branch of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which is paying a profit today is the telephone service.  As far as I know, there is not £1 of money employed in the capital expansion of the telephone service that is not fully remunerated by the receipts from the service, and it seems to me to be some kind of insanity which persuades the Minister to allow the service which is profitable to break down when it could be turned into a moneyspinner and made materially to relieve the burden on the Exchequer of the other services which the Minister has a statutory obligation to maintain.</P>
    <P>The Minister has adverted to this at page 13 of his introductory statement when he states:</P>
    <P>If the existing rate of return on capital is maintained over the period covered by the Telephone Capital <Col N="687" /> Bill, the telephone service will, over the same period, have contributed over £11 million from its own resources by way of depreciation, provision and surplus revenue, and will in addition have contributed £9.25 million approximately to the Exchequer by way of interest on capital, thus substantially reducing the net draw on the Exchequer towards meeting the capital outlet provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Bearing that in mind, I want to ask the House to remember that in addition to the capital figures I have read out and which were provided under Telephone Capital Acts from 1948 to 1959, I have no doubt the Department were themselves providing additional moneys from their own resources by way of depreciation provision and surplus revenue.  I should like the Minister to tell us when he comes to reply what additional provision was made in those years from those two sources, apart from the actual money provided under the Telephone Capital Acts from 1948 down to 1959.  These are figures which are not available to the rest of us. They are available only to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I well remember&mdash;and this brings me to the last aspect of the Bill with which I wish to deal&mdash;that when Deputy Everett was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the question of providing a subterranean cable from Dublin to Sligo, with appropriate branch lines, was under consideration. If my memory serves me, there was considerable discussion and argument at Government level as to whether the cable it was first proposed to lay had a sufficient capacity, and the general principle was laid down that the practice of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was generally covered by a Treasury decision going back to the period when the telephone company was first taken over by the State in 1908.  That principle was that the State consented to the acquisition of the service from the private company on the condition that the Treasury were not required to provide money for capital development unless and until the demand existed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> That was the general practice.  Any more insane basis for procedure in installing a telephone system in the country could not be imagined but one can easily understand that in Edwardian and Victorian times, that would be the Treasury's approach to a new undertaking of which the Treasury had yet no experience.  It resulted in this dilemma presenting itself.  We proposed to open a trench in the ground from Dublin to Sligo.  The question was: should we put in the trench a cable adequate for all existing demands or should we say to ourselves that a great part of the cost of the installation was due to the digging of the trench and therefore we should put in a cable that would provide for all anticipated demands for years ahead? There was a revolutionary decision taken then that although the demands were then x, a cable should be put in that would carry two or three times x.  Although the Treasury would have expressed horror at that decision, it seemed right to us to put in a cable that would carry all the anticipated demands.</P>
    <P>Here again the Minister suggests that in the 'fifties nothing was done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not say it but he said that the principal justification for his deplorable failure was the severe shortage of capital in the 'fifties when the telephone service was low in the list of priorities for the limited capital available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time we were building more houses, investing more capital in necessary development and getting on with more essential work by way of capital investment than Fianna Fáil undertook in the previous 20 years or since.  You have evidence of that in two fields.  Arrears of telephone installations in 1953 amounted only to 6,700 and there were no houses falling down on the people in the streets of Dublin. There were cables put in the ground in anticipation of the demands for an extended telephone service. <Col N="689" /></P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister did that much.  It was badly wanted.  The trouble is that all this cheap, fraudulent Fianna Fáil propaganda weakens and distorts intelligent discussion of important matters in this house.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs may have foreseen the necessity for capital and asked for the necessary capital and it may be that the Department of Finance withheld it.  This Government have now been in office for seven years and the situation with regard to the telephone service is worse now than it was seven years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a corporation sole and must accept responsibility for himself and his predecessors in office in his own Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>So I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are that after seven years in office, the Minister's only alibi is that his predecessors did not do enough.  The figures do not confirm that alibi and the attempt to establish that fraudulent alibi has drawn from me the censure which probably was overdue.  What I am saying to his face in public is what 90 per cent of his own supporters are saying behind his back.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to see that energetic measures are put in hand to provide the telephone where it is needed and to provide the circuits to carry the increase in traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to direct his attention to this <Col N="690" /> problem.  In this matter of shortage of circuits, I understand the Minister's dilemma is that if he adds more telephones in a place where such a shortage exists, the only result will be the problem to which Deputy M. P. Murphy referred, of lines becoming crossed and people listening to one another's conversations.  I assume that the overloading of circuits in Dublin explains the exasperating situation which arises when you start dialling a number and half way through, you get the engaged signal.  You find in the case of a number with six digits that after you dial the first two, you get the engaged tone.  Therefore I sympathise with the Minister if he says that he is being pressed to put in further circuits in Drumcondra, Ballsbridge, Glasnevin or Stillorgan.  He wants these additional circuits because the existing circuits will not carry the traffic.</P>
    <P>However, if you are living in Dublin and an emergency arises in which you cannot use your own telephone, you can go to a neighbour's house, to a kiosk or to a local shop and make contact of an emergency nature without intolerable inconvenience. But the Minister's rigorous test in respect of the necessity for circuits should not apply in rural Ireland.  If from time to time emergencies do arise in the rural areas, the corresponding inconvenience of an isolated home not having a telephone at all is a grave matter.  In the city you may have some inconvenience in the casual use of your telephone, but if there is an emergency on hand, the existence of a phone in the house is of incalculable value to people in rural places.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, pending his ability to instal an adequate service in the rural areas, the Minister should allow overloading of the lines rather than refuse the telephone to people in country places who may have to send for the priest or doctor in an emergency or where old people are living alone.  I know cases of old people living alone whose children have scattered.  One child may be in Cork, another in Limerick, Dublin or Dundalk, and their great desire is to <Col N="691" /> mitigate the loneliness of the elderly parent with whom only some female relative or girl is living.  The children would like to have the facility of being able to ring up from time to time and have a chat with the parent.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is hard for the busy and anxious administrators of the national telephone network to have regard to these considerations but in rural Ireland these are very important considerations. They do not fit into the ordinary hierarchy which the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have established of doctors, priests, veterinary surgeons and professional men who are entitled to some priority by virtue of their professional duties. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that instead of adhering rigidly to these priorities, he would be justified in risking overloading the service in rural Ireland and I believe the vast majority of people there would cheerfully suffer any consequent inconvenience if they felt, by suffering it, they were helping the category of persons who had no telephones to get one substantially earlier than they might otherwise hope to do.</P>
    <P>I hope we have heard the last of the Minister's false and dishonest argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that these misfortunes in recent years were due to something that happened ten or 15 years ago.  That is not true.  The provision of capital under the Telephone Capital Acts and other sources was reasonably adequate during the 'fifties, bearing in mind the then-existing demand and the prospective demand at that time.  It is in the past five or six years that the whole programme has collapsed about the Minister's ears.  Probably he has learned his lesson and, but for that unfortunate paragraph in his speech, I think he would have received from the House sympathetic understanding of his problems and enthusiastic readiness to help him to overcome them.  That paragraph has imposed on me the disagreeable duty of recording the truth and I hope the figure to which I have directed attention, having once <Col N="692" /> been put on the record, will never be challenged again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is about time we did something about eliminating some of the poles and wiring in the city and countryside.  The multiplicity of traffic signs, aerials, telephone poles and ESB poles is objectionable.  I mention that because it is a case that has been put to me.  Every ten yards in the street, there is a pole of some type.</P>
      <P>There is another matter I am more concerned about, and which I raised before.  I asked the Minister if it was possible to discover people who use the telephone for purposes other than normal, such as using profane and obscene language, things that only perverts would do.  The Minister said it is very difficult to track down such persons. During the past few months, because of all this Party-game talk about taxes&mdash;that is all it was&mdash;I was subjected to all sorts of abuse and threats.  It is bad enough to have cowardly people writing letters to the newspapers but it is worse to have them ringing you up, using vile language and insulting your wife.  One gentleman made it a practice to ring every morning at about ten past nine for three weeks.  It was the same voice; every sort of filthy language was used to my wife who was up earlier than I was, getting the children out to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One may ask: Why answer the phone?  Living in a busy constituency, my telephone rings about every quarter-hour during the day.  I must answer it.  When you read of certain types of crime in the papers, we see that the gardaí are able to rush to a telephone booth and find out from whom the calls came.  The Minister should protect the citizens from this abuse and members of the House should also have protection.  We have responsibilities and we are expected to do certain things.  At least our phones, our wives and children, should be protected from these perverts. If the call came from a street here, it might be difficult to trace but if it came through an office, it should not be too hard to discover where that office is.  Then an example could be made of some of these people. <Col N="693" /> Occasionally, we read of perverts using the phone to insult females.  Surely the Minister should do something to ensure that these persons can be located and brought to account for their conduct.  We need only a few examples.</P>
    <P>I have here a telephone bill for the quarter which was sent to a lady who does not use the phone very much. She rings her husband now and again, her doctor and a few others.  She is asked to pay £2-5-0 rental and her calls cost £1.  That means she must pay at least 4½d. a call which is rather unfair on a small subscriber.  We hope that more people will install telephones but it is wrong to ask people to pay between 4d. and 6d. for a call.  It is all right for business people who are making money out of it; they should be made to pay because a telephone call could earn them £5, as it often does.  There should be a differential rent in favour of the small person and let the business rental jump.  We heard a lot of criticism regarding the ESB rental and we were told of an old age pensioner asked to pay 11/- for a meter when he spent only 2/- on electricity. There is proof of that.  It is unfair.  When thinking of rentals in future, the Minister should consider a differential in favour of small subscribers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a sizeable figure before us and this shows there has been neglect by the Fianna Fáil Government over the past seven years in facing up to a problem that has snowballed to this extent.</P>
      <P>The telephone is a &ldquo;must&rdquo; and has been for quite a while.  A few years ago, the Minister told us television was a &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  It was at that time he should have decided which should get precedence, television or the telephone. The telephone service is not a luxury; the television service is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter is the danger of building up a labour force. I have no objection to a labour force being built up but the trouble is that when you do so and when the job has been completed, the force is dumped on the scrap heap.  One speaker pointed out that the members of the <Col N="694" /> force become &ldquo;dead-end kids&rdquo; and I agree with him.  There should be some sense of security for those who are giving their best and the Minister should bear that in mind.  It is important that the work should go ahead because every other day questions are asked by Deputies about this problem. I do not have to remind the Minister of that; I have kept the pressure on him to try to expedite the installation of telephones in my own area.  The backlog is increasing every day and something will have to be done about it.</P>
    <P>Agan in relation to a labour force, there is a policy in the Department that a man over 40 will not be employed for labouring work.  That is wrong.  Fathers of families will have to contribute in taxation towards this demand and they are entitled to get a chance to work.  They have family responsibilities, just as other sections of the community have and, with such a sizeable sum of money involved, they should not be deprived of work.  It may be said that this is not general policy but it is the policy, as I see it, in my area.  I say it is unjust and probably unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned blackguardism on the telephone.  The public kiosks are a target for blackguardism. The Post Office staff are subjected to abuse and this hardworking staff could be better employed than having to listen to this type of gentleman, and indeed, on occasion, this type of lady.  I would ask the Minister to see if some type of alarm could be introduced which would pinpoint the culprit on the spot and thus lead to his being brought to justice. As I said, this is a sizeable sum of money but we are all agreed that it is a sizeable investment and all I would add is, God speed, get on with the work and let us have results.</P>

      <P>We recognise that because of the era of prosperity which the country has enjoyed for the past five or six years the demand for telephones has increased.  It must be recognised that only those who are prospering can afford a telephone.  There is one matter which I should like the <Col N="695" /> Minister to consider.  In recent times, some applicants for telephones have been requested to deposit £10.  Everyone is not so requested but I do not know where the line of demarcation is drawn because I know of two architects, one of whom was requested to pay this £10 deposit and the other was not.  I suggest that it should be sufficient to have a guarantor.  I cannot see why a person should be requested to deposit £10 which will not be returned until he has ceased to be a subscriber.  The £10 could be gaining interest for him.  All these deposits of £10 must be gaining interest for the Department.  If every applicant had to subscribe a deposit of £10, I would not be against it but why should only certain people be requested to do so? It seems wrong to me.  It might be a wise thing if applicants were asked to make a deposit for a period of three or five years but I still think that a guarantor would make it easier for the applicants.</P>
      <P>In regard to abuse, I must say that I have not suffered from it.  The installation of post boxes, particularly in South-West Dublin is something that has been neglected, even though I have made application and shown the distances between the nearest two boxes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the points raised by Deputies on this Bill, I want to make it perfectly clear that when introducing the Bill I went to particular pains to make my statement as factual as possible and to set out, in so far as I could, the exact position at the moment in which the country stands in relation to telephone services and to telephone equipment and installations.</P>
      <P>I set out to give a history of telephone development in this country over a number of years past.  On a previous Capital Telephone Bill and on the Estimate for my Department, I fully accounted for the amount of capital advances under the various Acts since the take-over in 1922.  It is no harm to repeat here the amounts authorised to be raised and spent on telephones since the early days of this administration.</P>
      <P>Under the Telephone Capital Act, 1924, a sum of £500,000 was provided; under the Capital Act, 1927, a sum of £500,000 was authorised; under the Capital Act, 1931, a sum of £250,000 was authorised; under the Capital Act, 1936, a sum of £500,000 was authorised; under the Capital Act, 1938, a sum of £1 million was authorised; under the Capital Act, 1946, a sum of £6 million was authorised; under the Capital Act, 1951, a sum of £8 million was authorised; under the Capital Act, 1956, a sum of £6 million was authorised; and under the Capital Act, 1960, a sum of £10 million was authorised.  That comes to a total of £33,521,858 authorised under these Capital Acts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon apparently took grave exception to the inclusion of this sentence in my statement introducing this Bill, on page 4:</P>
      <P>The principal cause was the severe shortage of capital during the 1950s when the telephone service was afforded a low priority in the allocation of the limited finance available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year, of course, the Government allocate the capital to provide for the <Col N="697" /> investment in that particular year in the various sectors of the economy where State capital is required.  Telephone capital is provided for, in common with the other demands made from the other sectors&mdash;agriculture, industry and so on.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice all down the years to show the telephone capital amounts that are available each year very low down in the queue.  It is low down in the priority and the practice has been, all down the years, that the telephone capital allocations are down near the bottom of the line.  There is no point in Deputy Dillon's trying to pretend that the situation was ever otherwise.  Facts have to be faced in this matter.  The whole picture and situation has to be fully appraised. The matter has to be looked upon in all its broadest aspects so that we can get down to the problem that confronts the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in meeting the unprecedented demand that has arisen in this country over the past four years for telephone service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been pressed to meet anticipated demand as well as current demand.  Deputy Dillon spoke of a Treasury regulation, I think, that prohibited the Post Office from meeting anticipated demand.  He spoke vaguely of some decision being taken many years ago to change that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>He said it was changed in 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy since I became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and the policy of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs over the years, has been to make provision for anticipated demand.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in 1956 sought authority for the allocation to his Department of the necessary capital to meet anticipated and current demand but he did not get what he was looking for from the then Government.  He had to come to this House with a Bill that was drastically cut in the demand he <Col N="698" /> was making for the provision of the necessary capital moneys for the telephone service.  He complained bitterly in this House, when introducing that Bill, of the small amount of capital allocated to him for the execution of work which he saw it was necessary for the Post Office to engage in, in the years ahead, to meet the anticipated and current demand for telephone service.  In replying to the debate, he again referred to the same matter.  I have not said and I do not say that the telephone capital moneys were short since 1956: I said that over the whole period of the 1950s the allocation of capital to the telephone service was not sufficient to meet the unprecedented demand for telephone service within the country.</P>
      <P>On the first available opportunity that presented itself to me after I became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in 1959, I brought in a Telephone Capital Bill, in 1960.  I asked that £10 million be made available to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for the ensuing five-year period, as Capital Bills usually run for that period.  I got the authorisation to bring in a Bill to have £10 million allocated from the Department of Finance to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to be used at the rate of £2 million per year.  That was the understanding the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of 1960-61, I came to the conclusion that investment at the rate of £2 million per year over the five-year period would not be sufficient.  The following year, we raised the capital allocation to £2½ million, in agreement, of course, with the Department of Finance.  At the same time, I want to point out that it fell to me to commence then the augmentation of the staff working in the Engineering Branch of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs so that we could usefully use the additional capital allocations made year by year to the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already pointed out the long delay that occurs in the delivery of orders.  I want to point out now that <Col N="699" /> we cannot place orders in advance of the money being authorised here to pay for the orders on delivery.  To use usefully large amounts of capital in the development of a telephone service we need to have a labour force competent and capable usefully to use the cash, or the money, when it is allocated.  At the same time, we have got to have a certain knowledge that the equipment ordered will be delivered into the country.  Most of the equipment is manufactured outside the country and we have not got any effective control on delivery dates. Manufacturers are, too, finding it difficult to maintain delivery dates because of the fact that other countries are finding themselves in exactly the same position as we are.  There is in other countries an increased demand for telephones.  The Administrations in these countries are placing their orders for equipment also and expecting, like us, to get delivery of exactly the same kind of equipment.  We are all in the market together and the manufacturers are finding it increasingly difficult to cater for the unprecedented demand that now obtains for telephone equipment.</P>
    <P>The staff, then, has to be increased. Increasing the technical staff is not a simple matter.  It is a matter that must be planned progressively in an ordered fashion.  One cannot just find technical staff available in employment exchanges. One has to train them.  One has to take many of them in young. I have explained the position in relation to the professional engineers. Since 1960 we have been building up our staff and this year it is 50 per cent greater than it was four or five years ago.  Since I became Minister I have obtained the sanction of the Department of Finance for increased allocations from the sum authorised under the 1960 Act.  As I said earlier, we started off with £2 million in 1960-61. In the next year it was raised to £2½ million.  The year after it was £3½ million and the expenditure proposed in the current year is £4½ million. Anyone who looks at this in an objective way can see the development and the plan operating in the Department <Col N="700" /> to meet the situation in relation to telephones since 1960.</P>
    <P>Year by year the allocation of capital moneys has been increased. Year by year the staff to handle that cash usefully has been increased.  In the current year we are spending £4½ million.  Next year we hope the sum will be £6 million.  Building up a staff is a progressive operation.  So is increasing the allocations, and the purchase of equipment.  We are proceeding in a progressive manner to deal with outstanding arrears.  It is a formidable undertaking.  When I was appointed Minister I took on an apparently formidable undertaking from the point of view of the telephone service I inherited.  Even at the end of five years, with the utilisation of the capital now being authorised, the operation will not, in my opinion, be completed.  The telephone service will need still further capital and still more work before we will have an absolutely efficient service suitable to the needs of the country, particularly from the point of view of the further development of the national economy.</P>
    <P>Some of the matters raised here were matters of administration.  I shall study the statements made by the Deputies and have these matters examined.  These do not really fall to be dealt with under this Bill but, since they were raised, I should like to reply to them.</P>
    <P>The Post Office (Amendment) Act, 1951, provides for the prosecution of persons who use the telephone to make calls of an offensive nature or to make nuisance calls.  The regulations made in 1959 provide for the suspension of the telephone service to subscribers who use their phones, or allow their phones to be used, for calls of this kind.  Whilst it is not practicable to pursue every case reported, the more serious and persistent cases are investigated and proceedings are instituted in every case in which there is sufficient evidence available and the circumstances warrant prosecution. Less serious cases, and cases involving juveniles, may sometimes be met by a warning, usually by a member of the Garda Síochána, as an alternative <Col N="701" /> to prosecution.  Most nuisance calls are made on the automatic system and this increases the difficulty of tracing them.  We have our methods, but Deputies will appreciate that to publish details of them would reduce their effectiveness.  Observations of a subscriber's line to trace nuisance calls is undertaken only with the knowledge and consent of the subscriber.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of urgent trunk calls.  He referred to the special charge made for jumping the queue; I use that expression for want of a better one at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Priority calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim where the special charge is concerned is to ensure that, when a particular trunk route is congested, urgent and important calls will be given precedence.  The only practicable way of confirming that a particular call is genuinely urgent and important is to apply the special rate, which is double the normal fee.  My Department is not interested in the special rate from the revenue aspect and would gladly drop it in favour of any other suitable and effective means of affording priority on a fair basis.  Approximately one trunk call in every 1,000 is made at the special rate.  It will be seen from that that we do not make anything out of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch advised me to increase the staffs in telephone exchanges. It is expected that the total number recruited before the end of this year will be 215.  I do not know if Deputy Lynch has any particular cases in mind in which he thinks there is a shortage of telephonists.  If he brings them to my notice I shall have them examined.</P>

The original claim entered before the General Council was for a five-day week without any reduction in total weekly hours of work.  This claim was subsequently revised to one for a five-day week on the basis that the additional time to be worked on the five days should be limited to such amounts as would be necessary to maintain present weekly output without extra cost.</P>

      <P>The answer is yes, but in making the statement I was merely summing up, as chairman of the meeting, the result of a motion adopted at the Árd Fheis.

      <P>I do not think that I can usefully add at the present time to the Press communiqué which was issued in Brussels after the meeting with the Commission on the 29th November.  With your permission, a <Col N="707" /> Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report, for the convenience of Deputies, a translation of the communiqué.</P>
      <P>Following is the translation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Frank Aiken, the Minister for External Affairs of Ireland, visited the Commission of the European Economic Community in Brussels on 29th November, 1963.</P>
      <P>M. Jean Rey, President of the External Relations Group, presided over a meeting devoted to an exchange of views, in which also participated M. Mansholt, Vice-President of the Commission, and senior officials of Ireland and of the Commission.</P>
      <P>During the exchange of views various problems of mutual interest were discussed, in particular, the position of Ireland in relation to the problems of European integration, the economic expansion of Ireland, and the prospects envisaged by the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> In addition, certain questions relating to the development of trade between Ireland and the Community, particularly in agricultural products, were discussed.</P>
      <P>Discussions of a technical nature between senior officials of Ireland and the Commission will take place early in the New Year.  Following today's conversations, which took place in a cordial and constructive atmosphere, further similar meetings are envisaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think it is reasonable that we ought to be informed in this House of what the situation is in regard to our negotiations with the European Economic Community in view of the fact that the Minister for External Affairs has led a delegation to discussions in Brussels with them?  Does he think those discussions have advanced our prospects of entering the Community or does he think we are possibly on some other line?</P>

      <P>The meeting was for the purpose of an exchange of views, in which various problems of mutual interest were discussed, in particular the position of Ireland in relation to the problems of European integration, the economic expansion of <Col N="708" /> Ireland, and the prospects envisaged by the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  Certain questions relating to the development of trade between Ireland and the Community, particularly in agricultural products, were also discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach will not interpret my question as meaning any disrespect to the text of the communiqué?  The statement the Taoiseach read out means nothing at all. The only concrete thing in that is that the Minister is alleged to have had discussions on the prospect of trade between Ireland and the Community. What the Community has to do with our own so-called <i>Programme of Economic Expansion,</i> I cannot imagine. It is not Brussels business, as far as I understand.</P>
      <P>The communiqué did suggest that the future relations of Ireland with the European Economic Community were discussed, and I think it reasonable to ask the Taoiseach was that issue raised or, if not, did we envisage our entry into the Community ourselves without regard to Great Britain's decision? Did we inform the Community that we would not enter unless Great Britain entered and, in either event, what was the reaction of the Community to such information as we gave it?</P>

CIE are examining the question of additional equipment.</P>

      <P>Whatever about weeds, which are a transport hazard, would the Minister not think it desirable to invite CIE effectively to clean the canal in its passage through the city of Dublin and dispose of the dirt down at the outlet?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>A letter conveying the resolution referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department on 18th November, 1963 and an acknowledgment was issued to the Secretary of the Dublin Council of Trade Unions on 19th November, 1963. A further letter on the subject, received on 28th November, 1963, was replied to by me on 3rd December, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> Regarding the last part of the Deputy's question, I would refer him to my reply to a question on 12th November, 1963 (Volume 205, Column 1239/1240) in which I outlined measures taken by me in relation to the display of certain commodity prices and the investigation of prices by the Fair Trade Commission. Complaints about price increases, in the guise of turnover tax, are being investigated by officers of my Department appointed by me under section 23 of the Prices Act, 1958.  Inquiries are also proceeding as to the justification for price increases made by certain manufacturers and in this connection the Deputy will have seen the announcement of the appointment of a Prices Advisory Committee to inquire into the increase in the price of soap about which I have received a number of complaints.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution adverted to the position in general and emanated from the council which represents 40,000 working-class members and, if their families are taken into account, the number is considerable. The purpose of the resolution was to ensure there would be price control but not through the operations of the Fair Trade Commission.  Could the Minister indicate if he is prepared to institute price control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely soap is not an immediate question.  Lots of slips are being made in this connection and that may apply to soap.  What the Dublin Council of Trade Unions is anxious to ensure is that there would be price control on essential commodities like food and clothing.  Can the Minister indicate if steps will be taken to ensure that that control will be instituted immediately?</P>

I understand from the Minister for Defence that consideration is being <Col N="719" /> given to the question of utilising peacetime structures as refuges from radioactive fall out in the event of war. Underground car parks provided for peace-time use would of course be considered in this connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The adoption of the suggestion in question would not be feasible.  Generally these quarries are water-filled and I understand that dumping of household refuse in them has already been considered and found to be impracticable for public health reasons.  Furthermore, I am informed that prior drainage of quarries near built-up areas would endanger nearby buildings.  It appears, therefore, that fencing may have to be relied upon for immediate protection in many cases pending the long-term process of reclamation by dry filling.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence what steps have been taken to provide air-raid shelters to protect people in the event of a nuclear war; and if, in conjunction with local authorities, early steps will be taken to build large underground car parks in urban areas which in wartime might be used as shelters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The three main hazards of nuclear explosions are, heat, blast and radioactive fall-out.  Of these hazards the last mentioned would be the most likely and widespread.  Expert opinion is that worthwhile protective measures which are not too difficult to achieve can be taken by householders, employers, et cetera themselves by providing, at short notice, an effective refuge room in their own homes and premises at comparatively little cost. These measures would also give limited protection against heat and blast.  The methods of providing protection from radioactive fall-out have already been devised and are taught <Col N="741" /> in local Civil Defence classes.  Furthermore, a handbook as to how this protection can be achieved is at present being produced and will be issued when the Government deems it appropriate to do so.</P>
      <P>The provision of special purpose-built public shelters for any or all of the effects of nuclear war is not contemplated. Consideration is, however, being given to the suitability and practicability of utilising existing large buildings for refuge from radioactive fall-out.  Similar consideration will be given to any new buildings or structures, including underground car parks, which may be provided in the future for peace time use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his generous observation.  I mentioned to the Minister the question of the failure of subscribers to get a reasonably prompt answer in dialing 10 or 31 in Dublin and I asked him if he would tell the House whether that was primarily due to an absolute lack of equipment or whether, by increasing personnel during the hours after six o'clock, the existing equipment could be made somewhat more efficient at least for the purpose of answering subscribers and explaining the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is continuously under review in the Department and they keep a very close eye on it.  It is not easy to find a solution to the problem which the Deputy has in mind.  I have here a detailed explanation, as it were, and I will give it to the Deputy.  There has been a good deal of criticism of the speed of answering calls particularly at Dublin exchange during the summer season.  I am well aware that the speed of answering was poor on occasions during the peak periods of traffic.  I should like to make it perfectly clear that the operators and supervising staff in the exchange were in no way to blame for these conditions.  On the contrary, they deserve to be commended not only by me but also by the public for the earnest efforts they <Col N="743" /> made to give a good standard of service in very difficult conditions.</P>
      <P>The traffic during peak periods at the height of the summer season is tremendous.  Every effort is made by increasing the number of staff serving and the number of staffed switchboards to cope with this rise in traffic but there are limits to which this can be done and, even in normal conditions, sudden surges of traffic may occur which lead to temporary difficulties. The difficulties experienced this year were mainly the indirect result of the difficulties experienced on the trunk system.  Every operator is expected to carry a certain load of calls over a period of time.  In normal conditions she would have no difficulty in doing so.</P>
      <P>However, when conditions of delay occur, such as were common at peak periods during the summer, her effectiveness is seriously impaired because the time taken to connect calls is protracted. This must necessarily be reflected in a sharp decline in the speed of answer to waiting callers.  The speed of answer was also adversely affected by calls for assistance from people who were unable to get trunk and sometimes local calls by direct dialling. However, as I have made clear already, much of the criticism directed against the speed of answer was obviously coming from people&mdash;I am not talking about Deputy Dillon now&mdash;who did not really understand the situation. The overall aim of my Department is to provide an average speed of answer not exceeding ten seconds.  That is the aim of the Department and a difficulty, as I have explained, which the controller in the central exchanges continuously watches.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be unreasonable about this.  Perhaps the Minister has not got this information. How does he relate seconds to sounds of the bell?  I usually count the delay by the number of times the bell sounds. I do not complain if the bell only sounds ten times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>This section includes departures, made at the request of the Minister for Finance, as from the corresponding section of the 1960 Act.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) (a) gives the Minister for Finance authority to borrow on foot of terminable annuities in order to provide the Central Fund with moneys to be issued for telephone development, or in order to make good issues already made for telephone development.  It is in line with the corresponding Section of the previous Act save in regard to the period of repayment (see below).</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) (b) is a new provision. It provides the Minister for Finance with an alternative means of raising the necessary money, by enabling him to borrow it, not only on foot of terminable annuities, but also in the ordinary way in which capital is raised by the State, e.g., National Loans and Prize Bonds.  The new subsection will make certain that sufficient money can be borrowed, in the unlikely event that the Post Office Savings Bank Fund from which money is raised on the security of terminable annuities, should prove to be insufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in regard to repayment have been changed.  The period of repayment of moneys raised under the Telephone Capital Acts 1924/46 was limited to 20 years and under the Acts 1951/60 was extended to a period not exceeding 25 years.  No specific period of repayment is provided for under the present Act, and instead the moneys issued will be repaid over such period as the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, may determine. This change is necessary to bring the provision into line with the practice followed for the repayment of ordinary borrowing by the State, e.g., borrowing under the Central Fund Act each <Col N="747" /> year.  In addition it will enable the period of repayment to be extended if there is any appreciable variation in plant lives due to technical or other developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable part of the funds of suitors vested in the Accountant of the Courts of Justice to be used to help towards the rebuilding of the Opera House, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Cork Opera House was destroyed by fire at the end of 1955, its loss as a cultural amenity was keenly felt by the residents of the city and county.  The strong desire to restore it resulted in the forming of a new Cork Opera House Company in 1958 by a number of public-spirited persons, who immediately set about the formidable task of raising the <Col N="748" /> necessary funds for a new building. The company is a public one with an authorised share capital of £125,000 in ordinary shares of £1 each and its directors are six prominent Cork citizens.</P>
    <P>The company's professional advisers estimated at the time that the overall cost of re-building would be approximately £150,000 and it was clear from an early date that no more than half of this sum could be raised by subscriptions from the public and by local fund-raising activities.  In 1959, the company approached the Government, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for assistance in reaching the total amount of £150,000 then required, and they were informed that the Government would be prepared to seek approval for a State guarantee of a loan of £50,000 to be provided by a commercial bank.  The necessary steps are now being taken for the issue of this guarantee under the State Guarantees Act, 1954.  The Minister for Finance will be moving at a later date for a resolution approving of a draft order.  This draft order proposes to add the Cork Opera House Company, Limited, to the bodies scheduled to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, and states the maximum amount to be guaranteed, namely £50,000.</P>
    <P>The Cork Corporation were also approached by the company and ultimately it emerged that the Corporation would be willing to provide an interest-free loan of £25,000 if it were endowed with the necessary statutory powers.  In order to facilitate the Corporation in this respect, the Local Government Act, 1960, was enacted.</P>
    <P>The complicated negotiations involved in the raising of these funds covered a prolonged period and the company were not in a position to put the work out to tender until late in 1961.  When tenders were received, it became very clear that, with increased building costs and the necessity for compliance with stringent municipal standards of public health and safety, the minimum total cost of the new building would be about £200,000, as against the figure of £150,000 which had been estimated some years earlier. The Opera House Company thus found themselves facing the unpleasant <Col N="749" /> alternatives either of having to seek another £50,000 or of abandoning a project for which three-quarters of the outlay had already been assured.</P>
    <P>At this stage all local business concerns and many national ones had already been canvassed by them, but no further help of a substantial kind could be expected.  A large amount had also been subscribed in small sums by many thousands of local people, who could hardly be asked to provide any more.  A total of £75,000 has now been subscribed from private sources and the company has pointed out that the raising of such a large sum of money is evidence of the widespread desire that the Opera House should be rebuilt.  Accordingly, they asked the Government, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to review the problem in a generous light so as to make it possible, by the provision of the additional funds now required, for the company to carry its plans to completion.</P>
    <P>It was clear at this juncture that, without substantial Government aid, the project would have to be abandoned.  It was evident also that aid in the shape of a further guaranteed loan or even an interest-free loan, would not solve the company's difficulties. The extent of the commitments already undertaken by the company made it impossible for them to assume any further financial burdens.</P>
    <P>The Government feel that the re-building of the Cork Opera House is a worthwhile project and that its abandonment would be a national loss, particularly in view of the lack of adequate cultural amenities of this kind in the south of Ireland.  We have decided, therefore, that, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, a grant of £50,000 should be provided from the funds of suitors for the project.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable that operation to be carried out.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the grant of £50,000 to be made available to the company from the funds of suitors will be given on the basis that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the grant will not be made available until all the other funds (private contributions, Cork Corporation <Col N="750" /> loan and State-guaranteed loan) have been certified as expended on the building operations, and</P>
    <P>(2)  if within 30 years the Opera House ceases to be used for drama and opera, the grant must be refunded, an allowance of one-thirtieth being made for each year for which the premises have been so used.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the fulfilment of the latter condition will be secured by an indenture to be entered into between the company and the Minister for Finance and it will be arranged that the amount of any refund would be a charge on the premises.</P>
    <P>The funds of suitors are the cash and securities belonging to suitors which have been transferred or paid into or deposited in the High Court. In the ordinary way, they may be used only for the benefit of suitors entitled. Part of the funds, however, consist of unclaimed dividends and balances which have been accumulating over more than 200 years.  These are known as the dormant funds and they may be defined more precisely as balances in accounts which have not been dealt with for 15 years or longer.  The total liability in respect of the funds of suitors on 31st October, 1963, was £10,323,000, of which the dormant funds amounted to about £947,000 consisting of cash of the value of £390,000 and securities to the nominal value of £557,000.</P>
    <P>The position is, however, that actual funds, whether cash, money on deposit or investments standing in the name of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice do not amount to the totals which I have just mentioned.  This is because cash and securities amounting to £648,150 and £130,000 respectively have been withdrawn from the funds of suitors under the authority of various Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Oireachtas.  The purposes to which these withdrawn funds were applied included the building and improving of Courts of Justice and the enlarging of the Law Library in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The last statutory authorisation for withdrawal from these funds was contained <Col N="751" /> in the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959.  This Act enabled a total of £323,000 to be utilised for a number of specific purposes, namely, to provide financial assistance towards the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre, to finance the repair and renovation of the buildings of the Society of King's Inns and to provide for the creation of a fund for the maintenance of the Society's Library.  All these Acts indemnified suitors for any loss which they might sustain by reason of the withdrawals.  This indemnity is backed by the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>It will be apparent from what I have said that a portion of the funds of suitors amounting in the aggregate to £778,150 is represented not by cash or securities but simply by the liability of the Central Fund to indemnify suitors against any loss.  The present Bill proposes the withdrawal of a further sum of £50,000 and provides for the usual indemnity backed by the Central Fund.  The withdrawal of this amount will almost exhaust the so-called dormant funds.  As I have said, the dormant funds amount in all to £947,000.  When account is taken, however, of the fall in the value of the dormant securities, the net value of the funds is £866,000.  The total withdrawals which have been authorised by the various statutes in the past plus the amount of the proposed withdrawal under the Bill amount to £828,000, leaving only £38,000 untouched.  As time goes on there will, of course, be a further accumulation of dormant funds.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the assistance given by the State towards the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959. Deputies will recall that, when the Abbey Theatre was destroyed, the directors had to approach the Government for help in rebuilding the theatre, and this appeal was met by the grant of a sum of £250,000 from the funds of suitors.  The rebuilding of Cork Opera House is also an enterprise of national concern.  It has been recognised elsewhere that projects of this nature cannot in modern conditions be undertaken successfully without the <Col N="752" /> patronage of the wealthy, or of the State or local authority.  There is no doubt that this is a most desirable form of public investment since it will provide suitable entertainment for our own people and, at the same time, constitute an attraction for tourists whose business is such an important item in the economy of the south.</P>
    <P>The business community and members of the public have given an earnest of their real interest in the project by putting up the very substantial sum of £75,000 in the form of shares and interest-free debentures and it is now appropriate for the State to come to their support to enable them to complete the worthwhile task they have undertaken.  Building work has commenced and payments to the building contractors and architects are being made out of the £75,000 which has been raised from private sources.</P>
    <P>Cork city and its environs have already benefited from the spate of industrial and commercial development which has taken place in recent years.  Major undertakings such as the new oil refinery, shipyard, and airport have been supplemented by numerous smaller, but no less welcome, concerns, and together they have led to a vast improvement in the employment situation in that area.  This has been accompanied by the provision of adequate housing and other welfare facilities.  The material needs of the citizens are therefore well catered for and I think it behoves us now to see to it that the picture is suitably rounded off by the provision of a wellappointed cultural centre in this second city of the State.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say again that, as in the case of previous withdrawals, the Bill affords complete indemnity to suitors so that they will be absolutely protected from any possible loss.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this Bill.  It is important from the national point of view and from what may be described as the local point of view in Cork that the Cork Opera House should be rebuilt as soon as possible.  The Government apparently <Col N="753" /> feel it necessary now to scrape the bottom of the barrel in order to get money, but I believe the money in this instance is being found for a worthwhile project.  This is not money the Government are spending from revenue.  It is not money the Government themselves are raising.  It is money lying dormant to the account of suitors in the courts.  The Government are finding the money only to the extent that they must, and obviously they must, guarantee absolutely the funds in court.  Should there be a demand in respect of any of these dormant accounts, quite clearly, once the Government have allowed the money to be used, they must see to it that it will be replaced.  I hope the re-building of the Cork Opera House will proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the decision to spend this money on the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House.  This seems to me to be a veritable Aladdin's Cave for wealth, wealth which appears to have been reasonably well spent by various Governments over the years.  It is particularly important, and significant from any Government's point of view, to support the extension of the cultural pattern of the life of our people at a time when the philistine influences of the other media of education, such as television, the cinema, and so on, are making such great inroads into the quality of that life.  This represents a very significant stand on the part of the Government in that they support the ambition of the Cork people, and Cork, as has been said, is the second city in the State, to have this mark of regard and affection for culture to the extent that they are actually putting up hard cash for the realisation of those ambitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is rather an advance on Dublin, where we have had the precedent of the Abbey, which had to be replaced by the Government, and we have the present position in relation to the Olympia, which is in very serious straits and in danger of closing down. If that happens, it will represent a very serious setback to the cultural life of Dublin.  For that reason, it is a very <Col N="754" /> good thing that the citizens of Cork have shown an earnest of their intention and determination to retain this mark of their cultural advancement and that the Government intend to give them this support.</P>
    <P>The attitude towards living art, such as the theatre, is a mark of the level of culture attained by a civilised society.  I understand that the opera house in Stockholm was built entirely by the people themselves at a time when they wanted to show the very high level of appreciation of the arts in Sweden.  Where an art form of this kind is concerned, there are many aspects of it which ultimately have a very deep influence on the whole life of the country.  If artists, writers&mdash; actors, in particular&mdash;musicians, performers and interpretative artists of one kind or another have not an opportunity in our various cities of earning their living, to put it at its lowest, an opportunity of expressing the talents they have, then the love of art and of these qualities tends to die out, in so far as the demand is not there for them.  The competition is very strong at present from the television and the cinema, and it is a very good sign to see that Cork city is determined to hang on to what it has got in relation to this outward example of a highly-cultured civilised city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Deputies who have spoken for the manner in which they have received this Bill and for their support of it.  I agree with both Deputies who have spoken in what they have said about the desirability of this project, not just from the point of view of Cork city but from the point of view of the nation as a whole.  Those of us familiar with Cork and its people have always noted one particular outstanding characteristic of the Cork people, that is, their passionate attachment to their institutions.  In this regard, in their efforts to reprovide themselves with their opera house, we have a further example of that fine civic spirit.  The manner in which the House has received this Bill is sheer evidence that the Oireachtas appreciate the public-spirited effort by the Cork people to provide themselves with this essential cultural institution.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;offence&rdquo; in page 2, line 10, down to the end of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I explain with regard to this amendment, and certain other amendments standing in my name, that I regard all these amendments as standing together.  As far as I am concerned, the only one I want to discuss is the first of these amendments.  I move this amendment for the purpose of enabling the Dáil to discuss and, if necessary, to decide and vote on the <Col N="756" /> question of the total abolition of capital punishment.  I expressed the view on Second Reading that, while I was prepared to support this Bill as far as it went, I did not think it was going far enough.  I thought the Bill was to some extent illogical.  I thought the principles which the Government were apparently acting upon in bringing in the Bill in the first place did not run completely through the Bill. While the principles were accepted as far as certain portions of the Bill were concerned, they were not accepted as far as other portions were concerned.</P>
    <P>The first section is the section which provides that capital punishment will be abolished for murder except for certain categories of murder.  The suggestion I am making is that this should be a simple, three section Bill, in which we should provide that a person shall not be liable to suffer death for any offence.  We should then provide that a person who, but for this Bill would have been liable to suffer death, shall be liable to penal servitude for life, and we should simply leave the Bill at that.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is necessary at this stage to go through all the arguments discussed here on Second Reading as to the general pros and cons of capital punishment.  I feel, as I said on Second Reading, that when this matter is brought before the Dáil, every Deputy is entitled to make up his own mind with regard to it.  For that reason, the Fine Gael Party decided that this was not a measure in respect of which it would be proper to apply the whip.  We felt it was right that every individual Deputy should be entitled to express his own point of view, governed by his own conscience and his own convictions.  I am very glad to note that the Labour Party came to a similar decision with regard to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill as introduced by the Minister goes part of the way but does not go the whole way towards the abolition of capital punishment.  There are certain categories of murders which are to become what are to be known under the Bill as capital murders and in <Col N="757" /> those cases, the punishment of hanging is to be preserved.  It is also to be preserved in certain cases under the Offences against the State Act and the Defence Forces Act of 1954.</P>
    <P>One of the anomalies in the Bill as it stands at the moment&mdash;and this is a matter that was referred to here on Second Reading also&mdash;is that you can have under the Bill a situation arising whereby the occupation of the person murdered rather than the motive of the murderer will determine whether or not the punishment to be inflicted for the murder is to be capital punishment. That seems, certainly, to create a very anomalous and very undesirable position.  It seems to me that if we have arrived at a stage in this country where capital punishment can be abolished for any class of murder then that we have arrived at a stage where capital punshment can be abolished for all sorts of murder.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in reply to the Second Reading discussion, did concede that the arguments which weighed with the Government were not entirely logical and that as a consequence the Bill as it stands is not an entirely logical Bill.</P>
    <P>I know that there is a point of view &mdash;and I appreciate it is a point of view that must carry a great deal of weight &mdash;that we have arrived at a position in Ireland where what I described on Second Reading as a kind of accidental compromise has been reached in that while preserving the death penalty, it is very seldom used and the Government almost invariably exercise the prerogative of mercy vested in them to remit the death penalty and to have the offender imprisoned for life instead.</P>
    <P>While I fully appreciate the soundness of the point of view of those who feel that, that being the position, it is just as well to let it rest there, nevertheless, I feel that once this Bill is introduced, it is necessary for individual Deputies to make up their minds with regard to the Bill, with regard to what the Bill proposes to do and with regard to the general question of whether in the year 1963 and going into the year 1964, we should still retain the death penalty at all, having regard to the fact that we have before <Col N="758" /> us the example of so many countries which have abolished the death penalty and have abolished it without any of the repercussions which those who argued down through the years in favour of the retention of the death penalty felt would occur once it was abolished.</P>
    <P>I gave my own views on Second Reading as to why I was in favour of the total abolition of the death penalty and I do not feel it necessary on Committee to go into these again in detail, but I should like to say that one of the arguments which influenced me is the fact that the carrying out of the death penalty is an irrevocable act and there is strong reason for saying that any penalty which is irrevocable should be imposed only by a tribunal which is in itself infallible and that we cannot have that, no matter what precautions are taken, and I know the utmost precautions are taken against a miscarriage of justice.  No matter what precautions are taken, none of us can claim that the tribunals which impose the death penalty or which are authorised to impose it are infallible.</P>
    <P>That argument holds good, no matter what type of murder it is, whether it is what is to be described as capital murder under this Bill, whether it is to be what is described as political murder or whether it may be described as an individual murder. The argument holds good whether it is murder done impulsively on the spur of the moment or whether it is a calculated, planned murder.  The argument that the death penalty is irrevocable and nothing can be done to remedy the situation if a mistake is made is the same, no matter to what type of murder the death penalty is applied.</P>
    <P>I feel that this amendment, which is also put down, although independently of me, by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan, does give Deputies an opportunity of making up their minds and taking a decision on the important question of the abolition or retention of the death penalty in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Our attitude is the same as Deputy O'Higgins has indicated in regard to the discussion <Col N="759" /> of the section, that we are just discussing the section for the purpose of giving the House an opportunity of considering its attitude to the whole question of capital punishment and its retention or its abolition entirely.  The Opposition have decided to allow everybody to take his own decision about this very personal matter to each individual and for that reason to some extent it is necessary to talk to the House rather than to the Minister, which is the usual practice.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins, I do not intend to go into the main reasons which I have already given on Second Reading and will confine myself to the fact of certain exceptions being made by the Minister in the question of capital punishment and asking him to try to justify his decisions in this regard, while at the same time welcoming the fact that he has got rid of capital punishment in relation to so much capital crime and so many kinds of murder.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Dillon put the most advanced conservative point of view on this and I am sure that he is convinced that he was speaking abolutely in the best interests of the people whom he represents in this House but I wonder at what stage will he accept what appears to be the substanial evidence against most of his postulates.  He was supported to some extent by Deputy Cosgrave in his insistence, in spite of the evidence that we have that capital punishment is not a deterrent.  This evidence was supplied by completely reputable sources: the Council of Europe survey, a very authoritative source with very wide experience; the British Commission which was set up to examine the same question, and the Minister's statement that, as far as he could ascertain, it was, at best, unlikely to be a deterrent or a serious consideration in the mind of the individual at the time of committing this dreadful crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That evidence being there, what further evidence do these people need? As has been pointed out by Deputy O'Higgins, the countries mentioned in the Minister's opening speech, most <Col N="760" /> of the countries of Europe, have abolished capital punishment.  We must assume that all those countries have exactly the same attitude as we ourselves have to life and the Government's responsibility to their citizens. All these central European countries, we must assume, are people with a conscience in this regard and that they have considered the desirability of retaining capital punishment or getting rid of it and have decided to abolish capital punishment.</P>
    <P>The result of that abolition has not been any increase in the number of murders in those countries and that should be taken as a reasonable guide. Deputy Dillon's point was that you cannot really get statistical evidence on this question because if you keep capital punishment, it means that you will keep the number of murders down; consequently it is very difficult to know what is the real change when you remove capital punishment.  Surely it would be reasonable to expect a rise in the incidence of murders where capital punishment was removed, if it is a deterrent, and there has not been such justification for those who believed it could be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>My general precept&mdash;possibly, it is a little advanced&mdash;is that virtually all crimes are crimes of society, the result of environment and so on.  I do not completely go along with Deputy Dillon's suggestion that we are all capable of not doing a wrong act at all times.  The whole of our legislation in regard to criminal actions of one kind or another and the whole of the operations of the Minister's Department of Justice obviously disprove that. There are plenty of people who constantly commit crimes which, presumably, they have tried not to commit and for one reason or another, have failed to stop themselves from committing. The result is that a crime is committed and they are treated by the courts in one way or another and, unfortunately, I believe, by means of retributive justice rather than the rehabilitation of this person who is essentially a sick person.</P>
    <P>There is a great difference in this regard so far as murder is concerned. While one still has the person in prison, <Col N="761" /> it is possible for us to get a very enlightened Minister for Justice, it is possible for the present Minister for Justice to become very enlightened, even more enlightened than he is at the moment, to go to our prisons and say: &ldquo;We will treat these prisoners as sick people and we will introduce a system by which it will be possible morally to reclaim them.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. However, the difficulty is that it is possible to advance slowly in regard to criminals generally but in regard to the unfortunate people who are convicted of murder and executed, they are not there.  This is, as Deputy O'Higgins said, an irrevocable act and it seems to me consequently to be a particularly terrible act.  I cannot see any difference between the act as committed by us and the act as committed by this unfortunate person. There is a saver in relation to the person who murders in that he is mentally unbalanced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is not completely frank with us in the statement of his case and it seems to me to conflict very much with the case made by Deputy Sweetman as to whether, assuming it is not seriously accepted as a deterrent, this punishment is justifiable and whether retributive justice is permissible, as Deputy Dillon says. I do not know what his authority for that is at all.  I am sorry he is not here to tell us what his authority is for this suggestion, that we have the right to look for vengeance, which is what it amounts to when it affects a capital charge.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said in column 1114, volume 205, of the Official Report of 7th November, 1963:</P>
      <P>There is such a thing in the Divine plan as retributive justice ...</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman in his contribution at column 1102 of the same volume said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, of course, long past the days in which punishment was considered as an act of vengeance, an <Col N="762" /> act, in the minds of the people then carrying it out, of just vengeance. That is gone.  The retributive character of punishment to which reference was made by one Deputy ...</P>
    <P>That is a very serious difference of opinion between two intelligent Deputies and particularly in relation to a Deputy in such a position as is Deputy Dillon.  Does he seriously believe that this is a retributive act which we as a society are permitted to carry out by any of the Christian laws?  I would like to have heard more about that from Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>Of all these other countries we have heard about&mdash;Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greenland, West Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland&mdash;most of them are Christian societies.  Most of those countries observe the Christian ethic in their behaviour to one another and in their legislation.  Are we right and are they wrong?  Are they wrong in not claiming the life of a person on the basis of an eye for an eye, the Biblical approach to vengeance?</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dillon can use that, I think he should be prepared to state his authority because it is a most important conclusion for him to arrive at.  Anybody who is so completely confident about these things is a dangerous person because, as even Deputy Dillon said, there is a great difference of opinion between the medical people on this question of responsibility.  I can give authority for both sides, one for saying that a person is responsible and the other from people who have examined most of our murderers and are prepared to say all of them were irresponsible, that they were not responsible for their actions.</P>
    <P>The only importance of that is that there is a serious divergence of opinion between reputable authorities on the question.  My feeling is that while there is that divergence, one should err on the side of charity when it comes to determination of what one will do.  Where there are serious doubts in the minds of conscientious men, of psychologists, it seems to me one should not adopt Deputy Dillon's <Col N="763" /> attitude and say: &ldquo;All right; we will kill them&rdquo;.  He is taking a decision to carry out a very dreadful act.</P>
    <P>While one is reasonably uncertain, particularly being in the position of a Minister who has the final authority for these things, I think it is wrong to come down on the side which, if it is the wrong side, obviously is a most serious conclusion to arrive at.  I do not think it is right for us to be so absolutely certain as some Deputies are in regard to this whole question of guilt for crime and then what they consider to be just punishment for that crime, even if one does accept this question of absolute responsibility at a particular time for this dreadful crime.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that even if you accept that point of view, and I do not accept it, then one can overlook the fact that the most important aspect in the whole question of crime is not only that there is isolation of the particular person, but there is his rehabilitation and, above all, ultimately forgiveness for that individual.  That is the correct approach to all forms of crime, but here, by killing the person, by destroying the human body, one removes the possibility of rehabilitation of the individual, of his restoration to a reasonably normal attitude and to a useful position in society. Above all else, one destroys the most important element, that of forgiveness for that particular crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister has excluded this element and has some support from Deputies for so doing.  To some extent, one who is a professional politician like myself must always admire, in an academic, abstract way, the achievement of an individual placed in this situation, the intellectual contortions he makes to justify his position, but I think he must see that there is no rationalisation for his decision to take certain sections of the community and treat them completely differently from other members of the community, particularly since he broadly appears to accept that the only possible justification that might be held for such action was that it was a deterrent and, consequently, justifiable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> Personally, I think it is an exceedingly wrong act to take a human life, and even if it were a deterrent I would still oppose the idea of capital punishment if only for the old axiom that the end does not justify the means.  If the Minister is faced with the position with which he appears to be faced, that he does not seriously believe that this is a deterrent, then he simply cannot justify the exceptions he has allowed here.</P>
    <P>He seems to me to have adopted the very bad general principle of the British legislation on this matter in trying to make exceptions.  The British are now finding that these exceptions made bad law and they are doing some rethinking in regard to them.  In the special cases which the Bill mentions, the odd thing is that the Minister is asking us to legislate, in regard to two of them anyway, for a crime that does not exist in so far as it never has happened, and while I may be accused of being too&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While I may be said to be criticising legislation in respect of an act which will never occur&mdash;we have been told that there will be no hanging because this is a crime that has never been committed and will never be committed&mdash;at the same time we must bear in mind the position of ourselves <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries and their attitude to human life, their regard for the human body and all that it means&mdash;the most precious thing that there is.  The regard with which that is held in society is a measure of the level of civilisation in that society.</P>
      <P>One of the things that distresses people who have to go abroad is the appalling attitude of apparent indifference to the physical suffering and life and death of the individual, particularly in many of the African countries. I hope I am not appearing to criticise these people now, but I should point out that the more a society becomes civilised, the more this precious thing, human life, is guarded as a measure of that civilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, even though the Minister may say nobody will be killed, <Col N="765" /> nobody will be hanged for these crimes because they do not exist, I still do not think we should have that legislation on our Statute Book because it does not do us any credit as a society.  The Minister has spoken of the advance, the progress since the 19th century. He is here legislating for a non-existent crime and I do not know what his justification is.  Obviously this is the argument used by Deputies O'Higgins and Dillon&mdash;that it is absurd to pick out somebody because he happens to be in a particular position and say he is a special person who needs special protection, even though history has shown us he does not need special protection.  Social justice demands that he should not get different treatment from that which any of the rest get. We must all be equally precious to the society to which we belong and it is a departure from that principle to single out these people for a special kind of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister appeared to make the point that our police are not armed. I do not know if he means to imply that they need more protection because of that.  It is because they are not armed that no guns have been pulled against them.  There is an Indian proverb which says: &ldquo;If we meet violence with violence, where will violence end?&rdquo; And, to my mind, it is the prolification of offensive weapons which leads to crimes of violence in most cases.  The reason Gardaí have not been attacked is that they do not carry guns and the fact that they do not carry guns has been a protection for them in the past. The same can be said of the prison officer.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the question of the diplomat and political crime.  Here again, with regard to the diplomat, we are legislating for a non-existent crime.  Deputy Dillon made reference to the fact that the third secretary of an Embassy might be murdered but the Minister made it clear that he meant murder committed against a diplomat.  That is a non-existent crime in this country and I do not see why it is necessary to introduce this legislation to deal with something that does not exist and never has existed here. On the question of the deterrent <Col N="766" /> against this type of crime, could there be a more tragic refutation of the Minister's thesis than the recent dreadful events in America and the fact that four United States Presidents have been assassinated at different times, even though hanging is the penalty for this crime?  I cannot see any justification for the inclusion of this particular type of exception in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Now I come to murder committed under the Offences against the State Act.  This seems to me to be the thorniest question of all.  The Minister suggests that the people who commit such crimes are not going to be deterred by prison.  If he has studied history at all and in particular, if he has studied the history of this country, he will find that those who have committed such crimes have received the martyr's appellation and that those who were killed had been assassinated.  Practically all of the advances in civilisation over the past 100 years have been the result of various <i>coups d'état</i> carried out in various countries and the centre of these has been the murder of the principals then occupying office.</P>
    <P>That has been the most common general finding in relation to the recent history of the world, with the wonderful exception of India where Gandhi believed in and carried out the great campaign of peaceful and civil disobedience and, without violence, carried out the most wonderful achievement since Christ of the liberation of a whole sub-continent by the persuasion of the individual.</P>

      <P>He played his part but the great achievement was by Gandhi and Nehru.  I do not think that any of these people who took part in these various <i>coups d'état</i> did so except under the threat of subsequent hanging, shooting or garrotting in these different countries.  I can come much <Col N="767" /> closer home in the seven centuries' long struggle of our own history when there were capital crimes committed against the different States here.  They were all committed by courageous men. They are our national heroes, the people in memory of whom we are doing up Kilmainham jail, some of whom are still with us on our front benches.  These were all men of great courage but all men who decided at a certain stage in their lives that, if necessary, they would take life in order to alter the political situation in our society.</P>
      <P>It was quite clear to those men, all honourable men, at that time that capital punishment was not going to be a deterrent to them.  Because it was not a deterrent, I am now speaking here in a free Parliament.  It is difficult for me to pass judgment on these issues and to decide on their morality.  These people decided to take life because of these things and these principles and only history can really make the final decision on their conduct.  I think that for a Government to make these decisions, in the context of the awful conflicts that accompany all these great changes in every society, is to make a very bad decision that is terribly unjust.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has taken the advances he has taken.  They are much less than I should like, but presumably he has done his best.  Has he any reason to believe there would be any objection to completing the job and leaving, to stand in his name as Minister for Justice, the fact that he abolished capital punishment, that he had the courage of his convictions because, from what he has said, it seems his convictions are very close to ours and against capital punishment? We think he should take his courage in his hands and abolish the business of killing people judicially for the crime of murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins for the total abolition of capital punishment for all offences.  I do so for different reasons from those <Col N="768" /> given by some of my colleagues and by Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
      <P>This problem has always been very difficult, from the first murder on record, when Cain killed Abel.  The result was exile and not death, but from the record we find that, in a sense, exile was an even heavier punishment than death itself.  I am interested only in the abolition of the death penalty for one main reason, that is, that the innocent may suffer, not the guilty.  It is a serious matter that cannot be rectified by compensation or in any other way, if an innocent person is judicially executed for a crime he did not commit.  The seriousness of that convinces me we should not have a death penalty at all.</P>
      <P>Speaking from experience, let me put it this way.  The death penalty is not as serious as some might think when it is imposed.  It gives a human being for the first and only time in his life the exact moment of his death which, fortunately or otherwise, is knowledge otherwise hidden from us. Believe it or not, nobody was happier than I when I knew I had to die on a certain date because I had every opportunity of saving a soul at that time.  I had an opportunity that&mdash;God help me&mdash;I have not now.  I know I must face death at some time and I can only hope and pray that I shall be as ready then as I was at that stage. When we become sentimental about it, we can travel any distance, but when I look at this Bill and see that a person who is convicted without a shadow of doubt of deliberately and with intent murdering the father or mother of a family, I see that he is to be put in prison for the remainder of his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, speaking from experience, if it was really a life sentence&mdash;for a long time it never has been so except in certain American States&mdash;it is the harshest penalty that can be imposed. There is no hope and you do not know when you will be called before the final Judge.  You are left in confinement in the knowledge that everybody regards you as despicable and it begets in the prisoner's heart a hatred of mankind, and particularly of his warders and jailers.  It leaves him unfitted to face the next world. <Col N="769" /> It puts him in a difficult if not impossible position.</P>
    <P>For the type of murder I mention, we are going to impose that terrible penalty.  On the other hand, if he killed another type of person, he would be executed, an officer of the State or a person who has diplomatic status.  I presume we shall not execute him unless he is convicted and found guilty beyond doubt.  What do we do with him?  We give him an opportunity of stringing a harp within two hours of the rope being put round his neck.  We give him the greatest possible prize while the man who slays the breadwinner is to be kept in prison.</P>
    <P>It is a very difficult question but broadly I come down strongly on the point of view that here, where executions are and always have been looked upon with horror and where they have not been carried out except <Col N="770" /> very rarely, I think the obligation on a Government of deciding whether a man will live or die is such a serious one that it should not be placed upon them.  At least we should give the abolition of the death penalty a trial. If&mdash;God forbid&mdash;things got out of hand and we had to restore the death penalty, that would be another day's work.  We would have done our best. I am very conscious of the fact that, by abolishing the death penalty and putting a person in jail for the remainder of his natural life, we are imposing a very harsh penalty.</P>
