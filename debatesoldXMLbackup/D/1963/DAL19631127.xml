      <P>The Government Information Bureau has a staff of six persons.  Five of these entered the Civil Service, through open competitions, on the following dates, namely, the 24th September, 1926, the 26th February, 1949, the 22nd January, 1962 and, in the case of two officers, 24th September, 1962.</P>
      <P>The sixth entered the Civil Service on 23rd June, 1951, under the authority of an Order pursuant to Section 10 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924, and, having subsequently resigned, reentered on 27th March, 1957, under the authority of an Order pursuant to Section 5 of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956.  His salary scale is £1,975 by £65 to £2,335.</P>

      <P>Rejection could take place because the question of freedom from physical defect or disease involves the future as well as the present.  The main object of official medical examination is to ensure that there is a reasonable prospect of regular and effective service and to guard against early pension, sick pay for prolonged periods or payments in case of premature death.</P>
      <P>If a candidate appeals against rejection on medical grounds, the Commissioners refer such cases to a board of three specialists for examination and report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he can give any explanation of the rise of over 35 per cent in imports in October 1963 compared with October 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that in such a short period as a single month there are liable to be considerable fluctuations in the value of imports.  He will also understand that it is not, at this stage, possible to give a complete analysis of the imports in October. Nevertheless, there were certain exceptional factors which influenced the value of imports last month.</P>
      <P>In the first place, there was a labour dispute at the Dublin deep sea docks in September, which lasted over a fortnight and which was responsible for reducing the value of imports cleared in that month and increasing those in October.  Furthermore, two large ships, purchased earlier by Irish Shipping Limited, were brought to account in October and, together, they accounted for almost £2 million of the total.  There were, in addition, certain other large machinery imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the September labour dispute, it would be reasonable in making any comparison with 1962 to relate the aggregate values of imports <Col N="12" /> in the two months September and October in each year.  If this is done, the figure for September and October, 1962, was £46.5 million and for the corresponding months in 1963 it was £55.5 million, an increase of £9.0 million or 19 per cent.  The monthly average value of imports this year has been 11 per cent greater than the monthly average value for 1962: but the monthly average value of exports this year has been 12 per cent more than the monthly average value for 1962.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that even taking September and October together, as he has done in the reply, it is clear there is still an element of inflation in these figures and more so in the two months than in the single month?</P>

      <P>I presume the first part of the Deputy's question refers to a consignment of sugar sent to the United States this month.  If so, the relevant documents have not yet been brought to account and it is not, therefore, possible to state the f.o.b. export price at which the consignment was valued.</P>
      <P>Since there is not a free world market in refined sugar, it is not possible to give a precise answer to the second part of the Deputy's question. It can, however, be stated that the price of British granulated sugar for export f.a.s. London or Liverpool was £111 per ton yesterday.  This price has varied very considerably in the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when he intends to extend dental benefits to the dependants of insured workers, other than those covered by section 14 of the Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two factors which militate against an extension of the existing dental services.</P>
      <P>The dental personnel available is limited and an extension of services would necessarily reduce substantially the quality of the service available to national school children and the lower income group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> The other factor is finance.  It is estimated that the extra cost to be met from taxation of dental service for the lower and middle income groups, including the dependants of insured workers, would come to about £2 millions yearly.  If recent events correctly reflect the attitude of the Deputy and his friends, it would be extremely difficult for the Minister for Finance to provide funds at the present time to cover expenditure of this magnitude.</P>
    <P>I am hoping, however, that I shall be able to give effect to the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.  This, in time, will reduce substantially the high incidence of dental disease among children and set free dental personnel for the treatment of adults.  It is to be expected that this release of personnel, in association with the increased revenues which the revision of out-dated fiscal measures is calculated to produce in our expanding economy, will make it possible to improve existing dental services and extend them to much greater numbers of the population.</P>

      <P>Army officers who are employed in posts paid from public funds, that is, out of the Exchequer or the funds of a local authority are, of course, paid the full salary of the posts occupied by them.  Where the salary of the new post is as good or better than the officer's Army pay, retired pay is not issued.  There has always been a concession where the pay of the new post is less than pre-retirement pay; in such a case retired pay will be issued to make up the difference between the pay of the new post and the pre-retirement pay, allowance being made for pensions increases, so that pre-retirement pay is now calculated at <Col N="16" /> 1959 level.  Even this concession may give the re-employed pensioner a better income than a colleague who has served in the same employment throughout his career.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this principle of abatement of pension is sound and while I would not propose to depart from the principle, I would like to examine the definition of Public Funds as it is now applied in these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether a person, following a surgical operation or other disability which does not interfere with his capacity to carry out satisfactorily the required work in a Government Department, may be rejected by medical examination under the Civil Service Commissioners; and, if so, if there is a right of appeal against such a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Rejection could take place because the question of freedom from physical defect or disease involves the future as well as the present.  The main object of official medical examination is to ensure that there is a reasonable prospect of regular and effective service and to guard against early pension, sick pay for prolonged periods or payments in case of premature death.</P>
      <P>If a candidate appeals against rejection on medical grounds the Commissioners refer such cases to a Board of three specialists for examination and report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a person who might, because of a serious operation, such as a pneumonectomy, be considered to have a reduced expectation of life but who might be able to give service during that limited period, would the Minister consider accepting him for such limited service with some sort of loading such as is operated by the insurance companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the practice adopted by the Civil Service Commissioners but I am sure they would apply this bar only where they believe that health would be <Col N="18" /> permanently impaired.  I do not believe they would apply it in the case of an ordinary harmless operation.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>The matters raised are ones which would require Finance Bill legislation and the Deputies will appreciate that I cannot indicate in advance what proposals my Budget statement may or may not contain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Government have announced that, in their considered judgment, immediate adjustments of incomes generally are not only desirable but necessary in order to meet the increased cost of living, does the Minister not think that some interim step might be taken to relieve the circumstances of retired people living on fixed incomes who are in an even more acute dilemma as a result of the rise in the cost of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would naturally have regard to the question raised by the Deputy of these people who are living on fixed incomes but I would have to have regard also to what could be afforded by the Budget and also to the chances of raising the necessary money.</P>

      <P>The site for a new National Library at Morehampton Road.  Donnybrook, was purchased in October, 1961.</P>
      <P>Because of the volume of other urgent work falling to be dealt with by the Office of Public Works, it has not so far been possible to do anything in the way of preparing plans for the new building, and I regret, therefore, that I am not at present in a position to supply the information required at (c) to (f) of the Deputy's question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 to 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our turkey production and exports have been declining in recent years as a result of the very great expansion of turkey production in Britain on mass production lines as compared with the traditional system of farm production here and elsewhere.  While very many people regard the flavour of fresh turkeys reared on free range as superior to that of oven-ready birds reared and fattened under the modern <Col N="40" /> intensive system, the matter of flavour is, of course, conditioned by the development of tastes and habits generally and it is a fact that oven-ready turkeys and poultry are advancing in popularity on the principal markets.</P>
    <P>Steps have been taken in recent years to help in maintaining the market for our exports of turkeys in the face of the growing competition from British birds, e.g. improvements in quality of Irish turkey stocks and in the standard of marketing dressed turkeys and participation in promotion of demand for Irish turkeys through advertising media, exhibitions and displays.</P>
    <P>In view of the smaller numbers, this year's promotional work is on a more limited basis.  As much advance information as possible regarding the expected level of Irish turkey supplies is made available to British wholesalers each year both through the contacts which the exporters here maintain with their British agents and through discussions on the turkey market which officers of my Department have each year with representatives of the British National Federation of Wholesale Poultry Merchants.</P>
    <P>Such a discussion was held last month at which the British wholesalers indicated that it would, of course, facilitate them if they could get fairly accurate advance information as to the numbers of turkeys which their Irish suppliers would be able to send them and the probable timing.  At a recent meeting which my Department arranged with the principal turkey exporters, it was the opinion of the exporters' representatives that it would be impracticable for exporters to give reliable advance estimates of the quantity which they could secure individually on the open market and which would be available for export. I am not aware that any turkey exporters do provide their British salesmen with such firm forecasts.</P>
    <P>The conditions under which small flocks of turkeys are produced here can vary so much that there is no generally accepted comprehensive figure of average production costs.  In the case of a few sample lots supervised by poultry advisory officers during the <Col N="41" /> past couple of years for flocks of about 30 to 50 birds marketed at 26 weeks I have seen average cost figures varying from 1/8½d. to 2/3d. per lb. liveweight. Some British costings I have seen have indicated an average cost of 1/9¾d. in 1960 and 2/- in 1961, covering turkeys marketed at 16 and 24 weeks but I cannot say how representative these figures are.</P>
    <P>As regards the turkey industry generally and what can be done to increase exports, I asked the representative Poultry Production Council appointed by me in 1960 to examine the position.  In their report, which has been published, they expressed little hope in existing circumstances of increasing exports of fresh turkeys or even maintaining their present level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that of 20 to 25 active turkey exporters in this country, at least six are able to furnish British salesmen with information six weeks before the main Christmas demand begins, that each of those six exporters is able to state the amount of turkeys he can ship for consumption in Britain and that this information has been extremely helpful to the British salesmen?  Could the Minister not get in touch with the remainder of the Irish turkey exporters so that this information could be supplied by them as well?  Might I also ask if the Minister has information in his Department to the effect that the 26-week old Irish turkey is far superior to the British turkey and that the general demand in Britain is for Irish birds?  In view of the general demand in Britain for Irish birds in preference to their own, surely there is need for the overhaul of the marketing system in regard to turkeys and surely there must be something concrete the Minister can do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware, as I have said, that any turkey exporter can provide British salesmen with such firm forecasts.  I might read a quotation from the report which I received and published in February last year:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Elaborate and costly marketing efforts and stringent requirements in regard to standards of export premises, <Col N="42" /> grading, packing and transport will count for little against the fundamental disadvantages of our pattern of production.  The fact is, however, that production on this pattern represents the greater part of the turkey industry as it exists in this country today, and it is nothing less than wishful thinking to suppose that it would be sufficient to enable our producers and marketing agencies to compete with the skilfully-managed, highly-organised, large-scale production groups in Britain.  There will, of course, continue to be scope for small-scale production of turkeys by the traditional methods to cater for the demand of the home trade and, it is hoped, for the export of fresh birds but in our opinion the only assured means in present circumstances of increasing exports of fresh birds or even maintaining their present level would be a subsidy from public funds on the finished birds.  We have given consideration to the desirability of such a subsidy but we do not recommend it.</P>
    <P>When one thinks further, that in 1951 the production of turkeys in Britain was something in excess of 700,000 and there is an estimated production this year of between 7.5 million and 9 million and when one also remembers that one of these units in Britain, it is expected, will produce one million turkeys next year&mdash;which will be much greater than the entire production of this country north and south&mdash;and six further units will produce from 250,000 to 500,000 it is not difficult to see the problem with which traditional methods of production have to contend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not going to throw up his hands in despair?  Something must be done to put the better-flavoured and superior Irish turkeys on the market in Britain.  Any of the salesmen in Britain will give the Minister ample information, if he has not got it, that there is a general demand for Irish turkeys because of their superior flavour.  When the demand is there, why not get the turkeys sent there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who made this recommendation to me were very experienced in this business and I am quite sure that in the course of their general examination of the problem they went into every conceivable detail. Notwithstanding that and all the knowledge they undoubtedly possess they made that firm comment.  I do not think it is throwing up your hands at something when you are confronted with a problem for which there seems to be no solution other than the production of turkeys on a basis similar to that which the British are now using.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conceding that, but look at all the other products that were not so well received.  For example, take pasteurised milk.  It is only a matter of a few years ago that people in the smaller towns&mdash;and many large towns&mdash;did not like the idea of taking pasteurised milk and would much prefer the milk taken straight from the cow.  That is all gone now.  I do not think there is any way in which we can overcome this problem.  It is not throwing up one's hands at a problem when you are forced to face the naked realities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been drawn to the report published by An Foras Talúntais, indicating that the milk yields of Irish cows are among the lowest in Europe; and what special measures he proposes to take to improve this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to, which also points out that higher yields per cow have been mainly responsible for the increase of 17 per cent in Irish milk production over the last decade and that this expansion, which should be accelerated by the technical improvements now being applied in Irish agriculture, will have <Col N="44" /> to be based on efficient low cost production. I am taking effective steps to promote such progress by</P>
      <P>(1)  encouraging the improvement of grassland through the Fertiliser Subsidy Scheme;</P>
      <P>(2)  encouraging the conservation and provision of winter feed, e.g. silage;</P>
      <P>(3)  improved breeding of dairy cows particularly through the purchase and location at AI centres of the best dairy bulls available and the progeny testing of these bulls;</P>
      <P>(4)  the efforts of the advisory services in encouraging efficient, low cost production.</P>
      <P>I have some doubts as to whether the figures of average milk yields for this and other countries, as shown in the report, can be validly compared. The figure for this country is an estimate for the total cow population, excepting those suckling calves, whereas for certain of the other countries the figures would appear to represent the average of the recorded dairy herd.  The average yield for all recorded cows in this country in 1962 was 693 gallons.</P>

I do not see any objection to mentioning that fact to them but I have that belief, that they would probably lean the other way rather than be too liberal in their approach to such an important matter as this.</P>

      <P>The Chairman of the Arbitration Board in his report on the claim of local authority clerical officers for increased remuneration recommended separate salary scales for men and women.

      <P>On 25th March, 1961, the county council wrote to the person believed to be the owner of the site, drawing attention to its objectionable condition and suggesting remedial action.  Certain works were carried out subsequently and promises to carry out further works to render the site non-derelict were received by the council.</P>
      <P>On 18th April, 1963, the local authority instituted proceedings under the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, by serving a notice under Section 15 of the Act. A reply was received on the 6th May and on 16th May a notice under Section 2 was served on the person ascertained to be the owner inviting him to make an offer with respect to the carrying out of works to prevent the site from continuing to be derelict or with respect to the future use of the land.  The owner replied on the 10th July, 1963, that he proposed to use it as part of a site for a new dwellinghouse.  He was refused permission under the Town and Regional Planning Acts in respect of his building proposals and this refusal was upheld by me on appeal.  My decision was conveyed to the parties on 18th November.  It is for the county council now to decide what further action under the Derelict Sites Act would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Long Title, this Bill is designed &ldquo; to amend and extend the Land Purchase Acts&rdquo; but these formal words hardly convey its full significance.  I would prefer to say that it is designed to furnish the Land Commission with new and improved instruments to be used in a determined drive to build up the basic farm structure wherever it is found to be wanting by reference to modern trends.  Before I come to deal with the individual proposals set out in the Bill&mdash;on which, indeed, I think Deputies have got a <Col N="66" /> particularly informative White Paper &mdash;I should like to explain to the House the background of the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>On various occasions since my appointment as Minister for Lands, I have indicated, both inside and outside this House, that I was carrying out a full reassessment of the powers, functions and policies of the Land Commission to ascertain whether they were fully adequate to meet the needs of our times as indicated by social and economic developments at home and abroad.  I have borne in mind particulary: the demand of the people in the congested areas for a higher standard of living; the fact that in certain parts of the country many holdings lie vacant and let, in most cases being badly worked, and, looking to the future; and the overall need to adjust the farm-structure of Ireland to the Europe of the 1970s and the 1980s.</P>
    <P>Throughout most of my life I have had regular dealings with the problems of the small farmers in western districts and, as a result, I had some ideas as to the remedial measures required.  However, to ensure that we found the best answers to the questions which might arise I appealed for widespread and public discussion on the various aspects of the Land Commission's work which might properly feature in the general reassessment to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to be able to say that both inside and outside the House such discussion has taken place resulting in many useful suggestions.  Some of the voluntary bodies addressed themselves in workmanlike fashion to studies of the structural problems of Irish land-holding and they have submitted very informative papers to the Taoiseach and the Government.  These submissions from independent councils which are so well placed to interpret the present-day views of farmers and of the rural community generally were extremely valuable.  The Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Problems of Small Western Farms was most useful also in filling out the picture of the problems confronting us.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the ideas flowing from these various sources and noting <Col N="67" /> also specific suggestions which emanated from other quarters, we sought to hammer out piece by piece a &ldquo;new deal&rdquo; for the small farmer.  In doing so, we had in mind the necessity of carrying out much of the groundwork of reform before the anticipated participation of this country in the Common Market.  The fact that there has been a delay about our entry, however, merely means that, in so far as structural reform is concerned, we must make the fullest possible use of the breathing space thus afforded.</P>
    <P>First, it was decided that the plan must be based on the maintenance of our traditional family farm pattern but that:...</P>
    <P>in this day and age the family farm must be capable of giving the family a standard of living comparable with that available to similar families engaged in non-agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>On balance, we decided on an ideal standard of 40-45 acres of good land. In making this choice we were looking into the future and trying to visualise a unit which would be adequate to maintain a family in comfort under the intensified competitive conditions which we will have to face in future. I know that arguments can be made in favour of even larger units of, say, 50 or 60 acres but the available pool of land is limited and our aim is to do the best we can for the greatest number.  We all know that there are far too many farmers in Ireland for whom the possession of even a 40-acre farm is still a distant prospect.</P>
    <P>Having reached this policy decision on the farm size, we did not wait to fill out the rest of the general plan but forthwith directed the Land Commission to adjust its working practices to conform to the new ideal and that is now in force&mdash;in fact, it has been in force for the past year.  New legislation was not needed for that.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention that the decision on the family farm involved a final break-away from any idea of different standards in the congested and non-congested districts.  For very many years, there was a theory abroad <Col N="68" /> that because the west was congested the people there could not aspire to the same standards in land-holding as were found elsewhere.  The practice was to aim at a poor law valuation of £10 there and regard this as an economic unit.  Every landowner whose poor law valuation was over £10 was excluded by the Land Commission for consideration when land was available for division.  Similarly, when as a result of the Land Commission's work landowners in a townland were brought up to, or even near, £10 valuation, they were then &ldquo;written off&rdquo; by the Land Commission from further consideration. It is clear that nowadays these standards are not acceptable to the present generation in those areas. Where it is possible, therefore, it is proposed to enlarge small farms to the full family farm size even though this in certain instances may mean fewer allotments.  It is not at all suggested that the new family farm size holding can be achieved by the Land Commission in every case of land division.  The new size holding structure, however, is being laid down as our national aim where it is capable of achievement; it will be the standard size for migrant holdings; and under the new policy landowners whose units are under this standard will be entitled to consideration by the Land Commission where lands are being divided.  The different standards formerly applied by the Land Commission as between east and west must go, so that those dealt with by the Land Commission, irrespective of their location in the country, can be given an opportunity of earning a decent livelihood by present-day standards.</P>
    <P>The late Holy Father, Pope John XXIII, writing of the depressed state of European agriculture, asks these pertinent questions: &ldquo;What can be done ... to ensure that agricultural living standards approximate as closely as possible to those enjoyed by city dwellers who draw their resources either from industry or from the public services in which they are engaged? What can be done to persuade agricultural workers that, far from being inferior to other people, they have every opportunity of developing their <Col N="69" /> personalities through their work, and can look forward to the future with confidence?&rdquo;  The answers to these questions cannot, in the nature of things, be simple ones.  But, as the first part of an answer, this Government put forward the ideal of the enlarged &ldquo;family farm&rdquo; which I explained to the house in detail in a speech on the Lands Estimate in June of last year.</P>
    <P>At this point, I must emphasise that the adoption of an area of 40-45 acres for the family farm does not carry with it any implication of deliberately reducing the number of persons on the land.  In common with other Western European Governments, we hold the view that it is essential for the wellbeing of our society that we maintain a strong rural population.  In this context we aimed at achieving a worthwhile improvement in the farm structure while reducing to a minimum any consequential disturbance of the rural community.</P>
    <P>In the Small Farms Report, there is confirmation of the view that there are far too many vacant and underproductive farms in the country.  These clearly should be taken up and used in the structural reform.  As I have said on several occasions, this country can no longer afford to allow absentees to hold valuable land in what I might describe as &ldquo;cold storage&rdquo;.  Accordingly, it was decided to re-examine the law relating to the acquisition of vacant farm land and if it was found to contain weaknesses or deficiencies that legislative proposals of a strengthening nature be produced forthwith.</P>
    <P>The same report put forward the idea of providing old or incapacitated farmers with a form of pension which, with the right of residence and perhaps other amenities, would enable them to live out their time in peace and comfort in their own houses while their land was made available to younger persons better fitted to work it.  We saw this as a suitable compromise which would on the one hand allow the Land Commission to proceed with the work of structural reform and at the same time reflect a proper concern for the aged and avoid any disruption of their accustomed way of <Col N="70" /> life.  The elderly farmer would not be treated as an obstacle to be removed; rather would he be accorded his proper place as a senior and respected member of the rural community who had earned the right to retire with dignity&mdash;and with security.  A plan for life annuities along these lines was prepared and the basic legislation to implement it is now before you.</P>
    <P>The Small Farms Report also suggested a system of loans to enable a progressive farmer in a congested area to migrate himself to a better holding of his choice rather than have him wait, as at present, until such time as the Land Commission might come round to dealing with his townland. This idea we found acceptable in principle and it was decided that it should be put into effect.  Indeed, I have personally advocated a scheme of this kind for many years, both inside and outside this House.</P>
    <P>In the preliminary drafting of schemes to give effect to these two new ideas, I found that in each case the Land Commission must be prepared to offer cash for the land they proposed to purchase.  Indeed, in the case of the elderly farmer, it was vital that they should be able to offer him part cash and part life-annuity for his land.  But I was only too well aware that the provisions of the 1950 Land Act relating to the purchase of interests for cash were very restrictive &mdash; so restrictive, indeed, that if they were to apply at all to the land of a particular elderly farmer it would only be by the merest accident.</P>
    <P>In regard to this matter of cash purchase I found also that there were other ways in which the rigidity of the 1950 provisions hampered the progress of land reform.  For example, if a holding is on the border line between agricultural land and forestry land, so that part of it could be used for re-arrangement of the neighbouring holdings but a substantial part of it should obviously and logically be utilised for State afforestation, the Land Commission are inhibited from purchasing it for cash.  They may not make a positive purchase for the partial benefit of Forestry Division although, oddly <Col N="71" /> enough, if they buy land for rearrangement and later find that they cannot use it for this purpose they may then consider the Forestry Division as a suitable allottee (Land Act, 1950, section 28, subsection (12) ).</P>
    <P>It seems obviously desirable that, where small farms exist in mountainous regions, the work of the Land Commission on structural reform should be harmonised with the work of State afforestation and it follows that the provisions of the 1950 Act which inhibit co-operation should be reviewed.  For the various reasons mentioned, it seems clear that the legal restrictions on cash purchase must be relaxed in several respects and my colleagues agreed that I should put forward legislative proposals for major changes in the relevant sections of the 1950 Act.</P>
    <P>It was evident at this stage of the general assessment that we needed a new Land Bill for the purpose of authorising the entirely novel schemes now proposed and also to make better provision for the working of the existing machinery of compulsory acquisition and cash purchase.  I must mention, however, that even if we had no new schemes in mind we would have been obliged to introduce a new Bill because of more urgent need under an entirely different heading.  If Deputies will refer briefly to section 26 of the Bill they will see a proposal to make available a further £5 million in land bonds to the general land reform programme of the Land Commission.  The position is that the legal limit on the total of land bonds which may be issued has virtually been reached and without new legislation in this respect this winter, the portion of the programme which is financed by bonds must come to an abrupt halt next March or April.  It is estimated that at the New Year the Minister for Finance would only have a remaining authority to create land bonds to a total of £300,000 whereas we would probably be asking him for £1 million.  Thus, though sections 5, 6, 34 and 41 are the most interesting items in the Bill the fact remains that it is more imperative that section 26 be enacted.</P>
    <P>When I came to review the matters <Col N="72" /> which need to be dealt with in the Bill, I found that in the years since the passing of the Lands Acts 1950 and 1953, a substantial number of flaws and inadequacies had appeared in the operation of the land code or that, through the passage of time, some sections of the Acts had become out of date.  Clearly, the thing to do was to take advantage of the opportunity to remedy all these other difficulties in the one piece of legislation.  The result is the present Bill of 45 sections.</P>
    <P>Having given the House the background of this Bill, I now propose to deal with it section by section.  As I suggested at the outset, Deputies have before them a very informative White Paper but I may nevertheless be able to add something further by way of verbal explanation.</P>
    <P>I think that sections 1, 2 and 3 call for no particular comment and that section 4 is the first item on which I should speak.  It was necessary to define &ldquo;congested areas&rdquo; for the purposes of two subsequent sections in the Bill and many Deputies who are familiar with the land code will have noticed that in furnishing a definition I have used as starting point the &ldquo;congested districts&rdquo; of the old Congested Districts Board.  The Second Schedule is in fact a recital of the list of the counties and rural districts given in section 46. subsection (1) of the Irish Land Act, 1909.  But there are other parts of the country which by modern standards must also be regarded as substantially congested; large districts in south Ulster and north Leinster and smaller areas mainly in the mountainous parts of south Leinster and east Munster could qualify for the description.  So that justice may be done to genuinely congested areas whether north, south, east or west, section 4 contains machinery for the making of Ministerial Orders declaring further areas to be congested areas for the purposes of sections 5 and 7.  I have in mind that after the enactment of this Bill the Land Commission Inspectors will carry out local surveys and submit reports on which a series of such Ministerial Orders will be based.  Having regard to the many variable factors involved, we have tried to provide&mdash;in subsection (2)&mdash;a <Col N="73" /> reasonably elastic formula for determining where congestion exists.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides the basic authority for the introduction of a scheme for the making of loans to progressive farmers in congested areas who are willing to migrate themselves but who lack the necessary capital. Details of this scheme have still to be finalised but the general pattern is outlined in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages we see for this scheme is the fact that it can be made to operate very expeditiously. The procedure used in purchasing the old holding will be that followed under the cash purchase provisions of the 1950 Act&mdash;almost exactly the same as in a sale between private persons.  When the applicant comes to take over his new holding from the vendor, the Land Commission will be ready to enter into possession of his old holding, pay him at once for it in cash and make available to him the additional loan on which they have decided.  In the typical case, too, the applicant will be taking over existing buildings; he will not have to wait for the erection of new ones.</P>
    <P>Deputies may remark that it is nowhere laid down that the migrant must remove himself out of the &ldquo;congested areas&rdquo; and they may be fearful that men may seek loans under this section to move merely from one congested area to another without any overall advance towards solving the main congestion problem.  The Land Commission, however, will see to it that no such misuse of the section arises. The resettlement of self migrants under the scheme in existing congested areas will be controlled so as to ensure that it will not conflict with the general programme of the Land Commission for those particular areas.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear also that this new scheme, which we might refer to as the &ldquo;self-migration&rdquo; scheme, will be in addition to and not in substitution for the traditional schemes for long-distance, short-distance and local migration which have been operated for many years by the Land Commission directly at its own instigation&mdash; these will of course be continued.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> Section 6 provides authority for an entirely new scheme under which the Land Commission will pay for land by way of life annuity rather than capital sum and it is designed for the farmer who is no longer able to work his land to the best of his ability. Where an elderly bachelor owns a farm, or an ageing couple who have no children to succeed them, the tendency is that the land becomes less and less intensively worked.  Even where the standard of farming does not notoriously decline, it may be found that it suffers a relative decline through the lack of incentive and the will of the owner to keep abreast of the times.  In such a case, it is clearly in the national interest that the owner should be persuaded to allow the lands to pass on to more active hands.  But an elderly countryman is not usually prepared to uproot himself and to face into, say, the noisy life of a big town. It seems to me, at all events, that he would more often be prepared to settle for a secure income, a quiet life in his own home in accustomed surroundings and, perhaps, a few roods of garden such as he would be able to tend in his declining years.  This is the basic approach of section 6.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) is framed on the assumption that the farmer is willing to sell his land to the Land Commission under section 27 of the Land Act, 1950.  I have referred before and shall refer again to proposals for broadening the scope of that section.  If he is, say, 65 years of age or if he is younger but incapacitated, he may obtain an offer of a life annuity, as an alternative to the usual cash.  Depending on his own needs and prejudices he may choose either form of payment or, within reasonable limits, a combination of the two.  Most often, I should imagine, he will want some hundreds of pounds in cash to meet immediate commitments and he will ask that the remainder be paid on an annuity basis.  Under subsection (2), there will be a prescribed table of annuities based on life expectancy by which the amount of his life annuity will be established.  Such annuity will, in the typical case, be substantially greater than the annual amount which could <Col N="75" /> be got if, say, the vendor had been paid in land bonds; and had retained them as an investment.</P>
    <P>If it is argued that a man should not dissipate his entire estate by taking an annuity which will die with him, my answer is that this section is meant, essentially, for persons without dependants. The farmer who has a son or daughter to succeed him will not be interested in the scheme one way or the other.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that subsection (3) provides for &ldquo;primary&rdquo; and &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; annuities; for married couples this provision is compulsory.  I have given careful thought to the question whether the owner of the land should not be given freedom to choose between this double annuity and a once-for-all annuity which would die with him or her.  On balance, I have decided that it would be wrong for a State agency to deal with a man on the basis that he would take all for himself and leave nothing for his widow if he should be the first to die.</P>
    <P>Although the section will apply to the sale of an interest in land which is held jointly or in common, it will be seen from subsection (3) that if a husband and wife have joint interests in the land, or interests in common, they will not come within the general rule for the provision of primary and secondary annuities.  The theory here is that if each has a separate interest in the land there are, in effect, separate sales and each of them, as an independent vendor, gets a separate personal life annuity.  The effect will be much the same as with other married couples; the household will have two annuities while both are alive and one annuity for the survivor.</P>
    <P>In the case of the elderly owner who has reached or is approaching the age for a non-contributory old age pension, the scheme will carry the special attraction that the first £3 per week of a Land Commission life annuity will not reckon for means test purposes.  It is felt that this concession must be offered if the owners of small properties are to be brought into the scheme; otherwise the full application of ordinary means <Col N="76" /> test rules would bear so heavily on these smaller owners that there would be no attraction about selling to the Land Commission at all.  This concession is not a matter for a Land Bill but will be dealt with later under a Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>Another obstacle to the success of the scheme came to light when I considered the case of the incapacitated man who is by no means elderly and who has a full expectation of life for the reason that the injury or illness which incapacitates him is not such as would hasten death.  On a strictly actuarial basis, such a man would be likely to obtain a very small life annuity, perhaps half or one-third of what an elderly man might get for the same property.  Accordingly, it is intended that the regulations to be made under subsection (4) should provide for a special additional allowance to be paid to the incapacitated owner from the date of sale until the date he becomes eligible for the old age pension. This will not be part of the life-annuity, which will in every case be calculated strictly in accordance with subsection (2).</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that in future the halving of annuities will not be conceded to allottees of enlargements, cottiers and other persons in non-congested areas.  The State is subsidising the relief of congestion and the consequential problems arising from congestion to a very heavy degree.  It is necessary, therefore, to establish certain priorities in these forms of State subsidisation so that the money expended will give the most effective results.  It is in the congested areas that there remains the real hard core of congestion, including rundale estates.  In many cases this hard core of congestion has proved virtually unbreakable up to the present time.  In particular, in dealing with rundale estates, it is essential to get the co-operation of all the people concerned to enable a rearrangement to be achieved.  It is therefore necessary to provide every inducement possible to try to solve these very difficult cases, and accordingly the benefit of half-annuities is being applied to the congested areas.  The position, however, <Col N="77" /> is very different in the non-congested areas and, compared to the exorbitant conacre rents now ruling in these areas &mdash;and which most of these allottees continue to pay before the Land Commission gives them the extra land they require&mdash;the full Land Commission annuity, based on the actual cost price of the land, must be regarded as a reasonable impost.  Deputies will remember, of course, that this is a purchase annuity, and not a rent.  I am sure it will be appreciated that the substantial State subventions that are required each year for land settlement work should in the main be utilised for those most in need of them, viz. the migrants and the small farmers in acutely congested areas.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with a doubt which has arisen regarding the Lay Commissioners' powers to summon witnesses to attend at hearings.  This power, incidentally, is rarely needed.  The real difficulty arises from the fact that a power to summon is of little use if there is not also a power to punish non-compliance.  Accordingly, subsections (1) to (3) set up machinery for summoning and examining witnesses and subsection (4) provides that persons guilty of non-attendance or obstruction may be referred to the High Court for correction.</P>
    <P>Section 9 simply confirms that a local authority has power to contribute voluntarily towards the cost of Land Commission works from which the local authority derives benefit.</P>
    <P>The next two sections deal with maintenance of improvement works and rates on vacant buildings.  The provisions are fully explained in the White Paper and it is scarcely necessary to elaborate on them at this stage. I assure the House that they are not intended to absolve the Land Commission or the Minister from any responsibility or liability which a reasonable man would impose upon them.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is of importance because it introduces the idea of a thorough control over the subdivision, letting and subletting of all agricultural land. Under the existing law, in various Land Acts between 1881 and 1936, the majority of owners of agricultural <Col N="78" /> holdings are obliged to obtain the consent of the Land Commission if they desire to sub-divide or make lettings of their lands.  There are a number of exceptions to this requirement, for example, holdings sold under Acts before the Land Act of 1923 are subject to sub-division control only while the purchase annuity is payable. The Land Commission's control over the fragmentation of holdings, therefore, has a very incomplete and patchwork pattern.  The proposition now put before the House is that there should be complete and uniform control in all cases whether the lands were or were not purchased under the Land Acts; without such uniformity much of the work of land reform could be impeded or frustrated.  Deputies will accept that landowners must not themselves be free arbitrarily to recreate the conditions which we are striving so hard to undo.</P>
    <P>I regard section 13 as one of the most important provisions in this Bill. It is designed to counteract any deliberate obstruction by way of sale, etc., to compulsory acquisition proceedings by the Land Commission. Such attempts at deliberate obstruction are not uncommon and not only do they cause confusion when they occur but they may ultimately result in the proceedings being defeated.  It is considered unreasonable that a land owner with a bad ownership record should be able to frustrate the land settlement plans of the Land Commission for a particular locality just by effecting a quick sale of his property.  The section accordingly provides a system of control on dealings in lands in respect of which the Land Commission have issued a Notice of Inspection or where a provisional list has been published.</P>
    <P>In many proceedings under the Land Acts, the Land Commission find it necessary to appoint Limited Administrators to enable dealings to be carried out in relation to lands of deceased persons but over the years the Land Commission and the Land Registry have found that the existing powers in this type of case are deficient in a number of ways.  Section 14 is designed to overcome all these difficulties by introducing a new concept of a Land <Col N="79" /> Commission nominee who will represent all parties with interests in a holding and who will normally be the person in effective control of the holding, whether as principal or as agent. There will be legal power to deal with this nominee as if he were the owner for all purposes except the distribution of purchase money.  This procedure will facilitate the completion of the Land Commission proceedings without affecting in any way the various legal interests in the property.</P>
    <P>It is often alleged that one of the great troubles about the Land Commission from the point of view of landowners is the delay in getting paid. The system of judicial allocation of purchase moneys is necessarily involved but it has many merits from the point of view of protecting the rights of all interested parties, especially where land has been compulsorily acquired.  With a view to expediting this branch of the Land Commission's work, sections 15 and 16 provide for:&mdash; (1) the delegation of decision functions to Examiners of Title, and (2) the authorisation of acceptance of a shorter root of title than heretofore.</P>
    <P>So that Examiners may not be inhibited from exercising these enlarged powers, section 17 provides an indemnity for them against actions which parties aggrieved by <i>bona fide</i> decisions might otherwise take.  Similar statutory indemnity has always been available to the Public Trustee under the Land Acts.  There will be a right of appeal from the Examiners' decisions to the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides a simple machinery by which reserved game rights which have not been exercised for upwards of 20 years will lapse. This measure will be especially useful where former landlords to whom rights were reserved under the early Land Acts have left the country and their successors cannot readily be traced.  It is envisaged that if a farmer wants to have the exclusive game rights over his own lands and if the rights reserved on sale under the Land Purchase Acts have not been exercised for 20 years, <Col N="80" /> he will submit to the Registrar of Titles the necessary proof of non-user. If, because of a valid counter-claim, it appears that the reserved rights have in fact been kept alive, the application under this section will fail but once the owner of the rights has made himself known the acquisition of the rights by the landowner can then be dealt with under section 34 of the Land Act, 1933, or section 39 of tre Land Act, 1936.  Thus there will exist comprehensive machinery for dealing with all owners of reserved game rights whether known or unknown.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that this section is in no way aimed at persons who exercise actual shooting rights at present.  The real purpose is to clear away the debris of old pointless reservations in favour of landlords who have long since departed from the Irish scene.  Incidentally, it is intended that the Land Commission themselves should use this section to divest themselves of reserved sporting rights in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Section 19, 20, 21 and 22 are all aimed at correcting technical flaws in the existing machinery of resale and revesting.  They are explained rather well, I think, in the White Paper and none of them should prove troublesome or contentious.  I cannot deal with them at any length without becoming involved in considerable technical detail and so, if the House will permit it, I propose to await questions on any aspect of these sections which may trouble Deputies.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 provides for adjustments in land finance accountancy to meet some of the effects of the Statute of Limitations, 1957.  The Land Commission will lose title to certain annuities, mainly payable in respect of island holdings, because of the operation of the Statute of Limitations.  It is desirable to ensure that the resultant deficits will not fall to be borne by the ratepayers but will be defrayed, where necessary, out of central funds.</P>
    <P>Section 24 dealing with consolidation of holdings is the positive counterpart of section 12 which strengthens the power of the Land Commission to resist the fragmentation of agricultural <Col N="81" /> holdings.  That is the negative side of the picture.  On the positive side, every effort should be made to facilitate the building up of legally-consolidated units of viable size.  But the existing law is deficient in that, for example, it does not allow for the consolidation of a Land Commission enlargement with a parent holding which was not purchased on an annuity basis under the Land Acts, or where the annuity has ceased to exist by reason of amortisation or redemption.  In working to build up viable units, we must not be hampered by unrealistic technical difficulties which could lead to the ultimate undoing of the good work.  So here we have a global provision to achieve effective consolidation in every appropriate case&mdash;subject to consent of the owner of the lands.</P>
    <P>An occasional complaint made by vendors against the land bond system of payment is that, when interest rates are generally rising, a higher interest bearing series of land bonds may come into use in the interval between price fixation and vesting of lands, but owing to the terms of the existing law, payment in such case had to be made in the lower interest bearing series. There is no doubt that some landowners in the past had a sense of grievance about this point but because of the stable interest rate of land bond series, for the past three years it has not been a practical problem.  Section 25 will put the position right for the future.  There is no question, of course, of penalising any landowner should the interest rate fall after price-fixation.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is one to which I referred in my opening remarks.  It is essential for the continuance of the system of purchase for land bonds because the total supply of bonds permitted by law is coming very close to exhaustion and authority must be obtained within the next few months to create bonds up to a higher over-all limit.  An increase of £5 million is proposed.  The present annual rate of expenditure is about £1 million, so that on the face of things we are making provision for about the next five years.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 29 are best considered together.  The first makes it clear that it is legal to delegate to a <Col N="82" /> senior inspector of the Land Commission the power to decide on an inspection of lands with a view to possible acquisition; the second deals with the issue of the inspection notice to the landowner.  The reason for these sections is that it is sometimes necessary for the Land Commission to act quickly&mdash;as when it is believed that an unsuitable sale is about to take place. They will obviate the necessity of referring cases to Dublin because the senior inspectors referred to are stationed in the provincial headquarters of the Land Commission.  I need hardly say that the decision to start proceedings for compulsory acquisition, as distinct from merely having an inspection carried out, will still be a matter for decision by two Lay Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I now refer back to section 28.  This section has been inserted at the request of the Minister for Finance and though it is not of great significance at the present day, I should perhaps give some brief account of its historical background.</P>
    <P>At the time of the passing of the Irish Land Act, 1903, it was recognised by the authorities of the time that Trinity College, Dublin, would suffer partial losses of income through the redemption under the Land Purchase Acts of superior interests owned by that college.  Provision was made in section 39 for an annual payment of £5,000 to offset such losses.  The £5,000 was payable to the Public Trustee and he used it to pay the college the amount of actual losses for each year; any surplus at the end of a year was invested by him to be used to cover losses in later years.</P>
    <P>Under section 15 of the Land Act, 1923, the 1903 arrangement was abandoned and instead the college was paid a fixed sum of £3,000 per annum.  The funds in the hands of the Public Trustee were handed over to the joint control of the Minister for Finance and an officer of the college.  The matter has remained so for the past forty years; mention of the £3,000 to which I have referred will be found in the current Book of Estimates under Vote 35, &ldquo;Universities and Colleges&rdquo;, Subhead F 2.  The Minister for Finance is of the opinion that it is no longer <Col N="83" /> necessary or desirable that he should exercise joint control over these funds and so the Act of 1923 is being amended in such a way as to leave the college in sole control.  I should make it clear that all this relates only to the old accumulation of funds handed over in 1923; the disposal of the annual £3,000 has never been subject to the Minister's control.</P>
    <P>Section 30 settles a very technical point about the precise manner in which valid claims for rates should be met out of purchase moneys and compensation moneys.  It confirms the procedure at present followed.</P>
    <P>Section 31 and 36 bring into conformity with monetary changes since 1931 the monetary limits regulating the modified title requirements which under sections 35 and 38 of the Land Act, 1931, and section 52 of the Land Act, 1933, are to be applied in small purchase money and compensation cases.  The limits set 30 years ago are much too small in terms of present day values.</P>
    <P>Section 32 disposes of some awkward legal points which have arisen in relation to orders conferring and defining rights of way.  The tendency has been for the courts to apply rather restricted meanings to the wording of the sections governing the Land Commission's powers in these matters. Section 39 of the Land Act, 1931, in particular, has been found to be of much less widespread application than one would assume from a straightforward reading of it.  Needless to say, it is essential that the Land Commission should have adequate powers to provide rights of way in and out of the lands they deal with, subject to the payment of adequate compensation and the erection of fences, gates etc. where appropriate.  These latter are already provided for; but section 32 of the Bill now introduces a rewording of part of the unsatisfactory section in the 1931 Act which, it is hoped, will remedy the flaws found in it.</P>
    <P>Another small change in a money limit to allow for the changing value of money is introduced at (b) in this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> Still pursuing this question of falling money values, we have in section 33 an upward adjustment of the figure in the 1933 Act relating to the possible value of the alternative holding which must, in certain circumstances, be provided for the owner of lands acquired.</P>
    <P>In section 34, with which incidentally section 41 is intimately associated, we come to a very important matter related to the acquisition and resumption of land.</P>
    <P>If we set before ourselves the ideal of the well worked family farm as the keystone of rural life, we must, I think, be prepared to take all necessary steps to implement it.  Now the holding which is vacant and let all too often displays clear evidence that it is being inadequately cared for by an 11-months tenant.  The law as it stands, and especially section 32 of the Land Act, 1933, is not very effective to remedy this state of affairs because neither absenteeism nor repeated lettings on the 11-months system constitute of themselves, a sound legal case for compulsory acquisition.</P>
    <P>Section 32, Land Act, 1933, is chiefly relied upon in objections to compulsory acquisition since it provides a defence based on two &ldquo;adequates&rdquo;&mdash; that is to say, adequate production and adequate employment.  But it was established in a legal decision some years ago that these adequates did not necessarily have to be supplied by the owner of the land.  If the lands were let, the production achieved and the employment created by the efforts of the letting holders could be pleaded by the owner towards satisfying the requirements of the two &ldquo;adequates&rdquo;. It seemed, then, that the answer was to legislate against the let lands; to provide that the &ldquo;adequates&rdquo; must be provided by the direct action of the owner and his immediate family.</P>
    <P>On consideration, however, it was seen that the proof of letting might be very, very difficult if both parties to the letting contract set out to deceive the Land Commission.  At best, it would be a most unpleasant thing to force a man's neighbour into court to say on oath whether the cattle grazing on the lands or the growing crops were the property of the landowner or of <Col N="85" /> another.  Even the harvesting of a conacre tillage crop by persons other than the owner of the land could be represented as a neighbourly obligement or as a matter of a wage-contract. I am assuming that the conacre letting would be by verbal arrangement only and could never be proved to exist save by the spoken evidence of the parties.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations, there is the difficulty that not all lettings are to be condemned.  If we are to retain a reasonable balance in this matter, we must be prepared to make allowances for the good farmer who falls seriously ill at sowing time and for the widow whose family are too young to work the farm.  Such people must be free to make temporary lettings without the fear of losing their lands.</P>
    <P>These thoughts have led me to the conclusion that the realistic thing to do in future is to proceed against lands on the grounds that they are vacant rather than because they are let.  In other words, the absentee or non-resident should be denied the defence of the &ldquo;adequates&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Today, when the reform of the land structure in this country is one of our most urgent problems, we can no longer afford to tolerate the position that vacant and let lands may be immune from the compulsory acquisition powers of the Land Commission. This is not to say that these powers will be used indiscriminately by the Land Commission in all such cases.  As heretofore, where people are temporarily absent for special family or economic reasons from their holdings the Land Commission would not interfere with them.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the law on acquisition which causes concern is the fact that a man could use the adequates defence even though he had already indicated his intention to sell his lands.  I do not think it very logical that good production and employment by an individual should prevail as a defence against acquisition in those circumstances and thereby frustrate the hopes of local uneconomic holders of securing viable holdings.  Since market <Col N="86" /> value is guaranteed in any event, I think that lands offered for sale should immediately be considered by the Land Commission where they are required for the relief of congestion, and power to enable this to be done is being provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Accordingly section 34 provides that the defence of the adequates will not be available to the non-resident or to the owner who has tried to sell his lands in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that a body corporate cannot satisfy the residence condition by any technical device such as making the farm the registered office of a limited company.  The persons holding the real beneficial interest in such a company must themselves physically fulfil the residence qualification. Subsection (2) of this section allows for the completion of current acquisition cases under the existing law.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is also being taken to expand the provisions relating to sports fields, parks, pleasure-grounds, <i>et cetera,</i> so as to include sites on the shores of lakes or the banks of rivers which might be required for use in connection with boating or fishing. Section 41 provides for the amendment of the law relating to resumption of tenanted holdings so as to bring it into agreement with the foregoing.</P>
    <P>Section 35 is simply another amendment to allow for the changing value of money.  In this case, however, a specific financial limit, for certain expenditure on watercourses <i>et cetera,</i> is to be removed from the statute and replaced by a system of administrative control.  Section 36 I have already dealt with in conjunction with Section 31.</P>
    <P>Section 37 deals with one other problem affecting the acquisition of vacant and let holdings.  Section 38 of the Land Act, 1936, guarantees the immunity from acquisition of a newly-vested holding and this guarantee at present operates for seven years.  It is possible for the owner of such a holding to vacate it and, however badly it may be neglected in his absence, the Land Commission are at present powerless to take any action except to make him an offer for his lands on <Col N="87" /> a voluntary basis.  I think this guarantee is over-generous.  It is cut by section 37 from seven years to two.</P>
    <P>Section 38 is intended to cover cases in which, following upon acquisition proceedings, landowners obstruct the Land Commission in taking over possession or, in extreme cases, reenter into possession after the Land Commission have moved in.  The purchase money is put to credit but the owner continues to act in such a way that the Land Commission suffer damages and loss of revenue, and also incur legal costs in dealing with him. The law permits of claims to recover many of these sums but it has been found to be deficient in some respects but most of all in relation to claims arising after the date of vesting, that is to say, principally in cases of re-entry. This new section provides that all sums owing to the Land Commission by or on behalf of the owner may be validly claimed and allowed out of the purchase money.  Corresponding provision is included in respect of sums due by tenants of resumed holdings.</P>
    <P>Sections 39 and 42 deal with certain aspects of the law relating to the sale of default holdings.  Existing provisions deal with the writing off of all or part of the arrears and with the recovery of such arrears or part of them by way of advance to the new purchaser but these provisions are over-rigid in that they cannot come into play until the Land Commission have gone to the trouble and expense of obtaining possession under an Order.  In practice, the opportunity sometimes arises to sell such holdings without the necessity of first taking possession; the present proposal is to relax the two relevant sections so that they can be operated in these instances &mdash;with consequent saving in time and expense.</P>
    <P>Section 40 rectifies a small legal defect in the machinery for partitioning commonages.  Its effect will be that burdens attaching to an undivided share will transfer fully to the appropriate divided share and will be re-registered accordingly.</P>
    <P>I dealt early in my speech with the need, under several headings, to <Col N="88" /> expand the cash purchase provisions of the Land Act, 1950, that is to say sections 27 and 28.  In this Bill, the really significant item covering cash purchase is the second-last item in the Repeals Schedule.  The removal of a small part of section 27 of the Act will eliminate the narrow restrictions on cash purchase and will leave the Land Commission free to pay cash for any land or interest in land which they require for any of the purposes of the Land Acts.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that all future acquisitions will be paid for in cash; the practical extent to which the expanded 1950 provisions will operate will have to be settled administratively from time to time.  But the flexible statutory power will be there to apply them to lands held by applicants for loans under section 5 of this Bill and the elderly and other vendors mentioned in section 6 and any other appropriate cases, in addition to the limited field of activity laid down in the 1950 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 43 is a corollary to the repeal I have just dealt with.  It will free the hands of the Land Commission in reselling lands on hands which were purchased under the narrower formula existing before the repeal.</P>
    <P>The first seven items in the Repeals Schedule are associated with the sub-division control to be set up under section 12 of the Bill.  They represent the various parts of the older patchwork of control which is now being abandoned.  The eighth item is one with which I have just dealt.</P>
    <P>The last item is very much a matter of technical detail.  Part of section 15 of the Land Act, 1953, is listed for repeal because it will be rendered redundant by the wording of section 30 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, my ambition is to provide an effective weapon in this State's campaign to advance first to a sound farm structure and then, as we all hope, to a good living for those families who devote their time and talents to the farms.  In my view, the existing powers of the Land Commission are completely inadequate to deal with the solution of the congestion <Col N="89" /> problem in present day circumstances. This enabling Bill is designed to provide the Land Commission with modern and effective machinery to deal more effectively with this great national problem in this day and age. I, therefore, confidently recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill about which the Minister has now told us in detail is that which was promised to the country by the Taoiseach when he spoke in Thurles on 15th August, 1962.  At that time the Taoiseach outlined the scheme referred to in detail today by the Minister but I may say that from the evidence in the Bill itself and from the Minister's speech, the Bill falls far short of what the Taoiseach apparently had in mind when he spoke in Thurles.</P>
      <P>If we interpreted the Taoiseach's speech correctly, there was to be Government action especially in relation to western areas.  Non-farm employment was to be expanded and we were to have 40 to 45-acre holdings throughout the country: the Land Commission were to provide farms of that size.  Interest-free loans were also to be made available to western landowners who sold to the Land Commission for the relief of congestion in order to enable them to buy land elsewhere.  We were also told the Land Commission would be empowered to re-occupy vacant rundown farms.  The Taoiseach said that loans would be made available to small farmers for the purchase of livestock and equipment.  I do not see anything in the Bill dealing with those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nor do I see anything in the Bill to deal with our greatest national problem to-day, the purchase of land by aliens.  There is no mention whatever of the vast areas of land which have been transferred by sale to aliens in recent years.  Neither is there any single sentence dealing with the provision of houses by the Land Commission to small farms.  One would have expected that when the Minister for Lands, with the Taoiseach, had been forecasting a Bill of this kind since early in 1962, it <Col N="90" /> would have equipped the Land Commission with additional powers which would bestow benefits on smallholders.</P>
    <P>When I received a copy of the Bill, I was at once anxious to examine the section dealing with the purchase of lands by aliens but I could not find it because there is no such section.  Then I wanted to refer to the section dealing with the matter referred to by the Taoiseach in Thurles about loans being made available to small farmers for the purchase of livestock and so on, and again I found there was no such section.  In view of the recent statement of the Minister for Local Government regarding the provision of houses in congested districts for small farmers who have not the wherewithal to provide themselves with homes, who have not sufficient money set aside to supplement the Local Government or local authority loans, one would have expected a solution to this problem but I cannot find any solution in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister that we on this side of the House are more than eager to assist him in endeavouring to solve the problem of congestion which is a very great one in many parts of the country.  That is why I say that I hope that this Bill is not going to be used as a means by which the Fianna Fáil Party can parade around and say: &ldquo;We are going to give everyone a farm of 45 acres.&rdquo;  If the Land Commission were to provide land for everyone who applied, they would be faced with an impossible task because the land is not there for them.</P>
    <P>The relief of congestion is something which must be tackled courageously and with intelligence, bearing in mind that we have a terrific amount of congestion and that it reflects itself in the families of the congests inasmuch as you have smallholders endeavouring to eke out an existence on a 20 or 30 acre holding or less and finding it impossible to do so.  As a result of their plight, many small farmers and smallholders have had to emigrate and their sons and daughters have had to emigrate along with them.  As a result of serious problems facing small farmers with small holdings, there are fewer people in rural Ireland today, fewer children attending our national schools <Col N="91" /> and fewer people attending the parochial churches.  The flight from the land has been particularly bad in the west of Ireland, and even in other areas, apart from the congested districts.  It should be our aim to establish as many families as possible on the land and provide them with a decent living.  We should endeavour to curb the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>The Government have not got a real grasp of the seriousness of the situation There are many vacant small holdings today which are vacant, not because the owners were anxious to travel but because they could not live on the acreage of land on which they were obliged to live.  We have the experience of the farmer on approximately 50 acres who has three or four sons.  All of them are anxious to remain on the land and work the land but it is only suitable for one member and the other two sons must leave the district to seek another way of living. A very serious effort will have to be made to re-establish people on the land.  The Government must have some idea of the seriousness of this problem when they introduced a Bill of this type.</P>
    <P>The proper description of this Bill is: &ldquo;Too little and too late.&rdquo;  It reminds us of Lanna Machree's dog which went a little bit of the road with everybody and the whole of the road with nobody.  It endeavours to deal with the problem of congestion in a halfhearted manner.  Despite that, it will not meet with serious opposition from this side of the House at this stage but we do propose to be extremely critical of every section on the remaining stages and particularly on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>If we compare the Government's policy in relation to land and congestion with that of the Fine Gael Party, we find that there is a difference. It is our primary duty to keep people on the land, to encourage them to remain on the land, and not to assist them to come off it.  I see that under this Bill loans are to be provided for a smallholder in a congested area to purchase a holding of his choice elsewhere, provided he gives up to the <Col N="92" /> Land Commission for the relief of congestion the small holding on which he lives.  Why not give him the loan one way or the other?</P>
    <P>The policy of Fine Gael in regard to the plight of the small farmer is to provide farmers with interest-free loans of up to £1,000 for schemes aimed at increasing production which are planned in conjunction with the local advisory services.  We do not propose to deal with the problem in a half-hearted manner by offering a man a loan to buy the farm of his choice elsewhere. If he wants to remain where he is, why not help him to increase production on that land, to stock it a little better and to build up his financial resources.  Our problem in rural Ireland would be more courageously tackled if we invested a huge sum in keeping our people on the land instead of encouraging them, and practically paying them, to leave the land.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael realise that the small farmer is in a serious plight today.  He cannot be described as being in good circumstances or in a position to make ends meet.  Our scheme of providing interest-free loans of up to £1,000 is a scheme for all farmers.  I repeat: it is for all farmers.  There is nothing to prevent them consulting with their local agricultural advisers as to how they can spend this money wisely by improving their holdings and increasing production.  Credit facilities must be provided to encourage agricultural expansion; but paying people for leaving the land is not the solution.  We should encourage people to remain.  That is why there has been such a serious flight from the land in the west and in parts of Cork and Kerry.  Indeed, one could describe the whole Gaeltacht as being in that serious situation today.</P>
    <P>One of the main planks of Fine Gael policy is that all small farmers, whether in congested districts or not, will be provided with new dwellings by the Land Commission.  It should be their duty and responsibility to become an agency for the provision of houses for the people in the country.  The rents of these houses should be repayable to the Land Commission with the annuity on the same basis as the considerable improvement <Col N="93" /> work carried out under Section B of the Land Reclamation Scheme.  This Bill falls short of its purpose by not saying that the Land Commission should provide houses for our small farmers.  Local authorities find themselves unable to cater for these people.  The demand for housing in the urban areas is such as to keep them busy for a long time to come.  The only agency that can readily provide the small farmer with a decent roof over his head is the Land Commission, and there should be provision in this Bill to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this Bill has not dealt with the question of the purchase of land by aliens.  I do not know whether that is deliberate or not.  We have had discussions on this matter time and again.  Questions have been asked and we have had the Minister saying that aliens purchase only land unsuitable for anything else and that in many cases where aliens purchased land, the land was too bad for the Land Commission to interest themselves in it.  Not so many weeks ago, we heard the Minister say in this House that large tracts of land were purchased by aliens but that the land was too poor to be even considered by the Forestry Division for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered if the Minister or the Land Commission have a true picture of the amount of land being purchased by aliens.  When I speak of land, I mean good, arable land&mdash;not the type of land the Minister says he would be glad to see aliens coming in to buy up.  The information I have does not correspond in any way with the information the Minister must have in regard to this problem.  I do not know if the Minister has any account of a survey carried out recently.  He must have because he has referred to the report of the Small Farms Committee.  There is a paragraph in that report relating to the sale of land to foreigners.  When the report was circulated, that section was not completed.  Nobody can say that the land around Athboy in Meath is bad land, that persons living in Meath would be inclined to give land away for nothing or that the land there is of <Col N="94" /> too poor a quality even for the Forestry Division to take over.  Yet, according to this report, convenient to Athboy in Meath, there are 500 acres; convenient to Kells 200 acres; convenient to Clonlee 200 acres; and at Trim, Meath, 150 acres held by foreigners.</P>

I will proceed to say that there are in the hands of foreigners, convenient to Trim in Meath, 150 acres and convenient to Edenderry, 250 acres.  Nobody can say that the land around Edenderry is of very poor quality.  Convenient to Naas in County Kildare, there are at least 500 acres in the hands of foreigners. <Col N="95" /> Not so very far away, in Straffan there are 160 acres held by foreigners; in Moyvalley, 400 acres; in Ratoath, 100 acres, in Slane, 100 acres; in Ashbourne, another 100 acres, in Straffan, County Kildare, over 200 acres.</P>

      <P>I want to point out that while we are told that the Land Commission are anxious to get land for the relief of congestion and to assist smallholders, some of the best arable land in Ireland today, in what can be described as the richest counties, has changed hands and been purchased by aliens and the Land Commission did not say &ldquo;boo&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister now knows that this colossal acreage of good arable land in the midlands and in Meath has been sold to foreigners.  The passage of this Bill will not prevent the foreigner from coming over here and buying up the land of this country.  There is nothing in this Bill which will in any way hinder aliens from coming over here with their chequebooks and continuing to buy up the various tracts of good land that come on the market, thus denying the local smallholder or small farmer the right to an addition to his holdings.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the seriousness of this problem, I respectfully recommend to the Minister that he should take steps to insert on Committee Stage a suitable section in the Bill to deal with it.  Now that the Land Commission are prepared to pay the full market value, I fail to understand why they cannot obtain the lands that aliens are allowed a free hand in purchasing at the present time.</P>

      <P>It is well known that aliens are concentrating on purchasing further large tracts of land in this country.  The Bill should provide for the establishment of a register in which all details will be recorded as <Col N="96" /> to the nationality of persons buying Irish land and where such persons are not Irish citizens or have not ordinarily been resident in this country in very recent years, provision should be made in that regard.  Details should be kept in relation to the area, the valuation and the purchase price.  All these details should be recorded by the Land Commission by law.  In regard to the purchase of land by aliens, the provision of houses for small farmers, the interest-free loans to which I have already referred, the Bill falls far short of what was expected.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to congested districts and under the Bill the Minister has power to declare any area a congested district.  Recommendations were made by the national councils of Macra na Feirme in relation to this matter to members of the Oireachtas.  One recommendation was that legislation be enacted immediately to preserve the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland.  There is nothing in this Bill to implement that recommendation.  Is it an unreasonable provision to make?  Is it unreasonable to suggest in an Irish Parliament that an Irish Government should take steps to provide that the land of Ireland shall be for the people of Ireland?  This is a very important matter and one which is not being catered for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the making of an order in respect of congested areas, the Bill should refer to the whole country, not to the congested areas as they exist at the present time or not to whatever areas the Minister may declare to be congested districts, on representations made to him.  There are pockets of congestion in every part of this country. In the Second Schedule, reference is made to Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, parts of Clare and the portion of West Cork comprising the former rural districts of Bantry, Castletown, Schull and Skibbereen.  Everybody knows that there are pockets of serious congestion, for example, in Monaghan, in parts of Cavan.  Everybody knows there is a serious problem of congestion in parts of Wicklow and in parts of Wexford. The same applies to Laois-Offaly and to parts of Limerick.  The Minister <Col N="97" /> would be very well advised to consult the Land Commission again when dealing with this matter because in practically every county, there are areas which can properly be described as congested districts.  Any legislation in respect of this matter should relate to the whole country.</P>
    <P>I have referred to advances for the purchase of land by persons in congested areas.  That is not a proposal which will meet with any opposition from this side of the House.  I say, again, that the Fine Gael proposal would meet with a greater measure of success and would have more immediate beneficial results.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill is worthy of comment.  It deals with the payment of certain purchase annuities, and so on, in full.  Subsection (1) provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever a payment to which this section applies becomes due to the Land Commission, such payment shall, notwithstanding anything contained in Part III of the Land Act, 1933, be payable in full by the person or persons liable from time to time to make such payment.</P>
    <P>When we reflect on what our small farmers endured during the years of the Economic War when they were told, first, that the land annuities would be done away with altogether&mdash; and then that they would be halved</P>

      <P>We now find, after all the hardships which our people endured, that the halving of the land annuities will not be of any benefit in future to a person who gets land from the Land Commission in a non-congested district.  The halving of the annuities should continue.  The classes affected are farmers with existing holdings in non-congested districts who may receive enlargements and cottiers and other persons who may get allotments in non-congested areas where surplus land is available. The position now will be that the halving of the land annuities, as provided under the Land Act, 1933, will be denied to the cottage tenant &mdash; a man who should be assisted&mdash;if he is lucky enough to get an allotment of land.  I feel there are Deputies who did not know of that provision in this Bill until I raised it.  It is a very serious matter.</P>
      <P>All of my constituency&mdash;indeed, the greater part of Leinster &mdash; can be referred to as an uncongested area.  As the Minister has not declared any part of the midlands a congested district, does that mean that in future anybody there who gets land from the Land Commission will not get the benefit of the Land Act, 1933?  Then there are accommodation plots which are often provided for cottage tenants and other smallholders.  Under section 7 of this Bill, they will be denied the benefit, in non-congested areas, of the halving of the land annuities.  This section denies to practically everybody who will be lucky enough to obtain a holding from the Land Commission the benefit of the halving of the annuities.  That is most objectionable and the matter will have to be debated in greater detail in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall have to give section 10 very serious thought.  The points I desire to raise on the section will be raised on the Committee Stage.  It would appear that section 10 is an attempt to shift responsibility from the Minister for Lands and from the Land Commission to the shoulders of the <Col N="99" /> local authorities.  I feel that the Land Commission should continue to be responsible for maintenance and other works.  Local authorities have quite enough to cater for at the present time. The rates this year have probably gone beyond the paying capacity of the people.  Therefore, whatever is now the responsibility of the Land Commission should remain the responsibility of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Section 13, which deals with the prohibition of sale, transfer, letting or subletting of certain lands without the consent of the Land Commission, requires very serious consideration. Subsection (2) provides:</P>
    <P>Where a notice under subsection (6) (as amended by section 29 of this Act) of section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, has been served after the passing of this Act, the lands (or any part thereof) mentioned in the notice shall not, in the period of one year commencing on the date of the service of the notice, be sold, transferred, let, sublet or subdivided without the consent in writing of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>That may be rather far-reaching.  It may be unreasonable for the Land Commission to serve a notice on the owner of a holding which prevents him from subletting, subdividing or transferring the lands for a period of one year.  I should like to know from the Minister what is to happen in the case of a land owner who is served with this notice and no immediate decision is taken by the Land Commission.  Are his lands to be left for 12 months?  If he is not in a position to work them himself, he cannot sublet them, set them or transfer them.  Must he pay rates and taxes and be at the loss of any profit from the lands?  Surely there must be some provision for such cases.</P>
    <P>What would be wrong with specifying a month to give the Land Commission time to make their inquiries? What would be wrong with two months to give the Land Commission ample time?  If they had not reached a decision by then, the Land Commission could say: &ldquo;We are not in a position to give you a decision at the <Col N="100" /> moment.  You may proceed and we will give you permission to set the lands for this season.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us deal with the case that is not suitable.  The owner's lands must be allowed to remain frozen for a year while he does not make a halfpenny piece out of them to enable him to pay his rent or his rates.  I want to put this to the Land Commission and to the Minister. If the owner is not to be allowed to sell, to transfer or to set his lands for the period of a year, will the Minister undertake, in the same way as he did in regard to the Minister for Social Welfare in another matter, to ask the Minister for Local Government to bring in a Bill exempting them from paying rates on the land for that period?</P>
      <P>I wonder will serious consideration be given by the Land Commission to the various types of people on whom they will serve notice?  I hope and trust the Minister, who is now getting powers to ask the senior inspector of the Land Commission to inspect certain lands, will not be inclined to use this Bill for political purposes because a Bill of this kind can lend itself to very serious abuse.  Up to this decisions in this regard were left entirely to the Land Commission.  For over 20 years, I have been going to various Ministers for Lands, including the present Minister, on deputations from time to time. The Minister has always told us that he had to express his very sincere regret that this was a matter entirely for the Land Commission, that he was completely powerless.  The Land Commission might do it or might refuse to do it, that all he could do was to ask them.  In this Bill the Minister is getting certain powers by which he can direct inspections by a senior inspector of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> I should like the Minister to explain the cases in which he intends to issue instructions for such inspections. On whose recommendation will they be made?  If representations are made by Fianna Fáil Deputies, will he, in order to give patronage to his own Party and his own Party's supporters, hasten the inspection of various lands or will he, about two months before a general election, ensure that every inspector of the Land Commission will be busy appearing on every farm the Minister has listed for the purpose of being able to say: &ldquo;The Minister has now authorised an inspection and the minute it is over you will get your 45-acre holding.&rdquo;  These powers might be better vested entirely in the Land Commission rather than in the Minister to be exercised at his own whim or whenever he so desires.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to raise with the Minister is in regard to the fact that the acquisition of land will still be a matter to be decided by the Lay Commissioners.  The Minister for Lands under this Bill can authorise a senior inspector to hold an inspection of lands and to make a report in that regard.  The question as to whether or not they are to be acquired is one for the Lay Commissioners and I want to refer to the present situation in regard to Lay Commissioners.  Recently the Secretary of the Department of Lands has been appointed a Lay Commissioner and, may I say for the records of the House, it was an appointment made on merit and worthy of being made.  The Secretary of the Department of Lands is certainly a man of very high standing and of great discretion who has wide experience of the administration of the Department in general.</P>
    <P>However, I want to take a case in which the Secretary of the Department of Lands, who is now a Lay Commissioner, will give an instruction to a senior inspector to carry out an inspection of lands.  When the report comes before him again, he will be dealing with the report of the inspector he sent out to inspect the lands and will be judging that report as a Lay Commissioner <Col N="102" /> afterwards.  That was all right up to this.  Now we have the Secretary of the Department who is a Lay Commissioner. As Secretary, he will be giving instructions to inspectors and authorising inspections and, as Lay Commissioner, will be giving decisions on the reports of these inspectors when they have made their inspections.  I wonder if that is right.  I want to place it on record that my experience of the Lay Commissioner who is also the Secretary of the Department has been such that it has given me grounds for the greatest admiration of him but it is a bad principle to have the Secretary of the Department, who is responsible for all these inspections, who is responsible for the administration of the Land Commission, sitting in judgement on the reports of his own inspectors.</P>
    <P>It would be better, if the Secretary feels he should give the State the benefit of his experience and wisdom as a Lay Commissioner, that he should relinquish his post as Secretary of the Department.  On the other hand, if he feels that he could contribute more generously to the welfare of the State as Secretary of the Department, he should relinquish his post as a Lay Commissioner.  This is the first time this matter has cropped up.  We had Mr. Deegan, who was Secretary of the Department and a Lay Commissioner at the same time, but at that time the Minister had not the power which he seeks in this Bill to authorise senior inspectors to make reports.  The Minister cannot say that the position in which the present Secretary of his Department is also a Lay Commissioner bears any relation to the position which existed when Mr. Deegan was Secretary to the Land Commission because the powers now sought to be vested in the Minister did not exist at that time.  That is why I think the Bill presents an entirely new set of circumstances which the Minister should re-examine.</P>
    <P>There is a weakness in Section 4 of the Bill which deals with the making of congested districts by Ministerial order.  On whose recommendation or on what grounds did the Minister make such a provision?  If there were <Col N="103" /> a recommendation from the Department of Agriculture, after consultation with the local advisory services, or if the local organisations or statutory bodies made such a recommendation to the Minister, I could understand it, but, as matters stand, we should hear much more from the Minister in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 6 gives authority for a new system under which the Land Commission will pay for land by way of a life annuity rather than a capital sum.  We have no objection to the system envisaged in section 6 but I would like to hear what is to be done about the incapacitated or aged farmer who would like to receive that Land Commission annuity but who has not proper title to his holding.  This Bill should have in it some section whereby facilities will be made available without cost to such farmers to put their titles in order.</P>
    <P>Deputies of all Parties know that the number of small farmers who have not got proper title to their holdings is astonishing.  Many holdings are still registered in the name of a great-grandfather. There were cases where no will was made, where there was no question of administration, cases where people were not anxious to be involved in legal expenses, cases where people were probably shy about talking to solicitors and slow to seek legal advice.  In many instances, such people died without having made a will and that gave all members of the family an equal share in the holding.</P>
    <P>Many members of such families emigrated.  Some of them are dead and some have not reported back home for 15 or 20 years.  In some cases there were family disagreements and some members of the family were not prepared to sign away their share unless they got a substantial sum in compensation.  The holding would not warrant the raising of a loan to settle these demands which, in many instances, bore no relation to the value of the farm because exaggerated values were put on these shares.</P>
    <P>There are many smallholders in this country who would be glad to take <Col N="104" /> advantage of Section 6 but who would have great difficulty in satisfying the Land Commission as to title.  The Minister should look at the whole matter again, and, before Section 6 comes into operation some other section should be included to enable the landowner to equip himself with proper legal title.  We all know that it costs a substantial sum of money to establish proper title.  There have been cases where the cost of probate has crippled a farmer and, in my opinion, we should have some special scheme to deal with such cases.  There is a great harvest awaiting our legal men if steps are now to be taken to put title in order.  I should be the last to advocate a harvest for the legal men but some section should be inserted in the Bill so drafted as to enable smallholders to put their title in order without cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the farmer who is so aged and incapacitated that he cannot properly work his land should retire. He is to be encouraged to retire and I emphasise the word &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo;.  I am also glad to see that the Minister today made use of the word &ldquo;persuade&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that, in view of the severe hardships suffered by CIE pensioners due to the inadequacy of their pensions, amending legislation should be introduced to enable CIE to pay a just and equitable pension to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion relates to the problem which has been raised in this House on several occasions, that of CIE pensioners. Its purpose is to seek justice for a group who are victims of an unjust, inequitable and unnecessarily complicated pensions scheme.  Here we have a ridiculous situation in which we have four different groups of pensioners, <Col N="105" /> each receiving different amounts of pension.</P>
    <P>In 1963, there are 1,040 pensioners in receipt of 12/- a week; 327 in receipt of £1 a week; seven in receipt of 33/6d. a week; and 954 in receipt of 51/3d. a week.  The 1,040 in receipt of 12/- a week are all aged over 70; the 327 in receipt of £1 a week are likewise over 70; and the 954 in receipt of £2 11s. 3d. are between the ages of 65 and 70.  To understand the position clearly, it is necessary to look at the developments prior to and after 1956 when amending legislation was introduced which increased the pension from 37/6d. a week to 51/3d. a week for all who retired after 1st April, 1956.</P>
    <P>Those who retired prior to 1st April, 1956, received no increase at all, so that the first example of disparity or discrepancy lies in the differential in pensions paid to those who retired prior to 1956 and those who subsequently retired.  This, unfortunately, is only one aspect of what can be described as the most complicated pension scheme that could possibly be devised by man.</P>
    <P>Those who retired prior to 1956 did not at that time receive any increase, while those who retired since have received an increase.  However, it is even more complicated than that.  All CIE pensions are reduced substantially when the age of 70 is attained. Between 65 and 70, the pensioner receives 51/3d. a week but on reaching the age of 70, the pension is reduced to £1 per week.  At the present time there are 327 in receipt of £1 a week&mdash; the 327 who have reached the age of 70 since 1956.</P>
    <P>This leaves us with the largest category and the worst paid group of all, the 1,040 men who are receiving 12/- a week.  These men all retired prior to 1956.  When the amending legislation of 1956 was passed, the men who were then 70 years or over were in receipt of 6/- a week.  In 1957, this sum was increased to the present figure of 12/- a week.  One might say this was a substantial increase, an increase of 100 per cent, but it does not work out anything like that because when those people were brought from 6/- to 12/- a week, a food voucher of £1 per month <Col N="106" /> was taken away so that in fact their net increase was only 1/- a week.  As I have already said, the whole system is unnecessarily complicated and very difficult to unravel so as to get a true picture.</P>
    <P>To understand the motion more clearly, however, we can divide all CIE pensioners into two groups&mdash;those under 70 years of age and those over 70.  At present those who retire at 65 receive £2 11s. 3d. a week and will receive it until they reach the age of 70 when their pension is reduced to £1 per week.  There are 954 in receipt of £2 11s. 3d.  There are 327 who retired since 1956 receiving £1 a week and there is the third category, those who retired before 1956 who receive 12/- a week.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any valid reason for the reduction of these pensions when pensioners reach the age of 70.  I concede that a man qualifies for the old age pension at 70 but we had better keep clear of that matter for the moment. Neither is there any valid reason why the 1,040 who retired prior to 1956 should be victimised so that they receive only 12/- a week.  This victimisation is all the more difficult to understand when one examines the position of the CIE superannuation fund.  In 1962 the total amount of the pension fund was £3,428,994.  This sum invested at five per cent would yield £170,000.  The annual income of the fund is £200,000 approximately from the Board and £82,000 from the men. Added to the £170,000 interest, we get a total of £452,000.  In 1962, £213,000 was paid out of the fund in pensions so that it means only half of the income was paid out and the other half went into reserve, which goes to show that the fund is far from being bankrupt and could more than allow a substantial increase in the pensions.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out already, there are 1,040 men receiving 12/- a week.  If we contrast their position with that which obtained 40 or 50 years ago, we find that a man who retired then received £700 or £800 gratuity and 16/- a week pension, which was a non-contributory pension.  Surely this is a very great reflection on all who are responsible for the present situation.  This fact <Col N="107" /> alone should compel the Minister to take the necessary steps to ensure an equitable and just reward for these men who have given long and faithful service.  This motion is an attempt to secure justice for these men.  Numerous attempts have been made in recent times to do this; representations have been made to different quarters by different people; but no progress has been made and we are left with a system which is unnecessarily complicated, inequitable and which cannot be justified in the year 1963.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>taking account of the establishment in June, 1963, of the Commission to examine the Pension Schemes and the Sickness Benefit payments for the regular wages grade staffs of CIE, consideration of the position of the existing pensioners should be deferred pending receipt and consideration of the Commission's report. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am assuming that the motion refers to CIE wages grade pensioners.  At the outset, I must explain that under the Transport Act, 1950, I am empowered to confirm any superannuation scheme for CIE employees or any particular class of employees submitted to me by <Col N="108" /> the Board of CIE and I may require the Board to prepare and submit such schemes to me.  I have no statutory authority, however, to require CIE to amend an existing superannuation scheme, in which matter the initiative rests with the Board.  In confirming a new scheme or an amending scheme which has been submitted to me I may, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, modify the scheme as I think fit whether by deletion, addition or otherwise.  Deputies will appreciate, therefore, that in the absence of amending legislation, any proposal for an increase in the pensions at present paid to CIE wages grade pensioners must come from the Board.</P>
    <P>The CIE pension schemes for regular wages staff provide for fixed weekly contributions and for fixed weekly rates of pension.  The contributions and pension rates are not related to length of service or wages earned.  The rates of pension for members who retire on reaching the normal retiring age of 65 years differ as regards those who retired before 1st April, 1956, and those who retired after that date, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Pensioners who retired before 1st April, 1956, get 20/- per week for life, or 30/- per week from 65 years to 70 years and 12/- per week for life thereafter, or 37/6d. per week from 65 years to 70 years and 6/- per week for life thereafter (subsequently increased to 12/- per week).  The member's weekly contribution rate in this scheme was only 1/-.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Pensioners who retired after 1st April, 1956, get 33/6d. per week for life, or, in the alternative, 51/3d. per week from 65 years to 70 years and 20/- per week for life thereafter.  The member's contribution rate in this case is 3/- weekly, as compared with 1/- in regard to the previous group of pensioners.</P>
    <P>Female members pay a reduced contribution to the schemes and receive correspondingly reduced pensions. The normal age of retirement for females is 60 years, as against 65 years for males.  The number of female members in the schemes is very small. At 31st December, 1962, the number <Col N="109" /> of CIE employees who were members of the wages grade pension schemes was 12,731 and in 1962 these members contributed £83,000 to the wages grade pension fund against a contribution of £216,000 by the Board.  The Board's contribution per member in 1962 was, therefore, approximately 6/6d per week, while the member's weekly contribution was only 3/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Statutory Instrument which set up the fund for the wages grade pension schemes in 1949 provided that the Board's contribution shall be not less than the members' contribution and that subject to this minimum the Board's contribution &ldquo;shall be such sum as the Company think expedient having regard to any report received from the Actuary as to the solvency of the Fund and to every other circumstance which in the opinion of the Company is relevant&rdquo;.  It will be seen, therefore, that the Board's present contribution to the wages grade pension fund is quite a generous one compared with the members' contribution.</P>
      <P>At 1st November, 1963, there were 2,399 CIE pensioners, of whom 960 male pensioners were in receipt of 12/-per week, 482 in receipt of 20/- per week, 6 in receipt of 33/6d. per week and 915 in receipt of 51/3d. per week, while 36 female pensioners received weekly sums varying from 10/- to 18/-.  In addition to the foregoing there were 736 pensioners who retired before reaching the normal retiring age of 65 years because of redundancy and ill-health and who receive pensions of varying amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE wages grade pensions must be viewed in conjunction with the Social Welfare benefits to which CIE pensioners are entitled.  Prior to the Social Welfare Act, 1960, which introduced the contributory old age pension, CIE pensioners were entitled to the non-contributory old age pension but payment was subject to a means test.  In fact, the CIE wages grade pension schemes were deliberately designed to enable the pensioners to take advantage <Col N="110" /> of the non-contributory old age pension. Prior to 1st April, 1956, when the CIE wages grade pension schemes were amended to provide for increased pensions and contribution rates, the great majority of CIE employees opted for a pension of 37/6d. a week, reducing to 6/&mdash;subsequently increased to 12/&mdash;a week at 70, or of 30/- a week reducing to 12/- a week at 70, in preference to a flat pension of 20/- a week for life, so that they might qualify for the full non-contributory old age pension at 70.</P>
    <P>The present position is that CIE wages grade pensioners are eligible, in addition to their pensions, for (i) unemployment benefit or disability benefit between the ages of 65 years and 70 years and for (ii) the contributory old age pension at 70 years.  As Deputies are aware, these Social Welfare benefits will be increased in January, 1964, and the position will then be that a CIE wages grade pensioner who is in receipt of a pension of 12/- per week will have a total income, between his CIE pension and his Social Welfare benefit, of 62/- per week if a single man or 99/6d. per week if a married man.  The other CIE wages grade pensioners will have total incomes varying from 62/6d. to 93/9d. per week in the case of single men and from 92/6d. to 123/9d. per week in the case of married men.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that in considering the rates of pension drawn by existing CIE pensioners, the entitlement of the pensioners to Social Welfare benefits should be disregarded. In so far as increases in pension are sought on grounds of &ldquo;severe hardship&rdquo;, to quote the motion, this argument is entirely invalid.  When comparing CIE wages grade pensioners with other categories of pensioners, regard should be had to their entitlement to social welfare benefits.  Established ESB workers, for instance, are excluded from social welfare benefits other than widows' and orphans' pensions and their retirement pension scheme is set at a level which takes account of this.  The Bord na Móna pension scheme, on the other hand, is designed to supplement the social welfare benefits to which its employees <Col N="111" /> are entitled so as to secure for them a reasonable all-in retirement income.  It is relevant in this connection that the contributory old age pension is intended to be a national retirement pension for workers generally and that the Social Welfare Act, 1960, provides for modification of existing pension schemes to take account of it.</P>
    <P>For instance, under the ESB Manual Workers Superannuation Scheme a member who retires at the age of 65 years, after 45 years pensionable service, can receive a maximum retirement pension of £5 0 4 per week.  He has not contributed for social welfare benefits other than widows' and orphans' pensions and is not entitled to unemployment benefit between 65 and 70 or to contributory old age pension thereafter.  This £5 0 4 per week is, therefore, his total retirement income.  By contrast, the figures I have already quoted show that a CIE pensioner can have a maximum weekly retirement income of £4 13 9 single, or £6 3 9 married.</P>
    <P>On this basis, CIE pension rates taken together with social welfare benefits are not unreasonable when compared with other pension provisions and it is clear that existing CIE pensioners have already secured very substantial increases in their retirement incomes.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a five-man Commission was established in June 1963, to examine the pension schemes and sickness benefit payments for regular wage grades of CIE and to make recommendations not later than 31st December, 1963.  The establishment of the Commission was in accordance with the proposal agreed by the parties concerned in the negotiations for the settlement of the CIE bus dispute.  While I understand that the Commission will not deal with the position of existing pensioners, I consider that the matter is to a certain extent <i>sub judice</i> and that the consideration of the position of existing pensions could most appropriately take place at the same time as the Commission's report is under examination.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that to take any steps to recommend to CIE to make <Col N="112" /> changes in the present pension rates would be somewhat anomalous when we do not know what proposals will be forthcoming from this Commission for present CIE workers who retire in the future.  It seems to me reasonable that we should examine this matter in relation to the recommendations that come from the Commission and that, naturally, if any action is taken, it would be taken in connection with new legislation governing the future of CIE, which has to be implemented by this House some time about April next year.  In the meantime, as Deputies are aware, these CIE pensioners will be given the increase in the contributory pensions which is being offered in January, 1964.</P>
    <P>The only observation I have heard up to now in regard to this matter which needs attention from me is the suggestion that the fund could afford increases in the pensions.  The demand on the fund is increasing each year as the proportion of those on the lower pre-1956 rates diminishes.  The fund is examined actuarially at regular intervals and CIE must pay whatever is necessary to keep it solvent.  At present it is just solvent and no more.  I have carefully inquired from CIE about this matter.  As Deputies know, the arrangements for this pension fund are supervised by CIE with the collaboration of the trade unions concerned.  The trade unions are surely aware of the actuarial state of the fund.  When I say that the fund is only just solvent and that CIE could not afford, as of now, to increase pensions, that is a fact and I hope the House will accept it.  We have gone into it very carefully.  I think it is true to say that the trade unions would be most insistent that the fund would be only just solvent and CIE would not be in a position of deliberately withholding pensions from deserving workers if it were possible to grant them.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to consider the question of existing CIE pensions without considering contributory social welfare benefits.  As the House will remember, when the Minister introduced this scheme, it was deliberately designed to alleviate hardship and to provide some reasonable foundation for the <Col N="113" /> welfare of retiring workers.  It was made applicable to CIE pensioners who had already retired, with the results I have already stated.  While admitting that the pension of 12/- a week is not high by any standard, I do not think it can be said that the total benefits secured by CIE pensioners under this scheme are absolutely miserable.  For a married worker to receive 99/6 up to 123/6 a week indicates that we are making social progress in that regard.  I hope Deputies will bear with me in that and, as I have said, when we have received the Commission's report, then we will have to decide what to do and in connection with the re-examination of the transport system, we will again review the existing pensions to see what, if anything, can be done.</P>
    <P>The Government's action in introducing the social welfare scheme of contributory old age pensions indicates that we have natural sympathy with people who retire from work and that any action we take will be taken in a spirit of social justice.  We will see what the position is.  So I confidently recommend the amendment.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the motion.  I do so most enthusiastically. I do not know how any Minister could come into this House and seek to justify, as the Minister has sought to justify tonight, awards of pensions as low as 12/- per week.  The fact that these pensions have been in operation since 1956 makes the matter more serious.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he has no power to amend this scheme.  It is not good enough for him to say that the increase must come from the Board of CIE. I feel that the overwhelming consensus of opinion of Deputies will be such as to bring to the Minister the realisation that he is treating these ex-employees of CIE in a most shabby and dastardly fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a question I put to the Minister some time ago in respect of CIE pensioners and the amount of <Col N="114" /> pension in the various categories, he did in fact tell me that there were some of these ex-employees of CIE who were in receipt of a pension as low as 6/- per week.  It would seem that since that question was tabled by me, the pensions have been increased. At least, there is no indication in the Minister's statement to us here tonight that there are any persons now with pensions as low as 6/- per week.</P>

      <P>However, the Minister bases his arguments mainly on the fact that these people now enjoy social welfare benefits.  I suggest that the question of social welfare benefits should not enter into this debate at all. These people were contributors to social welfare funds and were entitled to social welfare benefits in their own right as insured contributors.  For any Minister of State to slash the pensions of his employees on their getting a social welfare pension, non-contributory, at the age of 70, is despicable in the extreme.  I know of no good reason why the Minister should bring in this question of social welfare at all. Indeed, the Minister pointed out that many of these pensionable employees who retired prior to April, 1956, opted for the then prevailing higher pension rates of 37/6d. a week up to 70 years of age and took the 6/- per week, or the lower rate, from 70 onwards in order to qualify for the then non-contributory old age pension.  That was the weakest argument that the Minister could have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that it was his Government who laid down the means test and who denied these people an opportunity of getting a decent old age pension by reason of the fact that they maintained this rigid means test down the years and it was only quite recently that it was relaxed for insured contributors.  It is no argument. <Col N="115" /> It is no credit to the Minister's Board or his Department that many of these unfortunate people had to opt for the lower rates of 6/- and 12/- a week in order to qualify for the old age pension under the then rigid means test which applied.</P>
    <P>There is no employer in this State who would recommend a pension scheme of around 12/- a week to his workers.  If that kind of offer were made nowadays to workers or their trade unions, they would regard it as a colossal insult.  Indeed, it is true to say that many employers make available worthwhile pensions to their employees on a non-contributory basis and it is particularly deplorable for a State body and a Minister for Transport and Power to set such a bad headline as to stand over the payment of such a miserable pittance as 12/- per week to so many workers who gave the best years of their lives to the building up of CIE.  These men went through tough and difficult times.  They gave the best years of their lives to the GNR, GSR and now CIE.  It is particularly deplorable that they should be treated like this in a nationalised industry.</P>
    <P>I would expect the Minister in charge of a nationalised industry, as CIE is, would set a headline for those niggardly or conservative employers in our country who are denying workers a pension scheme.  I would expect the headline he would set would be a very good headline and that the amount of money paid out in pensions would be such as to afford the worker an opportunity to live in at least frugal comfort in the twilight of his life.</P>
    <P>All Deputies have been told heartrending stories and we are aware of great suffering and privation in the homes of pensioners of CIE.  Clearly, a pension of 6/- or 12/- today is worthless, having regard to the colossal increase in the cost of living.  It is not good enough at all for the Minister to wash his hands of this proposal and to put down an amendment asking the House to await the report of a Commission on pensions before anything will be done for these unfortunate persons.  We are dealing here with <Col N="116" /> people who are over 70 years of age and many of whom are 80 years of age.  If the Minister waits very much longer, he will have depleted numbers to deal with.  Many of them will have passed to their eternal reward and will have very little gratitude on their lips for CIE.  I appeal to the Minister&mdash;I appeal to his social conscience&mdash;to recommend to the Board of CIE that the lower categories of pensions we refer to be increased out of all proportion.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask the Minister not to take into account at all the social welfare benefits which these people enjoy.  If he sets that very dangerous precedent, it will automatically happen that employers and other State bodies will also reckon social welfare benefit and the kinds of superannuation schemes which will evolve in this country in the future will be measured in shillings, like this present scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister was unwise in referring to the pension schemes of Bord na Móna workers.  They are another category of workers directly under the charge of the Minister for Transport and Power.  The pension scheme which the Minister and his Department evolved for Bord na Móna workers was so utterly mean and niggardly that the Party I represent thought fit to challenge it and to vote against it in this House.  The pension scheme for Bord na Móna workers has nothing to recommend it to anybody.  It was a deplorable scheme and it should have been rejected.  The Labour Party in this House did its very damnedest to ensure it would be rejected: it was not our fault that it went on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the officials advising the Minister in respect of pensions would seem to be ultra-conservative in their outlook but not so conservative when they are designating pensions schemes for the higher personnel in CIE: then there is no question of 6/- or 12/- a week but rather £1,000 a year pension and a colossal lump sum for the &ldquo;higher-ups&rdquo; in CIE.  That kind of social inequity is deplorable, especially such gross inequity that you can have one man going out on a pension of £1,000 a year and another going out <Col N="117" /> on a pension of 6/- a week.  Twenty pounds a week <i>versus</i> 6/- a week is the kind of inequity which we challenge: it is utterly unfair and unjust.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the members of Fine Gael who put down this motion.  I have been concerned with the plight of these unfortunate men for some time.  I am very happy to lend my voice to the sentiments expressed by Deputy T. O'Donnell and to play my part in focusing public attention on the scandal of pensions now being awarded to CIE pensioners.</P>
    <P>If we have regard to the more recent superannuation schemes evolved by CIE, particularly the redundancy schemes of recent times&mdash;admittedly, they emerged as a result of the militant action of the various trade unions involved&mdash;we now have what is regarded as a pretty generous redundancy pay scheme for the unfortunates whom CIE are obliged to lay off.  If we compare that amount with the money received by the pensioners we are concerned with at the moment, the comparison is clearly odious.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to examine his conscience in this matter and realise that the 12/- he awarded in 1956 has been frittered away to nothingness by reason of the steep increase in the cost of living in the meantime.  It is not good enough for him to look over his shoulder and to throw bouquets at the Minister for Social Welfare and to say, in effect: &ldquo;After all, these people will get a contributory pension if they live to be 70 years of age and you must add that to the CIE pittance of 6/- or 12/-.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am happy to support this motion with my voice and my vote, if necessary. I express the ardent hope that the motion will have the desired effect of increasing these emoluments for the unfortunate category of CIE employees to whom we refer with the least possible delay and that, by reason of the consensus of opinion expressed in this House, the Minister will be able to say to the Board of CIE and to the Commission now sitting that it is our view that we have treated these workers in a most shabby and despicable manner and it is high time that <Col N="118" /> these ridiculous pensions were brought up to a realistic figure in keeping with the times, prices and costs that our public have to endure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can be quite certain that when the Minister for Transport and Power comes in here, we shall get a jawful of statistics.  Some people say statistics can be used to prove anything: I think the Minister for Transport and Power believes that to be so. He introduces figures shaded to suit him so that it almost appears as if he is giving us all the story.  That indicates that he can make himself believe that what he says is the truth and nothing but the truth, whereas, nine times out of ten, it is a shaded version leaning always towards the side he wants to support or must support in the particular situation which obtains.</P>
      <P>In the first paragraph of his speech, the Minister said he has no statutory authority to require CIE to amend the existing superannuation scheme.  That may be the legislative position but surely the factual position is that, over the years, CIE were a failing institution: railways were going down and roads were coming up.  Prior to intervention by the Government with subvention, wages were not so good because of the situation that obtained. Nothing was so good, if you worked for CIE, the GNR or one of the other institutions involved.</P>
      <P>When times were not so good, there was not so much money to put into a superannuation scheme and so we had these unfortunate people finding perhaps a tiny sum put into their superannuation scheme but, if it was a tiny sum, it was quite a sizeable sum to them.  The situation now is that if these people had to rely entirely on the pensions created by their contributions, they would be in a bad way indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is Government policy&mdash;and, by now, we should know that it is&mdash;that the railways ought to be taken over, that the railways are to be preserved, that our people are to get these services, then surely it should be Government responsibility to ensure that the people who slaved for 40 years and remained in that employment when they could <Col N="119" /> have left and obtained better employment elsewhere, and at the end of an active life found themselves better off and in a better position to support themselves than they now are, will get a decent pension.</P>
    <P>We had the GNR Works in my constituency.  Some of the former workers are now employed in various companies under the aegis of the Industrial Engineering Company (Dundalk) Limited.  A lot of the retired people there are existing on this 12/- a week referred to after 70 years of age, or on this 30/- a week referred to, from 65 years to 70.  Many of these people were compulsorily retired at 65 where the practice had been to get them to sign a chit which would say that they could be discharged at a week's notice but keeping them in employment until 70 and in some cases afterwards or for five years of what could be active life. Many of these people are existing on 30-/ a week with a pension which, when they reach 70, if they have not been starved out in the meantime, is reduced to 12/- and which is added to their old age pension.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister's comparisons with the ESB are fallacious.  The ESB is not as old an institution as the railways, but during the entire period of its life it was a growing institution and, therefore, the number of people who are involved there is relatively small. Maybe that makes them weak.  Maybe they are not in a position to exert the pressure that CIE pensioners can exert on members of the Dáil and on other people in a position to plead their case for them.  If they are few, because 40 years ago there were very few people going into the ESB, and if their case is weak, surely it is no reason to bring them into comparison here and to suggest that because there is no shout from them CIE pensioners should also remain silent.</P>
    <P>Even the comparison made&mdash;and Deputy Treacy adverted to this also&mdash; with the Bord na Móna people is of no value to the Minister in his argument. I agree with Deputy Treacy that the Bord na Móna scheme is also a disgrace and, if the means were there, no <Col N="120" /> employer would offer a person who worked for forty years in his employment anything like a pittance of 12/- per week.  The means are there because the Government took the decision to maintain the railways, and if they did the least they should do is behave as any decent employer would.  They took that decision at a period when many of the people who are now existing on that pittance were working for them and, as I said before, could have left and sought employment elsewhere from a decent employer who would leave him much better off now.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in an almost patronising manner, said he would like more money to be given to deserving workers.  It reminded me of the play in which Eliza Doolittle's father pointed out that the undeserving poor could often be as hungry as the deserving poor.  These workers are all deserving workers.  If they were not they should have been discharged.  If they were kept for forty years they are entitled to a decent pension and I believe sincerely it is the Minister's duty to give it to them.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have been approached&mdash;let us make it quite clear that we have been approached &mdash;by CIE pensioners.  We have listened to their case and investigated it and we have put down this motion.  Every time the Government are in a position that is difficult they appoint a commission. We had the Milk Costings Commission, that wonderful effort which lasted seven years.  We had all these different commissions which sat for months and months and years and then they produced their findings.  If the Minister wants to follow the path of all the other Ministers in the Government he should appoint a survey team and the survey team can produce its findings.</P>

Whether he appoints this Commission or not he is sheltering behind it now.  If the Minister is doing his job he will know what the problems are.  He will know what the hardships are and should be in a position to take a decision, to bring it to the Cabinet and get it implemented.  There is no use in his sheltering behind a Commission when people are hungry.  We on this side of the House support them and if we fail in this motion now it will not mean we shall cease our activities but we shall press forward until we see that these people get a decent break.</P>

      <P>This motion has been put down by us on the grounds of equity and fair play to people who have served the nation well.  While it is true that some of the CIE workers did approach Fine Gael Deputies, the CIE workers with whom I discussed the matter were not only CIE workers but former comrades in our dark and difficult days here.  They were people who did not hesitate to risk their positions and their lives in the service of the country.  I was not at all aware of the circumstances in which they now live until it was brought violently to my notice by some of these former comrades of mine who are CIE pensioners.</P>
      <P>This motion has much to commend it.  The Minister's amendment to postpone it until this Commission reports its findings is merely passing the buck. I want to draw the attention of the House to some facts.  First, in January, 1962, I wrote to the Minister for Finance recommending that in his Budget of that year he should make some provision for these people.  The Minister very kindly wrote back to me and said:</P>
      <P>I received your letter this morning concerning CIE pensioners.  The initiative in this case must come from the Minister for Transport and Power and I am forwarding the letter to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> In moving his amendment the Minister practically said he had no function and yet here is the Minister for Finance saying the initiative must come from him.  From the Minister for Transport and Power himself I received this reply in February:</P>
    <P>With reference to your recent representations with regard to CIE pensioners I now have had an opportunity of looking into the matter. The position with regard to increases for CIE pensioners is that under existing legislation the initiative for proposing amendments to CIE pension schemes rests with the Board.</P>
    <P>He did say there he had authority to look into the matter and went on to suggest that the case was not too bad at all.  However, the case he made here today was that these pensioners are well treated and that with the contributory old age pension at the age of 70 they are very well-off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be charged with misquoting the Minister.  He says on page 4:</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, these social welfare benefits will be increased in January, 1964, and the position will then be that the CIE wages grade pensioner who is in receipt of a pension of 12/- per week will have a total income, between his CIE pension and his social welfare benefit, of 62/- per week if he is a single man, or 99/6 per week if he is a married man.</P>
      <P>He goes on to say that the other CIE wages grade pensioners will have 62/6 to 93/9 a week in the case of single men and 92/6 to 103/9 in the case of married men.  What does the Minister mean by that?  Does he imply that they are very well off and should have patience and wait until this Commission reports?</P>
      <P>That reasoning does not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> Forty years ago, the railway worker when retiring got a gratuity and a pension of 16/- a week.  When you consider the purchasing power of that money then and the purchasing power of the pension at the present time, can we say that there has been any advance in the social condition of these workers?  I assert that there has not but that, on the contrary, there has been a grave deterioration of their position.  I submit to the House that CIE workers who retired some years ago and who are in receipt of these small pensions should get this small pension from CIE and the old age pension as well.</P>
    <P>It is argued that the reason the pension was cut down was to enable the pensioner to come within the means test.  That means test has been increased considerably since but the increase has not been significant enough to carry the difference in the cost of living and increased costs which people like these CIE workers have to bear today.  I am struck by the argument of the Minister that this whole matter is <i>sub judice</i> and should not have been raised until the commission reported. In the very next breath he says that this commission has no function in relation to those CIE men.  What does that mean?  One moment he says that they should await the report of the commission and the next he says that the commission has no function as far as the railway men are concerned.</P>
    <P>The younger people will be able to fight for themselves.  The people I am concerned with are the old pals of years ago.  A great number of these men, because they considered they were in safe employment, did not apply under the Military Service Pensions Acts for pensions which they could have then obtained.  Some of them did apply but they found themselves in extreme difficulty in establishing wholetime service because of the fact that they were in wholetime employment.  A ruling by the referee brought some of them in on the grounds that their service was of a dangerous nature but that did not apply to them all.</P>
    <P>I feel that CIE would pay reasonable <Col N="124" /> pensions to their former and present employees if the Minister gave them the green light to go ahead and do so, if he said to them that the Government would make good the amount required to bring up the fund or to keep it in a solvent condition.  That would be a more reasonable charge on public funds than charges that are now being met in other directions.  It would be a very valid charge.  To compare these pensions with the pensions of Bord na Móna workers and of other State concerns is very unfair, unreal and the comparison has no substance. Does the Minister mean that the Bord na Móna pensioners are quite content with their money?  Everybody knows that is not true and that the Bord na Móna scheme was voted against in this House by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister should withdraw his amendment.  I know that a considerable number of his own backbenchers would be delighted to see this motion passed and put into effect.  If the Government take off the whips I have no doubt what the result would be.  In several parts of the country Fianna Fáil Deputies have promised support to this motion because they could not see any reason why the Government should not accept it.  The Minister should withdraw his amendment, accept the motion and put it into effect. If he does that it will show that he has regard for these men who have given valuable service to the company and to the country and he will also ensure that the purchasing power of the pension of 50 years ago will be no smaller today.  That would not be asking for very much.</P>
    <P>The railway worker retiring 40 or 50 years ago got £400 or £500.  At that rate a similar worker would need to get £1,200 or thereabouts of a gratuity now.  A worker who was getting 16/- a week in those days would need almost 128/- a week nowadays because of the depreciation in money values. Now they are told they must wait for a Commission to report and that they then might get something, that some crumb might drop from the Government's table to benefit them.  I feel the Minister is misdirecting himself, that he is not acting as he should in this matter.  Every Deputy in the House <Col N="125" /> would applaud him if he took his courage into his hands and accepted the motion without hesitation.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the question raised in this motion before I came into this House as a Deputy.  I consider the motion put down by Fine Gael to be one of two things, a cheap attempt to make political capital out of whatever the present Commission decide to do, or alternatively, a destructive effort to destroy the smooth working of that Commission.</P>

      <P>I should like to put some matters on record so that at least the records will be kept straight to a certain degree.  First of all, there is a letter addressed to me by Dr. C.S. Andrews, Chairman of CIE, on 20th October, 1958.  It is as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Deputy, I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 11th October.  The existing wages grade pension scheme was approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in October, 1957, following negotiations with over 20 trade unions. The question of retrospective application of the terms of the amended scheme was one of the primary issues in the negotiations and 1st April, 1956, was the limit to which the Board was prepared to go in this respect.  The proposals submitted by you have been fully considered and I am to inform you the Board is not willing to submit further amendments to the existing scheme to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, I got in touch with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his reply, dated 9ú Lúnasa, 1958, is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A chara&mdash;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your representations on <Col N="126" /> behalf of pensioners of CIE who retired prior to 1st April, 1956, and who are seeking pensions on the same scale as those who retired since that date.  The Minister has asked me to say in reply that the Transport Acts place on the board of CIE responsibility for proposed amendments to existing superannuation schemes.  The Minister has no power to require CIE to submit an amending scheme and the initiative lies with CIE.  In the circumstances, the representations which it is desired to make should be addressed to the board of CIE.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Minister for Transport and Power brought in a Bill whose title I cannot recall at the moment.  I submitted an amendment to that Bill but it was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  My amendment was as follows:</P>
    <P>Before Section 4 to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>All persons who are or have been members of any existing or former superannuation scheme, and all persons claiming in right of any such members, shall be entitled to the same benefits, rights and privileges and subject to the same obligations, whether obtaining legally or by customary practice, regardless on what date they became in receipt of benefits under any CIE superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy who remembers that Bill can easily refer to that suggested amendment.  Later on, I got in touch with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alderman Briscoe, and Deputy Cummins, also were in touch with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Deputy Briscoe wrote to them and got this reply on 6th March, 1962:</P>
    <P>This is to acknowledge your letter of 28th ult. in connection with CIE pensioners.  I am to inform you that this Congress had this matter in hand last year and after a considerable lapse of time were successful in having it discussed at the Top Consultative Group of CIE which is composed of representatives of <Col N="127" /> Congress and top representatives of CIE.  This Group meets each quarter. The problem is that any increase in pensions would necessitate increased contributions from existing employees of CIE.  This is the Company's attitude and we were unsuccessful in our efforts to improve the position.  I understand the Minister for Transport and Power has no function in this matter which is purely for the Board of CIE.</P>
    <P>That letter is signed Leo Crawford, Joint Secretary.  In a letter to Deputy Cummins, dated 8th January, 1962, the Chairman of CIE, Dr. Andrews, wrote:</P>
    <P>In order to maintain the existing level of CIE pensions, the Board is at present contributing almost double the amount contributed weekly by each individual member of the pension scheme.  I am sorry to have to say that I could not recommend any increase to these pensioners which would add to the Board's already heavy commitment in the matter.</P>
    <P>Later, when the Commission was set up, I endeavoured through my own trade union to raise this matter at the Dublin Council of Trade Unions.  I was, however, informed that as it did not affect the trade union to which I was attached, I had no permission to raise it but that I could write to the Secretary of the Council on it.  I did so and was informed simply that the matter would be considered by the executive committee.  I wrote also to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and on 10th July, 1963, I received a letter, this time beginning &ldquo;Dear Noel.&rdquo;  The letter stated, referring to a deputation he had met representing pre-1956 CIE pensioners:</P>
    <P>One of their suggestions to me on the last occasion I saw them was that they should have access to the Commission at present considering pension and sickness pay benefits of bus workers.  I advised them that if they wished to have their position considered, they should communicate with the secretary of the Commission. The Commission, as you <Col N="128" /> know, was set up following an agreement arrived at to settle the bus dispute. The terms of reference, although they were similar to those I had proposed for a settlement and rejected are the terms of reference of the parties to the dispute.  I told them, therefore, that I could not interfere but that they were free to contact the Commission, as I suggested. I do not think I made myself sufficiently clear to the men who interviewed me.</P>
    <P>The Minister wrote to me in order that I could make it clear to some of the people who called on me in that connection what the position was.  The position is that the Commission was set up, as decided on by negotiation between the present Minister's Department and the representatives of the workers.  One of the matters to be considered, according to the letter from Mr. Leo Crawford, was the matter of the pre-1956 pensions.  I am informed that they worked out the contributions and benefits on an actuarial basis.  I am informed that these people have applied to be heard.  I have not found out if they have been heard&mdash;I sincerely hope they have been&mdash;but I just have a note that it will be considered at the next meeting of the executive.</P>
    <P>In the light of these circumstances, and the remark that Deputy MacEoin referred to, I repeat that this motion is put down for one of two objects&mdash;to make cheap political capital if the Commission should better the lot of these men or, alternatively, to disrupt the smooth working of the Commission. I also say that while the contributory pension, which was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government, has helped considerably I hope through this Commission the men will be further helped but they will certainly not be helped further by passing this Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let us get rid of the nonsense and return to sensible facts.  If we were all as concerned as Deputy Lemass appears to be in parading our own activities as Deputies then we could not consider the problems of these unfortunate men.  There is not anybody who has put his name <Col N="129" /> to this motion who has not engaged in as much correspondence and representations on behalf of these unfortunate men as Deputy Lemass.  We saw, and the nation sees&mdash;the unfortunate pensioners know, some of them in another place in which they can be all wise&mdash; that nothing was going to come of that type of thing and that nothing did come of it.  Deputy Lemass failed miserably and so did everybody else in trying to get the Minister for Transport and Power to live up to his responsibilities as he now, for the first time, acknowledges his duty and his right to require the Board of CIE to prepare and submit a superannuation scheme for CIE employees.</P>
      <P>The Minister admitted that in the first two lines of his speech today.  He has the power to ask them to submit such a scheme.  He speaks about somebody having initiative.  Now he finds he has had that power.  Why did he not require CIE to produce such a scheme?  Why did he and the Government do nothing until the buses came to a halt and the unfortunate people of Dublin had to walk to and from work because the Minister, the Board of CIE and the union failed to discharge their responsibility to look after the unfortunate people who worked for the railways when they were thriving and many of whom worked long before many of us were even thought of, men who in the autumn of their days must look ahead to cold and bitter winter because of the neglect of the Minister and the Board to provide a decent pension scheme for them, a scheme which would match up to the value of their contribution?</P>
      <P>I am talking not of the nominal value but of the real value of their contribution.  When they contributed 1/- a week it was the equivalent of 4/- or 5/- a week today.  Instead, the Minister can superciliously say: &ldquo;They cannot expect any better than the amount in respect of which they made contributions while they were working,&rdquo; 20, 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to a very leading question: Does this Government want to govern at all?  There has hardly been any significant matter that Fine Gael have raised here, or in the country, in the last few years in <Col N="130" /> which the Government have not deliberately thwarted the efforts of Fine Gael to bring about improvements, by setting up commissions or select committees or some sort of delaying tactic.  I do not intend to go over the whole field of them but there are a few matters that readily occur to me, the reform of ground rents, the reform of the health services, the necessity to tackle the itinerant problem, the Irish language revival, the question of higher education and now pensions.  In each of these cases when Fine Gael with a courageous and progressive leading capacity has tried to do something they meet with commissions and select committees and all these things whose main objective is to prevent Fine Gael from bringing about the benefits the people so definitely want.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass quoted his own private correspondence but we have no opportunity to check whether it is even true, but if the Librarian had permitted me I could have moved the whole Library into the Dáil Chamber to quote in every volume questions by Deputies from all Parties asking for the reform of the CIE pensions scheme and as often as the question was asked, since the present Minister took office, the answer was that he had no function. Today he admitted he had a function, that he had the power to ask CIE to produce a pension scheme.  He had the power but he did not do it and this Commission is set up because he did not do it.  The busmen went on strike because he did not do it and now we are told to wait because this Commission is inquiring into the future pensions of those people who are now working.  We do not say anything about those who are now working&mdash;we are concerned about them&mdash;but deliberately confined our motion&mdash;and the Minister knows it&mdash; to the CIE pensioners.  That is not the CIE worker: it is a pensioner, a man now out of work, retired having reached the age-limit or retired through ill health.  We are concerned with him as the Minister knows.  He accepts as much in his speech in support of his amendment.  &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; says the Minister, &ldquo;that the Commission will not deal with the position of existing pensioners&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> We have not abolished the feudal powers of ground landlords; we have not properly tackled the question of the revival of Irish; we have not given the people the reformed national health services they want because the Government sets up committees to prevent Fine Gael reforms.  Now they are going one better and say that we cannot do anything for the pensioners because there is a Commission sitting that will not even consider pensioners. How ridiculous can they become?  It is a wonder the Minister did not ask the House to reject the motion because there is a commission working on ground rents: it would be just as relevant.  This is the most ridiculous amendment ever put down by a ridiculous and irresponsible Government which has ceased to want to govern and is referring every difficult and awkward problem to a commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan put his finger very pertinently on the real issue.  We have provided financial assistance to maintain capital equipment: we have relieved CIE of a whole lot of financial obligations relating to the payment of interest on the old railway transport stock.  We have been able to do that with one wave of the hand and without consideration as to the cost simply because the moneyed men, the bankers, thought it was prudent to do it.  But when it comes down to providing a little assistance for the hungry, the under-nourished, the infirm or the aged, it cannot be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was about to deal with what was described by the Minister as an attractive proposal in relation to the life annuities to be paid in the case of incapacitated, disabled or aged landowners who are to be encouraged to give up their land to the Land Commission for the relief of congestion.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the elderly owner who has reached or is approaching <Col N="132" /> the age for a non-contributory old age pension, the scheme will carry the special attraction that the first £3 per week of the Land Commission life annuity will not be reckoned for means test purposes.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with that.  Perhaps the Minister will explain whether, in the case of a husband and wife who are joint owners of a holding, this will be the first £6 per week.  I expect that the amount of the annuity will be based on the value and size of the holding which the man is about to give the Land Commission.  I am sure the scheme will vary so as to include reasonable provision for the person giving up a reasonably sized holding.</P>
    <P>I have been wondering whether the Minister should consider raising this figure to, say, the first £5 per week rather than the first £3.  I feel that in itself it will be at least some attraction in assisting people to arrive at a decision about retiring to know that they will have this life annuity which will not interfere to any great extent with their old age pensions.  I am glad that the Minister stated that after the passing of this legislation the Minister for Social Welfare will introduce suitable legislation.  The Minister and the Land Commission should have as attractive a scheme as possible for the incapacitated farmer who will still have many years to go before getting the old age pension.  If we expect him to retire and hand over his holding to the Land Commission for the relief of congestion and if he has no immediate successor, the annuity would want to be well worthwhile.  It should be based on the fact that statistics have proved that our people are now living longer than was the case some years ago.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister before announcing the full details of the scheme, and as a measure of goodwill, to have the financial benefits as generous as possible.  I can assure the Minister of the support of this side of the House for any scheme which he introduces which will encourage our people to feel that by taking part in it, they will be contributing in no small way towards remedying one of our greatest social problems, the problem <Col N="133" /> of congestion, and in addition, towards their own financial advantage.  I am glad that people are being encouraged rather than compelled in this Bill.  I hope we will never see the day when any Government or Minister will be given the power to compel people either to retire or to surrender the homes in which they have been born and bred.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty of encouraging people.  Older people particularly need encouragement in regard to this matter and I wonder if the encouragement in this Bill will meet with a favourable response.  I think it will take some time.  I also feel that full details of the scheme should be published so that afterwards it cannot be said that those who surrendered their lands were buying, so to speak, a pig in a poke. All of us have a duty in this matter and it is to encourage people, as far as possible, by sound advice to avail of this proposed scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell the House what types of people will be considered for land in congested districts. The first duty and obligation of the Land Commission will be to look after the local smallholders, that is, people living on small holdings convenient to the estate concerned. Figures showing the numbers of smallholders are very alarming.  We have people eking out or trying to eke out an existence on holdings which can be described as miserably small.  The big difficulty we have had with many people working those small holdings was that they found it extremely difficult to obtain local employment which would enable them to live in the district.</P>
    <P>I find some of these figures astonishing. We have here three great social evils, unemployment, emigration and congestion.  They are inter-related.  The problem of congestion is of great magnitude and I have been wondering how long it will take to solve it.  Consider the position in Cork.  It is the largest county in Ireland.  There are in Cork 9,814 holdings of less than one acre. We may presume that these people, registered owners of these small holdings, have other employment and are not dependent on the land for a livelihood. Again, in Cork, there are 2,000 <Col N="134" /> holdings from one acre to five acres; there are 2,000 holdings from five acres to ten acres; there are almost 1,500 holdings from ten acres to 15 acres; there are 4,500 holdings from 15 acres to 30 acres; and there are 18,958 holdings under 30 acres.  Holdings of under 30 acres are uneconomic and those who own them are entitled to enlargement under this scheme.</P>
    <P>In Clare, there are 7,000 holdings under 30 acres.  In Kerry, there are almost 4,000 holdings under 30 acres. In Galway, there are 16,500 holdings under 30 acres.  In Leitrim, there are 7,777 holdings under 30 acres.  In Mayo, the Minister's county, there are 23,101 holdings under 30 acres.  In Roscommon, there are 11,350 holdings under 30 acres.  In Sligo there are 9,053 holdings under 30 acres.  In the entire province of Connacht, there are almost 68,000 holdings under 30 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy mind quoting the source of these figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the survey undertaken by the NFA and Macra na Feirme.  In the Twenty-six Counties, we have 234,244 holdings under 30 acres.  It is a very interesting figure.  The figures quoted show how difficult the problem of relieving congestion is.  It is quite impossible to bring every holding up to the standard of 40 to 50 acres.  We have not got the land.  I should like to know what priorities will be given by the Land Commission.  I presume the small holder of 30 acres will be brought up to 45 acres, and likewise the 20 acre holder.  That will not cope with the problem of farmers' sons who have been trained on farms, who understand farming, who are fully equipped in modern farming methods, who are anxious to work land, to produce more, to provide themselves with homes into which they can bring a wife and in which they can rear families in Christian decency.  There is no provision for these in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy of Fine Gael to operate a scheme whereby such young farmers will get farms at an annual <Col N="135" /> rent or by way of lease, leaving their capital free for stock and equipment. It would be well worth the Minister's while to have consultations with the officials of his Department, with the NFA and Macra na Feirme, to discover the best method of putting the land of this country into the hands of those who will work it.</P>
    <P>We have too many smallholders and it is that fact which confronts us now with this terrible problem of congestion. During the last war&mdash;every Deputy in this House can vouch for this&mdash;it was the smallholder who grew the wheat, the oats, the beet and the barley and saved this country from starvation.  The large farmer made his contribution, too; the law was there and he complied with it.  It was the small farmer, however, who took off his coat and produced the food for man and beast.</P>
    <P>Some Government in the not too distant future will have to tackle courageously the problem of the smallholder. Will this Bill be effective in encouraging people to leave the land rather than stay on it and get their livelihoods from it?  We have the lowest marriage rate in the world.  That is connected with our land problem. Potential young farmers have no prospects. In conjunction with the proposed scheme, there should be a scheme enabling young farmers to get land.  Lands that are let in conacre over a long period, lands that have been purchased by aliens, should be put into the hands of young farmers. The lands could be let at a yearly rent or on lease, giving those who work them the first option on it in the event of their disposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister realises it is not easy for any farmer to have the money to buy lands for three or four sons.  If he has to raise the money by way of loan, it means it has to be paid back with interest.  Instead of having to raise a loan, the farmer's difficulty would be better met by a scheme of loans such as proposed by Fine Gael. In that way, capital would be left available for the purchase of stock and the equipment necessary to work the land properly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> We now have a provision whereby cottage tenants can obtain land.  There has been a good deal of confusion in the past as to whether cottage tenants are entitled to land or not.  The Land Commission never laid down any regulation debarring cottage tenants. I have seen many of them obtain accommodation lands of from five to ten acres.  If the Minister goes to the trouble of finding out how these people work that land, I bet they will give a reasonably good account of themselves.</P>
    <P>One section of the community deserving of more consideration in the allotment of land is the Old IRA applicants. Old IRA service should not be forgotten in the allocation of land, providing the applicants are in a position to work the land and live in the vicinity of land being divided.  But it cannot be expected that their IRA record can be handed down from father to son, and that the son or grandson is entitled to land.  It should apply only to applicants with actual service.</P>
    <P>When considering land in this country we can make three classifications: tillage farming; the rearing of cattle for beef for export; and the dairying industry.  This Bill should maintain a proper balance between the three.  I would not like anything in the Bill to interfere in any way with the dairying industry.  The manufacture of butter, cheese, chocolate crumb and other milk products for export is of vital importance. Of equal importance is the production of beef cattle for export.  We can boast of being able to export the best beef in the world.</P>

      <P>Surely that is the responsibility of another Minister?  The Deputy is now going into the realms of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates what I want to convey.  If we are to send inspectors into a dairying area, special consideration should be given by the Land Commission to the type of farming carried out in an area.  One would not expect the Land Commission to act as readily as otherwise in the case of a farmer who, although not engaged in tillage, may be extensively engaged in milk production.  It is extremely important <Col N="137" /> that such a man be encouraged by every possible means to continue in his branch of the industry without the threat of Land Commission notices for acquisition.  I am sure the Land Commission will have due regard to the circumstances prevailing in each area.  I hope the power being invested in senior inspectors will be used with common sense and intelligence in the administration of the scheme.  As far as the administration of the scheme is concerned, I know it will be the intention of the Government, as it is the intention of the Opposition, to see that in the acquisition of land, due attention will be given to all the circumstances, particularly the manner in which the lands are being worked.</P>
      <P>Time and again the Minister has asked for the opinions of various organisations on other aspects of policy.  Before this Land Bill was issued, it should have been the subject of conferences in the Minister's Department with the various national organisations.  For example, we do not know if the Minister has consulted Muintir na Tíre or if he has obtained the views of such bodies as the Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, Macra na Feirme and the NFA.  I know the Minister has not got the official view of the auctioneers' association. The auctioneers of this country can be of great assistance to any Minister for Lands and the Land Commission in regard to the acquisition of land, the letting of land, and particularly the circumstances surrounding the letting of land.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>There is the difficulty that not all lettings are to be condemned.  If we are to retain a reasonable balance in this matter we must be prepared to make allowance for the good farmer who falls seriously ill at sowing times and for the widow whose family are too young to work the farm.  Such people must be free to make temporary lettings without fear of losing their lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not possibly agree more.  That is what I want to convey to this House and what should be conveyed to the country.  There are certain cases, <Col N="138" /> special circumstances, in which the Land Commission will be prepared to allow lettings of land to continue.  In the case of the death of the father of a young family the widow should not have the threat of Land Commission acquisition proceedings held over her head.  It should be made known to her that she is at liberty to retain the lands until one of her sons or daughters, as the case may be, comes of age, and that the Land Commission will not interfere in any way.</P>
    <P>There are many cases of the death of a farmer who is the father of a family.  The widow should be permitted to set the lands at the best possible price she can get for them and retain the farm until her family have reached an age at which they can take over to replace the father. I am glad that the Minister has made reference to this matter.  There are cases where a farmer may suffer a prolonged illness.  There are cases where a farmer is not in a position, for one reason or another, to work the lands himself.  There may be financial reasons.  The Land Commission ought not to take drastic action but should seek advice from people who are in a position to know the circumstances.  For example, the local solicitors who would be handling the confidential affairs of such people could give the Land Commission accurate and full details of circumstances that the persons concerned might not wish to be publicly disclosed. Irish people dislike to have their business publicly known or disclosed.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of assuring the Minister that so far as the auctioneers of this country are concerned he can rely on every co-operation with the Land Commission. If the Land Commission are interested in the purchase of any holding, I can assure the Minister that in so far as the general Association of Auctioneers is concerned, if he needs advice and asks for it he will have their full co-operation and support.  The reason is that the Minister was reasonable earlier this year when it was decided that for lands purchased by the Land Commission at public sale or by private <Col N="139" /> treaty the Land Commission would pay the auctioneers' fees.  That being the case, the Minister and the Land Commission have built up a fund of goodwill and co-operation.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Land Commission, before taking drastic action in cases where lands are set, would ask the senior inspectors who are given additional powers under this Bill to consult with the auctioneers concerned.  There is no auctioneer who will not give fairly and honestly the circumstances in each individual case to the Land Commission.  The auctioneers know more than anybody else about the letting of land.  They deal more intimately with land owners. They have intimate knowledge of the position of the person taking the land and of the financial circumstances of the farmer on whose behalf they are acting.</P>
    <P>For that reason, the views of the auctioneers in charge of the letting of lands should be a very important and serious consideration for the Land Commission.  I would ask the Minister to arrange for suitable consultation between the auctioneers and the Land Commission in regard to the letting of lands and, where circumstances do not warrant full time working of the lands in question, that no drastic action be taken by the Land Commission if the circumstances are such as I have mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which will merit prolonged discussion on Committee Stage. It is a Bill with which we agree in principle and we are prepared to allow the Second Stage to pass without opposition.  We have, as I have pointed out, many amendments to suggest on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I, personally, wish the Minister good luck in any efforts he may make for the relief of congestion.  There are a few sections in this Bill which will enable him to deal more speedily with that problem, which is a problem that is near to the heart of every Minister for Lands.  It is the big problem that has faced Ministers for Lands in the past and that I am afraid will face Ministers for Lands in future unless <Col N="140" /> it is tackled bravely and courageously. There are many smallholders who wish well to any legislation that would bring about an improvement of their lot.  The Bill contains a few rather objectionable clauses which require greater explanation on the part of the Minister.  We will go into these matters on Committee Stage.  The Bill is long overdue.  I hope it will produce the results which the Minister anticipates but I say now, as I said in the commencement of my speech, I think it is too little and too late.  The problem of the relief of congestion ought not be tackled in a half-hearted manner. It should be tackled bravely and courageously.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that the powers now being given in this Bill to the Minister will be exercised impartially, fairly and broad-mindedly and will not be exercised with any political bias.  I sincerely hope that any action that is taken as a result of this Bill will be taken in all sincerity, with good intention, in the interests of the smallholders, in all cases in which the Land Commission acquire land by agreement and by voluntary sale.  In the case of compulsory acquisition, I trust the Minister will ask the Land Commission to be more than reasonable, to give the benefit of the doubt to the land owner at all times on the question of full market value.</P>
    <P>If land owners who are anxious to dispose of land, to put land into the pool of land for the relief of congestion, who are retiring from farming or who for one reason or another are putting land on the market are reinforced with the knowledge and confidence in the Land Commission that they will get full market value, that will be a considerable help in obtaining the necessary land in the pool for the purpose for which the Minister desires it.</P>
    <P>The prices paid by the Land Commission in recent years have been reasonable.  I have never known them to overpay or, so to speak, to spend money unwisely on the purchase of land.  They can afford to be a little more generous.</P>
    <P>If we are to relieve the congestion <Col N="141" /> problem, it will cost money.  If we are to help the smallholders, it will cost money.  Let us be prepared to pay full value for the land.  For the sake of the relief of congestion, it is worth more to us than for any other purpose. Therefore, the Land Commission should be generous as far as possible, bearing in mind the amount of good which a substantial estate purchased by the Land Commission will do for the community as a whole and for the interests of the people put on the holdings.</P>
    <P>The people settled in new homes on such estates will be the parents of children who will attend our schools and churches and build up our parishes.  Canon Hayes was right when he said that the principal unit of the community is the parish.  We can see it dwindling away.  That is bad for the economy, bad for the country. It is unsound and unhealthy.  Therefore, the more we do to build up the community in the rural districts and the more we concentrate on them, the better for the country as a whole.  We must endeavour to make life more attractive for the people in those areas. We must establish them in new homes where they will rear their families. That should be our aim.</P>
    <P>Again, where there are objections or where reasons are put forward by the owner of land as to why it should not be acquired, I trust that in future the Land Commission will be more realistic in their approach.  Every one of us in this House must know of cases where the Land Commission refused to acquire lands which they should have acquired and, on the other hand, of cases of land which they acquired and divided but with which they should not have interfered.  I cannot say at the moment what motives influenced the Land Commission in that regard but there is ample evidence in rural Ireland that there are many large tracts of land which the Land Commission have refused to acquire for no apparent reason.  No reason was made known to the public as to why they did not acquire such lands. In many cases, farms were compulsorily acquired from hardworking, reliable, decent people who worked <Col N="142" /> them well and what matter if congestion were relieved as a result of it, but instead a number of what we can describe as slum holdings were created as a result and the position ultimately became worse than it was originally. That is why, if an owner objects, I think the objection machinery should give him a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>With regard to lands that come on the public market, I am sure the Minister will have a fund of goodwill if he is prepared to pay for them.  By setting the example of paying full market value, by being reasonable and generous in consultation with the auctioneers and others concerned in the disposal of lands, I feel a fund of goodwill and co-operation will be built up whereby, over a period of years, the pool of land required by the Minister will be obtained.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Land Commission well in their efforts to cope with the problem but this Bill falls short of my expectations.  Having heard the warnings of the Minister for some years, I was expecting better things.  I hope that his attitude in relation to landowners may, as a result of this Bill, be changed.  There is little use in the issue of warnings and threats to our landowners: the day is past when any Minister can do that and hope to achieve his objects.  Instead of a warning and a threat, the hand of friendship should be extended.  There should be a spirit of co-operation and goodwill between the landowners and the Government and that would produce better and more beneficial results.</P>
    <P>I was anxiously awaiting the circulation of this Bill.  From the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Lands and from the speeches of various Ministers throughout the country, I was expecting great things.  I was expecting a revolutionary Land Bill.  I was expecting a Bill that would contain many provisions in which this Bill is lacking.  Maybe this measure is a first instalment of land legislation: I do not know.  If it is a first instalment of Land Bills, would it not have been better for the Minister to wait until he and his Department could decide fully on a more positive <Col N="143" /> course for obtaining land for the relief of our congestion problem?</P>
    <P>This Bill contains one or two attractive provisions but it contains, also, a number of objectionable provisions. In other words, it reflects a Government trying to relieve the congestion problem but finding themselves handcuffed and blindfolded. That, really is the summing-up of this Bill.  I was expecting that the matters and the points I raised in relation to Fine Gael land policy and, indeed, the points I raised tonight and earlier this evening would be incorporated in this Bill.  However, we must deal with the measure on its merits.</P>
    <P>There are many beneficial provisions lacking in the Bill.  I trust that, by a full and thorough examination, this House may more actively interest itself in the workings of the Land Commission. I expect that this Bill will be debated well, fully, wisely and impartially by the House.  Of all the legislation we can discuss, there can be none more important than a Bill which can be of such great benefit to our rural community.  Therefore, the Bill is a measure that should engage the active attention, wise counsel, constructive proposals and suggestions of all Deputies.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by saying that the Minister will be met from this side of the House not with unwarranted criticism but with goodwill, with concrete suggestions and with whatever advice we can give in an effort to mould our land policy to conform with what we feel will be most beneficial for our country and the relief of congestion?  We are all genuinely sincere in our efforts to do something for those who are suffering from the great disability of congestion and for that reason, let the Minister be assured that when he comes here with reasonable proposals, he will be met not with any opposition but with practical suggestions.</P>
    <P>If we make suggestions from this side of the House, we make them in the full knowledge that we are doing our duty as the Opposition and in an effort to direct the Government into <Col N="144" /> what we feel is the proper way of thinking in the national interest.  Every member of our Party is deeply concerned about conditions in rural Ireland as affected by the obligations and duties of the Land Commission and particularly by the workings of this Bill.  I can assure the Minister that it is not our intention now or in the future to be in any way obstructive. Fine Gael never stood in the way of anything that was progressive for this country and for that reason the opposition we offer to this Bill will be constructive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Tá súil agam go scrúdóidh na Teachtaí go léir na haltanna seo agus go mbeidh siad go léir toilteanach cabhrú linn fadhb dheacair na talún a réiteach.</P>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister and the Department on introducing this Bill.  This is a long piece of legislation containing many sections, each and every one of which is very important. This is the most welcome step forward in legislation governing the work of the Land Commission for a long time. Indeed, I could describe it as the greatest piece of land legislation that has been introduced since the Dáil came into existence.  It is aimed at solving the legacy of uneconomic holdings which we have been left in this country.  The staggering figure of 60,000 such holdings is a problem for any Government.  Even if we had the whole of our national territory and part of the surrounding  as well, it is difficult to envisage the finding of sufficient land in order to solve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> Therefore, this is a very bold and courageous step the Minister has taken. He is offering encouragement to the youth of this country in a very concrete way.  He intends to provide for them the capital which will help them to purchase holdings and he is trying to create a viable farm on which a man could reasonably be expected to rear a family in comfort.  At the same time, he is providing sympathetic consideration for the elderly people who have been engaged during their lives in the difficult work of farming.</P>
    <P>There is no question of a big stick being used in this Bill so far as the owners of farms are concerned.  There is provision made in every part of it for negotiation and for the utmost co-operation between the Land Commission and those who own land and those who expect to acquire land.  If we had sufficient land this could be an easy problem but as things are, irrespective of what Government is in office, this is not an easy problem to solve.  However, the Minister has taken some steps to remedy the situation as he has found it and to bring up the size of the viable farm to roughly 45 acres of good land or its equivalent of not so good land. We welcome also the intention to provide suitable houses for these people who acquire farms.  Deputies saw the excellent model of a Land Commission house which was on exhibition in this House and it is something on which the Commission should be congratulated.</P>
    <P>There are excellent farmers in Ireland. It is not an easy occupation to master and unless you have some training, unless you were reared on a farm, it is difficult to adapt yourself to that way of living.  Many farmers' houses are isolated, situated in backward parts of the country and these people sacrifice many of the attractions and entertainments of the big cities and towns.  This Government has extended the rural electrification scheme so as to provide the power which enables farmers to modernise their method of working and to keep in line with the progress that is necessary and that will be necessary when we enter the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aiming at helping <Col N="146" /> people to have farms of a standard size so that farmers will be able to earn a living and also to compete on the export market.  For that reason when the Minister looks around to find these lands it is only natural that he would devote his attention to farms which, in the opinion of those neighbouring them and indeed in the opinion of those who would travel past them on the county roads, are not properly utilised or worked to the best advantage.  There are many such farms in the country which have been let or set over a period of years. Probably they changed hands each succeeding year with the result that those who acquired them neglected them or were not encouraged by virtue of the fact that they might not succeed in purchasing on the eleven months system the following year, and did not use the necessary fertilisers or drain the land.  Therefore, from year to year it deteriorated and after a lapse of ten, 15 or 20 years in many cases it went back to heather and was of very little use to anybody.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that the Minister is interested in that situation and that he has asked his officers to compile a list of such holdings in each county. I am not saying he will go in straight away and acquire this land by force but at least people will come to understand that they had better dispose of it or return to it themselves and maintain it properly.</P>
    <P>No country the size of Ireland with so many uneconomic holdings can afford so many derelict farms and we must take steps to ensure that they will be put into production as quickly as possible, and that those people in the neighbourhood with small farms and large families will get portion of these lands.</P>
    <P>In schedule 2 of the Bill, the Minister has defined certain areas as congested areas and I would ask him to include in those areas certain parts of my constituency of County Cavan where many holdings are uneconomic. He has power in the Bill to do that and these areas should be included in it.  Many of them have for years been known to be congested and the position in that regard has not improved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> I do not intend to delay the House to any great extent except to say that, to my mind and to the minds of many others who wish to see conditions improved, the Bill is a great step forward.  The last speaker made reference on a few occasions to Fine Gael policy with regard to land and loans.  The trouble I saw in his speech was that he was trying to blow hot and cold at the same time.  He tried to tell us that we should prevent people from exercising free sale and in the next sentence said that we should take over land.  I do not think that is a fair approach because the Minister has no intention of trying to bulldoze this Bill through to the detriment of those who are working their lands properly.  This Bill was never intended to do that.</P>
    <P>We can take his statement with regard to the £1,000 loans free of interest as Fine Gael propaganda.  It is a well-known fact that you cannot get money off trees and indeed not many years ago the people opposite were not able to provide even small loans for houses.  The National Loan the Deputy's Coalition Party tried to float for a miserable £9 million was not fully subscribed so that it is not as easy as the Deputy may think to provide £1,000 loans free of interest for the farmers.</P>

That may be the right of a politician but it is not a fair way to treat this House, which is full of politicians.</P>
      <P>The last Deputy to speak also said a lot about the sale of land to foreigners.  We should ask him if he is in favour of the three F's for which the farmers of this country fought.  I will not deal with the contribution made by some of his colleagues about the bringing in of foreigners to buy land because that is a matter between themselves. We welcome this Bill as a genuine effort to cope with the problem which has been handed down to us for years. We wish the Minister every success with it and will give him every assistance in putting it into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>A Land Bill in any country is a very important measure <Col N="149" /> but in this country it is something that should be handled with great care. There is one fact of fundamental importance here, that is, that no amount of talk will increase the amount of land available for distribution and no number of Land Bills will make the pool of land available any bigger.  I take it that the Land Commission have been using all their efforts over the years to make available as much land as they could reasonably take in for the purpose set out in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister traces the background of this Bill which, he states, is the reason for its introduction.  I think he will agree that the background of the Bill is an historical one, one that we in this country can only describe as land hunger.  Land is something for which the people of this country have always been fighting, something that has brought both joy and sorrow to a great many people.  At no stage will the claims of people for land be fully satisfied.</P>
      <P>The foundation of this Bill is the report of the Commission on Small Farms which inquired into the situation in the west of Ireland, the situation in what are referred to as the congested districts.  That is the historical problem created for us in the past and it is because of that historical problem that the great struggle, led by Michael Davitt and the people of the Land War, began.  It was these people who fought for the three Fs which have always been the keystone of Irish land policy.  That is something that will always be cherished by the people.  Every student of history, whether the most amateur type or those who have gone more deeply into it, will find that the three Fs are still the basic keystone of land policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I look at that and hear the Minister saying he is now seeking to hammer out a new deal for the small farmer and that at this stage the plan is based on traditional farming which would provide for the farmer the same standard of living as that enjoyed by his counterpart in industry, I am very concerned.  That, indeed, may be the aim and I personally hope the Minister can achieve it, but I doubt very much <Col N="150" /> so in the circumstances of our country and because of the number of holdings which are so small and unsuitably situated.</P>
    <P>The Minister's aim is to provide holdings of from 40 to 45 acres of good land.  If we are to have holdings of from 40 to 45 acres of good land in this country generally, I should like to know from the Minister what would be the aggregate size of the standard farm on the western seaboard, taking a line from Lough Swilly to Cork Harbour, which would provide that acreage of good land.  Taking the Second Schedule to the Bill, I notice that the Minister lists a number of counties and districts as being within the congested area.</P>
    <P>I was amazed, to say the least, to find that in his list of other areas, the Minister mentions east Munster.  Generally in Munster, we regard east Munster as being that portion of Munster which traditionally contains the better land.  I can take my constituency of West Limerick as not being in east Munster.  In fact, I claim it to be as congested as any portion of any county along the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>County Limerick has a total of 17,000 holdings and the statistics show that of that number, and this includes east Limerick, 8,992 are under 30 acres.  If I am to relate the problem being tackled by the Bill to the question of what will happen in relation to these small holdings, I can see the immensity of the problem for the Land Commission in that area alone. In fact, I cannot see how a solution is physically possible unless we are to take the people from that area and place them elsewhere.  But, of course, they are not included in the Schedule and I want to know from the Minister if this means they are to be excluded from national land policy.</P>
    <P>Does it mean that the people in that portion of our national territory are not to be the care or concern of this Land Bill?  In this context I must associate the people of my constituency with the advise we give to people in the country generally to remain on the land and found families.  I know, and <Col N="151" /> the Minister knows, that under Land Commission policy as administered at the present time, a young man coming off his father's farm has no entitlement to land.  Should there be two or three sons on a farm of 30 acres they cannot remain there&mdash;two of them at least must leave.  At the moment, however, those two have no qualification, no matter how much time they have spent following the avocation of farming, to receive a holding from the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The only other thing open to them is industry or their capacity to convince some bank manager that they are creditworthy.  If a piece of land becomes available they might succeed in buying it.  Does this Bill decide that people in my constituency who are eager, able and willing to work a holding, may not compete for such a piece of land if they can induce their neighbour to sell it to them?  What is to be the solution in so far as such young people are concerned?</P>
    <P>There is still another facet of this problem.  In my constituency, as in all southern constituencies, the backbone of the farming way of life is dairying.  It has been a tradition over the centuries that there is dairying in Munster.  A man may take a portion of land, a farm, and work that and put cattle on it.  Indeed, at times, he might take over the cattle which are on the land, care for them, milk them, thus providing a living for himself and his family, paying the owner for the use of the land.</P>
    <P>The question of equities is raised in this Bill and the solutions which existed in the past to the question of renting land would seem to be wiped out now. In this matter what is to be the position of the dairy farmers?  I asked the Minister previously what was to become of that type of letting and the Minister said there could be letting of land up to ten years or so without in any way impairing the prospects of the owner of the land concerned.  Dairy farmers have traditionally been associated with this type of land utility&mdash; they have raised families in that way &mdash;and when the farm which they were <Col N="152" /> concerned with was sold they would have to go out and look for another.</P>
    <P>What will remain for such people if they can no longer rely on such a tradition of earning a livelihood?  I want clarification on these matters from the Minister.  I want to know what will be the position in my constituency when this Land Bill is passed.  How much does this Bill hold for the people who have been following this traditional way of life?  What does it hold for the large number of smallholders in my constituency or for the young men now growing up on these holdings and who hope to acquire land in the area in which they have been born and lived?  It is a question of the amount of land available. I do not know what solution can be found, whether we should take these people out of the place or not.</P>
    <P>When you see the provision in the Bill regarding money to enable people in the congested areas to obtain a viable farm elsewhere, you wonder will this concession be available to areas where I think the Minister will find there is great congestion.  The Department officials will be able to tell the Minister about this but I suggest that if you draw a line from Foynes in County Limerick to Newcastlewest and the Mullaghradharc Mountains and take the territory to the west of it you will find at least as many small farms in that part of the constituency of West Limerick as anywhere else. Will these people be given the same facility regarding the provision of capital to enable them to obtain viable farms elsewhere?</P>
    <P>I want to hear from the Minister when the money is made available to purchase farms, how will that fit in with the limitation of sale as I gather permission will have to be obtained from the Land Commission for sales? Do the Land Commission intend to acquire the farms and, if so, on what system do they propose to sell or let them?  What criteria will they use to distinguish between applicants from different places?  Will there be a weighting of the scales in the case of applicants from one part of the country as against others?  Will each applicant be considered on his merits? <Col N="153" /> The restriction on sale or letting is something I think the Minister should consider and I ask him to do so very carefully from the point of view of the young men who are on the land at present and for whom holdings are not available under present Land Commission policy.  Are they to be left in the position that if they get a loan or put money together, they will not have a free-sale market in which they may bid for whatever land is offered?  That is very important.  Free sale does not always apply only where the person selling is concerned; it can also apply so far as the number trying to buy are concerned.  It works in both directions and I should like the Minister to consider that because I believe his aim of settling a strong rural population in the country is tremendously important. That population, unfortunately, is not as strong as we would wish it to be. It has engaged the attention of sociologists and others interested in the flight from the land.  Will this Bill do what the Minister intends and believes it will do&mdash;halt the flight from the land?  Will it put more people on the land and will they be the vigorous type of farmer that the Minister is concerned about?</P>
    <P>We provide means in the Bill for people who become decrepit or disabled to deal with their land, but do we make it any easier for the younger, virile people to take possession of the land any earlier and at a time when they are most eager and able to establish a strong rural population?  Are we giving an opportunity for that to come about or are we closing an avenue that was already open to them? I do not suggest that is the case but I should like the matter to be examined to see if there is a solution to the problem in the type of areas and for the type of people for whom I speak.</P>
    <P>The relief of congestion is a big problem in the west, in Kerry, Cork and elsewhere and would require a great amount of land.  If the problem was to be dealt with in its entirety it would need the rest of the land of the country to do it.  But the other provinces also have pockets of congestion such as the cases to which Deputy Dolan referred when he asked for the <Col N="154" /> inclusion of Cavan in the schedule of areas to which the benefits of this measure will apply.</P>
    <P>I cannot follow the argument at present as to why halving the annuities would apply in one case where a person gets additional land and would not apply in other cases.  The fact that people get additions of land seems to me sufficient proof that they have not viable holdings.  If a man gets additional land from the Land Commission, obviously he was not an economic landowner up to that and the Land Commission are attempting to put him in a position to earn a livelihood for himself and his family.  If, in one case you remove people and give them viable holdings on the halved annunity system, it does not seem logical to me that certain people in my constituency should be given additional land but should pay the whole annuity.</P>
    <P>If in any constituency where land is available surplus to the requirements of the smallholders and a cottier gets a portion of it, I take it he gets it because he has shown himself to be industrious, because his family circumstances are such that he is considered to be entitled to it to supplement his ordinary way of life, and I suggest these people are a very important section of the community in the development of a strong rural population and a viable farm economy.  Again I cannot see why there should not be equality for these people in this regard.  In regard to the measure which the Minister for Social Welfare will introduce, something which is certainly very desirable from the point of view of getting the old people off the land, I wonder in what way can the removal of £156 for the purposes of the means test be justified in this case when we do not allow it in other cases?  That, however, is something that can be discussed when the measure comes before the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister in regard to Sections 9 and 10. Section 9 provides that local authorities and other interested statutory bodies may make payments towards the cost of marine embankment repairs, et cetera.  I suppose if it is a pious <Col N="155" /> wish that they may make them it will be all right, but if they do not have the desire to make them, is it intended in this Bill that there should be some kind of pressure exerted to make them provide contributions for this type of work?  The Minister will be able to inform me on this matter when he is replying.  In Section 10, the Minister absolves himself and the Land Commission from any responsibility for works done but if I take the two sections together it seems to me it is a question of the local authority giving, but the other side may not pay. Perhaps I am misreading it, but I have looked at the two sections and I would like to have the matter clarified.</P>
    <P>If it is the intention that one side should claim for work done, and if the local authority derive a benefit from it&mdash;if the land owners within the ambit of a particular local authority benefit, they may say their holdings have been improved&mdash;the local authority may be asked for a contribution.  Again, if it holds on one side, it ought hold on the other.  If the Land Commission have been negligent and if something has happened which has caused any loss, the Land Commission should face that problem and from the national point of view, should make good the damage. They can make good the damage more easily than can the local authority from the funds available for these types of work.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that the sub-division, letting and sub-lettings of all agricultural land in the State shall be subject to Land Commission consent. I can see the force of fragmentation. Away back in history, it was the declared policy at one time that the mere Irish had to divide up their holdings between their children and this created a problem the legacy of which still remains with us.  Is any normal father who is a farmer and who has a holding and who cannot under the present policy see any other opening for two sons than working on the land, to be free to break up a holding between the two sons?  If he has a holding of 70 or 80 acres or more, is he to be prevented from giving them each 40 or 45 acres which the <Col N="156" /> Minister says would be a viable farm of good land?</P>
    <P>These are some of the points that come into my mind on reading this Bill.  The land policy is a problem which is very vexed.  I do not believe anybody or any politician would deliberately get into the land question because he generally finishes up badly. It is something that does not repay him in any way and whatever effort the Minister may make will, I suppose, inevitably be open to criticism.  I am not raising these points merely for the sake of criticism but in relation to my own constituency where we have a problem as, I am sure, other constituencies have also.  I do not see this Land Bill doing anything for the smallholders of my constituency.  As the Bill stands, I do not see it holding out any hope to them of enlargement, of removal or the creation of viable holdings.  I want to put that to the Minister because I seek their inclusion in whatever amelioration the Minister is able to bring the smallholders in this measure.</P>
    <P>I also want to put to the Minister the case I have mentioned of young men who are on farms at present but who are not eligible in regard to the division of land in their area because they are regarded as landless.  This is something about which I have spoken here on many occasions.  I do not know how it can be solved.  On previous occasions, I suggested, and I suggest again now, to the Minister, although I do not see how he can make provision for it, that we should have some system whereby there could be an apprenticeship on farms and if a young man proved himself worthy, by skilled husbandry, he should be entitled to have a holding on the same terms as anybody else: otherwise a large section of the people will be condemned to move off the land and we will remove the virility from the land and from the local population. It is something we will have to face at some stage that even for a relative number of such young people, we must provide an opportunity or an inducement to remain here and to farm.</P>
    <P>There is one other facet of this problem I should like to put to the Minister.  In my constituency and I <Col N="157" /> am sure in many others, there is this question of smallholders.  At the moment, if there are other smallholders within a radius of one mile of the lands being divided, they cannot be considered for additions to their holdings.  That is something that will need to be examined from the point of view of the restrictions we propose to apply to lettings or sales of agricultural land.  It is the highest ambition of any smallholder, by the hard and relentless work of himself and his family, to put together enough money to enable him to buy an extra plot or two anywhere within two, three or four miles of his home, because that is the only way in which he can raise the standard of living of himself and his family.  There is not sufficient land available otherwise for the amelioration of his position.  I would wish that we had sufficient land to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>I believe the flight from the land is due to the fact that we have not got enough land.  I welcome any measure designed to increase opportunities for a decent livelihood for those on small holdings.  I welcome any measure designed to create a virile rural population. In his examination of this Bill, having heard the debate here today, I would appeal to the Minister to have another look at the provisions and ask himself whether they are such as will bring about the kind of amelioration he has in mind.  I hope the Minister is not being parochial, if I may use the expression, in his outlook.  I hope he is not obsessed solely with the problem of the west.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that the problem of the small farmer is not confined to the western seaboard.  It is a problem which has its roots deep in history.  It exists all over the country. It will require the utmost goodwill, thought, diligence, and work to try to give even a section of our people the living on the land to which they are entitled.  I invite the Minister to consider the points I have put before him and I should like his reassurance on some of the matters I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from the content of the last speaker's <Col N="158" /> remarks that he has carefully examined this Bill.  It is equally obvious that the previous Fine Gael speaker had not taken that trouble, or that, if he did, his mind had not been greatly affected thereby.</P>
      <P>With regard to the flight from the land mentioned by Deputy Jones, I do not think that any Government in any country in which this problem exists &mdash;in Wales, Scotland, Brittany or elsewhere in the world&mdash;can do more than give the necessary opportunity, economic and social.  This particular phenomenon has been in existence for some years and, when all is said and done, in a free country, each generation goes its own way and makes its own decision.  With regard to the west of Ireland, and this is probably true of the whole of Ireland where land is concerned, women rather than men are to some extent responsible for the movement away from the land.  It appears to be a social rather than an economic problem in that young girls nowadays seem to prefer the type of social life available in a large city to rural life, even when every possible convenience is available to them in the country.  It is something I have never understood, but then I am getting past the stage of being able to think the way a 17 or 18 year old thinks.  This is their right and all we can do as a Government is to try to provide the opportunity.</P>
      <P>There are, as the Minister knows, two approaches being made to the problem this Bill seeks to solve.  One is the approach enshrined in the Bill. The other is an approach, which has got a great deal of clerical support and the support of certain farmer organisations, which suggests that the creation of 40- to 50-acre holdings, with the consequent further depopulation that would entail, is not the desirable or correct way in which to tackle the problem of the rural slum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other approach suggests that more intense and more intelligent use of small holdings is the real answer to the economic problems of farmers in congested areas.  If one is to judge from the figures available from county council and Government sources, there can be no doubt that farmers have not <Col N="159" /> made sufficient use of ground limestone in particular and fertilisers in general in the creation of more productive land.  I have been inquiring here and there throughout the west of Ireland and the general feeling of the farmers is that the Minister's approach is the right one.  Their belief is that it is not possible nowadays to have or to achieve a sufficiently high standard of living on a holding of anything less than 30 acres of good land.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister is being parochial in this connection.  There cannot be any doubt that he and I and all those who represent western constituencies are only too painfully aware, from personal contact, of these problems &mdash; hundreds and possibly thousands of them.  We are bound to be affected by the experience we have in dealing with our own people.  I do not think the problems are basically different in Galway from Mayo, certainly in the northern part of Galway, which is the poorer section, not the rich and lush pastures which Deputy Carty and others enjoy.  I do not believe the problem is essentially different in Clare, Kerry and that part of Cork which suffers from the same or kindred problems.  I do not think the charge can be fairly made that the Minister and those of us keenly in favour of this Bill are being parochial.  I shall go further and say I would not support this Bill if it attempted to apply to the entire country.  The powers now being taken by the Land Commission are powers that we, as a Legislature, would normally be very slow to give.  The steps the Land Commission will be empowered to take as a result of the enactment of this Bill are powers we would not like a Government Department to have in relation to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to cure an acute problem in certain areas.  It is designed to do what should have been attempted 30 years ago.  Certainly, some of the minor provisions in it, such as those clearing up the sub-division situation, should have been brought in a very long time ago.  In fact, what was happening was that the Land Commission were acquiring and <Col N="160" /> dividing land on the one hand and the people were redeeming annuities, subdividing land and fragmenting it all over the country on the other hand. It was time, if the Land Commission, the Department of Lands and the Minister were to be serious about this problem, that some of these changes were put into effect.</P>
    <P>There is one matter about which I have very strong feelings, that is, with regard to the legal procedure adopted in the Land Commission.  I hope the Minister will take this opportunity of simplifying and rationalising a procedure which has been in operation since about 1924 and which is so ridiculous as to be almost unbelievable. The time has come when it should be quite good enough to post documents to the Land Commission solicitor.  The time has come when it should not be necessary to read through a verbose and contradictory order to find out whether you should lodge documents by way of schedule with the keeper of records or lodge a single document with the examiner.  The time has come when a long and sometimes contradictory memorandum about how an allocation schedule, as it is called, should be prepared should be replaced by the simple apportionment account procedure which solicitors have found perfectly easy to operate and foolproof in practice.</P>
    <P>It is time there should be some realism about things like quasi-tithe rents.  I do not know what a quasi-tithe rent is; and, to tell you the truth, I do not want to find out, because I do not believe it exists.  If it does, I believe the cost of giving £3 a week to one old age pensioner under this provision would pay for all the money the State would lose if all the quasi-tithe rents in the whole of the west of Ireland were forgotten about.  Solicitors in their ordinary course of business deal by way of requisition on title and reply by way of apportionment account and closing.  There are only two people involved in this.  If there is a mortgagee, then there will be a third.  The only effective difference this will make is that you have what is known in the law as a three point instead of a two point closing.  I know <Col N="161" /> the Minister himself is a solicitor with long years of experience before he took up his present position.  I know he will sympathise with what I have to say.  I hope he will give effect to my wishes in this regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to Land Commission practice in the past, there is one aspect which, while I have some sympathy for it, I must deplore the action.  It is with regard to houses.  It appears to me to be very wasteful from the national point of view that the Land Commission on acquiring land should subsequently leave a perfectly good dwelling house until such time as it is practically uninhabitable and in some cases, in fact, until it is uninhabitable. That seems to be most wasteful in a country where we provide, either by rates or taxes, something like £600 for the building of a new house.  Now it is going to be more.  For the reconstruction of a house we provide hundreds of pounds in either rates or taxes.  It seems wasteful and unnecessary that these houses should, where it can be avoided, be let go to rack and ruin.  I appreciate there are difficulties.  Where a re-arrangement scheme is involved, it is not apparent to the Land Commission which particular individual will ultimately get the house.  I urge that in the interests of commonsense houses should not be left vacant for an indefinite period in the future.</P>
    <P>There are a few other minor matters I wish to mention.  For instance, suppose the registered owner of a field outside a town applies for the permission of the Land Commission to sell a site.  If it is apparent to the inspector that the sale of half a dozen sites in that field would not be open to any objection, then it should be possible to devise machinery whereby the consent, after the first consent, would come automatically.</P>
    <P>I hope that when this Bill is being implemented, the Land Commission will not be open to the charge now so often levelled against it of retaining land too long.  Land has been held for ten, 20, 30, 37 years, to my knowledge. I do not know any circumstances under which land should be kept in a state of suspended animation for a <Col N="162" /> period of 25 years.  While that is going on, the very evil this Bill is designed to cure, the evil of continual letting, is being perpetrated by the Land Commission itself and by the time the allottees, as they are called, ultimately get their pieces of land, they are waste and useless.</P>
    <P>In making this criticism, I am not in any way trying to take away from the approval I give to this Bill.  The plain fact is that under the present system when land becomes available in an area, one of two things happens. One thing is certain to happen, that is, that local congests will try to have the land acquired.  They will go to the Land Commission; they will go to a public representative; and the usual representations are then made.</P>
    <P>There are circumstances in which it is obvious that if there were fair play, these people would have the land distributed amongst them but under the existing system, by the time the Land Commission have got round to taking positive action, the land has been quietly sold elsewhere and, as the Minister so very well knows, it causes something more than disappointment and chagrin; it causes annoyance and a sense of injustice amongst these people that the Land Commission should not be able to step in and prevent an outsider from coming in and, as a result, the state of congestion in the area is perpetrated.</P>
    <P>Revolutionary, therefore, though it is, the proposal to serve notice effective for 12 months immediately land comes on the market, is the best one that is in this Bill.  From now on let us hope that the big grievance of people who see land, sometimes the only piece of land that is likely to be available in the locality for perhaps ten or 15 years, being taken away from them, will no longer have any cause.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows from his own experience that some of the rearrangement done at great expense in the constituency of South Mayo has not yielded the results that were expected. It is very sad to see the State spending a large amount of money on a comprehensive and very difficult rearrangement scheme and within one year of its completion, to find two or three new <Col N="163" /> houses, each of which cost approximately £2,000, vacant and the land unused. I have often wondered if it would be possible to go even further than we are going in this Bill, and I am as fond of freedom and individual right as is anybody else, but when one sees a large amount of money spent on the reclamation of land, money that the public have to provide through taxation, and the same land allowed to go back again into rushes, one begins to feel appalled.  When one sees the Land Commission spending an awful lot of money on the creation of viable holdings and the building of new and attractive houses and outbuildings and when these are left almost immediately afterwards, to go to rack and ruin, one is appalled.  I often wonder, therefore, if the Land Commission could not take steps to reacquire forthwith land and houses, vested or otherwise, so as to prevent them from falling into disuse; in other words, to prevent the stupid waste of public funds.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of this Bill on which I should like to make comment but there is a great deal in it which is more suitable for discussion on Committee Stage.  I do want to congratulate the Minister sincerely on this measure and to express the hope that it will have the desired effect, to express the hope that the time will come when the Land Commission, which was originally established to cure a problem and then fade out, will have cured it and will be able to bid <i>adieu.</i></P>
    <P>I believe that in many ways we cannot answer some of the questions that could be put forward because this Bill is not final.  Even when it is enacted, it will not be final, but at least it is an important step forward on the road to the solution of a very grave social and economic problem and it is a Bill which will give renewed hope to the people, particularly of the western areas, not least the constituency which the Minister and I represent, where some of the worst examples of congestion are still to be seen.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to say that I approve of the provision to pension <Col N="164" /> off, generously pension off, elderly people who are anxious to retire from farming; that I approve of the provision which will enable young men to go out into the open market and fend for themselves.  Many of the younger people are slowly beginning to realise that the State cannot do everything for them, cannot take them up in the morning, dress them, shave them, feed them during the day, give them land, a high price for everything and a comfortable bed at night; that they must be up and moving.  I hope and believe that many of the young men will find it possible and profitable to avail of the money which will be forthcoming to enable them to go out and tackle the market alone.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the principal Opposition Party is willing to give this Bill a Second Reading without asking for a division and, indeed, that they welcome it.  The fact that they do so gives the lie to the suggestion one heard from time to time in recent months that this Bill was going to meet with very strong opposition in this House.  I think it is not; I hope it is not.  I look forward to improving the Bill on one or two small points at a later stage.</P>

      <P>Tonight I listened for a long time to Deputy Flanagan, the ghost Minister for Lands in a ghost Government making a ghostly speech. It is rather amazing that when he had a chance of doing something, not only for the farmers of the west of Ireland but for the farmers in general, he forgot to do anything for them.  The only thing missing from his speech here tonight was the banshee wail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill, despite the fact that I realise he is probably 40 years too late in doing it.  He has had the courage to do what nobody else before him has attempted.  We have often heard the American slogan: &ldquo;Go west, young man, go west&rdquo;.  In my country the slogan is: &ldquo;Go east, young man, go east&rdquo; and the faster our young men of the west can find a place in the east midlands and the midlands themselves, the better for all of us.  I am glad that at last something is to be done to allow our people back to the lands from <Col N="165" /> which they were chased centuries ago. We hear a lot of ballyhoo about the people of the midlands but we forget that our Irish people were driven out to the coastline and that most of the people who are in the midlands today are the descendants of English soldiers and their ilk who took over our land. It does not matter what titles they have.  The fact is that many of these people took over our lands in days gone by and against the will of the majority of the people, they have hung on to them ever since.</P>
    <P>It is a ridiculous situation that we find the densest population in the poor lands of the west, in the poor lands along the coastline, while in the centre of the country, there is a small population on the best land in the world. The imbalance of population in this country is so crazy that unless something is done about it in the near future, there will be no hope at all for agriculture.  I travel 200 miles across the country and I find that I leave the most densely populated area in the country when I leave County Mayo and that when I come into the midlands, I come into the least densely populated area.</P>
    <P>Many of these people have three or four holdings of land.  They refuse to sell them or to make any proper use of them.  At the same time, in the western seaboard counties, we have people who would be only too delighted to take them over and make use of them.  Unfortunately, one of these brilliant coalition Governments got into power under false pretences and through false promises and made it possible for any man to get rid of his holding at a jumped-up price.  We all know that as a result of a Bill passed by an inter-Party Government, anybody can now put his land in the hands of an auctioneer and get two or three people in to bid at the auction. These people have not the slightest intention of buying the land but if the Land Commission want it, they will have to pay the highest price.  That kind of nonsense has been going on now for a number of years and it is time to call a halt to it.</P>
    <P>I know of instances in which land <Col N="166" /> was put up for sale and people brought in to make fake bids for it and the Land Commission had to pay tremendous prices as a result.  There are many people in this House who are aware that a holding was recently sold to an alleged Egyptian for £40,000 and that the Land Commission now have to take over that holding and try to let it at an economic rent to the local people.  It is beyond the time when somebody should call a halt to this practice and I hope the present Minister will do so.</P>
    <P>In my area, when Deputy Blowick was Minister for Lands, a holding was taken over and the owner was paid £70 in Land Bonds for it.  He has not yet obtained any money for it. The Land Commission people went into court and put up a plea that they wanted this land for the relief of congestion, but what did they do? They handed over this holding to a man who already had a holding of 104 acres, who is living on his own and who is 69 years of age.  Not only did that man have land but he had pull as well.  I hope things of that kind are coming to an end.  It is past time that they were brought to an end.</P>
    <P>It has often been alleged that if you were a tradesman and wanted a job from the Land Commission, you should not go looking for it with a hammer sticking out of your pocket, but that you should go to the inspector's wife with the head of a turkey sticking out from under your coat.</P>

      <P>There has been very grave discontent in regard to the Land Commission not only in my part of the country but in many other places as well.  I am sorry the Minister is not here because if what I say is wrong all the Minister has to do is to stand <Col N="167" /> up and say so.  I do not think this discontent is the Minister's fault because he is the only Minister who ever did anything for us.  There should be no kidgloves in a debate of this kind.  I do not mind anyone throwing stones at me because I will throw as many back. The big problem in these country areas is the imbalance of agricultural population. In the midlands there are the ranchers and the moneyed men.  If one has money one can get land and the amazing increase in the value of land and in the price obtained for land to-day is the best indication of how much money is being made out of land by those people who have enough of it. However, if a man has not got land and has not the money to buy it he is in a serious position.  For that reason I welcome this Bill but I sincerely hope it is not one of those sops thrown out to the people of the west.  For too long have sops been thrown out to us.  I hope this Bill, when it is enacted, will be implemented and that our people in the west will be brought east as rapidly as possible.  I do not mind if in doing that a priest loses his collection, a doctor loses his fees, a teacher loses his class or a shopkeeper loses his customers.  I am not apologising to them.  I am just speaking for the farmers.</P>
      <P>I have seen meetings held in the west, allegedly farmers' meetings, at which there was no farmer at all, and these meetings have been held purely and simply to try to prevent people leaving the area.  I hope the Minister for Lands will not be the slightest intimidated by the people who attend these meetings because they are interested in their own welfare, and not in that of the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable that it is almost unknown that any man who has ever been taken to a holding in the midlands has failed.  If there ever had been a failure it would be so rare that it should be forgotten.  That is the best proof of the ability of our people to make a living in what is euphemistically described as a viable holding.  I wonder when we are using the word &ldquo;viable&rdquo; would it be more correct to say that the main thing is a viable holder rather than a viable <Col N="168" /> holding.  Over the last thirty years the many people who came from County Mayo and from many parts of Donegal and Kerry to the midlands, who got no more than thirty-five acres and often less, have made good.  It is no use giving land to a man unless he is able to work it.</P>
    <P>Due to a Bill which went through this House during the war years the people of Limerick got a lot of land. They burned the stairs in the house, burned the rafters in the roof, if they could, and then cleared off to England. A Bill was passed to stop them from getting land.  However, it is well past the time that this should be forgotten. People have changed very much since then.  The people of Limerick today and the people of other parts of the country, no matter where they come from if they show a reasonable interest in the land should at least be given a five-year period in which to justify themselves.  In the small rural towns of the west and in the midlands if a young chap takes conacre or has in any way shown that he is interested in the development of land he should be regarded as a good client for a holding of land in the same way as somebody in a congested area who is pulled out to make room for his neighbour.  He should be placed in a position in which he cannot sell the land but if he wants to sell it to buy a better place well and good.  If he just wants to sell it to get the money that should not be tolerated under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have often quarrelled with the Land Commission in regard to their method of selecting tenants.  There are many people in the west with only four or five acres of land who have been taken into the midlands to operate substantial holdings.  The majority of them made good but, on the other hand, there was a great risk involved. I know all the difficulties that are presented by the problem of vesting.  As the law stands, in the case of a man whose holding is vested, it is practically impossible to change him as far as the Land Commission is concerned.</P>
    <P>For instance, people such as the ESB do not walk out to a man's house and <Col N="169" /> run a supply into it and hope he will pay for it.  They canvass him first.  They ask him if he will take the supply and they tell him the price.  It is very important that the Land Commission should do something similar to that.</P>
    <P>Take farmers in the west who are doing reasonably well.  In many cases they will agree to a change.  It is obvious that, having done well in the west, they will do better in the midlands or in the east.  Then the Land Commission could ask the smaller people in the west if they would use the holdings vacated by the people who have moved out.  It is a much safer and a much better course than that pursued at the moment.</P>
    <P>Take a man living in the west, almost on sand.  You will frighten the life out of him if you say to him that you will take him out of that land and transfer him, but that is what has been done.  Such a man never saw land before except in a photograph, perhaps.  I suppose it is the best commentary on the ability of our people that those who have been taken away have been so successful but I do not think it is the right method of dealing with this matter. There must be an easier solution.</P>
    <P>There are many people, even though they are in a minority, whose land is freehold.  They make no payments to the Land Commission.  Unless these people have land in some place where it is causing a tremendous hold-up from the point of view of Land Commission activities, they just cannot get anywhere at all.  That is unfair. If such a landholder pays nothing to the Land Commission, at least he has caused them no trouble.  I do not see why he should reap no benefit from the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is not necessary to tell the Minister that I wholeheartedly agree with the introduction of this Bill. Unfortunately, it is 40 years too late, but better late than never.  I am sure the Minister realises that until our agricultural population is reasonably distributed over our lands, there is little hope for agriculture here.  The great imbalance of our rural population is the cause of our agricultural trouble.  The Minister for Lands is <Col N="170" /> the only man who can remedy that situation.  It may take time but until somebody starts&mdash;as the Minister is doing now&mdash;there is no hope of achieving the objectives which we in the west would like to see achieved.  It is not that we cast avaricious eyes on the lands of the people in the midlands but when we see the poor use to which the best land in the world is put, we feel that we in the west are not being treated fairly.  Having been kept out of these lands for hundreds of years, it is time we got a chance of getting back to show what can be done.</P>
    <P>I do not know of anybody from my county who failed when he was transferred.  In all, there must be very few such cases.  Anything the Minister can do to send the small farmers in the west to better lands in other parts of the country is worth doing: there is nothing political about it.  There is no hope for agriculture in this country unless we put the agricultural population where it should be. There is no use, from the agricultural point of view, in having a small farmer eking out a livelihood along the west coast while a rancher in the midlands marches and says he is starving.  If he is starving, it is his own fault.  Any west of Ireland man who got 40 or 50 acres in the midlands would consider himself well off and would not be looking for anything from this or any Government.</P>

      <P>This Land Bill seems to me to be a very helpful measure, containing as it does 45 sections, which, I must say, were very well explained by the Minister in his introductory statement.  However, we must ask ourseslves what good can the Bill do for a constituency like mine, where two counties are involved, Leitrim and Roscommon.  In that constituency, if we look at the ratio of population to land acreage, we will find it very worrying indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Leitrim, there are 509 holdings under £2 valuation.  There are 980 holdings between £2 and £4; 1,931 between £4 and £7; 1,986 between £7 and £10; 2,210 between £10 and £15; 1,094 between £15 and £20; and there are 1,439 holdings over <Col N="171" /> £20.  There are 10,149 holdings in that county and of these, 8,710 are completely uneconomic.  Roscommon is supposed to be a much better off county.  There we have 505 holdings under £2 valuation; 1,258 holdings between £2 and £4; 2,066 between £4 and £7; 1,996 between £7 and £10; 2,907 between £10 and £15; 2,165 between £15 and £20; and 4,589 holdings with valuations of over £20.  There are 15,486 holdings in that county and of these 10,897 are uneconomic.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to make is that no later than Thursday last, the Minister, answering a question here, told us that in County Westmeath, there are 4,418 acres of land awaiting division, some of which has been held by the Land Commission since 15th November, 1960; that in County Meath there are 7,843 acres awaiting division, some of which has been in the hands of the Land Commission since 17th April, 1957; and that in county Kildare, the Land Commission hold 2,758 acres, some of it since November 5th, 1956.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves honestly what will the new Bill do to remedy a situation like that.  While so many of my constituents are living on small uneconomic holdings, hungry for migration, the Land Commission hold in three counties alone more than 15,000 acres of good land which would give 50 acres to each of 320 people.  As I said at the outset, I cannot for the life of me see how the new Bill will do anything to remedy that position.</P>
    <P>We do not really know whose fault this is&mdash;whether it is the fault of the Minister, of some of his officials or of somebody else.  If it is the fault of the Departmental officials, I would appeal most earnestly to the Minister to get on to them and get something done about this impasse, because it is no use expecting this new measure to do good generally if such elementary errors are being tolerated.</P>
    <P>The Bill in many ways falls short of my expectations.  I had hoped it would have some reference to the purchase of land here by foreigners, particularly since I represent a constituency <Col N="172" /> which, as I have said, contains so many small farmers hungry for migration and who every week read of the fancy prices being paid for good land by foreigners.  They feel, and rightly so, that it is the job of the Land Commission to buy up that land.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago, the Minister for Local Government announced a new scheme under which there are to be increased grants for buildings for farmers whose valuations do not exceed £25.  He also stated that the Land Commission would provide these people with loans of up to £500.  I had expected to hear in the Minister's speech today some reference to these matters.  Unfortunately I did not hear it.  On page 5 of his introductory statement, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>At this point I must emphasise that the adoption of an area of 40-45 acres for the family farm does not carry with it any implication of deliberately reducing the number of persons on the land.</P>
    <P>He may be right in that statement if he proceeds immediately to divide this land he has in the three midland counties I mentioned, but if the people of my constituency migrate, surely it will reduce the number of small farmers tremendously if we are to have, in my constituency, farms with 40 to 45 acres of good land.  I quite agree there is nothing wrong with reducing the number of farmers in the constituency of North Roscommon-South Leitrim because in fact we cannot hope to give the people there holdings of 40 to 45 acres of good land and still have the same number there.</P>
    <P>On page 6 of his statement, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Small Farms Report also suggested a system of loans to enable a progressive farmer in a congested area to migrate himself to a better holding of his choice rather than have him wait, as at present, until such time as the Land Commission might come round to dealing with his townland.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with him, because as some Deputy said here, <Col N="173" /> some people have been waiting for 25 years.  I feel sure there are many people in Leitrim who have been waiting even longer.  I must, therefore, congratulate the Minister on what I think is a great idea.  I would ask the Minister to tell us what the qualifications are in the case of farmers applying for this loan.  There is nothing further I wish to say at this stage except to express the hope that when this Bill is passed, it will not be left lying in the Land Commission offices without anything being done.</P>

      <P>Any Bill aimed at relieving congestion where it is most acute, that is in the west of Ireland, should be and must be welcomed by this House.  However, I have one criticism to make in regard to what happened before the Bill was introduced. I believe the Minister was unwise to announce as far back as a year ago that he proposed to introduce this Bill and to mention some of the rather revolutionary proposals he had in mind.  In the year that has elapsed since the Minister gave advance notice of his intention to introduce this Bill, many holdings have changed hands, but, unfortunately, the movement of land was in a direction other than that intended by the Minister.</P>
      <P>People who had been letting their lands for years and others who wanted for some reason to get rid of their holdings took fright and a large pool of land came on the market, with the result that farmers of substantial means who were financially sound or in a position to get money, went into the market and bought farms, thereby denying the Land Commission the opportunity of eventually purchasing these lands and making them available to smallholders.  The rich farmer became richer, or at least enlarged his holding, while the smallholders or congests saw the lands disappearing that they had expected the Land Commission to acquire and divide among them.  Therefore, I believe the Minister was unwise in giving any details of this Bill so far in advance of its introduction.  &ldquo;If 'twere done when 'tis done, then 'twere well' twere done quickly.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> It is time that the Land Commission, or the Minister by legislation, put a ceiling on the acreage of land that any one man should hold.  We have too much land held by individuals or families&mdash;thousands of acres.  Until such time as a ceiling is put on ownership, and the amount of land specified that any one person or family may hold, we are only fooling ourselves and the people because we will never get to grips properly with the problem. I do not know what the ceiling should be or how the Minister could give legal effect to it, but it must be done.</P>
    <P>In one part of my constituency, on the eastern side, around Clonfert and Eyrecourt, literally thousands of acres are being held by families and all the efforts made by the Land Commission to secure these lands have failed.  I also know that when attempts are made to acquire these holdings, it is represented that many people are employed on particular farms.  I understand the Land Commission evaluate the problem in this way: The farm with 500 acres employs 10 people.  On that basis, the 500 acres are divided by ten giving 50 acres each to the employee for the purpose of determining whether an adequate and fair number is employed on that land in relation to possible acquisition.  People are quite aware of this and will state that they have a certain number employed on the lands.  The officials representing the Land Commission are not in a position or apparently do not take steps to refute these statements when all they need do is apply to the Department of Social Welfare to find out how many insured workers were on a particular holding.  They did not do that and their eyes were wiped.  Unless they are very careful in future in regard to possible acquisition of that kind their eyes will be wiped again.  I do not know if I am at liberty to offer some criticism of the Land Courts as at present constituted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not but if a trend that has asserted itself recently in relation to proceedings for acquisition continues, it is only a waste of time for the Land Commission to <Col N="175" /> proceed for acquisition.  At a recent court in Galway, of which I am aware, the Commission sought to obtain some 300 acres.  After a long day's hearing at which witnesses of all types were summoned the Commission succeeded in getting eight acres of land.  Defence witnesses were brought from England and from far away to state that if the land was left to them and if the Land Commission did not move in they would return and work, everybody knowing they had no such intention. That seriously hampers the powers of the Land Commission to acquire.  The gentlemen in the Land Courts must be the most gullible in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes in this Bill to take drastic action against the people who have been letting their lands for years.  That is long overdue. I know of holdings that have been let for upwards of 60 years.  In one case which I reported four years ago a holding had been let for 49 years <Col N="176" /> consecutively.  To date the Land Commission have taken no action and so far as I can see no action will be taken.  It is a serious thing when you report a particular substantial holding and no action is taken by the Commission in an area where acute congestion exists.  I am highly critical of the policy of the Commission in not going in when they were given notice by a public representative or by a group of farmers.  I am highly critical of the procedure, the publication of statutory notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and all this paraphernalia.  It gives owners of these lettings an opportunity to dispose of their property or arrange for its disposal before the Land Commission can take the necessary initial proceedings for acquisition.</P>
