      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the suggestions made during the debate on the Estimate for Agriculture that there should be a yearly price review of farm products, and of the fact that he has adumbrated yearly general reviews of the incomes of other sections of the community, he will now give his views on a yearly price review to adjust farmers' incomes also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of years, there have been annual discussions with agricultural organisations on policy questions, including prices, and, of course, there have been discussions on other occasions as well.  It is necessary to remember that these discussions could not take the same form as in such countries as Britain, because of the fundamental fact that we have to sell one-third of our production on export markets where prices cannot be influenced by our decisions.  The Government subscribe to the principle of a reasonable relationship between agricultural and other incomes and they are giving proof of this in the unprecedentedly large sums now being made available for price support, agricultural education, the advisory services, improvement of land and buildings, relief of rates, fertiliser subsidies, disease eradication, etc.  The country's financial resources are, however, not unlimited in the sense that we could afford to guarantee any particular level of prices without reference to the actual prices obtainable in the export market.</P>

During the year ended 31st March, 1963, the number of applications for dentures from eligible persons in the area was 212 and in the period 1st April, 1963 to 30th November, 1963 a further 258 applications were received, making a total of 470 applications in the period 1st April, 1962 to 30th November, 1963.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 3 to 5 together.</P>
      <P>To furnish the information in the form requested would be grossly misleading since the nature of the health services in this State differs from that in the other territories mentioned, in relation to which, of course, the Minister for Health in this State has no responsibilities.  Further, to cite the average expenditure per head of the population on a particular service when the whole population is not entitled to that service would be meaningless.</P>
      <P>I presume that when the Deputy speaks of &ldquo;expenditure by the State&rdquo; he has in mind expenditure from local authority sources as well as expenditure from the Exchequer.  The reply has been prepared on that basis.</P>
      <P>Accounts of expenditure in the present context are not prepared on the basis of calendar years but on the basis of financial years, ending on 31st March.  Figures for the calendar years are not available and consequently the figures I propose to quote are those for the financial years nearest to the calendar years mentioned in the questions.</P>
      <P>The total of expenditure on health services from State and local funds was £20.020 millions in 1960/61, £22.352 millions in 1961/62 and £24.100 millions in 1962/63.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to expenditure on drugs and medicines, when a health authority <Col N="774" /> sends a patient to a voluntary hospital for treatment, it pays the approved capitation rate.  This rate includes an element, but not a specific sum for these commodities.  The accounts of the voluntary hospitals do not distinguish between drugs and medicines supplied to Health Act patients and those supplied to noneligible patients.  Consequently, the figures available for State expenditure on drugs and medicines understate the true position by the amount of the cost of these items supplied to eligible patients in this class of hospital.  The available figures are as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of mothers to whom infants were born and who came under the free of direct charge mother and infant schemes of current health legislation, expressed as a percentage of maternity cases in each of the years 1960, 1961 and 1962.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the maternity and infant care service provided by health authorities under the Health Act, 1953, for persons in the lower and middle income groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year ended 31st December, 1960, the number of women who availed themselves of the service, according to figures supplied to my Department by the health authorities, was 45,224, of whom 40,820 were delivered of babies, alive or still-born. It is not possible to state what proportion this represents of all maternity cases in the country since the number of pregnancies terminating in abortions, miscarriages or still-births outside the scheme is not known.  The total number of live births, including multiple <Col N="775" /> live births, registered in the year, however, was 60,735.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31st December, 1961, the corresponding figures were 45,651, 41,207 and 59,825.</P>
    <P>Information in respect of the year ended 31st December, 1962, has not yet been supplied to my Department by the health authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what is the average overall wage level at which a family of husband, wife and four under-age children are treated free of direct charge under the general medical provisions of the Health Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to supply the information requested, it would be necessary for me to obtain from every health authority a statement of the income of every family which holds a medical card and which consists of a husband, wife and four under-age children.  I do not feel that the trouble and expense of examining every entry in the medical register in order to extract this information would be justified.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, no doubt, appreciate that wage level is only one of the factors taken into account in determining eligibility for general medical services and, consequently, that even if a national average figure were available, it could be very misleading.</P>

The Health Authority discharges this obligation mainly by providing institutional accommodation in parts of St. Kevin's and St. Mary's Hospitals; in Brú Chaoimhin, Cork Street; in Brú Bríde, Crooksling, and in St. Clare's Home, Ballymun.  The Health Authority also provided accommodation at Island Street for people who were temporarily homeless.

As regards the second part, I would point out that the Income Tax Acts provide for deductions in respect of expenses incurred &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties&rdquo; of an office or employment.  If any teacher is dissatisfied with the ruling of the Revenue Commissioners in the matter, it is open to him to have recourse to the ordinary appeal procedure to have his claim for allowance of these expenses determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the need to increase milk output in the coming season by at least 20,000,000 gallons in order to supply export markets for dairy products, and of the further need to improve the quality of the milk, he will indicate whether or not his Department have any plans to assist dairy farmers to increase their herd numbers and to improve milk quality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that the Deputy's reference to export markets is a bit optimistic. In fact there is a world commercial surplus of dairy products and exporting countries have to sell them at a loss which in some instances is very severe.  I am glad that our milk production has been steadily increasing but at the same time it would be quite wrong to imagine that world markets are waiting to buy up all we produce and at an economic price.</P>
      <P>I consider that the recently announced scheme of grants for calved heifers will be a valuable inducement to farmers to increase their herds.  As regards milk quality, considerable attention is being given to this matter by my Department in conjunction with the advisory services and the question whether further measures are desirable is being discussed with farm organisations in the light of the report of the survey team on the dairying industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the fact that butter prices in Britain have improved by 130/- per cwt. since the milk levy was struck in this country, he will announce the removal of the levy forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that there was an improvement in the price of butter in Britain following the import control measures introduced by the British Government.  I regret, however, that the improvement since the levy was struck has been nothing like as much as the figure mentioned by the Deputy.  In fact, during the period to which he refers, the improvement in <Col N="788" /> price has been not much more than half the figure he mentions.</P>
      <P>I believe it is too early to attempt an assessment of the market prospects during 1964, especially as the year 1963 presented some unusual features which we have no assurance will recur next year.  It is also well to remember that the considerable quantity of milk products that had to be sold to countries other than Britain during the past twelve months has to be disposed of at prices which carried a high rate of subsidy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that the idea of a milk levy was propounded in the report of the Advisory Committee on Agricultural Marketing, on which the producers were represented.  I believe that the principle underlying that idea is sound.</P>
      <P>If a marketing board were able to function entirely at the expense of the taxpayers, instead of to the extent of two-thirds, there would be no particular reason for giving careful attention to marketing methods and to the return obtainable in export markets.  It is for such reasons, I think, that the Dáil approved of the levy principle.  As I have said before, of course, the existence of the levy arrangements does not in itself prevent the Government from reviewing prices if the circumstances should warrant it and if the Exchequer could afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in saying the amount is half what I indicated, he has taken the first levy&mdash;not the average?  There were two instalments of levy.  In computing his losses this year, the Minister has taken into account losses on butter put into cold storage in previous years.  His advantageous position now results in a position that, by next March, he will have not more than one thousand tons in cold storage. Therefore, facing all these advantageous facts, the Taoiseach himself should now meet the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, presumably before the Dáil closes for the Christmas recess, with the levy removed and from that point talk about the increase in the price of milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The price realised for butter in May, 1962, was 285/- per cwt.  It was at that point that the levy of one penny was struck by An Bord Bainne.  The price obtaining in the British market at present is 362/6, making a difference as between May, 1962, when the levy was first struck, and the present price of 77/6.  The circumstances to which I referred in my reply may not, of course, arise again in Britain.  I admit the carryover of butter stocks at the end of the year will be very small by comparison with some previous years, but we have a fair idea of what our production will be next year.  There is no alteration, as yet, in our quota with Britain and we can make a fair calculation of the amount of production that may have to be disposed of in markets that are anything but attractive from the point of view of price.  Although the volume of butter and milk products disposed of in the current year has been high because of the factor I have mentioned, having regard to the other conditions, we cannot foresee any great difference in the contribution the Exchequer will have to make towards the sale of surplus agricultural products of the nature of butter and other milk products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the statement that these factors may not arise again is quite erroneous, inasmuch as Britain is now taking steps to rationalise the butter market and ensure a fair price is paid? According to a reply made to me by the Minister not so long ago, this year we can look forward to an increase of 10,000 cwts.  In those circumstances, does the Minister not agree the Taoiseach and himself should meet the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association while the Dáil is in recess, remove the levy, and discuss with that body an increase in price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Rationalisation of the British market has nothing to do with the extent of our quota.  The present year was exceptional because Britain ran short of butter.  I cannot foresee what the position will be next year and, unless we secure an increase in our <Col N="790" /> quota, our estimate is that we will have to export to other countries, apart from other milk products, about 6,000 tons of butter.  If we were to export 5,000 or 6,000 tons of butter to these markets on the same basis and at the same prices as in the current year, I have a pretty fair idea what that exercise would cost us.  I have no evidence to cause me to think otherwise.  As Minister I have to face the facts as they are and not try to conjure up notions as to what they may be.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what factories erected during the last ten years with the aid of State funds were damaged extensively by fire; and if as a result any recoupment was made for the loss; and if any of these factories stopped production as a result of being so damaged.</P>

      <P>There are only two cases of which I am aware.  The factories of the Sligo Spinning Company Limited and Cortex Proofers Ltd were extensively damaged by fire.  In one case the factory was rebuilt by the owners.  In the second case, negotiations are proceeding for the utilisation of the premises for a new industry in the textile field.  No question of recoupment arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the recent announcement by insurance companies of increases in premium rates up to 25 per cent in certain categories of fire and accident insurance, he proposes to institute an enquiry into these increases to satisfy himself that they are justified; and if he will indicate (1) what is the total premium income from (a) fire insurance and (b) accident property insurance for each of the past five <Col N="795" /> years in the Republic of Ireland, and (2) the total insured losses under the same headings for the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no power to control these rates.  The insurance rate for a particular class of risk is determined by underwriting experience.  The returns submitted to me show that substantial underwriting losses have been incurred on fire insurance in this country in recent years.</P>
      <P>Detailed information on the matters mentioned in the second part of the question is obtainable from the annual reports on Assurance Companies published by my Department and presented to the Dáil.  The latest such report&mdash; that relating to the accounts deposited during 1962&mdash;will be published next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the increases refer only to certain types of fire insurance, mainly factories and buildings of that nature. There have been some tremendous losses arising out of damage to factories by fire and storm in recent years. As the Deputy is probably further aware, all the insurance companies contribute to a fund.  I am not in a position yet to be sure what effect the 25 per cent increase will have on the returns of the insurance companies in the years to come.  These matters will be disclosed in the annual returns. However, if there is any suitable action that suggests itself to me, it can be taken then.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together. Normal priorities in the allocation of housing tenancies by Dublin Corporation were suspended with effect from the 14th June, 1963, in favour of persons <Col N="799" /> requiring evacuation from dangerous buildings.</P>
      <P>The number of families rehoused from dangerous buildings between 1st June and 5th December, 1963, was 759, including 87 single-person families.</P>
      <P>At the latter date, 493 families, including 168 single-person families, were awaiting rehousing from dangerous buildings.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say how long the Corporation will be obliged to concentrate on the housing of persons from dangerous buildings, but the complete suspension of the normal priorities has been modified by a recent decision of the Corporation, without prejudice to dangerous buildings cases, to make available five per cent of new dwellings in the Edenmore and Finglas areas to families living in seriously overcrowded conditions.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together, and to circulate with the Official Report the statement showing the total expenditure of local authorities during the past ten years on the provision of fire brigade services.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I announced my intention to undertake a review of fire service organisation and legislation. Considerable progress has been made with this review and particular attention is being given to the aspect of fire prevention.  In the meantime certain specific steps have been taken towards increasing the effectiveness of existing fire prevention measures.  Agreement in principle has been reached with representatives of the Irish Standing Committee of the Fire Offices Committee of Insurance Companies on the setting up of an Irish Fire Protection Association with the object of creating a greater public awareness of fire hazards and precautions, and making generally available the results of latest research in this field.  A series of slides illustrating major fire hazards, prepared in my Department, has been shown by Telefis Éireann and will continue to be publicised from time to time, as well as other warnings on particular occasions. A special report on the prevention and control of forest fires has been printed for general circulation.  The Fire Standards Committee is finalising its report on revised standards of fire precautions in relation to public buildings and institutions.</P>
      <P>Satisfactory progress has been made by fire brigade authorities in improving standards of fire cover in their areas, particularly as regards the organisation of fire brigades, the provision of new fire stations and adequate firefighting equipment.  The authorities have, in general, fully discharged their statutory obligations in regard to fire precautions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general financial structure of the fire services, including the incidence of cost, is being examined as part of the general review of these services.  The question of contributions from insurance companies towards expenditure <Col N="803" /> on the fire services has been considered on a number of occasions but has not been found likely to prove of any net value to the community.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement :</P>
    <P>The total expenditure by local authorities for each year of the past ten years on the provision of fire brigade services was as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that the introduction of up-to-date machinery on road works has created a grave unemployment situation in County Roscommon; that this has deprived small farmers of what hitherto represented a substantial part of their income; and if in the circumstances he will sympathetically consider providing, through the funds available at his disposal, such alternative schemes as will provide those affected with the employment of which they have now been deprived.</P>

      <P>The Road Fund grants to county councils for the present year have been allocated and notified in full and there are no funds at my disposal from which supplementary grants can be made available.  The grants allocated to the Roscommon County Council show an increase of more than £63,500 as compared with 1959-60.</P>
      <P>Grants for the specific purpose of providing employment are dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  I am forwarding representations already made to me by the council in this matter to the Parliamentary Secretary for consideration.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that all over County Roscommon workers and small farmers for the last two months have been in a desperate situation due to the lack of employment of the type which had been made available for years past to them?  While I have no personal objection to the introduction of up-to-date machinery, but rather am in favour of it, may I ask the Minister why it is that, when workers in rural Ireland lose their jobs through the introduction of machinery, no steps are taken by his Department to see that the same treatment is meted out to them as is given to industrial workers in factories who lose their employment as a result of automation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands what steps have been taken by his Department to relieve congestion and increase the acreage of small holdings in (a) the Listowel electoral area and (b) North Kerry in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The official statistics are not compiled by reference to individual districts such as those specified in the question.</P>
      <P>In County Kerry as a whole, however, all practicable measures continue to be taken to relieve congestion, through land acquisition and division, enlargement of uneconomic holdings, elimination of fragmentation and operation of the migration programme.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it would meet the Deputy's requirements to know that in County Kerry, during the last five complete financial years, an aggregate area of about 5,000 acres was taken over by the Land Commission for division while almost 6,400 acres were distributed amongst some 370 allottees, including the enlargement and/or rearrangement of 262 small or fragmented holdings.  During the same period, a total of 29 migrants was transferred to new holdings outside the county while eight similar allottees were resettled within the county.  Expenditure on estate improvements works in County Kerry during the period in question was approximately £125,000.</P>

    <P>60.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands what acreage of land has been acquired by the Land Commission in the Listowel area during the year 1963; and what acreage it is anticipated will be acquired during 1964 under the provisions of the new Land Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in reply to the preceding question, statistics are not compiled by reference to specific districts.  In relation to County Kerry, however, I can say that a total area of 1,900 acres has been acquired by the Land Commission in the current year to date.  In addition, some 2,500 acres are the subject of current inquiries <Col N="807" /> for possible acquisition, while compulsory acquisition proceedings and voluntary purchase negotiations are in train in respect of a further 1,400 acres in the county.</P>
      <P>Any attempt to forecast what acreage will be acquired next year would be very difficult at this juncture as the circumstances affecting acquisition vary with each individual property.  It is hoped, however, that the new powers envisaged under the Land Bill, 1963, will bring about an acceleration in the land acquisition programme generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>61.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether it is his intention to acquire lands offered for sale by local auctioneers, vacant lands, or lands held by elderly people in the Listowel area during 1964; and, if so, what areas of land of this type are at present under consideration for acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my recent speech on the Second Reading of the Land Bill, 1963 &mdash;Vol. 206, No. 2, cols. 65-89&mdash;in the course of which I outlined the relevant proposals for land acquisition, generally, throughout the country.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the Land Commission are now free to pay auctioneers' fees in appropriate cases and they commonly purchase lands offered by auctioneers which are suitable for their statutory purposes.  It is not contemplated, however, that the Land Commission should acquire all lands on offer or should otherwise seek to dominate the land market.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that statistics for the particular area in question are not readily separable, the Deputy will appreciate that many transactions of the type mentioned are conducted on a confidential basis between the Land Commission and the landowners concerned and it is not the practice to publish details in such cases.  In my reply to Question No. 60 I have summarised for the Deputy's information current land acquisition measures for County Kerry as a whole.</P>

      <P>asked the <Col N="808" /> Minister for Lands if his attention has been drawn to a report of an investigation into the buying of land which was carried out by the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> in which it was alleged that Irish land was being bought up at an alarming rate and that the twenty-five per cent.  stamp duty was being rendered ineffective by a succession of legal loopholes; and, if so, whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the newspaper report in question.  Of the three methods of evading the 25 per cent.  stamp duty, as detailed in the newspaper report two have already been rendered ineffective by the Finance Acts, 1961 and 1962. The alleged new method of evasion is being investigated as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I would inform the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners have extensive powers under Section 35 of the Finance Act, 1961, to deal with cases in which arrangements are made for the purposes of avoiding or reducing liability to stamp duty at the 25 per cent rate.</P>

During the course of the examination of the Bill by the Special Committee of the Dáil I introduced an amendment seeking to exclude the Industrial Credit Company from the obligation of including in its directors' report a reference to companies in which it has a holding of more than 20 per cent by way of equity capital investment.  It was suggested to me that this obligation would deter industrialists in this country from seeking equity investment from the Industrial Credit Company. One of the purposes of the section as it stood was to ensure that a position in which take-over bids could be made would not be reached without the shareholders in a company having some knowledge of the position as affecting their own company in regard to shares held in it by another company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as it was drafted inadvertently upset the operations of the Industrial Credit Company in the manner I have just suggested, and this obligation to indicate holdings by the Credit Company in Irish industrial concerns was regarded as unnecessary and undesirable in the circumstances. The manner in which the exclusion of <Col N="817" /> the Credit Company is now achieved will make it possible for any other company whose principal business is the acquisition and underwriting of shares in an undertaking in this country to take advantage of this subsection provided that company holds a certificate of exemption from the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The subsection as it now stands will serve to exclude the Credit Company from this obligation because I propose to issue a certificate to it.  It has been agreed unanimously by the Special Committee of the Seanad and adopted by the Seanad itself.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say if the Industrial Credit Company is the only company excluded in the manner set out in this amendment? While appreciating the reasons which the Minister has given, may I ask is there an obligation on the Industrial Credit Company to give details in its annual report of its investment in particular companies here?  While it might be undesirable to furnish this information on request, at some stage the public interest might require that the actual extent of the Industrial Credit investment would be stated and made available.</P>

      <P>I want to put on record, as I said at the Special Committee, that I entirely disapprove of this amendment.  I have yet to find a single person who practises in company law, be he an accountant, a barrister or a solicitor in this city, who does not regard the amendment as being a most unpleasant precedent which they are afraid will have serious repercussions.  Apart from that, it is entirely wrong that when public moneys are being disbursed by the Industrial Credit Company, we should not get information in this House in relation to their disbursement or that it should not be available to people going to make the appropriate inspections. It seems to me that the effect of this amendment will be that there will be a very much greater atmosphere of hugger-mugger in relation to Industrial Credit Company financing which in the long run will do a great <Col N="818" /> deal of harm to genuine financing by that company.</P>
      <P>I have had the view for some time &mdash;and the Minister knows I have had this view&mdash;that the Industrial Credit Company were wrong in mixing up normal financing with certain other financing they were asked to do by Government direction.  Therefore, I welcomed the division of their previous responsibilities which was made in the Bill which was enacted some time ago.  It was a step in the right direction.  This is a step in the wrong direction and far from assisting the financing of industry will throw an air of suspicion over all financing which in the long run will defeat entirely the aim the Minister has and the aim that I believe the directors of the Industrial Credit Company also had in making these representations to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Before subsection (5) the following subsection inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) (a) A copy of every declaration made and notice given in pursuance of this section shall, within 3 days after the making or giving thereof, be entered in a book kept for this purpose.  Such book shall be open for inspection without charge by any director, secretary, auditor or member of the company at the registered office of the company and shall be produced at every general meeting of the company, and at any meeting of the directors if any director so requests in sufficient time to enable the book to be available at the meeting.</P>
      <P>(b) If a company fails to comply with this subsection the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £100 and if any inspection or production required thereunder is refused, the court may by order compel an immediate inspection or production.&rdquo;</P>

This is the section which enables the complete prohibition of the carrying of firearms, quite apart from their discharge, for limited periods.  It is designed primarily for the protection of game.  The point of view I put to the Minister earlier was that very often a very necessary part of game protection is the destruction of vermin which can sometimes be done only by the use of a shotgun.  While I understand the purpose of the section and appreciate it in the interest of game preservation, in the long run it might prove to have a harmful rather than a beneficial effect.</P>

      <Col N="822" /> I think we could take amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4, with this amendment. As Deputies will see, the object of section 7 is to enable the Garda Síochána to sell firearms that have accumulated in their hands over the years mainly because the owners have not thought it worthwhile to sell or otherwise dispose of them.  The proposal in the amendment is that where the Gardaí have failed in their attempts to sell the weapons and where they are of the opinion that they will not succeed in selling them, they may destroy them.  It is possible that some of these weapons will have no saleable value whatever and the object of the amendment, therefore, is to authorise their destruction where the owners refuse to take them.  It is just to authorise the Gardaí to destroy as well as to sell.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, after paragraph (a), to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the substitution for subsection (4) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>`(4) It shall not be lawful for any registered firearms dealer to return to any person a firearm or ammunition given to the dealer for repair, test or proof unless the person&mdash;</P>

    <P>(a) produces a firearm certificate authorising him to have <Col N="827" /> possession of the firearm or ammunition, or</P>
    <P>(b) proves to the satisfaction of the dealer that he is entitled to have possession of the firearm or ammunition without having a firearm certificate therefor, and' &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a minor amendment of the provisions of the 1925 Act.  The existing provision prohibits a firearms dealer from accepting for repair any firearm unless the person handing it in has a firearms certificate or shows that he is otherwise authorised to have it.  This causes some difficulty in practice because a person brings a firearm along and forgets to bring the certificate.  It is obvious that the requirement will be met if the stipulation were to the effect that the person must have his firearms certificate when the gun is being given back to him. It is the handing out that is important, not the handing in.  That is what is involved here.</P>

      <P>I made it clear on Second Reading that I regard this as quite an undesirable section to get the approval of this House.  This is the section which provides that where the existence or non-existence of a firearms certificate is material to the case being made by the prosecution in court, notwithstanding that fact, the Gardaí are to be relieved of any obligation of giving proof of the existence or non-existence of the certificate.  That is highly undesirable.  It is a feature that is creeping in more and more into our legislation&mdash;this idea of removing from the authorities the obligation to prove the complaint in respect of which they are bringing a defendant into court.</P>
      <P>The ordinary conception of justice in this country heretofore has been that an accused person was regarded as innocent until his guilt was proved.  In this section, and in other sections in comparatively recent legislation, that position has been reversed and under this section, if a person is charged in relation to an offence where the existence or non-existence of a firearms certificate is material, from this on, when the Bill becomes law, he will be regarded as guilty unless he himself proves his innocence.  That is a complete reversal of the ordinary conception of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not regard it as doing quite that.  All we say is that it shall not be necessary to prove it. So far as we read the section, all that means is that the prosecution need not, when opening a case, prove that the person had not got a certificate.  I explained to the House on the Second Stage how and to what ridiculous lengths the Department and the Gardaí can be pushed in order to have to prove that a person did not have a certificate, though the defendant or the accused never claims to have had it.  In my opinion, the words &ldquo;it shall not be necessary to prove&rdquo; cannot mean that non-possession of a certificate ceases to be an ingredient in the offence.  I admit that if the prosecution and the accused say nothing, then it will be taken that the accused did not have a certificate.  I submit that if the accused can raise any sort of doubt at all in the minds of the court that he could have a certificate, then the onus of proof will go back on to the prosecution. It seems to me that all that is involved here is that if the accused does not claim to have a certificate, then it will not be necessary for the Department, off its own bat, as it were, to prove that he did not have one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been long enough in his present position to know that what he says in the Dáil has nothing good, bad or indifferent to do with the decision the courts are asked to arrive at.  The courts will be asked to interpret this section.  They must interpret it as meaning what it says, and what the section says is something entirely different from what the Minister says it means.  There is no question of the section merely saying all that it involves is that the prosecution do not need to tender their proofs on opening their case.  That is not in the section. There is no question in the section of putting forward the position of the accused person, as to whether he claims or does not claim to have had a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, as his second leg, advances the theory in relation to this section that what it means is that the accused person does not claim that he had a certificate and that then it is not <Col N="830" /> necessary to prove it.  That is not in the section.  The Minister went on to say that if the accused person made any claim at all that he had a certificate, that if he cast any doubt on the State's assertion that he had not, then the onus shifts on to the State to prove that he had not a certificate.  That is not in the section.  All that is in the section is that if a person is charged with an offence, in respect of which the existence or non-existence of the certificate is material, under those circumstances the State will not be required to prove either that the certificate existed or did not exist.  I think it is a shocking bad section, particularly in a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>That is not so. He cannot compel the State to do that. If it were a civil action, where an order was made by a judge, that would be a different matter.  In those circumstances it would probably be the Minister who would be defending and I have no doubt that the Minister would plead privilege, or that the document was under the Official Secrets Act.  As far as a prosecution of this sort is concerned, I do not think the defendant has any remedy at all. The only remedy he would have would be to have a certificate in his hand and produce it.  If he lost that he would be sunk as far as this section goes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 3 (1), page 5, line 30 to delete &ldquo;auditor of the Company&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Comptroller and Auditor General&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I understand that at present such is the case and that the accounts are audited by an auditor from the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The effect of the amendment is to ensure that at any stage in the future these accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The point has been raised here on quite a number of occasions that in regard to semi-State and State bodies to which moneys are advanced by the Oireachtas, the measure of control sometimes passes from this House and at that stage, while the moneys are accounted for, anybody who wishes to question them must proceed in the ordinary way to the company for an explanation of how the moneys were spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that the insertion of these words will be a guarantee that the money is being properly invested, that there is a proper use of these funds and a maintenance of the link between the Comptroller and Auditor General auditing these funds, so far as the State is concerned, and the Oireachtas, which is the body which determines what finances are made available to State bodies and which, through the Comptroller and Auditor <Col N="835" /> General, exercises a measure of control.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that this amendment does not in any way take from the freedom of operation which the National Building Agency enjoys and which the House is now prepared to give it, but it will reassure all those who may be anxious to be reassured that the highest controlling officer in the State is actually responsible for the proper control and auditing of moneys advanced by this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say, in support of the Bill as it now stands, that the auditor appointed by the company shall, according to the articles of association of the National Building Agency, be a person appointed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. In fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General has been the person nominated up to this.  That is not to say that there is any compulsion to continue that arrangement.  In fact, I am opposing the amendment on the grounds that we wish to have the freedom, if the situation should arise, to appoint other than the Comptroller and Auditor General to do the accounting for this agency.</P>
      <P>One thing that should be said about the National Building Agency is that it is really a trading company as distinct from, say, Bord Fáilte or other such kindred bodies for which the Comptroller and Auditor General is designated as the auditing officer.  In its trading, it has had and will continue to have dealings with ordinary commercial companies and it is only right that the agency should have at least as much freedom in its operations as the companies with which it will be doing business and on whose behalf it may be asked to erect houses for the companies or for their workers.</P>
      <P>The rather strange thing about all this is that Deputy Jones, no doubt in good faith, has joined in tabling this amendment but he has been rather unfortunate in his choice of seconder in that he has Deputy Byrne who, in 1960, in volume 183, No. 13, at column 1803, had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> The question of the Government's confidence in the accountancy profession arises in relation to this matter, the Minister's confidence in the professional integrity and professional competence of the members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants to which I have the honour to belong.  If the Minister has no confidence in the profession, I would urge him to say so frankly and give us an opportunity of putting our house in order.  If, on the other hand, he has confidence&mdash;and I believe he has&mdash;I would urge him to consider my pleading sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I do believe the Comptroller and Auditor General is properly equipped to carry out the audits of commercial companies.  I want to emphasise that I do not wish at all to cast aspersions on his Department &mdash;quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Byrne in a related sphere where the question of the Comptroller and Auditor General comes up.  I have other excellent quotations in the same vein from Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon. It is not often I agree with those gentlemen in their outlook on many things but in this case they seem to have long since agreed with what I am proposing to the House, that is, that we do not go on with this amendment making it obligatory to have the Comptroller and Auditor General appointed to do the accounting of this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to agree that the fact that a certain person is joined in this amendment does not invalidate the fact that the amendment is desirable.  One of the things that have been apparent from time to time is that money provided by the State for semi-State companies has gone outside the control of the House. While this may happen on this occasion. I propose that the Comptroller and Auditor General examine the accounts of this company.  In doing that, I am not casting any aspersions on the accountancy profession outside or on those whom the Comptroller and Auditor General may appoint to examine accounts on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> The purpose of having the accounts examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General is to ensure that moneys provided by Oireachtas Éireann for any service of the State will be used in the manner for which they were voted.  In that connection, there was another amendment, which has been ruled out of order, to the effect that the Committee of Public Accounts should have the opportunity of examining these accounts and the report of the Auditor General thereon. That amendment has been ruled out but the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General would be auditing the accounts would be an indication that the money would be used for the purpose for which it was voted.</P>
    <P>Up to this the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, has appointed the Comptroller and Auditor General to look after the affairs of the company and to ensure that the money voted to it will be used for the purpose for which it is voted. It is a fact that we have set up companies from time to time to carry out certain works which are desirable in themselves and that we have voted a certain amount of money for the working of these companies but the measure of control exercised over that money by this House has been going from the House.  Even in some cases where the Comptroller and Auditor General has been appointed to look after the accounts of these companies, they are not asked to account to him in certain respects.  They account to him in their own fashion.</P>
    <P>It does not invalidate the amendment that the person who has signed his name to it has argued in another way at another time.  That is going from the general to the particular and to do that is not a good defence in cases such as this.  I would prefer the Minister to deal with the amendment on its merits.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Jones is under some illusion that the control exercisable by the Comptroller and Auditor General would be more effective control.  Later on, it emerges that, in fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General does not control to any greater <Col N="838" /> degree the functions of the company to which he is assigned as auditor than the ordinary auditor appointed in the normal way outside.  It should be kept in mind that the Minister retains the right, whether the Comptroller and Auditor General or any other auditor is appointed, to say who is to be appointed and that control cannot be taken from the Minister by any action of the company or its directors.  The company may not dispense with this control of the Minister which will always remain.</P>
      <P>Up to the present, we have been using the Comptroller and Auditor General because of the fact that when the company started, there was very little in it.  It was a backroom operation and it is still relatively small.  For that reason, it was convenient to appoint him and it may still be convenient to do that but I can foresee the time when the company will no longer be so small and when it will no longer be convenient to appoint the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I hope that it may grow into a sizeable institution and may reach the point where it will no longer be convenient for the Comptroller and Auditor General to look after it.  He might find that he would not have the staff or the time to be doing this company's business as we might like to prescribe in this amendment that he should.</P>
      <P>I say that it is better that this trading company, this commercial company, whose business will take it into close contact with other commercial companies, should be entitled to the same freedom as that enjoyed by those with whom it will be dealing, to the same freedom as CIE, the ESB, the Irish Sugar Company, Ceimicí Teoranta and the air companies.  There is no reason to believe, from our experience of those very large concerns, that the fact that their accounts need not be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General means that they have been doing anything wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason to suggest, I think, from past experience or any prophecy of what may happen in the future that by not obliging the company <Col N="839" /> to have its business audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it may go off the rails.  It is subject to as much control and will be subject to as much control by the appointment of any accountant as it will be even as it is now being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. However, we do not want to tie it to the Comptroller and Auditor General, for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <P>From past experience of those rather larger operators I have mentioned, plus the fact that in the last analysis, the Minister will still control the appointment of an auditor to the company's business and, in turn, will be answerable in his own way, in the ordinary course of business, in this House, the position should be satisfactory to those who have any doubts about the matter.  Unless they are matters which, by their disclosure, would be other than in the interests of the company and its operations&mdash;that is, the National Building Agency&mdash;I shall, as Minister, at all times hold myself quite free to give to the House any and all information which Deputies may request.</P>

      <P>This amendment reopens the whole question of the total abolition of capital punishment as opposed to its retention for special categories of <Col N="841" /> crimes.  These categories are set out in the Bill.  I can only repeat to a large extent what I said on this matter on Second Stage.  For ordinary murders, the only case for retaining capital punishment is that it provides a deterrent. The Government are of opinion that the deterrent effect of capital punishment is not sufficient to warrant its retention.  We feel, however, that this is not valid in respect of certain exceptional crimes which are set out in the first section.  In regard to these crimes, the Government consider that the public interest requires that the death penalty be retained.</P>
      <P>For instance, imprisonment is no deterrent in the case of treason or political murder, or Offences against the State Act cases.  Neither is the type of criminal likely to be involved in the murder of a policeman or a prison officer, acting in the course of his duty, likely to be deterred by imprisonment.  There is also the fact, as has been mentioned by some Deputies, that our police force is unarmed.  There could be circumstances in which an organisation might embark on a deliberate policy involving the murder of members of the Garda Síochána.  As I mentioned on the Second Stage, the Bill involves the retention of the death penalty in a very limited number of cases.  For all practical purposes, we are, in fact, abolishing the death penalty and some of the cases in relation to which we propose to retain it are to a large extent theoretical.  We have never had in this country the murder of a Garda in the course of his duty, otherwise than in the course of a political crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputies who argue that logic demands that we abolish the death penalty completely.  I sympathise with those who are worried that there may be some anomalies by retaining the death penalty for certain crimes.  Such a difficulty appears to have loomed up in a very real way in Great Britain, but I think the category in relation to which we propose to retain the penalty is such a limited one&mdash;to some extent, as I have said, an academic one&mdash;that there is really no danger whatever that <Col N="842" /> we will get into this difficult situation by having exclusions from the general policy of abolition.</P>
    <P>I should like to persuade the House to see this matter from my point of view.  This whole question is one in relation to which society's approach has evolved and we are now at the stage at which we can, in that process of evolution, abolish the death penalty for all practical purposes, but I must have regard to the fundamental security of the State and at this stage I think I am justified in asking the House to make this very limited exception.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne raised the question of the rehabilitation of prisoners; he wondered if we had the right approach with regard to the treatment of prisoners.  He must not have adverted to a number of speeches and announcements I made on this matter in the past year or so.  I have clearly indicated that crime and punishment in their reciprocal relationship with each other involve a process whereby a person proceeds from a state of innocence to guilt and punishment, and back again to a state of freedom from guilt and responsibility for guilt.  The primary purpose of all imprisonment should be rehabilitation.  Acting on that directive principle, we have in our prisons, over the past year or so, embarked on a very definite programme of penal reform and adopted a number of measures designed to ensure that prison in the main constitutes a place of rehabilitation. The decision of the Government to retain the death penalty for this strictly limited number of offences was come to reluctantly.  The offences are, in our judgment, those for which, unfortunately, in our time and circumstances, and in our situation, it is only prudent to retain the death penalty, bearing in mind our overall responsibility for the security of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister has just said, I should like to support this amendment.  In this section there is posed the dilemma which faces any Minister seeking to abolish the death penalty without bringing to that abolition the full logic of the situation.  Capital punishment is <Col N="843" /> something about which one cannot blow hot and cold at the same time; we either decide to abolish the penalty or we decide to retain it.  This House has taken a decision on the principle that the death penalty should be abolished in relation to the vast majority of murders.</P>
      <P>In this section we are discussing a proposal by the Minister which has no logical argument to support it.  In effect, the Minister proposes to create a new offence known as &ldquo;capital murder&rdquo; and, in doing so, he appears to be largely following a compromise sought to be made by the British Government when dealing with this same problem.  In effect, the House is asked to legislate, contrary to reason, that the killing of a prison officer or of a member of the Garda Síochána in the course of his duty is to be regarded as a more heinous offence than the strangling of a young girl, the killing of a defenceless infant, or the brutal murder of some poor old man or woman.  We can legislate in that way, if we wish, but we are not legislating logically.  We are not doing it in accordance with our views in this matter.</P>
      <P>The killing of anyone is an offence against the law of nature.  I do not think it is possible for anyone to argue, if one assumes murder, that the character of the victim makes the actual killing more serious in one case than another.  I suppose the Minister, if he were driven to it, would argue for the section as it stands on the ground of expediency.  He might say it is expedient in the interests of the State that certain categories of people should be protected in a more definite way than ordinary private citizens.  The Minister has not put forward that argument.  I do not know whether he would use it, but, even if he did, I should not think it would be sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, the killing of a member of the Garda, if it is to be regarded as justifying a penalty which means the taking of the life of the killer, can only be put in a special category if there is something more behind it than merely the killing of the particular unfortunate man.  I suppose what could be behind it would be an <Col N="844" /> organised intention or effort to kill and destroy the unarmed Garda force.  If that situation should exist or if the possibility of such a situation existing dictates a course of action on the Minister and on the House to provide that the killing of an individual Garda officer should be regarded as capital murder, then it seems to me to be a <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i>  If there is a political motive behind the killing of an individual officer, then it does not appear to me that the quality or nature of the punishment will be any deterrent. If in fact there is a concerted effort to kill all the members of the Garda force, that is a political conspiracy, and we in this House and in this country surely know that, where there exists a political conspiracy of that kind, sanctions cease to count. You are not going to preserve the life of any Garda officer by laying down that the law shall be that if anyone kills that man, he will be guilty of capital punishment.</P>
    <P>In my view, that is illogical.  If there is a particular reason for creating a special offence of capital murder, let it be on the ground of national expediency. It cannot be defended on any other ground.  If it is to be on that ground, why should we provide that a member of the Government&mdash;indeed the Minister for Justice himself&mdash;may be shot down, and that is not capital murder?  Indeed, the President of this country may be shot down, and that is not capital murder.  Where are we going?</P>

      <P>If there is an element of national interest involved in a matter of this kind, in my view, that is the only basis on which a distinction can be logically discussed.  We must have regard to the fact that, in relation to the enforcement of law and order and the maintenance of proper principles in the country, a stage may be reached when a group of people may decide that the easiest way of achieving their aims is to shoot down members of the Government.  Nevertheless, we provide here that that kind of killing shall not rank as capital punishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Leave out of consideration for the moment any question of an organisation.  Suppose that is not possible to establish.  But you have an individual, a madman or a fanatic, a person with a fixed idea, who decides that the easiest way to achieve his purpose is to shoot down the Minister for Justice instead of bothering about some inoffensive Garda officer.  If the Minister for Justice were shot down in the course of his duty, if there is any logic for the creation of this kind of offence, why should that not be regarded as capital punishment?  I mention that because it appears to me in relation to a charge of this kind that once you start temporising, trying to say we will go thus far but no further, when we say we are going to abolish capital punishment but we do not mean this and we do not mean that&mdash;once you start doing that, you end up in an absurd situation.</P>
      <P>I feel that is what is happening in relation to this Bill.  It was advertised, if you like, by the Minister initially as being a Bill to abolish capital punishment. I felt, when I learned that this was the Minister's intention, at least it was a clear view on this very difficult subject and someone was proposing to do something about it.  But when the mountain went into labour, if you like, we produced this very pale compromise that was already tried out in England &mdash;an effort to distinguish between unprotected citizens and the individual forces of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand it.  If Section 1 defined capital murder as being murder carried out in pursuance of an unlawful political conspiracy aimed at the interests of the State, then there would be some logic in it.  But that does not <Col N="846" /> happen.  If the section is to mean anything, apparently the murder of a member of the Garda by a private citizen is to be capital murder, if that officer is killed in the course of his duty. There may be no political significance or motive in it.  It may be just the result of a private grudge by the killer against the Garda force in general actually visited on some individual members of it.  That is to be subject to capital punishment.  If you do find that kind of killing, in my view, no deterrent would prevent it, because it is the action of some fanatic or some person who is not going to be put off by whatever deterrent may be there.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to have in subparagraph (iii) of subsection (1) (b) a provision for a murder done in the course of furthering the activities of an unlawful organisation.  I cannot understand why it is necessary to go further than that.  If there is any logical defence for this section, surely it must be put on the basis that this State&mdash;I do not agree with it; I think we have progressed a great deal&mdash;cannot afford to allow an unlawful political conspiracy to exist which manifests itself in the murder of Garda officers or prison officers or Presidents or members of the Government or such persons; and if there is a killing done in pursuance of the activities of an unlawful organisation, that should be capital murder.  At least, that would be a logical provision.  I can see no logic in providing for that group of killings as being one of a group of murders that are to be capital murders.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment tabled here to provide, in effect, that no person shall be liable to suffer death for any offence.  We surely should have reached that stage in this country and in our western civilisation.  If we did that in our legislation, we would not find the number of killings in any way increased because our modern experience shows that it is very rarely indeed that there is a cold, calculated, premeditated murder.  Most killings are the result of passion, greed, avarice or temper suddenly arising and dictating a moment's action and often leading to a lifetime of subsequent regret.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of murderers are <Col N="847" /> not affected in the slightest by the law's sanction.  I do not think deterrent enters seriously into a murderer's mind.  It may in some cases.  Certainly, if it does, I can imagine that to many people indeed life imprisonment seriously enforced could be a far greater deterrent than death itself.</P>
    <P>But, the object of this amendment being to abolish capital punishment, I support it.  It can, at least, reasonably be said that in relation to the abolition of capital punishment, there is a logical view.  The logic of it can be countered by those who hold the view that if there is, in fact, a cold, calculated, premeditated killing of any person, the punishment for the killer in every case should be the same.  That is an argument in logic that I could see.  It would be a reasonable point of view. But I cannot understand any proposal which says that we will abolish capital punishment for all killings except in the case of named categories of victims.  When that kind of compromise is suggested, reason disappears from our legislation.  I therefore support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say that I still cannot understand the position the Minister is taking up in regard to this question and I do not understand why it is that he should make these exceptional divisions in regard to the categories coming under what he calls capital murders in the Bill.  It seems that he must accept that either hanging is a deterrent or it is not a deterrent and, if it is a deterrent, then a case can be made for retaining it for all forms of murder.  I would not agree with it but the case could be made with a certain amount of conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister retains capital punishment in respect of these exceptional cases here, then it seems to me that, in logic, he must accept the argument put forward by Deputy Dillon that, in fact, we are allowed to look for vengeance in certain circumstances, that if a diplomat or a member of the Garda or a prison officer or a Minister &mdash;under the Offences against the State Act&mdash;is murdered, then we have a <Col N="848" /> right to kill the person who committed the murder and that the only justification for not doing so could be the old one, that it does not work in that case. The only argument that could be put forward is the argument that you must not kill these particular exceptional categories in our society because, as far as we are concerned, they happen to be particularly precious members of our society.  That is so illogical that I cannot understand a clearly intelligent person such as the Minister trying to incorporate it in legislation which must stand to his name in the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Another point is that if the Minister does take this view that you are going to tell people that you will hang them if they carry out crimes against the categories of persons mentioned here, then in reply to his suggestion that the House is reasonably evenly divided on &mdash;ideologies is too strong a term&mdash;the general approach to progressive legislation and conservative legislation in so far as on one side of the House the Government Party represent the progressive approach and the Opposition represented by Fine Gael represent the reactionary approach to the problem of this kind, I would say that, quite clearly, speeches have been made from the Opposition benches which are in advance of the Minister's own position and consequently it would not be fair to try to divide the House on this issue into the progressive attitude of mind on the Government side and the conservative attitude of mind on the Fine Gael benches.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, if the Minister is logical in his mind, he must accept his position with Deputy Dillon who feels that under certain circumstances you are allowed to kill people and you are allowed to do it for the purpose of revenge, because I do not see that there can be any other logical analysis of the Minister's position.  Otherwise, I think he has to say to us: &ldquo;We think in respect of these special circumstances this acts as a deterrent and we are going to try to protect these people by insisting that hanging shall remain in order to protect these people because we think they are rather special.&rdquo;  If he accepts that it is a deterrent in respect of these people, I think he has <Col N="849" /> to explain why it is that in respect of the ordinary man in the street, the ordinary individual, the ordinary woman or child, the case mentioned by Deputy T. F. O'Higgins, brutal murders of old people, he is not going to establish in his legislation a deterrent which will protect their lives because, obviously, they have as much right under the Constitution to the protection of the State as have the categories exceptionally mentioned in this Bill.</P>
    <P>So that, as in British law, the Minister is already being faced with the consequences of his own very weak position on this question.  It is certainly illogical, unreasonable behaviour.  I think he is bound to accept that.  He said&mdash;as a matter of fact, we all concede this-that the question is academic, whether this question of hanging will arise, whether any cases will be necessary in the years ahead. Of course, anything can happen but in regard to the Garda and prison officers and diplomats, there has been no precedent and consequently there is reason to assume that there will be no such murders in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In offences against the State Act type of cases, I should have thought the Minister would have been the first to say we have reached a wonderful position of peace in Ireland compared with the dreadfully upset time of the 1922s and other years and the early 1940s and that now, as a result of the general maturity of the nation in one way or another, we have got to the stage that we have such peace that, in justice to the North, we can tacitly ignore the present illegal organisation type of danger and that he could equally take that step in relation to this section.  He could say that, because we have got to a stage where Parliament is properly accepted and where a fair hearing will be given, such a provision is not necessary.  As Deputy John A. Costello said one time, the gun has been taken out of politics.</P>
    <P>I do not see that the Minister can seriously justify the retention of this section, even if he thought it a deterrent, because the state of the country is such in regard to this problem that the likelihood of a recurrence of the <Col N="850" /> previous situation is negligible.  Furthermore, if these people want to take action of this kind, there are plenty of distinguished precedents for it despite the existence of this alleged deterrent in the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that in regard to penal laws, the aim is the rehabilitation of the person who has committed an offence.  Again, I would like to remind him that the general principle which he accepts in regard to the rehabilitation of the ordinary criminal who steals, robs, and so on, applies, too, to the person who murders.  One must accept that the murderer is not an exceptional person in that way.  He is exceptional in the fact that he is unfortunate enough to have a diseased mind but he is not exceptional in relation to the possibility of being reclaimed.  If he is reclaimable, it should be the purpose of our social machinery to reclaim him but if he is not reclaimable, then he must remain for the rest of his life in jail.  I cannot see any justification at all for killing the person.  The ultimate justice, the ultimate moral judgment, is on a much higher level than involves any of us at all.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the support which Deputy MacEoin gave to this Bill and his own unique contribution to it in regard to his own rather dreadful experience and his attitude during that experience, obviously the attitude of a very courageous person with the wonderful mind he had that he could approach the possibility of being killed so philosophically.  At the same time, I do not think it is a substantial argument or that he would seriously believe it is a substantial argument in regard to ordinary people going through the agony of waiting to be executed.  There is the complete difference where Deputy MacEoin was concerned that he was dying for a great ideal and for a very honourable purpose and was not like the unfortunate wretch who has killed somebody for some sordid objective.</P>
    <P>It is quite commonly said that it is more horrible to keep somebody in jail for the rest of his life, but that does not follow.  In fact the Minister's figures show it does not follow.  At a certain stage the Minister is advised, presumably, <Col N="851" /> by responsible medical authorities and the people looking after the prisoner, that it is perfectly safe to liberate this person, that the element of vengeance is no longer there, that the deterrent purpose was never there anyway and that, therefore, he can be liberated after a relatively short time. This does not mean that murderers must be liberated.  It can only be done if it can reasonably be assumed that it is safe to let the person out among the public and that he is unlikely to do any serious harm.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister seriously consider on this amendment, in respect of which we are all quite clearly divided but without any Party line division, letting us see the extent to which he is supported in his attitude, the extent to which Fianna Fáil Deputies are behind him?  Maybe he is right in saying that the public are not ready for this type of provision yet.  I think they are but possibly that is special pleading.  If he left it to a free vote, would he get the support of all his members over there or would we get some of that support, just as he might get some support from the opposite benches? Would the Minister take the opportunity of allowing the members of his Party to speak their minds freely and to vote freely on this very important amendment?</P>

The Minister will agree that, particularly having regard to the amendments which have been moved, the issue now is a clear-cut one which it is proper to leave to individual Deputies to decide for themselves, guided by their own convictions, their own consciences. Both the Fine Gael Party and, subsequently, the Labour Party have taken the decision that this is a question which should be left to the free vote of Deputies.  Clearly, unless the Minister is going to be big enough to take the same decision, there is no point in doing more than discuss it, because of the fact that the Minister would have a tied Party vote behind him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> I want to make this appeal to the Minister, even though it may be a last minute one: to take off the Whips and let the House decide, as they should decide in this issue, having regard to their own personal and individual convictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I disagree fundamentally with Deputy O'Higgins.  It seems to me that this is one aspect of the Bill where I am, more than on any other, completely justified in exercising, as it were, ministerial power to try to persuade the House to adopt a certain line of action. There is some argument for saying that every Deputy should have a free, individual choice on the principle of the Bill, on the principle of whether we should consider abolishing capital punishment altogether but the reason I am in favour of excepting these categories from the general abolition is that the safety, welfare and security of the State are directly involved.</P>

      <P>Let us go down through the categories as they are here. First of all, there is treason.  We are proposing to retain the penalty of capital punishment for the offence of treason.  Treason consists essentially in levying war against the State.  People who would do that would be people who would go out and be prepared to kill to achieve their objectives.  They would be prepared to kill our policemen, our soldiers or our civilians. Surely where people set out with such a predetermination to kill, we are entitled to say: &ldquo;Very well, if you embark on this course of action you must accept the situation that the penalty for it will be the greatest possible penalty the State can inflict on you&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputies must be prepared to make a distinction&mdash;that in these cases the existence of the death penalty would act as a deterrent.  In most of <Col N="853" /> the cases we are dealing with in this section, there is a very definite element of predetermination, and because people have predetermined to take a certain course of action, then the result of that course of action, if they take it, must be a factor that would weigh with them.  In the case of the person who would commit an ordinary murder, I think the deterrent factor is usually negligible, but a person who would set out to commit treason or embark on violence in furtherance of the aims of an illegal organisation, or the professional criminal who would consider the consequences of murdering a policeman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they certainly could not be regarded as having committed a capital murder.  I want to plead with Deputies for an understanding of my position.  My personal inclination is to abolish the death penalty completely because for me it has all the repugnant connotations it has for most of the other Deputies who have spoken.  I would hope this is only an intermediate step and that at some other time some other Minister for Justice will come along and maybe, reviewing the situation, will eliminate the death penalty for all or most of these categories, but at this stage I must say I am satisfied and the Government are satisfied that we must live up to our responsibilities with regard to the security and preservation of the State and that, as prudent people, we must insist at the moment on these provisions.</P>

      <P>The Minister has painted the picture of the professional criminal who knows what he is doing and says that in his case the death penalty may be a deterrent. Suppose he kills a policeman who is carrying out his duty without knowing he is a police officer&mdash;supposing it is a plain-clothes detective&mdash;does not the reasoning then fall to the ground completely?</P>

      <P>Not necessarily.  We are talking only about the deterrent effect, as to whether or not the retention of capital punishment will act as a deterrent, and I must say to the professional criminal it will certainly be a factor that will weigh with him when he sets out on a course of conduct. For that reason, I think in all of the cases mentioned here the retention of the death penalty will, to some extent, act as a deterrent.  If that is so we must in all prudence retain it at this stage.  I want to point out again to Deputies that we are, in fact, 99.9 per cent abolishing the death penalty. We are arguing here about the retention of the penalty for offences which will not take place, and if there is any deterrent in its retention we are entitled to retain it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, in the course of the few seconds left to me to <Col N="857" /> speak on this motion, I referred to the Minister's statement on that occasion in regard specifically to inquiries which he said he had instituted concerning the allegations of undue increases in the prices of drink in the Dublin area. In his remarks, the Minister said as reported at column 563 of Volume 206 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>To refer in more detail to the Fair Trade Commission's activities, through their authorised officers, this general survey was carried out in certain places.  In Dublin, for example, there was one particular complaint about the price of intoxicating liquor.  It was suggested that the trade organisation catering for licensed premises had issued a list of recommended prices. Authorised officers visited a number of licensed premises in and around Dublin.  In some cases, traders had adhered to the recommended prices for a while and then brought them down, while some traders had never adopted the recommended prices.</P>
      <P>After some interruptions, the Minister, referring to the activities of the authorised officers, said:</P>
      <P>They told me that prices had been reduced to a level consistent with the 2½ per cent increase.  It has happened to my own knowledge in parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried to draw attention to the fact that if we are to accept this statement of the Minister as an indication of the standard of examination which these authorised officers or other officials apply when investigating complaints of profiteering arising out of the turnover tax, it is a very poor standard and the Minister has been grossly misinformed in the matter.  It is not to be expected that the Minister would personally investigate these complaints but members of his Party, the Labour Party and of other Parties who travel in Dublin city and county are well aware that these recommended prices, a list of which was sent out by the association concerned, were adopted by 99.9 per cent of the licensed trade in Dublin city and county and these recommended price increases bear no relation whatever to the turnover tax. <Col N="858" /> In fact, the increases which have been imposed on the people are a multiplication of the turnover tax.  It seems to me that the apparatus available to the Minister for the determination of complaints such as this must be very defective when he can be persuaded, as he obviously has been, that there is no ground for serious complaint.</P>
    <P>There has been profiteering, gross profiteering, at the expense of the ordinary people of the city, principally those who drink the wine of the country, the ordinary pint of stout, and the excuse being made by the trade organisation concerned is that it is in anticipation of wage increases for the staff, in spite of the fact that any cursory look at the profits accruing nowadays in this trade will prove that without any further imposition on the public in the shape of increased drink prices, those who engage in that trade could very well afford substantial increases for their staffs.</P>
    <P>This is where we take issue with the Minister.  He said in his preliminary remarks, in reply to Labour speakers on this motion, that he saw no difficulty in accepting the terms of the motion but that seems to me a very empty observation if it is not backed up by vigorous action on the part of the Department to secure that there will not be, and should not be, profiteering as a result of the turnover tax.  I suggest that profiteering, apart from the drink trade which, I suppose, is to some extent a secondary consideration, has occurred and is occurring where essentials of life are concerned, such as food and medicine. To my knowledge, old people of very limited means, old age pensioners, especially those living on non-contributory pensions without any other income whatever, except, perhaps, a few shillings from the assistance authorities, people with a total income of, say, £2 per week, have been the greatest sufferers.</P>
    <P>In many cases, such people are forced by circumstances, as I suppose half our working population are, to run weekly accounts with grocers and while it has been correctly said that there are many thousands of decent people who would not take advantage <Col N="859" /> of people in that category, we must realise that there are also many people who would take advantage of any situation to get themselves a few shillings no matter whom they were robbing.  This House has a special obligation to safeguard, so far as it can, the old people, the social welfare groups particularly and the old age pensioners who have nothing except the contributory old age pension and many of whom live a lonesome and dreary life near the borderline of starvation.</P>
    <P>These people, as I say, are peculiarly open to exploitation and my information is that they have been, and are being, in certain instances exploited. They are the last people who can complain because they are the most terrorised section of the population, the people who have little or no hope of improvement except the shameful annual halfcrown which we in our munificence and our magnanimity give them&mdash;the halfcrown of which we should be ashamed.  That is the only thing they have but what little they have they are afraid of losing. They do not like to complain.  They are people who are of a conservative nature; they have worked hard all their lives and are trying to live out their last years respectably.  How, in the name of God, are they doing that and facing at the same time exploitation and profiteering which undoubtedly are going on, not in the case of every shopkeeper, but certainly in the case of a large number of them?</P>
    <P>We take issue, too, with the Minister in his general approach to the question of prices.  He says, the Minister for Finance says, and the Government have said that the determinant of price levels must be competition and that competition will resolve everything, the forces of competition will produce a situation wherein prices will be kept at a reasonable level and wherein exploitation will be wiped out.  Of course, that argument rings strangely in my ears with the argument advanced by the Leader of the main Opposition Party who is as Victorian as they come.  It was as if we were not living in an age where practically every aspect of our lives <Col N="860" /> is organised.  It is based upon the idea that every person operating in trade and commerce is an independent agent, that he can determine prices and cut his cloth according to his own measure.  That is not so.  In these modern times, practically every trade is organised.  These organisations and trade groupings, wholesale and retail, might determine prices, impose these prices upon one another and eventually upon the public.  These are much more what might be called little cartels&mdash;a contradiction in terms.  How then can competition determine price levels? How can it equitably determine price levels in such a situation?  That argument of competition falls to the ground.  The price of practically every item sold to the public is predetermined by the conspiracies, if you call them that, of the various interested groups who want to see the last possible halfpenny wrung from the pockets of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>An odd thing has come out of this morass which the turnover tax has created.  It relates to a semi-State body, the ESB.  The ESB, it is said, does not propose to pass on the turnover tax. They would be able to handle it within their existing income.  Does that not suggest a peculiar situation?  Does it not suggest that the ESB must have been profiteering for quite a while if it can do without having to pass on the tax?  I always thought, having listened to the Government, that the policies laid down for semi-State bodies were so fashioned as to ensure that the cost passed on to the public would be a minimum cost and that there would be no element whatsoever of profiteering. Of course, we have all known and the people have known for a long time that the ESB was selling current at a figure which was beggaring many people. That is true to-day and here is proof of it.  The ESB say: &ldquo;This turnover tax is no trouble to us; we do not have to pass it on to the consumer; we can deal with it out of what we are getting at the present time&rdquo;.  That suggests to me that the ESB would bear close scrutiny as to the profits it is making and it shows up the fact that it should have been scrutinised long before now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> I should also like to mention the fact that when the Minister says that competition will secure equity in prices, he is making a claim to the profiteers and telling them in effect they can come together&mdash;although he did use some strong words last week in his speech which they can read&mdash;and he is giving them <i>carte blanche</i> to get themselves together.  I suppose no matter how highly geared and controlled machinery you have, if the people whom you are trying to bring into conformity with the law, if the profiteers combine against you, it will be very hard to get a satisfactory result. It will be very hard to get a situation where you can impose justice upon such people.  Nevertheless, our duty is there to do that.</P>
    <P>What about the position of the vast mass of rural workers through the length and breadth of the country who are dependent on wages for their existence? What about the farm labourers, an ever-diminishing social group who will shortly be no more than a memory due to the fact that they are so badly treated and have been so badly treated since Michael Davitt's fight for the land for the people?  One wonders how the county council workers, the national average of whose wages is not much more than £6 a week, can possibly cope with any increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested, and undoubtedly will be, that people living in rural areas have advantages in the matter of obtaining vegetables and agricultural produce which are not available to workers living in the cities and towns.  That, to my mind, is largely a fallacy.  I have had a lot of experience in organising such workers and in fact the benefits, which accrued to them as a result of what they may get from the farm and what they may get cheaply by buying from a neighbouring farmer, are very slight.</P>
    <P>A number of them have written to me from various counties since the turnover tax came into operation asking what is to be done for them.  There is some measure of hope, I suppose, for industrial workers in Dublin city <Col N="862" /> particularly, who are under the protection of well organised unions.  They will get compensation which may not entirely be a help in the matter of the increased cost of living resulting from the turnover tax, but what of this vast mass who are not organised in any trade union and who are at the very lowest possible level in the matter of wages?  These are most important people, people we should aim at keeping on the land.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, by the neglect and the contempt which has been offered to them down the years, the land is being denuded of them.  Here we have another example of encouraging the flight from the land and encouraging people to make the long trek to the Holyhead and Liverpool boats.  Price control could be of some assistance, but, as has been indicated, the Minister is not well served in this matter by the agents he sends out to look at these things if we are to take the case of the Dublin public as an example. They are not as observant as they should be, or it may be a case that there are none so blind as those who do not wish to see.</P>
    <P>I remember reading in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 17th October a report of a meeting of a group of traders in Drumshambo and it was said that they had agreed on the following increased prices to be paid after the turnover tax was introduced: 1d on the lb of sugar, 2d on the lb of butter, 1d on the oz of tobacco, 1d on the pint, 2d on all spirits per glass, 4d on brandy per glass.  The average of these increases represents an increase of six per cent.  I should like to know if the Minister has taken note of that meeting or has had the matter investigated or what has happened in that area.  It is an example which came to light and one which was followed in many districts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I suppose traders could argue that because of the trouble caused to them by this tax, because they have been made collectors of the tax, they are entitled to some percentage for the servicing of this tax.  They might argue that instead of charging 2½ per cent they should charge something like 2¾ <Col N="863" /> per cent, but there is no justification whatever for an increase of six per cent in prices.  As we all know, when the Statistics Office, or whatever body determines these matters, eventually does determine the actual all round increase in the cost of living which has resulted from this tax, it will be found to stand at anything from 10 per cent to 12 per cent.  I should like to know what really effective action the Minister proposes to take in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have put down this motion in order to voice the feelings of the vast bulk of the people on this question of prices.  You do not get housewives parading this city, as they have been doing for weeks, just to kill time or just for fun.  There is definitely grave disquiet over these prices and the fact that the Government are conscious of this disquiet is proved by the coyness with which they regard by-elections and the anxiety they have displayed to avoid by-elections at all costs and to live on in the hope that the day will come when this iniquity like many of the other iniquities will have been forgotten.  That is a mistaken hope because it is probably the last fatal act on the part of the Government. Because of the imposition of this tax the people will express their voice very forcibly when they get the opportunity&mdash;be it in the next three months, or 12 months, or in two years' time&mdash;and when the Government Party comes back it will be in a very attenuated form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of the discussion on this motion appears to me to have been wide of the mark in so far as responsibility for the recent rise in prices is concerned.  With a few limited exceptions, some of which have already been mentioned, such as coal and the raw material used in the manufacture of soap, the recent rise in prices has been due to the turnover tax which was introduced by the Government and which has had a most dramatic effect on prices and will ultimately have far reaching consequences on the nation's economy.  This rise in prices was Government inspired and Government initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> In the course of the discussion on this motion last week the Minister for Industry and Commerce quoted some remarks I made in the debate on the Prices Bill in 1958.  I accept fully the import of those remarks made then and as being true generally in the circumstances and conditions in which price control and price levels operate. In the main in the past price increases were due to factors outside the control of whatever Government were in office, with certain exceptions.  In the main, price rises were due to increases in the imported costs of either the finished commodity or the raw materials which were subsequently manufactured or assembled into goods or commodities sold.</P>
    <P>For instance, the most recent case of price rises was because of the effect on prices&mdash;particularly on oil and fuel and a variety of other imported commodities&mdash;of the Suez crisis.  It will be recollected that at that time, in 1956, the cost of fuel not only in this country but in other European countries increased substantially.  The effect of that increase was not merely to increase the cost of fuel, oil and petrol but there was a consequential effect on goods either manufactured here or imported and which were affected by the price element in so far as fuel and fuel oil and other transport charges were concerned.  The present price increases differ fundamentally from these increases due in the past to rises in import prices.  The prices increase on this occasion has been due to the introduction of the turnover tax.  When this tax was introduced it was claimed by the Government and by the Minister for Finance that it was to apply at 2½ per cent or 6d. in the £.  Subsequently the Revenue Commissioners issued two booklets to traders and business people explaining how the tax would operate and how it would be recovered by the traders from the public.  It is interesting, when we now see that the effect of the turnover tax and the rise in prices far exceeds 2½ per cent.  Indeed, a Deputy would have difficulty in finding a case in which the turnover tax operates at the rate of 2½ per cent or 6d. in the £.  It either does not operate at all or it operates at varying rates from ten per cent to <Col N="865" /> 15 per cent and, in some cases, beyond that percentage increase.</P>
    <P>On page 7 of the first publication issued by the Department of Finance on the turnover tax, Pr. 7136, it is said:</P>
    <P>Registered persons may adjust their prices so as to recover the amount of tax payable on their turnover.  They may do this in any way they please and need not apply the tax separately to each transaction.</P>
    <P>There was a later document issued by the Revenue Commissioners called <i>Guide to the Turnover Tax</i> which says:</P>
    <P>Suppliers will normally provide for the tax by increasing prices to the consumer.  This may be done in a variety of ways and in most cases the supplier will be the best judge of the procedures suited to his particular line of business.  It should, however, be borne in mind that the tax is a tax on gross receipts and gross receipts will include the amounts added to provide for the tax itself.  Accordingly, if a supplier wishes to compensate himself fully for the tax, he will adjust his prices to allow for tax at slightly more than 6d. in the £.  The additional amount required is very small&mdash; less than one-sixth of a penny in the £&mdash;and, in the case of monthly turnovers up to £3,575 would be fully covered by the relief allowed for the first £100 of turnover each month.</P>
    <P>These two publications indicate the advice offered to traders and business people.  Is it any wonder that when there is confusion and difficulty, with prices rising in excess of 2½ per cent, people tend to forget the advice tendered to traders by the Government? Is it not unrealistic to suggest that the additional amount is very small?  Is there any known coin by which traders could recompense themselves by the addition of one-sixth of a penny?</P>
    <P>It is true to say that if the commodity is of sufficient size and costs sufficient money it is readily possible to calculate the increase and it has <Col N="866" /> been so calculated to provide the 2½ per cent.  It is equally true that traders, when dealing with turnover tax over a certain period, will be capable of charging it to the account or bill at the rate of 2½ per cent and of assessing their liability in respect of turnover tax by adding at the rate of 6d. in the £ or 2½ per cent.  But that fails to take into account that the majority of transactions in this country are individual transactions, transactions dealing in the prices of various commodities ranging from goods sold in groceries, hardware shops, drapery shops and chemists' shops as well as drink.</P>
    <P>In nearly all these cases individual customers come into the shop and buy their individual needs.  They resent it when in one case a trader is charging, not 2½ per cent, but anything ranging from five per cent to 15 per cent.  No individual trader can devise a system which will allow him to operate a 2½ per cent tax when he is dealing with a small individual transaction.  Take the case of razor blades.  Where a trader sells a packet of razor blades he can apply the 2½ per cent tax but what is to happen if individual razor blades are sold, as they are sold?  That example can be multiplied one thousand times in individual transactions in which traders are in a dilemma.  If he does not charge the tax he has to make it up on something else and other people will resent it when they are obliged to pay somebody else's tax.</P>
    <P>If traders propose to charge the tax on every individual sale, it is obvious that there is no coin available which they can use.  One of the defects of this tax is that it is ill-conceived, illconsidered and that no adequate calculation was made of its full economic consequences.  It seemed readily available as a means of raising revenue, a scheme which would not merely bring in substantial revenue but which would, for the first time, bring within the net of the tax gatherer a wide range of goods, an almost limitless range of commodities never before subject to tax.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments in favour of this tax was that the existing traditional methods of raising revenue would not <Col N="867" /> supply adequate revenue for the future, although already, according to the figures published by the Minister for Finance, the revenue from traditional taxation for the full year is from £6 million to £7 million extra.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax affects the whole range of goods.  Not only are the traditional goods that were always the subject of taxation affected by it but also commodities not previously subject to taxation such as fuel, clothing and food.  One of the defects of the tax is that it makes no distinction between essential commodities and the less essential commodities.  On the basis of the information given to us goods not previously subject to tax will carry proportionately a greater share of the total tax.</P>
      <P>One of the facts stated in the course of this discussion is that those who can secure wage and salary increases, those who are in a position to exert pressure either through trade union organisations or other bodies, will secure compensation.  Their circumstances will be relatively eased by the improvement in wages and salaries which will be effected as a result of the operation of the machinery I have mentioned.  Undoubtedly those organised industrial workers, the whitecollar workers who have unions to act for them, State employees who will benefit from arbitration and conciliation machinery introduced some years ago and other public servants who have available the benefits of conciliation and arbitration, in whatever form it may be, or who secured comparable increases as a result of direct negotiation will all, to some extent, be cushioned against the rise in prices and the impact of this tax as it affects the day to day living of every family and every individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably for the size of our population, compared with that of any other country in Europe, certainly that of any country in close proximity to this country, we have a larger proportion <Col N="868" /> of retired personnel, of people living on pensions, on fixed incomes. Remember, even those who received the benefit of some social welfare improvements received it on the basis of a 2½ per cent tax, not on the basis of 5, 10 or 15 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>But, outside altogether those who have got these benefits, there are people living on fixed incomes.  There are people who have no resources other than whatever they have accumulated from past exertions or who have available some modest contribution from the home assistance officers or some other semi-benevolent organisation. These people cannot compensate themselves for and cannot offset the rise in prices and the rise in the cost of essential commodities.</P>
    <P>It seems to me illusory to talk of better social welfare aims and objectives. It is fair enough to talk about them so long as they are regarded in that light but consider the matter of the improvement of social welfare benefits. Consider the position if we are to give a wider opportunity to people who are already the weaker sections in the community&mdash;unorganised people, retired personnel and, even leaving aside, for the moment, retired people, pensioners and people living on fixed incomes, we have in this community a great number of unorganised workers; workers who, because of their particular type of employment, are unable to get into trade unions or are unable to get adequate representation; workers who are employed in small concerns, self-employed persons.  All of these categories are almost outside the scope of any wage or salary adjustment which will compensate them for any rise in the cost of living.  It seems to me that this whole discussion about prices turns entirely on the responsibility which the Government have, an inescapable responsibility, for initiating the turnover tax without adequately contemplating the consequences or the repercussions on prices and salaries.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which have given rise to concern in recent weeks has been not merely the rise in prices but the consequential rise which will follow when wage and salary adjustments are made.  Rumour has it that the Taoiseach <Col N="869" /> has expressed concern at the extent to which wage and salary demands have been presented.  Is it any wonder, when the Taoiseach's own letter gave the green light&mdash;as if any need were there to indicate to the vast majority of people in this country who would seek the only legitimate way they could to compensate themselves for the rise in prices by an increase in wages or salaries?  However, the consequential effect of wage and salary increases may compensate, to some extent, those who get them&mdash;but what about the effect on prices?  What about the effect on the cost of production, the effect on our ability to compete effectively and efficiently in export markets and to maintain effectively our trading position?  This turnover tax has set off a chain reaction the end of which nobody can foresee and which no economist has been able adequately to estimate or accurately to foretell.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms expressed when this matter was considered by the Commission on Income Taxation, which has been quoted before, was that by Mr. David O'Mahony, Lecturer in Economics, University College, Cork.  In the Third Interim Report of the Commission on Income Taxation he said that the purchase tax would tend to raise the cost of living and thus stimulate demands for increases in money income which would, in turn, increase costs and thus impair our competitive position.</P>
    <P>This tax affects every individual and every household.  One of the criticisms previously made of it is that it taxes at the same rate the essentials of life as well as those not in that category. It taxes food, clothing, footwear, medicines.  In addition, it taxes the traditional commodities which are taxed&mdash;beer, tobacco, petrol.  The inevitable result of this tax has been the widespread demand by trade unions and organisations representing workers and salary earners for some compensation to be made.  But there are, as has been clearly said, sections in the community&mdash;retired people, people living on fixed incomes, self-employed people, people employed in small undertakings&mdash;almost all of whom will be unable to compensate <Col N="870" /> or cushion themselves against this price rise.</P>
    <P>If this tax had been imposed in a specific way, as were previous taxes in this country, the consequences which we are now discussing would not have occurred.  One of the most effective and strongest critics of this type of tax in the past was the present Taoiseach. Speaking in May, 1956, according to the Official Report, he said that Government intervention for tax-raising purposes in business always results in waste and is a cause of higher costs as well as of higher prices.  He said that furthermore the smaller the yield from any tax the higher will be the proportion of that yield absorbed in collection expenses and the wider the number of taxes the greater the possibility of successful evasion by individuals.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms during this discussion is that different traders and different shopkeepers charge different prices for the same commodity.  I believe the advice tendered&mdash;it was not a direction: it was advice&mdash;in the booklet issued by the Revenue Commissioners and the booklet issued by the Minister for Finance is responsible for that situation.  It is responsible for it because it stated that traders &mdash; shopkeepers&mdash;were to recover the tax and a little more.  But when you come to operate that the little more becomes impossible to achieve&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No one can suggest that this tax can be operated without raising the cost of living.  It has caused a steep rise in the cost of living, a steep rise in the price of essentials and non-essentials.  To suggest that price control could be effective, that there is any adequate system of price control which could prevent prices rising, a system Government initiated, Government inspired, and Government directed, seems to me to portray an evasion of responsibility.  Responsibility in this case rests solely on the Government responsible for introducing this tax.  So far as I am concerned, so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we believe that, when the people have an opportunity of rejecting <Col N="872" /> this policy, they will reject it emphatically, clearly and quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it a little difficult, having listened to Deputy Cosgrave, to bring my mind back to the motion before the House.  As I understand it, the motion deals with price control and the machinery which should be adopted towards that end. Price increases, in my opinion, fall under three different headings.  There is the situation in Dublin and other large cities and towns; there is the situation in small towns and villages in rural Ireland; and there is the situation in which a small number of manufacturers may get together to increase prices to a level which could be described as profiteering.</P>
      <P>Taking the first category&mdash;Dublin and the other cities and large towns&mdash; we on these benches contend, and the Minister has made the case here, that there is no more effective method of controlling prices than competition. Any Deputy familiar with what is happening in Dublin can give numerous instances of shops, particularly in the grocery line, which is what we are mainly concerned with here, which increased prices considerably more than was necessary to correspond with the turnover tax and which, as a result of complaints from customers, withdrawal of custom and competition, all of which are concomitant, have reduced their prices.  I personally know of a number of such instances.  I know of one large chain of supermarkets which increased the price of a certain type of cigarette by twopence for 20; within a week, that twopence was reduced to one penny per 20.  It must be perfectly obvious to anybody who thinks that what I say is true: where competition operates, it is by far the most effective method of dealing with profiteering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That interruption is typical of the type of statement we have heard in this debate.  At one stage we had Deputy Dunne maintaining that the Minister had said that there was no increase in the price of drink in Dublin.  The Minister, of course, never said any such thing.  Now we have Deputy Dr. Browne suggesting I have said there has been no increase in the cost of living.  I never said that.  Perhaps Deputy Dr. Browne would do me the courtesy of at least paying some attention to what I am saying, if he wishes to interrupt me.</P>
      <P>I was saying that by far the most effective way of dealing with profiteering is competition.  It follows logically from that that our efforts should be directed towards ensuring that there is competition.  Some Deputies have contended that one cannot depend on competition to prevent profiteering and that the only effective method is price control.  The whole history of price control, not only here but in other countries, shows that one of the principal results of introducing price control is the elimination of competition and what is fixed as a maximum permitted price becomes in fact the minimum price.  That is a phenomenon well known in every country.  To resort to price control of the type advocated would be a most retrograde step.  It would ensure that, where competition is operating, it will be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who are seriously concerned about this problem&mdash;I am speaking now of Dublin and the large cities and towns&mdash;could not do more for their constituents than to emphasise that day in and day out all over their constituencies and encourage people not alone to take away their custom from shops that are profiteering but also make it clear why they are removing their custom.  I know a number of cases where that has happened.  I ask the House to consider a business, large or small, into which ten people come on the one day and object to the prices charged, refusing to buy, and saying they will not deal in the shop again.  Imagine the effect of that in a shop.  I know what has happened in a number of shops.  Prices have come down.  The most effective action <Col N="874" /> Deputies concerned with this problem can take is to encourage constituents to take the most effective action open to them where profiteering is concerned, namely, withdraw their custom and give it to the man who is not profiteering. This has operated, and it will operate to a larger extent as time goes on.  We can hasten the operation of that most effective method of price control.</P>
    <P>The second category to which I referred is the category of the small villages and towns of rural Ireland. Here you have a different problem, because in some cases competition cannot operate.  In those cases, clearly we cannot rely on competition.  Listening to this debate, one would think the Minister was hearing about this for the first time.  In fact, it is clear from the Minister's statement that he was on to this problem as soon as it occurred, that he has succeeded in gathering evidence of concerted efforts by traders in small towns and villages to force prices up to a profiteering level and that he has issued instructions for prosecutions against such people.  I do not think that fact has been sufficiently emphasised in this debate.  The Minister has taken action, and prosecutions are pending.  I feel confident that, if we have just a few prosecutions, a number of people who have been endeavouring to profiteer will learn very quickly what is in store for them and will mend their ways.</P>
    <P>Again I suggest that Deputies concerned with this problem can do a considerable amount of spreading this information, not concealing it, that prosecutions are pending, that the Minister said he intends to continue with these investigations and to take all the necessary steps to deal with these concerted efforts where competition is being eliminated.  If we make that information known and make it clear it is our determination to support that action by the Minister, we will be doing something really effective to secure the elimination of the profiteering which has been complained of.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody be under any misapprehension, it should be clear from <Col N="875" /> what I have said that I believe profiteering has taken place in certain parts of the country and I believe it is the Government's duty to deal with that.  But I also believe that the Government are dealing with this in the most effective way open to them. To my knowledge, nobody has put forward any argument in this debate which would show that steps other than those taken by the Government will be more effective.</P>
    <P>The third situation to which I referred concerned manufacturers getting together and unduly increasing the prices of their commodities.  This presents a more difficult problem, but the Minister has made it clear he has been dealing with this, although the machinery, necessarily, is a bit slow. Investigations are taking place into the increases which have been forced by some manufacturers.  If the inquiries disclose grounds for prosecution, I do not think anyone need doubt that the Minister will not hesitate to institute prosecutions.  Apart from the slowness of the machinery, which, I suppose, is unavoidable, in regard to the methods by which the investigations take place, I have some doubts that it is rather too easy for manufacturers to make statements in reply to these inquiries which they are not asked to prove up to the hilt.  They are asked to prove them all right.  I know it is extremely difficult for the Minister and his officials to get to the root of this. Even highly-qualified chartered accountants would probably find it difficult to find the flaw, if there is a flaw, in some of these arguments.  I would urge the Minister to take every action possible to ensure that the investigations will be as searching and as accurate as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to stray from the terms of the motion, but since reference has been made to the turnover tax as a tax, to its political effects, and since allegations have been made that this Party have been running away from by-elections, I should like to say there are two ways of looking at this problem. One of them is the way we have heard, but the other way is this: why is it that the Opposition <Col N="876" /> Parties are making such desperate&mdash; and &ldquo;desperate&rdquo; is the word&mdash;attempts to have a by-election held before the people get an opportunity of judging this turnover tax in action?  Why were they so keen to rush the by-election in Dublin North-East?  They held it up until they were quite sure what was happening about the turnover tax, then they moved the writ. Since it is my constituency, I feel I had better say something about it.</P>

      <P>All I should like to do is to point out that the Opposition know very well the tide is turning as far as that propaganda battle is concerned and the truth is coming out. They do not want that.  However, we are determined to see it does come out and that the people will get an opportunity of passing judgment on what has really happened, not what the Opposition said happened in Dublin North-East or what they are saying is happening now, which, in many cases, is quite untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fair test of the genuine concern of the Opposition for increases in prices is how they approach the problem. Are they, in fact, going out urging people to do what they can in the way of taking custom away from shops so that the shops which profiteer <Col N="877" /> suffer?  I have not heard of any of them doing it.  They may have done it in private, but none of them has been reported as doing it and none of them has done it here.  None of them got up and said he was glad to hear the Minister has made arrangements for prosecutions to be instituted against people who have made concerted efforts to put up prices unduly.  In fact, listening to the speeches made, one would get the impression that they had not heard the Minister say this.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair comment on my part to note this omission on the part of Opposition speakers to this motion. I would be lacking in my duty if I did not comment on this.  I grant Deputy MacEoin the statement he made&mdash;that to take advantage of the situation in Dublin North-East was fair.  All is fair in this game.  But they should not complain if we make an effort to fight back and show what the truth is.</P>

We are anxious that the people should know what is going on, not what the Opposition say is happening or might happen, which is what we had to put up with before. We would like the people to get a fair chance to judge this, and they will, and we have no doubt what will happen.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I have strayed somewhat from the motion but I plead relevance to what was said before.  The real issue here is the question of undue increases in prices and I have suggested that no method has been put forward by the Opposition which would be, on the face of it, more effective in dealing with increases in prices than those detailed by the Minister.  The only suggestion has been the actual fixing of price levels, maximum retail prices, and, as I have said, that procedure has not turned out to be effective in the past in this country or in other countries.  It completely eliminated competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one assurance which I should like to give the House, that is, that this Party is at least as concerned as any other Party in this House to see that the people are not exploited, that we in this Party are determined to see <Col N="878" /> that whatever steps are necessary to deal with exploitation will be taken. We are satisfied that the Minister has taken the most effective steps that can be taken at this stage to deal with it.</P>

      <P>But, if these steps are found not to be effective, the Minister, I know, will have no hesitation whatsoever in looking for further machinery to deal with it and there will be no hesitation whatever in this Party in supporting his demands.  But, until we hear of a more effective way of dealing with it, I suggest that we ought to do what we can to further the efforts that are being made by the Minister, and a great deal can be done on both sides of the House effectively to deal with exploitation.</P>
      <P>I would say, in conclusion, that Deputy Liam Cosgrave, as I understood him, said that apart from a few very limited commodities, a sum of much more than 2½ per cent had been added on to all commodities and he blamed the Government for this.  I recall that not so very long ago Deputy Cosgrave's Party were shedding crocodile tears in this House for the very people who have put on these large increases he has talked about and it strikes me as the height of hypocrisy for him to come in now and blame the Government for this.  It would have been much more effective if he had dealt with the actual problem of price increases and had lent his support to the efforts being made by the Minister to deal with them.</P>

      <P>The Minister has accepted a motion which says in the first part:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that in view of the many recent increases in the prices <Col N="879" /> of essential foodstuffs and services, and in view of the fact that no satisfactory explanation of the necessity for such rises in prices is available&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;et cetera.  The Minister accepts that motion.  Deputy Colley admits that there have been increases but he qualifies it by saying that prices are now coming down and that there is no need to worry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister goes further than Deputy Colley.  He says he recognises that there have been many increases in the prices of foodstuffs and essential services and he accepts that the Labour Party wants him to do something about it.  We are not so much concerned about the acceptance by the Minister of this motion because, with all due respect to him, it is easy to say: &ldquo;I accept the motion&rdquo; but what we want him to do is to implement the terms of the motion as vigorously as needs to be done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley in a sort of apologetic speech said that the Fianna Fáil Party did not fight back vigorously enough when they were being attacked about the turnover tax.  Why the reticence, why the shyness, since last April? That is about seven months ago. Nobody prevented Fianna Fáil from talking about the turnover tax but there seems to be a reluctance, more than a reluctance, even on the part of members on the front bench, to say anything about it, which leads people to believe that they were ashamed of the turnover tax and are now still more ashamed of the turnover tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The turnover tax has had a test.  The people have had time to reflect on it from April to November and to see how it works in practice in November and the first two weeks of December.  We know what the reaction is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say with respect to the Minister that what he has done with regard to the investigation and control of <Col N="880" /> prices he must have done reluctantly because all the time, even since this turnover tax was debated, there has been a reluctance on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Taoiseach and all the members of the Government even to mention the term &ldquo;price control&rdquo;.  When we assembled here on 23rd October it had been obvious to us for weeks that there were increases in prices and that there would be increases in prices in the name of the turnover tax and in anticipation of wage increases and even on 23rd October, when the Minister was questioned, he did not seem to be too anxious to introduce the machinery that was available to him under the Prices Act, 1958.  A week after that, when he was asked, he gave a sort of half threat that if prices went up unduly he would be forced to take action and we saw an example of his action that weekend: there was a pathetic statement through the Government Information Bureau to the effect that manufacturers and traders should explain their prices to the public&mdash;&ldquo;Please, Mr. Trader, please, Mr. Manufacturer, explain to the public why these increases have been necessary and then they will be satisfied&rdquo;.  They did not even attempt to explain the increases in prices that had undoubtedly taken place in the latter end of September, all through October, and in November.  Prices at that time were already rising.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us last week that he has power, without having to avail of certain administrative machinery, to control the price of bread, sugar, milk and butter.  These are essential commodities and the prices of these commodities have increased.</P>
    <P>When we spoke of the turnover tax and related the turnover tax to social welfare payments, we spoke about essential foodstuffs, including the four I have just mentioned.  In the case of milk and butter the Minister said he must consult with the Minister for Agriculture.  The price of milk has increased and, as was described by Deputy Kyne last week, it seems to have gone up quite a bit in many parts of the country.  The price of butter increased by 2d. per lb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Take it as a rhetorical question.  There will be some opportunity. Has he, in fact, consulted with the Minister for Agriculture in regard to the price of milk and butter and, if he has, with what results?  He says he has to consult with him before he can take any action but, as I said before, butter has gone up by 2d. a lb., which is four per cent, and milk, in one instance I know of, has gone up by ?d. per gallon.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has not indicated to us that he has even investigated these with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.  Sugar has gone up by six per cent.  Bread has gone up by varying amounts all over the country.  If it were to go up by the 2½ per cent which Fianna Fáil Deputies talked about on the debate on the turnover tax we would have to deal in farthings, of which we are assured by the Minister for Finance there are plenty in the country but when one wants to get them in order to pay a price that would entail the payment of farthings, these coins cannot be found at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At column 562, volume 206, of the Official Report of 4th December, 1963, the Minister said he had investigated some manufacturers' prices and was satisfied that the increases were warranted.  To satisfy the public and to satisfy the Dáil he should have told us what manufactured articles he had investigated.  I do not disbelieve him. I believe he has investigated these but the public want to know.  They want to see evidence that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been concerned <Col N="882" /> to the extent of investigating particular commodities and particular articles.  I would say his assurance last week on that matter was much too vague and certainly does not satisfy the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister also quoted what Deputy Cosgrave said in relation to the Prices Act, 1958.  He said, in effect, that price control could not be operated successfully unless in wartime or emergency conditions.  I want seriously to submit to the House that, in view of the introduction of the turnover tax, the turnover tax which has been responsible for these increases, as far as prices are concerned we could be deemed to be in an emergency and for that reason price control is necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not know how effective the Fair Trade Commission can be.  The machinery of the Fair Trade Commission has been invoked by the Minister in order to ascertain whether there has been a price agreement in areas and in certain businesses or industries. I submit again it would be very difficult to prove that there was a price agreement by a body of people and while I hope the Minister, who only today announced that he intended to prosecute and while I agree that is an excellent thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The first time the Minister said &ldquo;prosecution&rdquo; was to-day. The Minister last week, as far as I could read from his speech, said he proposed to take certain action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if that is so but, as far as I remember, the only indication I got that he intended to prosecute was when he replied to a Parliamentary Question today.  I accept what the Minister says but what I am trying to tell him is that the machinery of the Fair Trade Commission is not adequate to investigate prices if the Minister intends to control them at all.  The Prices Act of 1958 is the only piece of legislation containing machinery which could meet the present <Col N="883" /> situation because, as I say, we want vigorous action.</P>
      <P>There is not much point in the Minister merely saying he intends to accept this motion, if he intends to do merely what he has been doing over the last few weeks.  It has been said by speakers from the Labour Party and by Deputy Cosgrave that wage and salary earners will look after themselves. There is no doubt about that but there are other people who are not in a position to look after themselves. There is the social welfare group but I do not want to dwell too much on that.  The Minister will recollect that when he spoke on the Budget here in April of last year he took examples of certain people and described how the turnover tax would affect them and how they would be compensated by increased social welfare benefits.  However, like every other member of the Fianna Fáil Party who spoke about the turnover tax, he spoke merely in terms of the cost of living increasing by 2½ per cent and no more.  Even with this example of 2½ per cent many of those in the social welfare class, especially assistance groups like the non-contributory old age pensioners and noncontributory widows, just about broke even on the assumption that the cost of living went up by 2½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the increase the Fianna Fáil Party said would occur as soon as the turnover tax was introduced.  It was described as an increase of 2½ per cent for the purpose of their argument to demonstrate that these people would be compensated by social welfare benefits. Even now it is recognised that the cost of living has gone up much more than 2½ per cent and the net result of that is that tens of thousands of people who are supposed to benefit under the last Budget now find themselves worse off than they were prior to the 1st November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case I do not think the Minister has said much that will allay public disquiet.  Despite what Deputy <Col N="884" /> Colley says he is doing and we should do with regard to certain shops, I do not believe the public are convinced that the Government are serious about controlling prices.  The women in the city of Dublin seem to be concerned about prices and I do not think Deputy Colley could allege that the march of women has been prompted by any political Party.  In any case I do not think he can allege that the Labour Party has prompted this protest march. As a matter of fact, a description of the protest march is contained in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 15th November, 1963, one edition of which had a heading: &ldquo;Women in tax protest&rdquo; and then went on to say:</P>
    <P>Several hundred Dublin housewives yesterday marched from Cathal Brugha Street through the city to lodge a protest at Government Buildings against the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>I have another copy of the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 15th November, 1963, which says in this regard:</P>
    <P>Between 90 and 100 Dublin housewives marched from Cathal Brugha Street through the city to lodge a protest at Government Buildings against the turnover tax.</P>

In any case the Minister has accepted this motion but in the beginning I said, and I repeat, that we expect him to implement the terms of the motion as vigorously as needs to be done and we shall have no hesitation <Col N="885" /> in putting down the same sort of resolution, with the permission of the Chair, or in questioning him periodically as to the action he is taking in regard to the control of prices, where it is necessary to control prices.</P>

At the same time I think it desirable to have something clearer in this legislation. It would be better to have &ldquo;bank&rdquo; clearly defined as being an institution licensed under the Central Bank Act, rather than have the phrase &ldquo;credit institution&rdquo; defined.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main object of the Bill is to simplify the transfer procedure for fully paid up registered securities.  Up to the <Col N="886" /> present the law relating to the transfer of securities has been the same here as in Britain, but legislation recently enacted in that country under the title of the Stock Transfer Act, 1963&mdash; which came into operation on 28th October, 1963&mdash;introduces reforms which will simplify transfer procedure there.  The British Act implements the principal recommendations of a committee representative of the London Stock Exchange, the Bank of England and the other leading institutions of the City of London concerned with stocks and shares.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Stock Exchange has represented that similar legislation should be introduced here as soon as possible so as to enable uniformity of transfer procedure to be restored throughout Ireland and Britain.  Meanwhile, Irish stockbrokers are obliged to operate two transfer procedures&mdash; the existing procedure for Irish securities and the new simplified procedure for British securities&mdash;which give rise to some confusion.  Apart from this consideration the reform is desirable in itself.  The extension of the simplified procedure to Irish securities would result in considerable saving of time for stockbrokers, banks and registrars of stocks and shares as well as for the investing public.  Indeed, the slowness and complexity of the present transfer system is often cited as a factor which discourages prospective investors.  As it is obviously desirable to restore uniformity of stock transfer procedure here and in Britain the present Bill follows the lines of the British Stock Transfer Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>The main provisions governing the new stock transfer procedure are set out in section 2 of the Bill and are:</P>
    <P>(i)  future transfers of securities to which the Bill applies will be under hand and not by deed&mdash;a new form of transfer for general use is introduced;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the person to whom securities are transferred need not in future sign the instrument of transfer;</P>
    <P>(iii)  the signature of the transferor need not be witnessed;</P>
    <P Just="Center">and</P>
    <P>(iv)  a transferor whose holding <Col N="887" /> has been sold on a stock exchange will not have to execute more than a single transfer form even where parts of the holding have been sold to different buyers.  A new form to be executed by the broker is introduced for such cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill applies to fully paid up transferable registered securities except securities of a company limited by guarantee or an unlimited company.  The Bill does not apply to partly paid up shares as it would obviously be undesirable that securities with a liability attaching to them could be transferred to a person without his acknowledgment, by his signature on the form of transfer, of the obligation being undertaken.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the Bill has effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment or instrument, such as articles of association, relating to the transfer of securities. Section 4 provides against the evasion of stamp duty by means of the circulation of transfers in which the name of the transferee has not been inserted. Power is being taken in section 5 of the Bill to permit of the amendment of the new transfer forms by way of regulations.  Under section 6 such regulations and also regulations made under section 1 determining the Stock Exchanges to be recognised for the purposes of the Bill, will be required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the provisions of the Bill and I am satisfied that it will provide an improvement in the procedure for transferring securities and that it will recommend itself to the House.</P>
    <P>There is a further point which I would like to mention.  Deputies, in nothing that the procedure set out in this Bill amends the share transfer procedure contained in the Companies Bill, 1963, may wonder why the latter Bill was not suitably amended.  Because of the complexity of the Companies Bill and as the Stock Transfer Bill, which covers a wider range of securities than company shares, introduces a new principle it was considered desirable to have the new transfer system discussed <Col N="888" /> separately.  For that reason the Companies Bill was not amended. However, in view of the fact that there will be a time lag in bringing into operation the Companies Bill which is in the final stages of being enacted, I propose to introduce an amendment at the Committee Stage of the Stock Transfer Bill to ensure that the new transfer procedure will override the transfer procedure contained in the Companies Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister it is desirable as far as possible to have the system in operation here working side by side with the system operating in Britain. To that extent, the Minister and I are in complete agreement.  Indeed, if the Minister did not change the system here to bring it into line, there would be a danger that he would lose substantially in duty on the transfer of stocks.  The fact that there were different systems must mean to some extent that the transfer of stock, whether the vendor or the purchaser was resident in this country or not, would be stamped in the country where the new system was operating rather than here.</P>
      <P>Having said that, it ends as far as Irish industrial securities are concerned, any advantage there is in this Bill over existing law.  The main object of this form of transfer is to avoid the necessity for a signature of transfer by the purchaser and the time-wasting procedure that used to go along with that circumstance.  The correspondence that had to take place between the stockbroker for the purchaser and his client wasted unnecessarily a great deal of time and money and there was often a quite unnecessary delay if the purchaser was not immediately available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, with the new Bill, in the case of Irish industrial securities, that must go on because the purchaser must give the company a certificate under the Control of Manufactures Acts and it is necessary for the purchaser, accordingly, to sign the appropriate certificate and for the stockbroker to get from each purchaser in respect of each block of shares purchased a certificate in the form required by the Act.  There will not <Col N="889" /> therefore be any saving, or any productivity, if I might use the word here, in regard to Irish industrial securities.  Indeed, many people feel that in the day of freer trade, the restriction that is there should pass.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree it is right to provide in the Bill that where there is a call on a share, the signature of the purchaser is required.  It would be quite wrong if a person could be registered in respect of a share with a call and be forced to pay a call without being appraised of it, the evidence of his having been so appraised being his signature.</P>
    <P>I do not like the way the Minister has chosen to deal in this Bill with its impact on the Companies Bill.  One thing very strongly in favour of the Companies Bill is that it is now a completely consolidated code.  It was finally passed out of this House about three hours ago and within that time we are proposing, not to re-consolidate or re-amend it, but to override it.  I cannot think of a worse example of legislation ever having been introduced here.  I shall wait to comment on the exact form of the amendment when we see it on Committee Stage but, as a piece of bad workmanship in legislation, the method the Minister is adopting takes the biscuit.</P>
    <P>The Companies Bill occupied the time of the Commission for, I think, eight or nine years.  It came to this House and occupied the time of a Special Committee of the House for a long number of sessions.  It then went through the House again and a Special Committee of the Seanad examined it and after all that, the Minister now comes here with this Bill and proceeds to tell his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the members of the Committee who worked hard on the Bill, that he is going to introduce something that will override the transfer procedure in the Companies Bill.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the Minister providing such a bad example.  Even at this late hour, it would be possible to remedy the situation by a one-line new Companies Bill to be introduced on Thursday&mdash;and we shall give the <Col N="890" /> Minister all stages on Thursday&mdash;so that the appropriate amendments to meet this Bill would be incorporated in the Companies Bill and we could have one document dealing with company law from now on, instead of two, as will be the case.</P>
    <P>Over the years, it has been suggested that the Department and the Minister for Finance live in an ivory tower isolated from the rest of the community. It certainly seems there is not very much collaboration or even much contact between the Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is really a scandalous piece of cynicism to endeavour to deal with this Bill in this way.  It is not as if this new procedure came unbeknown to the Minister.  He was given pretty good advance warning of it on the other side of the sea.  It came into force, as he said, on 28th October and if he were speaking to his colleague, and were not at daggers drawn with him, would it not have been possible since then to whisper a word in his ear and say: &ldquo;You have done a good job on the Companies Bill, colleague, but will you do it in step with me and we shall clear both together?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister must remember also that the Stock Transfer Bill did not come without notice in this House.  If he goes back on his records, he will see that I urged him in a question some six months ago to introduce this very Bill.  He told me then&mdash;I have not the exact date but it was in the summer&mdash; that it was not necessary, that he had no representations, that nobody apparently needed it.  It was common talk outside at the time that it would be necessary to run the two procedures side by side but apparently the ivory tower succeeds in blotting out anything except what the people there want to hear.  The Minister has now got himself into such a mess in this regard that all he can do is give notice today that he is going to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to override the biggest consolidation Bill that was ever passed through this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have another look at it and not disgrace himself and the office he holds, as well as the Office <Col N="891" /> of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that if we did not make this change in the system, as provided for in this Bill, we should be likely to lose revenue in stamps on the transfer of Irish stocks because people might be inclined to deal on the London Stock Exchange instead of the Dublin Exchange as the transfer would be easier to manage. That was one of the main reasons why the Bill was brought in, in addition to conveniencing the stockbroker and so on.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is also right in saying that as long as the Control of Manufactures Acts are there and the obligations under them remain, the transferee will have to sign his name.  He will have to sign his name in any case before the stock is registered with whatever company to which it belongs.</P>

      <P>If I transfer stock, let us say, to the Deputy in any Irish company, I thought perhaps that the Deputy would have to acknowledge that, before it could be registered in a register.  The main point made by the Deputy is covered by this amendment which I propose to bring in.  The difficulty there is that the Companies Bill may not come into operation for some time.  If it came into operation immediately, this Bill might not be necessary, but I am not sure of that. The Deputy will notice that section 3, subsection (1) says:</P>
      <P>Section 2 of this Act shall have effect in relation to the transfer of any securities to which that section applies notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment or instrument ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Companies Bill had been law, I think this Bill might not have been <Col N="892" /> necessary&mdash;I am not certain of that&mdash; because it would apply to that Act like any other Act.  It says:</P>
    <P>... to the contrary in any enactment ...</P>
    <P>The fact that the Companies Act will not be in operation for some time after this Bill is passed made it necessary to amend one or the other.  There was consultation about this and it appeared to me necessary to amend the Companies Act, to make reference to a Bill which was not law.  This Bill was not introduced when the Companies Bill was going through the House and one or other had to be dealt with.  The real difficulty is that the two Bills were going through at the same time. If one had gone before the other, there would have been no trouble.</P>

      <P>This amendment might be said to be consequential on the abolition of the death penalty in ordinary murder cases.  As the law stands, jurors must be kept locked up in trials for murder and treason.  In any other trial, the judge may at his discretion permit the jury to separate before considering their verdict.  I think it is logical that, having abolished the death penalty for ordinary murders, we should abolish the requirement that jurors be locked up in these cases.  I propose that in future the only trials in which the judge will be prohibited from allowing jurors to separate will be those for capital murder and treason.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the definition, or lack of definition, if you like, of &ldquo;registered adoption society&rdquo;?  It is provided that a registered adoption society &ldquo;means a body of persons entered in the Adoption Societies Register kept by the Board under Part IV of the Principal Act&rdquo;.  That does not seem to me to give any kind of safeguard.  It may be from the practical point of view there are certain safeguards where a body of persons seek to have themselves entered in the Register.  I do not know the mechanics of it but it does not seem to provide for anything in the nature of regulations to govern either the composition of such societies or their registration, and I should be glad if the Minister would give us some information with regard to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it is really a matter for the Board.  We have to trust the Board in the matter.  The matter is governed by section 36 of the Principal Act which, for the convenience of the Deputy, I shall read:</P>
      <P>(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the Board shall enter in the register any body of persons which applies to be registered and furnishes to the Board such information as the Board may think necessary to enable it to determine if the body is entitled to be registered.</P>
      <P>(2) The Board shall not register any body of persons unless the Board is satisfied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) that the body is one which exists only for the purpose of promoting charitable, benevolent or philanthropic objects, whether or not any such object is charitable within the meaning of any rule of law, and</P>
      <P>(b) that the body is competent to discharge the obligations imposed upon registered adoption societies under this Act.</P>
      <P>(3) The Board may refuse to register any body of persons if it appears to the Board that any person who takes part in the management or control of the body or who is engaged on its behalf in connection with the making of arrangements for adoption is not a fit and proper person to act.</P>
      <P>So there is a fairly tight framework within which to operate.  We have to leave it to the discretion and good judgment of the Board to make the proper decision.</P>

      <P>I do not want to controvert that but it has been put to me in any event, and it is as well to record this and have the Minister look into it, if necessary, that since the 1952 Act was passed, registration of these adoption societies is virtually automatic and that neither the 1952 Act nor the Minister's proposals in this Bill give any authority to him to make regulations which would have to be complied with, either by the Adoption Board or by these societies.  I understand that the registered adoption societies handle something like 80 per cent of the adoption cases which come before the Board so that it does seem that it is of some considerable importance that everybody should be satisfied.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be taken as casting any doubts on the societies&mdash;I hope the Minister understands that&mdash;but everyone interested in the question of legal adoption should be fully satisfied that the societies which are registered are societies in which everyone can have confidence.  I repeat I am not to be taken as suggesting that there are any registered at the moment that are open to suspicion or lack of confidence but remember we are not legislating just for the present; this will apply not only as it applied since 1952 but in the future and this is the time to have it considered by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that the societies which are registered are suitable bodies.  I have given the Deputy the text of section 36 of the Principal Act but sections 37 and 38 of the Act are also relevant.</P>
      <P>Section 37 provides that:</P>
      <P>The Board may cancel the registration of a registered adoption society on any ground which would require or entitle the Board to refuse an application for the registration of the society or if it appears to the Board that the requirements of this Act are not being adequately complied with ...</P>
      <P>and so on.</P>
      <P>Section 38 provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A registered adoption society and every officer of the society or other <Col N="899" /> person taking part in its management or control shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) furnish the Board with such information as the Board may from time to time by notice in writing require in regard to its constitution, membership, employees, organisation and activities;</P>
    <P>(b) at all reasonable times permit a member or authorised officer of the Board to inspect and make copies of all books and documents relating to adoption in the possession or control of these societies.</P>
    <P>In those three sections, there are adequate safeguards and the Board is endowed with all the necessary powers to ensure that any society which seeks registration or is registered is a suitable organisation.  There is no lack of powers on the part of the Board and it is a matter for the Board to satisfy itself that the societies are suitable.  If there is anybody who imagines that some registered society is not suitable, the course of action to take is to convey that view to the Board and let the Board consider the question in the light of the powers given to it in sections 36, 37 and 38.  For my part, I have no evidence to suggest that any society registered is other than an excellent organisation.</P>

      <P>The only circumstances in which irregularities of that kind could arise would be if the Board did not do its job.  If the Board does its job in accordance with the provisions of sections 36, 37 and 38 of the 1952 Act, there is no danger that any unsuitable body of persons could remain registered.  I think these three sections are adequate and comprehensive. I do not think there is anything further that need be done by way of regulation to add to them.  We established the Board and placed these stringent obligations on it and it can be assumed that it will carry them out faithfully.  If we have any doubts about the Board, the whole structure becomes meaningless.  If the Board carries out its statutory obligations, we do not have anything to worry about.  There should be no need to go further than the three sections I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I have moved the amendment for two reasons.  Under section 19 of the 1952 Act, a number of adoptions of children over nine years of age were made without any ill effects as far as I know.  When the 1952 Act was going through the Dáil, it was the intention of all Parties that the age limit of seven years was only temporary and would be increased. My amendment is designed to increase the age limit from seven years to nine. The old adoption Board, by resolution in 1957, asked that the age limit of seven years be extended and the new Board, the present Board, in 1960, <Col N="902" /> recorded a similar recommendation.  I would press the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell is not very wide of the mark with his amendment.  The position at present is that to be eligible for adoption a child must be between six months and seven years old.  Section 3 now allows a child to be adopted up to nine years of age, provided it is resident with the adoptive parents since before it was seven years of age.  What Deputy Dockrell has suggested is a slight improvement on the section in that regard.  It brings this up to nine years of age all round.</P>
      <P>From the evidence available, this is one of the few countries with such a low age for adoption.  According to a recent United Nations report, from among a large number of countries where investigation has been made the lowest age limit was that imposed in Ireland.  It was stated that in most of the countries the age limit is from 18 to 21 years of age.  There is a big gap between the age of nine and the age of 18, when it comes to adoption.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the case on the Second Stage that the question of integrating a child into family life over a certain age is a very difficult matter, that perhaps it is impossible to have a full integration with the child over a certain age.  The Minister's worry is that, by extending the age limit, we are liable to cause danger to the working of the Act and that while we might bring help and happiness to a few we might endanger many more.  I do not think that is a sound argument.  I can see the Minister's point but I do not think it should be the one we should finally accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Adoption Board is most scrupulous in its examination into the temperament, the conditions, the outlook of the child, even, and a complete report is available on an individual child.  They are the people who should have discretion on the decision as to whether a child should or should not be adopted over a certain age.  I should leave that discretion, if necessary, to the Adoption Board.  However, I should not tie their hands by legislation, <Col N="903" /> as the Minister intends to do in this section.</P>
    <P>We also have the position that a child may become an orphan at eight or nine years of age and cannot be adopted due to its age by people who would like to do so and who would be suitable in every way.  Take a child of 12 or 14 years of age whom people would like to adopt.  Nobody suggests that this child can be integrated with the adoptive parents as well as a child of five years of age but the people concerned will understand that themselves and, to a great extent, the child will not be expecting it.  At the same time, there will be great happiness all round and no danger whatever involved.  If there is an occasional case where doubt or uneasiness exists, the Adoption Board have sufficient experience and knowledge and regard for the whole adoption programme not to allow it to be jeopardised.  The Minister should have no hesitation in widening the scope as far as the age limit is concerned.</P>

      <P>I have considered this carefully.  I must confess I feel the weight of the argument is in favour of Deputy Dockrell and the other Deputies who suggest the age limit be raised.  I was considerably surprised to learn from the Minister on the Second Reading that the Adoption Board advocated that the age should be raised away beyond what is proposed by the Minister in this Bill. That influences my mind to a very great extent in my approach to these amendments.  I had accepted the view the Minister advocated on the Second Reading that the younger the child is adopted the better and the better the chances of adjustment, and so on. However, when I find that the Adoption Board recommend that the age limit be raised&mdash;I think the Minister said on the Second Reading that they recommended the raising of the age to 18 or 21&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me deal with the suggestion that the Board are not in agreement with what we are doing.  The opinion of the Board is that the age at which it should still be permissible to make an adoption order should be raised considerably but they ally that to the requirement that the child must still be placed with the family before it reaches the age of seven and to my mind that is the crucial thing.</P>

I am aware of that resolution of 1960 but that is not the decision of the Board as submitted to me officially and it is not the mind of the Board today.  The mind of the Board on full consideration is that the child must be placed with the family before it reaches the age of seven.  I think most Deputies will agree that that is the crucial thing.  Indeed, there are authorities for suggesting that seven years of age is too old.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> We want to have a system of adoption under which the child is fully integrated into the family and becomes, to all intents and purposes, a full member of the family in every sense.  I am convinced, as a result of all I have heard and read on this subject, that, in order to achieve that, the placing of the child with the family before it reaches the age of seven is of vital importance.  One might say then: &ldquo;Very well; why then do you not accept the proposition of the Board, that, if the child is placed with the family before it reaches the age of seven, it should be permitted to be legally adopted at any time thereafter up to, say, 16 or 21&rdquo;?  My argument against that is that we should not permit adoptive parents to put on the long finger the making of the application for the adoption order because it is desirable, once the child is placed, that the order should be legally made as early as possible; consistent with proper investigation, and a reasonable trial period.  There is an inclination on the part of some adoptive parents to postpone indefinitely the making of the application, the telling of the child, and so on.  It is important, I think, that we should make it obligatory on them to reach finality as early as possible.</P>

      <P>Assume one could adopt up to 12 or 13 years of age, I can see that then it obviously would be to the advantage of the child that the order should be made early.  I do not follow the Minister's argument on the point of application not being made, going out of date and therefore debarred from being made; how does that serve the interests of the child?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is on a different point now.  We are dealing with the case of a child who is placed before the age of seven.  My whole argument stands or falls on that.  I am for infant adoption.  I am for the placing of a child in the home before the age of seven years.  If that is accepted, then every argument is for inducing the adoptive parents to make application and get the order made at the earliest possible moment after the suitability of the arrangement has been established.  Once the order is made, the child has the security of a home, an entitlement to a birth certificate in the surname of the adopters and so on. It would not be fair to put that on the long finger, to leave it until the child is 18, 19 or 21 years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained on the Second Stage that an adopted child has certain rights with regard to a birth certificate.  We are proposing now that the child must be placed before it reaches the age of seven, that the application order must be made before it reaches nine, the Board being free thereafter not to make the order until it sees fit.  I do not envisage that the Board would delay the making of the order but there might very rarely be some specific reason why the order should not be made for a year or two. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Board delaying the making of the order, provided application is made before the child reaches the age of nine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies may be inclined to exaggerate the number of adoptions which would be made, if the law allowed it, in respect of children over the age of seven or nine years.  I do <Col N="907" /> not believe there are many.  I do not think Deputy McQuillan is quite clear on my argument as to why we should not throw the door open.  My argument is that, if we do, if we raise the age and permit later adoptions, we immediately weaken the pressure for earlier adoptions.  If people know they can adopt children later, they may be less likely to adopt them when young. In so far as opening the door to older children would to some extent take away the pressure to adopt while still young, I am against it because everything is to be said for adopting the young child, getting it into the family early, and getting it fully integrated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  The system of adoption here is different from most other countries; where older children can be adopted, it is possible to adopt legitimate children and the law provides that these children can subsequently be re-adopted.  Our law makes an adoption order absolutely final.  Once the order is made, the child is for evermore a legal member of the family into which it has been adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to quote for the House some extracts from the 1960 Report of the European Seminars on Inter-Country Adoption held under the auspices of the United Nations.  This report was prepared with the co-operation of the International Social Service and International Union for Child Welfare.  It is clear from the context, and otherwise, that what the <Col N="908" /> report has to say about inter-country adoption applies equally to adoption inside the country.  On page 13 there is a passing reference to &ldquo;the recognised problem of adoption of older children&rdquo;.  At page 28 it is stated:</P>
    <P>It is well known that placement of older children for adoption (even) in their own countries requires a very high degree of skill on the part of the social workers concerned as well as very special qualities on the part of adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>Pages 44 and 45, referring to the special hazards of inter-country adoption when a child is older, stresses that adoption, even in the child's own country, of older children is difficult:</P>
    <P>A child seven years or older has already had many life experiences. ... If the experience of a warm human relationship comes too late in the child's life, emotional and sometimes intellectual retardation can result....  The task of the rehabilitation of an emotionally damaged child is one for experts....</P>
    <P>It is known that children establish their emotional ties and their sense of identity at a very early age.  The child of five or six is considered to have established his family ties and sense of identity sufficiently strongly to begin to branch out into ties outside the family ... Children as young as three years have very vivid recollections of their parents or substitute parents.  Children of five or six may not be able to accept a new identity, i.e. new mother and father.  For a child of seven, identity and emotional ties may also include identification with his ... neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>I quote these to reinforce my argument that we should try, in so far as possible, to bring about a situation in which children are adopted while still young. I know conflicting views are honestly held by different people on this matter; but as far as I can come to an honest decision in my own mind about the amendment, I am convinced that the advantages are all on the side of providing that the child must be placed with the family before it reaches the <Col N="909" /> age of seven, subject to the modification we are making in the Bill that the application can in certain circumstances be made to the Board in respect of a child up to nine years of age and that the Board can make the Adoption Order at any time thereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very difficult problem, as the Minister says.  There are differences of opinion about it amongst people who know the subject and know the difficulty of creating a happy environment for the child and a happy individual from that environment at a later stage.  It is generally felt that the best time to adopt a child is within its first year of life.  After the first year, considerable damage has already taken place if the child is re-placed.  I understand, in fact, that if a child changes within the third or fourth year, it is difficult for it to do so without risk.  It is quite easy to concede the Minister's general point that from age 0 to seven would be the most desirable years to adopt a child. The earlier in that period the better from the child's point of view and from the parent's point of view&mdash;from the child's point of view in so far as it would be a well-integrated personality.</P>
      <P>Really, what we are trying to argue here is the exceptional case.  I do not think anybody in their senses would look for the adoption of a child when it is eight, nine, or ten, up to the age we have suggested here, unless there were exceptional circumstances.  Within the first days of a child's life is the ideal time; any time after that becomes less and less desirable.  After from five to seven years, it does not matter what level the Minister fixes.  There are great risks from the point of view of the child and of the adopting parents.  Everybody is conscious of these risks&mdash;the Adoption Board, the adoption society and the prospective parents.  Even the child itself can probably be aware of them.  It would only be done in exceptional circumstances and it would be a rather undesirable thing, did it have to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But assume circumstances where a child was living in a family and it had been allowed to live for some years in a family, as happens very frequently <Col N="910" /> in the country.  The child grew up in that family, and then the incident of the birth certificate comes along and the whole question of adoption comes up.  This is a case in which the child is only looked for adoption at a later age.  Would the Minister not agree that that type of adoption should be permitted in these exceptional circumstances? It would not be something that would happen very often.  It is undesirable that it should happen at all, but it could happen.  If it could happen, we ought to make provision for such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>We are all for anything the Minister could do to see the child gets the security of adoption, if there is some security in adoption as soon as possible. If he can give that incentive, he should try to do so.  He should also bear in mind the possibility of this exceptional type of case, when people make this decision with their eyes open.  They could only do it, having considered all the grave risks there are in such a prospect; but these risks would not exist at all if the child lived with the family over a number of years and they had deferred the question of adoption through ignorance or for one reason or another.  The child would then face this prospect of needing adoption, and under the Act would not be allowed to have it because of the age limit.</P>

    <P>The Minister referred on a number of occasions to this question of birth certificates.  He suggested it would be needed when the child would go for Confirmation.  I appreciate what the Minister said the last day about the whole question of birth certificates being a matter for his colleague.  In fact, they are a matter for a number of his colleagues.  We have the situation, as I got it here last week, that the long certificate is still needed by the Department of Social Welfare in respect of certain categories of social welfare <Col N="911" /> recipients.  Perhaps the Minister might help out his colleague in that.  If only the one certificate were available, would that not solve many of the problems to which the Minister has referred?</P>

      <P>There is force in what the Deputy says, but it does not do away with my argument that it is desirable for the child's sake to have the Adoption Order made as soon as possible.  Once the legal Adoption Order is made, the child is entitled to either the short or long birth certificate in the adoptive name.  That is the key. The long one mentions adoption; the short one does not.  I agree that short certificates in general may to some <Col N="912" /> extent suffer from the disadvantage Deputy McQuillan says.  I do not know enough about this but, while the argument Deputy McQuillan used in relation to social welfare services is to some extent valid, I am told over a greater part of the country more and more use is being made by everybody of the short birth certificate.  There may be areas where the short form of the birth certificate is regarded with suspicion but far the greater use is being made of the short form of the birth certificate.  That will to some extent overcome the difficulties the Deputy has in mind with regard to it.</P>

On marriage, that sister or brother could adopt the child and may have been keeping in touch with the child.

      <P>I think subsection (1) of section 5 will find general agreement, that is, the lowering of the age limit for the adoptive parents, but I mentioned on Second Reading that I have very strong objections to the proposal to remove the Irish citizenship requirement contained in section 11 of the 1952 Act.  The position is that at present, if this Bill does not go through, it is necessary that the adoptive parents either should be called Irish citizens or shall have five years' residence here before an adoption order can be made.  Now it is proposed to wipe out the protection&mdash;I believe it was a protection&mdash; that was afforded, by means of subsection (2) of this section.  I did ask the Minister on Second Reading to reconsider <Col N="916" /> that and I would urge him at this stage to reconsider it.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how the Bill is improved by the inclusion of subsection (2) of section 5.  I do not think it would in any way diminish the value of the Bill simply to delete that subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am leaving citizenship and coming to residence.  Surely if we are to have the unqualified statutory obligation that the Board be satisfied that the proposed adopters are suitable, then if they are residing here for one, two or three years, why prevent them from adopting a child? Bearing in mind all the time that the Board must be satisfied as to their suitability, I think the citizenship qualification is unreal.  Stipulating a five-year residence period may prevent suitable people who want to adopt a child from doing so.  As long as there is the safeguard of the statutory obligation that the Board must be satisfied as to their suitability, there is nothing to worry about.</P>
      <P>As against all this, I must point out if such people do come before our Board seeking an Irish legal adoption, they have submitted themselves to the scrutiny of the Board.  Non-residents would be more likely to take a child for adoption under the law of their own country.  If we make it easier for desirable people resident here to come to our Board and be scrutinised and regarded as suitable, thus making an Irish adoption possible, then that is desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little substance in that argument.  What the Minister is saying, in fact, is that we are trying to induce people to come <Col N="917" /> before our Board but if our Board are not satisfied with them they can take the child and have it adopted under procedure in their own country.  There is no great protection in that.</P>

      <P>When this Act was passed in 1952 after a great deal of thought it was decided there should be some minimum essential conditions.  Among those was the condition that these persons should either be Irish citizens or be in residence here for a period of five years.  This is simply being swept away by the Minister in this Bill and the only qualification so far as either residence or citizenship go hereafter is that at the time the application for adoption is made, the adoptive parents should be in the country.  They can fly in in the morning, make their applications and fly out in the afternoon.  That is the limit of protection so far as residence goes if this Bill goes through unamended and there is nothing at all to prevent the adoptive parents taking the child away the afternoon the adoption order is made.  I cannot see how the Minister can sell that to the House as an improvement.</P>

      <P>I can, of course. Talking about international opinion on this matter&mdash;I am not really putting this forward as a conclusive argument but it is still a factor&mdash;we are the only country in the Council of Europe that has a citizenship qualification.  All other countries are satisfied that it is not necessary and I am satisfied, too that it is not necessary.  When I say people can fly in here, take a child out and have it adopted by the laws of their own country, that is true, but this is a different matter and Deputy O'Higgins will agree with me that if we can make any provision here which will enable suitable persons resident here&mdash;they must be resident, under the 1952 Act&mdash;to adopt a child who would not otherwise be adopted, there is an advantage in that.</P>

We insist that you wait until you have lived here for a year while we carry out our investigation and have adequate evidence, and we are not going to make the order at this point.&rdquo;  Take the situation of foreigners living here for two or three years and who are in a position to satisfy the Board beyond any shadow of doubt that they are suitable to adopt a child and wish to adopt a child under our legal adoption system. Is it not wrong that they should be prevented from doing that and that the Board should be prevented from accepting them as suitable adoptive parents by this technical requirement that they should have lived here for five years?  That is the real argument I am putting forward in favour of this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 7, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>Section 22 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution for subsection (3) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  If the date of the child's birth is unknown, the Board shall determine the probable date of birth and that date shall be entered as the child's date of birth and if the Board subsequently ascertains the actual date of the child's birth, the determination shall be cancelled and the adoption order relating to the child correspondingly amended and if the date of the child's birth is not the date determined as aforesaid, the entry shall be amended.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to clear up a <Col N="919" /> possible defect in the provisions of the 1952 Act which related to the fixing of the date of birth for a foundling or other person whose date of birth is unknown.  The law as it stands enables the board to fix a date of birth in such cases and that date of birth is accepted for all purposes but it is not certain that if the actual date of birth subsequently becomes known the Board are entitled to amend it in the records and authorise the Registrar of Births to amend the register.  The amendment will make it clear the Board have this power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I made clear on the Second Reading, I regard section 7 as another objectionable section in this Bill.  This is the amendment of the Act in regard to interim orders.  The present position is that section 17 of the principal Act, the 1952 Act, deals with interim orders and permits the Board to make an interim order provided the Board are satisfied as to the minimum essential conditions laid down in section 13 of the 1952 Act.  The minimum conditions laid down in section 13 of the 1952 Act are, first, that the applicants should be of good moral character; secondly, that they should have sufficient means to support the adopted child; and, thirdly, that they should be suitable persons to exercise parental rights and duties in respect of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having laid down those minimum essential requirements, if the Board were satisfied they were fulfilled, under section 17 of the 1952 Act the Board could make an interim order in cases where they might have doubts for some other reasons.  They may have doubts with regard to the health, for example, of adoptive parents; they may have doubts with regard to the environment to which the child is being brought, or they may have doubts for a hundred and one other reasons, none of which would be <Col N="920" /> related to failure to measure up to the main standards set out in section 13 of the 1952 Act.</P>
    <P>For any reason apart from those essential main standards, the Board could have doubts and having them, could make an interim order.  What the Minister proposes to do by virtue of section 7 is to allow the Board to make interim orders, notwithstanding that the Board may not be satisfied as to the essential requirements set out in section 13 of the 1962 Act.  I do not think this a desirable departure.  It seems to me it would be far better, if the Minister wanted to amend the 1952 Act in relation to interim orders, simply to provide that the Board should not have any authority to make interim orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins and I may be only repeating the arguments we put to each other on Second Stage.  I have thought about this; I have considered it since, and I am still not prepared to accept that Deputy O'Higgins's doubts and fears on this matter are real.  This seems to be the obvious thing to do.  The whole idea of making the interim order is to afford the child the protection and security of a home while the Board are coming to a decision on some of the aspects of the case.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties is that health itself, which Deputy O'Higgins mentioned, is one of the ingredients of suitability.  From that point of view alone, it seems to me the Deputy should agree that the Board should be entitled to make an interim order. I cannot see what harm it can do.  If we accept that the Board is a responsible body and lives up to its obligations and its duties, then there is no danger whatsoever in endowing them with this power.  In fact, I think it is very desirable we should do so.</P>

      <P>I may be only repeating what was said on Second Stage and knocking my head against a stone wall in trying to convince the Minister, but I believe section 9 also contains a weakening, an undesirable weakening, of the present position with regard to legal adoptions.  The present position is that when a child is being adopted, the local authority must be notified.  That is an accidental provision in relation to adoptions by virtue of the Children Act, 1957.</P>
      <P>The practical importance of this is that once the local authority are notified with regard to the reception of a child in their area, they have the machinery to inspect the home of the adoptive parents.  They know, or are able to ascertain, from their local knowledge the general type of environment and so on.  I can appreciate the argument of the Minister on Second Reading that it is undesirable that particulars of the child's birth and name should have to be furnished. That is one of the requirements at the moment of the Children Act, not of the Adoption Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought all Deputies interested in adoption would have been with me in this matter.  I am afraid there is a certain confusion in the minds of people who quote for us what happens abroad in the matter of child welfare authorities.  In Britain, there is not an Adoption Board, these matters being regulated by the courts. I am not sure what the exact situation is, but I am sure the ordinary machinery the courts have available in England is the making of these inspections by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Here, the child welfare authority concerned is the Adoption Board itself and I think it wrong in principle that the local authority as such should also have a function in these matters.  The concept of adoption is that it is a matter through which the child is settled into the family as a naturally-integrated member of that family, and to encourage some notion that the local authority as such should have some function in what are the private affairs of that family is a misconception of the whole theory of adoption as we see it.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the Adoption Board should have, if they need them, the resources of the local authority, if they wish to avail of them.  The Board will have these resources: they have access to the services of the child welfare offices of the local authorities.  I do not object to that: quite the contrary. What I am concerned with is the suggestion that local authorities have a function as such in regard to adopttion. I think that is theoretically wrong and bad in practice.  It subjects adoptive parents to a system of inspection, not only by the Board which, we all agree, should have a function, but by the local authority.  Why should we inflict this on prospective adoptive parents?  Why should they be subject to this local authority inspection as if they were applying for a housing grant or something like that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do anything here that will make people less inclined to adopt, we are doing a bad thing.  If we subject <Col N="923" /> them to two quite separate systems of inspection, there is a possibility or danger that some of them may say: &ldquo;I am not going to submit to all this inspection.&rdquo;  I think the proper people to do the investigation, or rather, under whose aegis investigations should be carried out, are the Adoption Board.  I should prefer the Adoption Board to have its own skilled and trained staff to do all or most of the work that is necessary.  My aim would be to ensure it has that staff.  If there are some cases in which it wishes to call on additional information or services which the local authority may provide, I am not suggesting that they should not do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see what the Minister is up to, to some extent, but I think he speaks as somebody who has not great experience of local authorities. I may be wrong, but my understanding of his comments is that he is somewhat critical of local authorities having any power of interference in a matter of this kind.  The Minister has suggested that the adoptive parents should not, in any circumstances, be subject to the annoyance or intervention, shall we say, of inspection of a second authority, that the Adoption Board should be the sole body entitled to look after the child's welfare.  Perhaps there is a certain amount of annoyance for the adoptive parents in being subject to the local authority but we should be more concerned with making quite sure of the child's welfare rather than possible annoyance to the parents.</P>
      <P>When the Minister states that the chief welfare authority so far as children are concerned is the Adoption Board, he must ensure that sufficient staff are available to carry out inspections and safeguard the child's welfare. I may be wrong, but my understanding of it is that there are 600 or 700 adoptions per year and if the Minister has two officials attached to the Board, I gather it is impossible to have that function carried out properly with that limited number of officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is serious in curtailing the activities of the local authority and their powers or duties up to this, he <Col N="924" /> must now create a new organisation, with an immense staff, if he is to provide the same safeguarding of children as exists at present under local authority inspection.  He must have a substitute for that and that means a new set of officers, quite a substantial number.  If the Minister is serious and logical, he must do that because of his apparent disregard for local authorities. If the Minister wants that, it is all right. If he is going to assure the House that he will create a new body and give them the necessary staff and make that body responsible in a certain degree to this House, there may be something in what he says, but we cannot have a new group created and let them into action without some responsibility being exercised in this House.</P>
    <P>That responsibility can now be exercised through the local authority. It is very important to have a certain amount of power in regard to investigations. I could not imagine investigations being made directly through a board which was not directly responsible to this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not share the Minister's distrust of local authorities. I think the local authority service, the public health nursing service which is now being extended and is available at the moment, is an excellent service. Why not avail of it and the other excellent services the local authorities provide instead of saying: &ldquo;We do <Col N="925" /> not want the parents to be subjected to inspections by local authorities and we would prefer to have them subject solely to inspectors from the Adoption Board&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>My argument is that you save quite an amount of expenditure from public funds and you get, in addition, the same efficiency in return for the money now expended.  Thirdly, the welfare of the child is being better safeguarded than would be the case under the Minister's proposals, unless he is going to set up the new machinery which I think is necessary.</P>

      <P>It might be as well to refer the Minister to a letter which he apparently got early this month.  I have the cutting here from the <i>Irish Times</i> of 5th December, 1963 and it quotes a letter sent to the Minister by the Joint Committee of Women's Societies and Social Workers.  I understand this Committee represents approximately 19 societies, including the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the Irish Housewives' Association, the Irish Guild of Catholic Nurses, the Church of Ireland Social Service and the Social Study Departments of UCD and TCD.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not make the arguments advanced in it any the weaker.  I shall not read the letter fully, just the relevant portions.  The letter, which was addressed to the Minister, said that the joint committee of Women's Societies would like to place on record their dissatisfaction with the Adoption Bill now before the Dáil.  It said these amendments had been awaited with interest and that they had hoped for more helpful legislation. Then, in relation to Section 9&mdash;I am skipping portion of the letter to make it briefer&mdash;they say their main concern is and always has been with the welfare <Col N="926" /> of the child.  In this respect, they say, the Bill is sadly lacking; in fact, it considerably lessens the protection of the deprived child.  Particularly is this apparent in section 9 which proposes to remove the protection given by the local health authority, that is, the children's officer or public health nurse.  The local authorities had done much to supplement the work of the Adoption Board by contributing local knowledge which is absolutely essential for the protection of children placed in their areas.  It is particularly essential to have this knowledge before the child is placed.</P>
      <P>Then they go on to make the point which the Minister made on Second Reading and which I regard as a good one, that there is objection to requiring particulars of the birth and so on to be furnished to the local authority and in this letter the joint committee accept that argument.  They say:</P>
      <P>The only objection voiced so far is to the necessity for giving particulars of the child to the local authority.  The Committee is of the opinion that this objection can be met by exemption, in placements for adoption, from the requirement to supply name and place of birth of the child; of the greatest importance is the assurance from the local authority adoption worker that the adopters and home are suitable to receive a child with a view to adoption.  Suitable staff to do this already exists.</P>
      <P>They go on with this:</P>
      <P>We do not consider that the Adoption Board is capable of taking over from the local authority this preliminary work, unsupervised by any child welfare authority&mdash;surely it is not within the Board's terms of reference to handle every phase of adoption, but only to enter into the proceedings when placement is an accomplished fact.</P>

      <P>The Board, like a court, must remain independent until the final stage is reached, and the seal of legal adoption is required.</P>
      <P>This is the considered view of a Committee, representative of some 19, or thereabouts, societies, and I do not think that the Minister should shrug it off in that way.</P>

      <P>I do not know who the Minister is tilting at.  All I know is that I saw this letter in the paper.  It seems to me to be a reasonable case and the Minister apparently feels that he should become annoyed because it is referred to here.  The case that is made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Minister reads his Brief properly, he will recognise that the case being made there was in large measure made by me on the Second Reading of this Bill which was a long time before 5th December.  I believe that the case made there by and large is a sound case.  It is the case I made on the Second Reading of the Bill and which Deputy McQuillan urged here this evening.  I think the Minister is making a great mistake if he feels that his proper approach to this is one of arrogantly waiving aside the representation made to him by these ladies and that he is in any way being slighted because the letter appeared in the public press, I think he said, on the same morning as he received it.  That, to my mind, does not justify the Minister in dismissing the arguments which are put up there.  They are certainly arguments which require an answer. <Col N="928" /> I am not at all convinced by the answer the Minister has given so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly not being in any way arrogant in regard to this matter.  I am as anxious as any Deputy in the House to ensure that we do the right thing but I am entitled to look with suspicion on a letter which comes to me and at the same moment as I get it on my desk it is published in the morning newspaper. I think if people are anxious to bring about improvements in this piece of legislation that is not the way to go about it.  I am particularly reinforced in that opinion when I know that I have, previous to the receipt of that letter, endeavoured to explain my position and the reasons for what I am proposing to some of the people concerned. However, that is not really relevant to the discussion.  I think we can decide for ourselves here what is the right thing to do, on the merits of the case.</P>
      <P>I really would have thought Deputy McQuillan would have been with me on this because I know the interest he has in this problem, particularly of the illegitimate child, and how he is anxious, in rural Ireland particularly, that the old stigma and notions in this matter should disappear once and for all.  I think, in favouring the bringing of the local authorities into this matter he is injuring that cause which he himself applauds, because by having to notify the local authority of the placement of the child with adoptive parents you are putting it in a certain class, to which, to my mind, it should not belong.  This had to be done up to now, but even allowing for that, I think you are taking away from the whole notion and concept of adoption by suggesting that these children placed with parents for adoption should be subjected to inspection by the local authority as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully with Deputy McQuillan and Deputy O'Higgins when they say that these trained and skilled people with local knowledge are in the service of the local authority and that the Adoption Board should have access to their services.  If the Adoption Board has not got the staff in any particular instance to carry out a specific inquiry, <Col N="929" /> there is no reason whatsoever why it should not have access to the valuable services which these people can provide. Where I disagree with the Deputies&mdash;I do not know whether I can get this across clearly or not&mdash;is that I believe that the control of inspection should be with the Adoption Board and not with the local authority. There is no reason why children brought for adoption should come under the local authority jurisdiction in any way by notification.</P>

      <P>There is a difference in principle of giving the local authority a standing in this matter as distinct from the Board having access to its services.  I think that is an important difference in principle where the child is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins suggested to me that I was more concerned with the trouble or inconvenience caused to parents and that I should be more concerned with the welfare of the child. I am concerned with the welfare of the child, and I do not want the child to have different categories of people dealing with it.  Adoption is something which is dealt with by the Adoption Board directly with the family concerned.  The Board satisfies <Col N="930" /> itself that the family is suitable and thereafter, as far as any governing agent is concerned, that child is to all intents and purposes a member of that family.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had the opportunity of hearing the Minister on the matter of the adoption of children after they attain the age of seven years except in the special case of children living with parents earlier than that.  I fully appreciate the desire on the part of everybody to promote the adoption of infant children rather than that of children of a relatively mature age but, as I understand it, the Board has a wide discretion in determining the merits of every individual proposal for the adoption of a child.  If, having reviewed all the circumstances they come to the conclusion that in this case adoption is not in the child's best interests, without any reflection on the people desiring to make the adoption, it is open to the Board to say that they cannot give approval to the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So long as that discretion remains with the Board, I find it hard to understand the establishment of a rigid rule, leaving no discretion to the Board, <Col N="931" /> which excludes them from the consideration on its merits of any proposal for the adoption of a child over seven years of age except in the exceptional circumstances mentioned.  Is there some very grave reason against leaving it to the discretion of the Board to provide for the small number of cases which turn up from time to time in which, in the judgment of all prudent people the best interests of a child would be served by being adopted albeit the child is eight, nine, 10, 11 or 12 years of age?</P>
    <P>I have heard of cases where it was suggested that a long relationship existing between adoptive parents and a child of 15, 16, or 17 years of age was sought to be regularised by adoption and it was discovered that the terms of the Act, as it has been and will be, do not permit of that at all.  I recognise this is a matter of considerable delicacy and one which must be proceeded with with the utmost care, but I cannot see any sound reason for withholding this decision from the Adoption Board.</P>
    <P>I can well understand the Minister saying to the Board that if such a discretion is reposed in them that it was the general view, strongly held, that adoption should normally relate to infant children, that it was relatively indifferent up to the age of seven or eight years of age but that there ought to be the gravest reasons before adoption should be completed in the period between seven years and 21 years of age.  I recognise that full weight ought to be given to the desirability of infant adoption and the promotion of that course in so far as it is humanly possible to secure it.</P>
    <P>I think, with the evidence at my disposal, that we are going too far if, by our legislation, we make provision to cover the exceptional case not only more difficult but impossible.  If there are some special reasons of which I am not aware whereby adoption after seven years of age is clearly difficult from the point of view of good administration, in the best interest of the juvenile I would be prepared to agree to a special procedure in which the <Col N="932" /> Board would be enabled to recommend it to a second body whose approval would be required before such adoption would be made.  I do not know if any such extreme precaution is necessary. The Board has acted with great care and discretion so far but if the course I mention is necessary I would not demur.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to hear the Minister give the reasons why our attitude appears to be so implacable against any adoption after seven years of age.  I would be glad to know if he thinks no procedure could be devised which would provide for the exceptional case for adoption after seven years of age which would be in the best interest of the child concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said earlier on this point that I know that different people hold different views about this particular matter.  It is possible for honest people to disagree about the right thing to do.  I am glad that Deputy Dillon agrees with me that infant adoption is the ideal, that in so far as we can ensure it, we should endeavour to see that children are adopted at as early an age as possible.  Some authorities think that the age of seven years is rather too old. My reason for being, as has been said, implacable about the adoption of older children is that I am afraid of doing anything which would endanger the structure of adoption as a whole. All the authorities are agreed that if the age of the child were increased, the risk of failure would increase and failures in any significant number could be disastrous from the point of view of the structure of legal adoption which we have as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, there is the other argument by which I am persuaded more than by any other.  If we open the door for these desirable cases, we do take from the overall impetus there is for people to adopt children while young.  In other words, if people know they can postpone adoption until later, there will not be the same pressure on them and, so far as you would weaken at all the pressure to adopt children as early as possible, then I am against it. As I said here to Deputies, I readily admit that there must be cases in which <Col N="933" /> it would be possible to adopt older children of 14, 15 or 16 with entirely beneficial results.  I went on to say that a lot of Deputies exaggerated the numbers of those&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Very small.  On the whole, it is a question of balance but on the whole it is better not to have those very desirable cases if you are going thereby to weaken the structure of the adoption system.  It is better that <Col N="934" /> we should be, if you like, hard about the matter and say: &ldquo;Very well; but hard cases make bad law and even though in a small number of cases it might be desirable, we should not do anything which will have the effect of injuring the excellent system of adoption which has been built up here over the years.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total number of dentists required to ensure that the teeth of primary school children would be examined once each year, and the total number of primary schools in which dental examination and treatment were completed during the year 1955 to date.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question depends on the type of dental examination envisaged.  If the examination were to be confined to &ldquo;screening&rdquo;, to pick out the children who should be referred to dental clinics for full dental examination and treatment, the number of dentists required would be about twenty.  To examine every pupil once a year for the purpose of recording the state of dental health of each would, it is estimated, occupy the full time of about 50 dentists.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, in many areas the initial examination of children's teeth under the School Health Service is carried out by the medical staff during the course of their medical examination of children in schools. The children found to have defective teeth, the great majority unfortunately, are then referred for dental treatment. It is not the practice in all areas to carry out dental treatment on school premises; in most areas the children are treated at dental clinics.  Consequently, this part of the Deputy's question cannot be answered on the lines requested.</P>
      <P>The following table shows, in respect of each of the years for which figures are available in my Department, i.e. 1956 to 1961, the numbers of school children examined for dental defects and the numbers treated:&mdash;</P>

    <P>*Many children recommended for treatment, after dental examination, do not avail themselves of it.</P>
    <P>Dental decay is so widespread among school children, as has been confirmed by the recent surveys carried out at my request by the dental team engaged by the Medical Research Council of Ireland, that it is beyond the resources of health authorities, in funds and dental personnel, to cope with this grave problem by treatment alone.  For this reason the Oireachtas enacted the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, providing for the fluoridation of public water supplies in Ireland.  When fluoridated water supplies have been in use for some years it is confidently expected, as results elsewhere have shown, that dental decay among children using such water supplies will be reduced by more than one-half.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the School Health Examination Service under Section 19 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that each school child to whom the service applies is examined three times in his national school life, at certain stages during that period as stipulated in the relevant Regulations, it is desirable, although not essential, that each school should be visited annually.  This has not, up to the present, been practicable in the case, e.g. of some of the smaller, more remote schools and to achieve it in all cases would involve employment of some additional medical staff; but as the position would vary from county to county and as, in general, the examinations are carried out by public health medical officers who combine the examinations with other duties, I am unable to estimate the extent of the necessary addition.</P>
