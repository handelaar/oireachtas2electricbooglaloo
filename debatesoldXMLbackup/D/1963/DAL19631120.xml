      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if complaints have been made to the Attorney General on the alleged illegal felling of trees on an estate in County Sligo (details supplied); and, if so, whether legal proceedings are being instituted or otherwise.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether the complaint made by Mr. P.J. Gallagher that trees were felled on 32 acres on an estate (details supplied) for which no felling licence was held, has been brought to the attention of the Attorney General; whether the latter has investigated the matter; and, if so, with what result.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General received a complaint from Mr. Sidney Gallagher and replied suggesting that the complaint should be made to the local Garda authorities, as the Gardaí have the necessary facilities for investigating such complaints.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the reply given in this House by the Minister for Lands on Wednesday last, the 13th instant.  The Minister is the prosecuting authority in respect of offences under the Forestry Act, 1946.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach <Col N="1694" /> aware that Mr. Gallagher did make a complaint to the local garda sergeant and was treated more as a defendant accused than a person laying a complaint, with the result that he had to follow up the complaint to the local sergeant with one to a superintendent?  Would the Taoiseach state if it is intended to institute proceedings on the complaint made by Mr. Gallagher either to the sergeant or the superintendent of the Garda Síochána?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the Deputy's complaint in regard to the garda is correct.  I understand there is a court case relating to the estate down for hearing so that the matter can be described as <i>sub judice.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> asked the Taoiseach if he will state the statistical data on which he based his recent statement that the gap between income and output is now approximately closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The most relevant data are those derived from the quarterly industrial production inquiry. These indicate that between the June, 1958, and the June, 1963, quarters real weekly earnings in Manufacturing Industry increased by 21.8% while output per wage-earner increased by 22.0%.  The corresponding picture in February, 1963, was based on the figures for the September quarter, 1962, which showed a real earnings increase of 20.1% over the September quarter, 1958, compared with an output increase of 17.2%.</P>
      <P>Needless to remark, the Government's attitude does not depend on these statistics alone.  In February, 1963, the realisation that our national growth rate was somewhat lower in 1962 than in the preceding years affected the Government's assessment of the position, indicating caution in the matter of incomes policy.  In recent months it has become apparent that national production has improved this year.  The prospects for next year are also thought to be good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that in the White Paper which the Government submitted to the House <i>Closing the Gap</i>, a diagram appears on page 4 called Diagram No. 1 which has led people to believe that it represented the extent of the gap, and in terms of that diagram, has the gap been closed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a considerable improvement in that regard, although, of course, as the Minister for Finance pointed out in a recent statement, the process of closing the gap was in part secured by an increase in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in suggesting, if we are to believe the gap has been closed and if we are to compare the situation today and the situation last February in terms of the diagram, that the gap, in fact, never existed, that it is a figment of the Government's imagination?  Both the diagram last February and the diagram now cannot be true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement is just nonsensical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Last February, there was presented to this House a diagram suggesting that there was a gap in the terms of the last available figures which are for the June quarter. There is a reduction in that gap of one point, leaving, in terms of that gap, a gap of nine points.  Either the diagram was a falsehood in February or else the statement that the gap has been closed is a falsehood.  Which is the case?</P>

As far as the second part is concerned he is, of course, aware that the extent to which any future increases in salaries and wages will result in an increase in the Consumer Price Index Number depends on the amount of such increases and on the proportion of them which will be absorbed by an increase in national productivity.  It is not possible to make any reliable estimates of such changes in advance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state the reason for the delay in erecting a dispensary at Dundrum, County Tipperary; and if, in view of the grave hardships which people needing the services of a doctor must undergo by remaining outside the dispensary door in inclement weather, he will take immediate steps to have a new dispensary erected which will be adequate for the needs of the doctor and his patients.</P>

      <P>As explained in reply to the Deputy's previous question, the provision of a new dispensary at Dundrum, Tipperary South Riding, is a matter for the local health authority.  I understand that some further delay was experienced by the health authority in obtaining clear possession of the site which held up their advertising for tenders for the work; also when tenders were subsequently received the health authority found it necessary to communicate with the lowest tenderer in order to clarify certain details of his tender. The health authority has decided to accept this tender and is now taking steps to complete the contract formalities for the carrying out of the work.</P>

      <P>The question of filling the vacancy on a permanent basis is linked with the future organisation of a hospital service catering for Longford patients.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not feel justified in approaching the authority to reconsider <Col N="1701" /> their decision.  I understand, however, that they have given alternative temporary nursing employment to the nurse concerned as from the 4th of this month.  This particular nurse, being married, is not eligible for permanent employment.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>A scheme of repairs and improvements has been in progress at St. Otteran's for some years past.  To date, works costing some £33,000 have been carried out under this scheme, while approval has also been given to the carrying out of further works costing about £10,000.</P>
      <P>The health authority have also submitted proposals for a further scheme of improvements to the hospital, including improvements to the mechanical and electrical services and the sanitary annexes, estimated to cost £200,000.  These large scale proposals must be examined in conjunction with a general review of the hospital accommodation in the Waterford area which is at present receiving close attention in my Department.  I hope soon to be in a position to make certain recommendations on the matter to the health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the electrical installations are concerned, I understand that some urgent repair works have already been carried out to these installations so as to render them safe.  I have, however, made arrangements for an engineering inspector of my Department <Col N="1702" /> to visit the hospital this week to determine what further works are essential.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the proposition that the ambulance services in the city of Dublin are inadequate to assist poor persons in need of such services.  I am advised by the Dublin Health Authority that in all cases where an ambulance is requested by a medical officer for the transport of a medical card holder or his dependants to a hospital or clinic, arrangements are made for such ambulance transport free of charge to the patient. As, however, this is a matter for the health authority in the first instance, I would suggest that if the Deputy can adduce evidence that the services are inadequate he should take it up directly with the health authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The health authority sought my approval for the creation of an additional temporary whole-time dentist post to provide treatment and dentures for lower income group adults.  This approval was granted on 30th November, 1962, and in March last, I approved of the appointment of an individual to fill that post.  In the event, this person decided not to accept the appointment.  The vacancy was readvertised last September, but the <Col N="1703" /> authority have not been able to fill it up to the present.  I understand that there is a prospect of an appointment being made early in January next.  The authority have also provided a sum of £1,150 for dentures for adults, in the current financial year, and should be in a position to provide dentures for eligible adults as soon as the additional whole-time dentist assumes duty.</P>

    <P>NOTE:</P>
    <P>(1)  The statement is in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1963.  It contains the net revenue expenditure of the health authorities under the four headings indicated, the amount of grants made from the Hospitals Trust Fund towards capital projects and the payments made by health authorities for capital projects.</P>
    <P>(2)  The revenue expenditure is based on the latest available figures in my Department. Some of these figures are subject to adjustment in the course of preparation of accounts in final form.</P>
    <P>(3)  The expenditures of health authorities on recognised health services qualify for health grant recoupment from the Vote for the Department of Health to the extent of 50%.</P>
    <P>(4)  In addition to the figures shown in the table, payments amounting to £2,235,900 were made from the Hospitals Trust Fund to voluntary hospitals on capital or revenue (deficit) account.  It is not possible to allocate to particular health authorities the relief to their finances which these payments afforded.</P>

      <P>The figure includes the revenue cost of all institutions conducted by health authorities and mental health authorities, the expenditure on capital works in those institutions met either from the funds of the authorities concerned or from grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund, payments made by health authorities for the maintenance and treatment of patients in extern institutions, grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund towards capital works carried out by public voluntary hospitals and grants towards the revenue deficits of such hospitals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 32, 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The Budget estimate of the full year yield from the turnover tax was £10½ million and the cost in a full year of the compensatory social welfare reliefs £4¾ million.  This year the net yield from the tax, when allowance is made for the social welfare reliefs, is estimated at £1½ million.</P>
      <P>The compensatory reliefs granted in the Budget were the maximum that could be afforded having regard to the Exchequer position this year.  The extent to which further compensatory measures may be desirable and practicable will require consideration in the light of the Budget position next year. I cannot, of course, anticipate what next year's Budget may, or may not, contain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of the turnover tax, the increased expenditure this year on <Col N="1713" /> social and economic development could not have been undertaken, there would have been insufficient revenue to finance the public services and, looking to the future, it could have happened that desirable improvements in the social and economic services which were within the country's means could not be financed because the revenue system was lacking in the means to reflect fully the increase in national prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the increases in social welfare benefits which have been granted and which apply only to limited sections are on the basis of the 2½ per cent turnover tax, whereas in fact the tax varies from five per cent to 25 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are granted on a much higher basis.  The 2/6 on the old age pension is more like 7½ per cent or eight per cent.  They vary but they all more than cover 2½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing law exempts from turnover tax sales within the State of plant, machinery, equipment and other materials and substances of a kind in general use by fishermen for the purposes of their occupation.  It is clear from correspondence with the Lifeboat Institution that the great bulk of their purchases within the State will be exempt from tax by reference to that exemption, and there appears to be no need for a special exemption for them in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have under consideration at present <Col N="1718" /> the question of exempting from the turnover tax imports into the State of equipment used by fishermen and I will bear in mind in that connection the special representations which have been made in regard to imports by the Institution.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the serious loss suffered by Dublin manufacturers of children's clothing by reason of frequent delays in the customs clearance of imported materials at Dublin docks, particularly where the goods are for export when processed; and if he will ensure that there will be no further delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiative in relation to the clearance of imported goods through the customs rests entirely with the importer or his authorised agent.  Unless such goods are properly entered and produced, when required, for examination they cannot be cleared by the customs.  As I indicated in reply to a Parliamentary question on 2nd April last I would normally expect the customs examination of properly completed entries for imported goods to be finished within twenty-four hours of their submission by the importers or their clearance agents.  I would not, therefore, anticipate that the customs could be held responsible for any delays of the type referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are at all times anxious to ensure that there are no unnecessary delays, attributable to the customs, in the clearance of <Col N="1719" /> imported goods.  Their efforts to ensure the continued smooth functioning of the customs service would be materially assisted if the Deputy would supply me with particulars of any consignments held up by the customs for reasons which are not apparent to the importers or their clearance agents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the family of the late Senator Vincent have been consulted about the proposal to convert Muckross House, Killarney, County Kerry to a hotel and administrative staff college; if he is satisfied that the proposal is within the terms of the gift of Muckross House to the nation for the enjoyment of the general public; what alternative uses of the house have been considered; and if he will now consider handing over the house to An Óige for use as a youth hostel which <Col N="1721" /> would be in closer accord with the wishes of the donor than another luxury hotel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for finance if he is aware that the handing over of Muckross House to CIE for hotel purposes is causing grave concern to the people of Killarney and Kerry as a whole; and if he will make a comprehensive statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Question Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>I am in communication with a member of the Vincent family regarding this matter.</P>
      <P>The proposal is within the terms of clause 5 of the Preliminary Agreement regarding the transfer of the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park to the State as shown in Part I of the Schedule to the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Act, 1932, and is also covered by Sections 11 and 12 of that Act.</P>
      <P>The following uses for Muckross House have been considered: youth hostel, country residence for the President, convalescent home, dairy instruction centre, domestic economy school, horticulture and forestry institute, retreat house for a religious community, private residence, biological research station, folklore or other type museum, venue for international conferences, liminology centre or hotel training centre.  None of these was regarded as suitable for adoption.</P>
      <P>In 1935 An Óige were given permission to inspect Muckross House but did not make any proposals for using it.  In 1952 An Óige asked for the use of the basement of the house but this proposal was rejected on technical advice.  It is understood that An Óige have been accommodated elsewhere in the area.</P>
      <P>With regard to this matter generally, as already indicated in a statement issued to the Press, no final decision has yet been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Muckross House was donated for the benefit of the public at large, would <Col N="1722" /> the Minister ensure that no commercialisation of that property is undertaken and that it is maintained for the use of the public at large and not reserved for a small section of the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the grounds are concerned, no Minister would hesitate in giving an assurance that they will be maintained for the public at large.  But we are puzzled about what we are going to do with the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This house was donated by the late Senator Vincent as a playground for the people of Killarney, for Ireland and, indeed, for the world.  Is it not a scandalous state of affairs that, after several organisations failed to get Killarney, CIE should come along now?  We are not told, but we know it will be handed over to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly.  An Óige were asked to make proposals, which they did not make.  Afterwards there was some question of their getting the basement.  That was rejected for technical reasons, principally because of fire and a few other things.  I think Deputy Connor will agree that we rejected quite a number of proposals already.  So far as the present proposal is concerned, it is under consideration and we have not decided at all yet.</P>

    <P>The amount of new schemes actually sanctioned to date is £193,306 and the balance of £6,694 is being kept in reserve to deal with especially urgent cases that may arise between now and 31st March, 1964.  All new offers of grants are being issued on the understanding that, even if the contribution is lodged immediately, commencement of the work must be deferred until after 1st April, 1964.</P>

I sent these complaints to the Bacon Commission who had also received complaints from the same sources.

Steps have been taken and decisions have been reached by the Commission which I am satisfied will ease that state of affairs to whatever extent it exists.  I assume, because of the delivery of pigs to bacon factories for some time past&mdash;these were much higher than in previous years&mdash;that the tightening of the position was not anticipated but I feel satisfied that the decisions made by the Commission will rectify any shortage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that parking regulations are having the effect referred to by the Deputy. Section 92 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, provides that where any fair or market is held in any public place within the functional area of the corporation of a county or other borough, the council of a county or an urban district or the commissioners of a town, the corporation, council or commissioners may make such bye-laws as they consider necessary for securing the free passage of vehicular traffic through public roads on the occasion of fairs or markets.  This section is substantially a re-enactment of section 157 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, and therefore involves no significant change in the existing law.  No bye-laws have yet been made by any local authority under section 92 although I understand that some are contemplating such action.

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress last week, I had been discussing possible and desirable developments in the pig industry.  I had shown that no progress has been made over the past couple of years and that, in fact, in certain respects the position had deteriorated.It had deteriorated in that in the areas that would benefit most from this intensive industry, the reduction in numbers has been greatest. In the west of Ireland, the number of pigs now being produced is not much more than half what it was 30 years ago.  The position, fortunately, has altered and it has not altered by accident.For far too long the people engaged in the curing and processing of our bacon products have been allowed to sit back and draw the subsidy, while at the same time doing, as I believe, a very inefficient and very unsatisfactory job in both processing and marketing.  This may not apply to every firm but there was a large measure of inefficiency throughout the industry.  We have arrived at a position now which is fairly satisfactory, where the outlook is fairly satisfactory, and I think no efforts should be spared to secure that increase in production, that improvement in quality that we all would like to see.  I have been assured the outlets are there and that the only unfortunate aspect now is that we are not in a position to meet the demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand some difficulty still exists in regard to selling, a difficulty arising out of the fact that the supplies to various areas in England where we sell bacon is not consistent. Certain areas have become accustomed to getting a particular cure from a bacon factory and as the supplies of bacon to those factories are not consistent, these people cannot get the cure they want and they are not prepared to take any other.  I understand that various ways to meet this <Col N="1746" /> difficulty have been considered and somebody has come up with the suggestion that it will have to be met by centralised buying.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch dealt at some length with the dangers of centralised buying and I must say that, having spent a considerable number of years producing large numbers of pigs, I have the same fears in regard to this monopolised buying, as I would call it.  I have no reason to love the pig dealers because I have had my own difficulties with them.  Nevertheless, competition in the buying of pigs is all important.  A man producing any commodity, be it pigs, cattle, milk, should be free to sell wherever he wishes, wherever he thinks he can get the best price, and to curtail him would be absolutely wrong.</P>
    <P>A solution to this undoubted difficulty should be sought along other lines and I think perhaps centralised selling might overcome it&mdash;centralised selling with a standard of satisfactory curing, because most people realise that there is a great deal of unsatisfactory and unsuitable curing of bacon in this country.  At least we get it on the home market and I feel sure there is a considerable amount of this unsatisfactory product exported as well.  A number of people do not seem to realise we are exporting all Grade A and Grade A Special, and even though we produced as many pigs in October of this year as we ever produced before, the prices are good and the bacon is scarce mainly because the product is improving.</P>
    <P>Before I finished the other evening, I said a lady in the catering business had told me that in a single fortnight the price of gammons had gone up by 100/- a cwt.  I know from my own experience that a very small fraction of that has been passed to the producer&mdash;I would say about 30/- of it. There is certainly somebody profiteering in between.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very bad for the industry and I suggest there should be some investigation into such profiteering just because bacon is scarce. The bacon I speak of is certainly not <Col N="1747" /> Grade A or Grade A Special.  I have outlined various ways in which the industry could be assisted.</P>
      <P>One thing I did not refer to&mdash;I have done so during the year&mdash;is the Minister's failure to provide grants for storage of grain on farms.  It would be very desirable to provide grain storage on the farms.  Barley growing is on the increase and there is a great deal of deterioration in the feeding value of barley, due to indifferent storage. Barley is thrown in every sort of house with resultant considerable loss in its feeding value.  Sometimes there is even total loss or the grain has deteriorated to such an extent that it is dangerous to livestock.  If these grants have been made available to merchants, I cannot for the life of me see why they should be denied to farmers.  It is a further indication of unfair discrimination that should be removed.</P>
      <P>At this stage I should like to correct something in the Official Report which, if I said it at all, I did not intend to say.  It appears in Volume 205 at the top of Column 1679.  I am quoted as saying, in relation to the heifer subsidy:</P>
      <P>I believe the scheme will bring the increase the Minister is hoping for...</P>
      <P>If I said that, I did not intend to say it.  In fact I do not think I said it. What I said was that I did not believe it would bring about the increase in numbers the Minister hoped for, that I was satisfied it would bring about some increase and in fact I want to say that I should be glad to see it bringing about the increase the Minister is looking for.  However, I am satisfied it will not and we have this sort of half-hearted incentive alongside the restriction of the milk levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot, for the life of me, reconcile the two things and unless the milk levy is removed, it is a restriction on production and, as I have said repeatedly, all restrictions on production should be removed in order to give the farmers confidence to go ahead in the assurance that the more they produce, the better everybody will like it and in order that the price will remain constant <Col N="1748" /> and that an assured outlet will at all times be available.</P>
    <P>I have not referred to sheep, and I do not think the Minister referred to them.  He may have, in a passing way, and even in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> only a very passing reference is made to sheep.  It is very hard to understand that because we pay no subsidy towards the export of sheep.  In fact the industry is not subsidised at all.  The only subsidy I am aware of is the small finishing subsidy in the hill areas.  I am aware also that a small amount of breeding and research is being done by the Agricultural Institute and I believe that in this branch of the agricultural industry, there is considerable room for more interest, more enthusiasm and more expansion.</P>
    <P>I think it would benefit many areas where farmers have poor land.  I know efforts are being made to improve this land but a general improvement in the industry would add a lot to our export business as a whole.  In regard to encouragements, the Minister will have to face up to the fact that something must be done about prices.  If we are to encourage production, to get the production we all hope for, we must be realistic about prices and in this respect we might well take an example from the British who have an annual review of prices, costs of production and increases in industrial prices generally.  There is also an annual adjustment in Britain.</P>
    <P>It would be much more satisfactory here, instead of having a flareup about different commodities at different times of the year and an unseemly and ugly clamour.  It would be far better if the Minister fixed a date every year for a general review of farm prices. In every other industry, there are adjustments, year in, year out, and we are now looking forward to the ninth round increase in wages for industrial workers.  There was no question about farm prices, and about the case for raising prices in agricultural production just as in every other sphere of business in the country.  Still the prices of the various commodities are to be pegged down.  This is an unreasonable approach, and a different attitude will <Col N="1749" /> have to be adopted towards it if we are to get any enthusiasm or any increased production.</P>
    <P>Considerable improvements have come about in the marketing of both bacon products and milk products. The one thing I feel about it is that advertising is a very expensive business. It is absolutely necessary, but in a small country like this with limited resources it should be approached in a joint effort between Bord Bainne, the Pigs and Bacon Commission, the Sugar Company and the co-operatives. It is difficult to see how the same purpose could not be achieved while very considerably reducing the costs.</P>
    <P>Agricultural education is something that we all should be interested in.  I have no statistics as to the numbers going forward for agricultural degrees in the various branches of agricultural education, but one thing that strikes me is that whatever way the teaching of graduates is done there is one aspect which is sadly neglected.  From time to time over the years, I have interviewed quite a number of agricultural graduates, sometimes after they have been out for some time.  They are not educated up to selling their advice.  They cannot even sell themselves to an interview board.  That is a serious drawback.  Another thing I have found is that if you put a simple question to some of those people a large percentage of them will not be able to deal with it though it is a problem with which an agricultural adviser will be confronted every day of the week.</P>
    <P>You ask him to take an ordinary family farm of 45 or 50 acres.  You tell him that it is reasonably good land and ask him if he was free to make his own decisions how he would make a maximum income from it&mdash;what lines he would consider most profitable on a farm of that size; if he kept cows how he would try to keep down the cost of milk production, and what would be the most economic ration; and the same for pigs.  It would amaze and disappoint the Minister if he met some of these men and confronted them with that type of problem.  The answers would be surprisingly poor. I do not know why this is so because <Col N="1750" /> there are a lot of very able graduates coming there.  These people have just not been able to get down to making that sort of hard calculation that is so very necessary.  We have so many farms throughout the country where for one reason or another the farmers are not making the incomes they should and could make.  Our graduates going out to advise them should be able to look into their farms and give sensible and worthwhile advice, analyse the situation and decide what is wrong&mdash;is it finance, lack of information or following the wrong lines which is the problem?  I do not think that many of our graduates are capable of doing that, and they should be educated up to it.</P>
    <P>Something started during the year on which the Department ought to be congratulated is the home economics courses.  As everybody knows, the poultry industry has flopped rather badly.  Poultry instructresses certainly have nothing like the volume of work they had to do heretofore because the numbers in poultry are not there.  It was a very wise move to send some of these instructresses on the home economics courses, because the type of advice that can be provided from these courses on the conditions in the home will prove very valuable, indeed, in the years to come.</P>
    <P>There was an announcement during the year that certain changes were taking place in committees of agriculture.I have been a member of a committee of agriculture for some time and I see no change.  A change is desirable because I do not think we are getting the maximum out of our committees of agriculture and our agricultural advisers.  It is a very valuable service because it is organised on a national scale.  There is not enough contact between the Department and the committees of agriculture regarding policy.  There is a lot of routine calling done every day by agricultural advisers that is of very little value.  It would be far better if the Department decided on a certain line, that they wanted to plug some particular aspect of the industry, if they were more in contact with the committees of agriculture and asked them <Col N="1751" /> to co-operate in plugging this particular line and drop most other things. By doing this we would get results which we are not getting now.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with the method of electing or selecting members of these committees.  It is a very difficult thing to change and improve.  It is very difficult to decide who should be included or debarred, but we do not always get the best people.  We do not even get the biggest percentage of the best people.</P>
    <P>I have a note here about mink, because there is no aspect of the agricultural industry that we can afford to overlook and neglect.  Wherever it is possible to make money we should work to get people interested in it.  I am very glad to see that in the last year or so the Department of Agriculture has taken an active interest in mink production.  I recently met a Finn who came over, and I discussed the mink industry with him in his own country.  Finland has a population somewhat similar to ours.  Their cattle numbers are about one-third of ours and they cannot afford to export any cattle.  The waters around Finland are frozen for the best part of six months of the year.  They are producing 800,000 mink per annum, and in the last year, we pelted 15,000 mink.</P>
    <P>In a country such as this where we should have a very sizeable fishing industry, where we have a considerable amount of cattle and sheep offal from the slaughtering that takes place, and where we have even a fair amount of chicken and turkey offal from the broiler business, all that raw material should be organised and sold through mink.  In Finland of course, it is all an export business and it would be an export industry here, too.  To them, it is worth about £5 million per annum.  I believe it could be about the same in this country if it were properly organised and promoted.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most aspects of the Department of Agriculture that occurred to me.  However, there is one other point in relation to milk production.I have a cutting here from the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of Saturday <Col N="1752" /> October 12th, 1963, where Mr. A.J. O'Reilly, Manager of An Bord Bainne says:</P>
    <P>Unless there is a considerable rise in milk production in the coming year, certain market commitments already entered may well go unhonoured in 1964.  This is something which we would wish to avoid.  It is something which might allow us be labelled quite unjustly as a nation not interested in the long-term investment but preferring the short term gain.  World market intelligence suggests that the existing buoyancy in dairy production may continue during 1964.</P>
    <P>Rather than fall down on supply, it might be preferable&mdash;while, as I said, removing the milk levy and in that way giving a further incentive to milk production &mdash; to slow down on the removal of reactors from the remaining countries.  The Minister said in the course of his speech that he expected to remove 100,000 cows in the coming year.  Even if that were reduced by half it would mean a considerable extra quantity of milk until we get an opportunity of building up.  Coupled with this there would have to be an increase in the price of milk.</P>
    <P>In the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> we expected a fairly considerable increase in cattle numbers and we did not get it.  That is blamed on the eradication of bovine TB but when we made this provision, we knew we had this job of eradication to do. In the course of his speech, the Minister referred to the starting of a scheme for eradicating brucellosis.  That is another problem that is likely to have the effect of removing a large number of cows from the herds in the country. In view of all these things, the Minister should given careful consideration both to the removal of the levy and even to an increase in the price of milk at an early date.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to ask the Minister to remove all restrictions on production and to cease talking about difficulties and uncertainties.  There should be no talk about surpluses.  If there are marketing difficulties, we should concentrate on finding solutions for them. The Minister should do everything <Col N="1753" /> possible to create a spirit of confidence and optimism in agriculture.  If he decides to give the farmers a fair share of the national income, he will get the production he wants because I do not believe the farmers have ever let the country down if they have been given a fair chance themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right for a Deputy to call for an increase in the price of milk and milk products but when the Deputy or his Party are called upon here to vote extra money for the farmer they usually go into the wrong lobby.  I do not see much point in calling on a man to increase his production if we are not prepared to pay for it.  It must be remembered that, due to the factor which has entered into the marketing of milk and milk products, the price is largely regulated by the House, to that extent it is pointless to say to the Minister that he should automatically encourage an increase in the price of milk and at the same time have the Parties opposite to us in this House charging us with putting up the cost of living.  We can all agree with Deputy Clinton that if we had a market which would absorb all our milk and milk products at an economic price, then we would have no difficulty whatever in meeting the farmers' demands in that regard.</P>
      <P>I want to touch on a few of the points with which Deputy Clinton dealt.  This is a very important Vote, the Vote which covers mainly the activities of the farming community, mainly the activities of our farmers producing not only for the home market but also the export market.  We have included in this Vote a Supplementary Estimate for an increase of £1.35 million in aid of creamery milk prices and to that extent the Minister and, indeed, this Government can claim to have a consistent record in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate for this Department shows an increase of roughly £5 million over and above the previous Estimate and that is no mean achievement.  The total amount which will be redistributed, if you like to describe it that way, in this year will amount to something in the region of £39 million. <Col N="1754" /> Having regard then to the extent of our national income and the amount which we may expect to earn in the years ahead from our exporting activities, it is no mean sum.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputies to talk about what Britain will do.  Britain is in a totally different position from this country.  The British are not able to supply the home market.  We are an exporting country of primary products.Britain is an importing country and therein lies the difference.  Britain has a huge industrial population on which to levy the wherewithal to pay the farmer for his production.</P>
    <P>In our circumstances then, we have to provide for the home market at a level which the consumer will be able to absorb and, at the same time, to provide as much of our produce as we can for the export market at a competitive price.  That means that the Government have to go to the taxpayer to produce the wherewithal to make our primary produce competitive in the British market.  All authorities now agree that the British market is a &ldquo;dump&rdquo; market and that we are in the unfortunate position, not being in the European Community or with any great prospect of getting in there in the near future, of having to sell the bulk of our produce in Britain.</P>
    <P>To support my argument, I would go back to the Budget of this year.  The proposals in the Budget made provision, subject to our ability as an importing country, to promote not merely exports of our primary produce but of industrial goods as well.  I would like to go back to a little paragraph in the speech of the Minister for Finance when he said that it is clearly right that the State should directly and indirectly increase the volume of investment and do everything in its power to promote as rapidly as possible such a growth of our economy as can be sustained without undue strain on the balance of payments.  That brings us back to the point that we always have to have regard to the difference between our imports and our exports.</P>
    <P>Last week, Deputy Donegan ignored the positive side of our programme, the Government's intention to promote <Col N="1755" /> and encourage growth.  If he wants evidence of that, we have it in this Estimate, evidence not merely of growth in output and income but of a general broadening of the methods of marketing our primary produce. Not long ago, I heard Deputy Norton referring here in a cynical manner to our sales of butter abroad.  He seemed to infer in his speech that stocks of butter should be allowed to accumulate here at home regardless of the consequences.I noted, however, that one little point which Deputy Norton overlooked was that trade is not a oneway street.  That clearly denotes that we have to recognise the fact that we must export goods in order to import them.</P>
    <P>We know that in this regard in present conditions it is a battle in every market between the countries who sell milk and milk products.  The battle goes on all the time to see who will secure a grip on the market and hold on to it.  I submit to the House that it is gratifying enough, in our limited circumstances, to be able to record increased sales of butter and an increased price for butter in the foreign market.  The price of butter rose from £262 per ton to roughly £335 a ton in the outside market last year.  That figure of £335 per ton was an increase over and above that which we received the year before.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, Deputy Donegan or any other Deputy may decry the aim of selling more butter, especially the aim of selling it in the export market at a better price, but will either of them find more money elsewhere? If there are other markets available, will they be able to find a better price for milk and milk products?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy.  I was trying to develop the point that we sold a certain amount of milk and milk products, and we gained about £17 million for the national income.The Minister must be given every credit for his faith in the dairy industry, not merely now but in the past, because if we had not a past in this regard, we would have no future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £6,018,000 marks the Government's co-operation in helping creamery milk prices, which assures a market for the farmer who knows that he may look forward to a market which will provide an outlet for at least 27,000 tons of butter.  If we are up and <Col N="1757" /> doing as other countries are, we should be able to expand on that figure in the years ahead.  In passing, it is no harm to refer to creameries because this whole matter of marketing, especially of dairy products, is based on the creamery industry.  We are all well aware that a viable and efficient creamery industry is of prime importance.As far as lies in our power, we should see that the industry is supported by all the aids and techniques about which we hear so much from progressive dairying countries.  The report on milk and milk products and the creamery industry generally was issued in or about 1961.  The report recorded a number of shortcomings in our dairy industry.  I submit that it is not much use having a committee of experts produce a report, having spent a good deal of time going into all the details, and then paying no advertence to it in our subsequent discussions.</P>
    <P>One of the conclusions in the report was that the standards of the creameries should be raised.  That of course is not solely a matter for a Government because the creameries are engaged in processing milk, which can be deemed to be a business.  This is the age of what we might call cutthroat competition and it behoves the creamery industry to study the report and to conform so far as it is possible with its findings, or at least to the extent to which the limited resources of the creameries will permit.  That is not asking too much.</P>
    <P>We all know that due to our reliance on the British market, up to a few years ago, for an outlet for milk and milk products and due to several other factors, the Government have had to take a hand in dealing with milk and milk products.  Down the years it has become the fashion not to refer to inefficiency&mdash;that would be the last thing to do&mdash;but to blame the Government.The Government have wide shoulders and can bear any criticism. Without advertence to the Government, it is not beyond the ability of creameries to raise their standards a little and in that regard they might consider laying down some rules for priority of milk supply.</P>
    <P>First, if possible, creameries might consider the introduction of a system <Col N="1758" /> of payment for milk on the basis of butter fat content and purity.  Grading would also enter into this.  A premium should be paid in respect of grade and purity.  It might not be a very big thing; but if we are to continue to be producers for export of milk and milk products, there will have to be more concentration on these matters.</P>
    <P>The basis of milk here is summer grass.  The present Minister has encouraged the use of early and late grass.  By subsidising fertilisers, he has also brought about a general raising of standards in grass production.  Hand in hand with that should go an attempt to separate the various grades of milk. If we accept the idea of paying a premium for purity and grade, we should also be prepared to accept the idea of a reduction for bad milk.  Yet we never hear about that when we talk about the price of milk, dried milk, butter, cheese, chocolate crumb and other milk products.  Because the Government are so heavily involved in these matters, we blame the Government.We must get out of that idea if we are to survive as a primary producer in the English and European markets.  A drive by creameries against the producers of low grade and bad milk is long overdue.  They should be made realise they have an obligation to preserve the good name of Irish milk and milk products not merely on the home market but on the British market as well.  I do not believe anyone could seriously disagree with that.</P>
    <P>As a support to dairying in general, we have recently had an increase in farm building grants.  Grants are now readily available for the erection of first-class shelters for cows.  In addition, there are grants for the installation of water supplies.  Therefore, there should be no excuse now for lowering standards.</P>
    <P>Creameries here have been very slow to create any sort of service for the farmer.  They nearly had to be pushed into the extension of services.  They were slow to adopt any sort of advisory service.  It is my opinion from some experience in this matter that creameries could do much more to spread the idea of water supply grants <Col N="1759" /> and the advantages of having good cow byres and good housing with a water supply laid on.  They should also be encouraged to study methods of cooling milk.  There should be no holding back in that regard because a scheme of loans is available for the installation of first-class cooling equipment.</P>
    <P>In parts of the country, we are sticking to the outworn methods which obtained here 80 or 100 years ago. We see people jogging along the road in ass carts with one or two cans of milk.  If creameries mean to stay in business, they should study multi-can haulage and, indeed, the composition of the creamery can.  Bulk collection should be studied by those creameries which aspire to be central creameries. I am not talking for the creameries; in the last analysis, I am talking for the consumers.  Instead of cynically criticising us for trying to find markets for butter, it would be better for the Labour Party to say to the consumer: &ldquo;We can all take a hand in this matter &mdash;the farmer, the labourer and the consumer.&rdquo;We can only do that by encouraging creameries to have better methods of processing milk and milk products at lower costs.</P>
    <P>To give the creameries their due, they were always faced with a problem here because of the fact that the processing of milk is largely dependent on the summer production of milk.  That often causes difficulties in handling and cooling.  An effort on the part of producers would help, an effort to husband and promote earlier and later grass.</P>
    <P>It may be an abstract point but I think it bears directly on milk production: one is amazed by the lack of shelter on most dairy farms.  We hear about water supplies, farm grants, grass and so on, but never about providing a shelter belt.  I submit that a judicious scheme of planting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advocating it because it might save public money. We spend a lot on farm building grants and I suggest that with our climate, except in a very bad year, many animals could be kept comfortably in the open and so it is worth the while of any farmer who may be considering buildings, getting loans and seeking grants, to consider shelter belt plants for his farm.</P>
      <P>I should say in passing that I have never felt the management of creameries concentrated their whole energies or abilities on the producer purely.  I knew a number of creameries to start production and within a month instead of trying to help the producers directly, they were engaging, perhaps, in distribution.That is not the purpose for which we promote creameries.  I think they could solve our problem much more quickly if they concentrated solely on production.  They have an advisory service, not only from the Department but also from the IAOS, and any creamery in doubt about their ability to process milk in a first-class manner can call in a consultant, secure in the knowledge that they will get a grant for that.  Creameries should not be slow to avail of that advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a suggestion in the report that we have too many small creameries.  That is true.  If we look to the future and want to hold on as economic producers of milk, we should do all in our power to encourage smaller creameries to combine with larger units because if the larger ones find it hard to process milk economically, the smaller unit is bound to have greater difficulty in that respect.  Also, we have never tried very hard to see what we could do further to improve the flavour and texture of our butter. The Danes, the New Zealanders and <Col N="1761" /> the Poles all go into this aspect of butter and it is a matter of national pride for them to think their butter is the best on the market.  We should like to think as Irishmen that we can sell butter as good as these people ever produced.  It is up to ourselves to take action.  Time is passing and the old habit of blaming the Government for every drawback and disadvantage should be ended.</P>
    <P>The report also suggested that we should consider a brand mark for creamery butter.  The report made a further point which I thought was very good, that butter sold in rolls might be cut and made up on the creamery premises.  It also said, and one can endorse its findings, that the courses for teachers in University College, Cork, might be extended to include a larger range of subjects with provision for revised and short courses for creamery managers and sub-managers every three years.  Education is in the news and it is my submission, as it was the submission in England not very long ago, that we need education at the lower levels just as badly as we need it at the higher levels at the present time.  From that point of view, one can agree with the argument that the diploma course in dairy sciences is not broad enough.  With the best will in the world, creamery managers have not the facilities they should have for a little study and research.  I have done enough, I think, to show that creamery milk production is not just the song and dance Deputy Clinton, Deputy Donegan, Deputy Norton and others would have us believe.  There is a little more to it than meets the eye.</P>

      <P>Deputy Clinton referred to selling produce.  We might, I think, consider certain aspects of that problem.I agree with Deputy Clinton that we should use the best of the personnel in the IAOS, the creameries and the semi-State boards, which we have established, to push sales of primary products abroad.  We should pool the resources of these concerns and use them to ensure that they concentrate not merely on the export market but also on the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1762" /> We know from past experience and from more recent experience that farmers can increase production at a very rapid rate.  There is no doubt about that.  Production can be doubled in a short time.  Production is, of course, contingent on market prospects.  We should consider, therefore, all aspects of marketing.  We have gone beyond the economic science of the past when supply and demand ruled the roost. Every country now has marketing boards, not merely for the export market but for the home market as well.  In the past, farmers were asked to produce in the dark.  Having produced, they very often found themselves caught in a glut either on the home or the export market.  The bottom fell out of the market and there was despondency, indecision and fear.  At other times there was a scarcity and it was scarcities which earned for us the name of marginal suppliers on the British market.  That is the worst name one can get in markets now and that is why the Government use support devices to keep our products on the British market to ensure that in two or three years' time we shall not be deemed to be marginal suppliers and be the first to be kicked out of the market when goods become plentiful.  I could go into this in great detail but I do not wish to delay the House.</P>
    <P>I should like, in conclusion, to refer to the great success the Minister has had, in co-operation with the farmers, in his campaign to eliminate tuberculosis from our cattle stocks.  Today, he is reporting progress to the House and that progress denotes the degree of reliance he placed in the officers under his control, officers who served him and the country very well.  The scheme was very successfully operated.  Reactors were removed with the minimum of dislocation.  Disputes were kept at a very low level.  The Minister may feel assured now that he has the thanks of the community for the way in which his Department worked hand-in-hand with the farmers in wiping out this horrible disease from our cattle stocks.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note he intends to proceed now with the elimination of another scourge in our cattle herds. It is good to know we are keeping up <Col N="1763" /> with the best.  It is good to know that consumers in foreign markets are learning that quality counts in the end-product, whatever it may be, we put into those markets.  I am grateful that our foundation stock, our dairy shorthorns, are fit to stand beside the best cattle in Europe.  Indeed, I think time will show that our shorthorn cow is the best cow in Europe.  Anyone who wants to learn may do so through the medium of the beef tasting competition held in England a short time ago.  It will be generally recognised ultimately that the best beef on the market is grass-fed beef.  It is beginning to be recognised now that the best egg on the table is the egg of the ranch-fed hen.  The consumers in the British and other markets will come around to the way of thinking that quality counts and in the long run they will be prepared to pay a little extra for good quality.  I hope we shall be able to deliver the goods.</P>

      <P>I was amazed when I read the notes under the heading &ldquo;Main Activities of the Department.&rdquo; I was doubly amazed by the Minister's statement that agricultural profits have gone up by roughly £4 million. I wonder in what aspect of agriculture profits have increased to that extent? My main concern is with tillage.  My personal experience and that of my neighbours in north Tipperary is that tillage has declined, both in respect of acreage and price.  I should be pleased to have some indication from the Minister as to the basis for his figures showing that farmers are making a vast profit.  I believe that the Minister had in mind the big rancher with the huge herds and broad acres.  As far as the tillage farmer is concerned, I can prove by the Minister's figures that prices for barley, wheat and oats have decreased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1948, farmers in north Tipperary were paid at the rate of 44/6d. a barrel for feeding barley and 49/8d. for malting barley.  In 1949, the price went down to 39/- for feeding barley and increased to 56/10d. for malting barley.  In 1951, the prices were: feeding barley, 53/2d; malting <Col N="1764" /> barley, 78/8d.; in 1953, feeding barley, 48/4d., malting barley, 55/-; in 1954, 39/4d. for feeding barley, 61/- for malting barley; in 1955, 40/4d. for feeding barley, £3 0s. 4d. for malting barley; in 1956, 42/- for feeding barley, 59/- for malting barley; in 1957, 39/10d. for feeding barley, 59/- for malting barley; in 1958, £2 0s. 2d. for feeding barley, 53/2d. for malting barley.  This year, for feeding barley, the farmers were paid 37/- and out of that there is a deduction for sack hire and haulage.  Some years ago these deductions were not made from the price paid to farmers supplying millers.  For malting barley this year the price is 53/-.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's statement that farmers are better off to the tune of £4 million, the figures I have given show that the income of tillage farmers has dropped substantially in the period 1947 to 1963.  In regard to the price paid for feeding and malting barley, the tillage farmer has experienced a drop.  Therefore, such farmers must be excluded from the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>Farmers in north Tipperary are very concerned because they have to grow malting barley on contract and they find that the persons issuing the quotas for the contract are also the buyers of the barley not grown under contract, with the result that a farmer could have a quota for 40 to 80 barrels of malting barley and could have 20 to 30 barrels of that barley left over after filling his contract.  The price paid for malting barley is 53/- a barrel and the price paid for the remainder is 37/- a barrel.  I cannot prove but I have reason to believe that all the barley goes down the same chute.  I should like to see some control exercised by the Minister in relation to quotas and the buying of barley.</P>
    <P>I was not greatly surprised to see that the wheat acreage has declined substantially.  The Rank organisation is closing down various flour mills of which they have gained control.  They closed some mills last year.  The workers were guaranteed alternative employment or a gratuity.  It amazes me that people should stand up in this House and say that the reason the Rank organisation were buying those <Col N="1765" /> mills was that the Irish people were eating less flour.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of closing down flour mills would be a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out that there was a reduction in the wheat acreage of about 82,000 acres and indicating to the Minister what I believe is the cause of that reduction.</P>
      <P>Those who say that the Irish people are eating less flour are hiding their heads in the sand.  Every person who leaves this country represents one mouth less to feed and we have had this mass emigration down through the years under successive Governments. That, in turn, leaves us with fewer people to consume the flour.  We have been told the reduced consumption of flour has been caused by the raising of the standard of living.  I do not think I need point out that bread is the staple diet of the average working man throughout the country.  The big gentry, as I might call them, are not great bread eaters because they have their big dishes, their big fries, but bread still remains the staple diet of the working people, and they are off to England to find work.  That is why our flour consumption has been falling.</P>
      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has told me I may not discuss this, and I intend to make only a passing reference to it, important though it may be.  I believe it is wrong to give control of the wheat and the flour industry to one group of people.  It is very dangerous that one group, such as the Rank group, should completely control the flourmilling industry.  It could lead to a very dangerous situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's <Col N="1766" /> particular attention to the oats situation.The acreage was down by about 6,000 this year.  That does not seem so much, but in relation to our average production, it is something we should try to remedy.  I cannot pay any compliments to the Minister or his predecessor for the small acreage of oats we have had over the past number of years.  They have been rather generous and off-handed in the matter of giving import licences for foreign oats.  We have been told that it is impossible to make oatmeal from Irish oats and that a horse cannot win a race unless he is fed on foreign oats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not feed even their horses on Irish oats if they could get the foreign stuff.  I think the Minister should come down strongly on that, that he should stop the importation of foreign oats by these horse breeders, trainers and hunt people.  He would be doing a far better job of work on behalf of the tillage farmers than he has so far been doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, I was a very strong believer in farm mechanisation, whether in the form of tractors or combines.  As a younger man, I never believed that more machinery on the <Col N="1767" /> farms would mean fewer workers. Time has taught me to reverse my views on that.  I realise now that for every machine we put on a farm, we send away not one but two or three men to the country from which the machine has come.  The majority of the 74,000 people leaving the land in this country come from the tillage areas because we all know that very few are employed by the grassland ranchers. All they employ is a man and a dog each, and more often than not, the dog is not even licensed.  It is the tillage farmers who give the employment, and consequently when the price of our tillage produce falls, the rate of emigration from the tillage areas mounts.  It is this that is leaving us with fewer agricultural labourers and farmers' sons.</P>
    <P>When it was first announced, I was most interested in the Minister's heifer scheme, but since I have studied the scheme more closely, I find that though it may be of some small assistance to small farmers, it will also do them some harm.  When I heard the scheme announced on the radio, I wondered if it were not aimed solely at the big cattle man.  The average small farmer has not got the land to carry a big surplus of stock.  All he can afford to keep are two or three cows for their milk.  He may keep their calves until they are yearlings.  He might be able to keep on two or three heifers for replacement of his herd, but that would be the very most.  After doing that, they still must have the ways and means of carrying them, if it is only for the £15 grant.</P>
    <P>When a cow drops a calf, the Minister will be actually giving to a certain type of farmer £15.  The dropped calf will be another £15 and if he puts the cow on the market straight away, he can get away with it.  The Minister tells us that these additional heifers have been added but what he means by that I do not know.  I still say that this is a good scheme but I hope it is not allowed to get into the wrong hands. A certain number of the big ranching people will cash in on it, with the result that the small farmer, as in <Col N="1768" /> everything else, will get a very small share of it.</P>
    <P>I will refer very briefly to pigs because other speakers have referred to them in more detail.  To name local towns, you go into Borrisokane and pigs are £7.15.0. a cwt.  In Nenagh they are £8.5/- on the same day.  You go back to Templemore and they are £7.12/- maybe with buyers from the same factory.  You cannot expect the Minister to send inspectors around finding out the prices, but it would be good if a fixed standard price could be arranged or notified in the papers. I know that prices are notified in the papers but they are deadweight prices and the average country person is selling by live weight.  The Minister can do very little about this and possibly the farmers themselves are to blame.  There should be some small control so that the average farmer will know exactly what the prices will be on different weeks.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that tillage prices have been getting worse and we are getting smaller prices today than for a number of years.  The silver lining to that dark cloud is beet.  I would like to pay tribute to Lt.-General Costello for the way he is managing, working and meeting the farmers' representatives.  The tillage farmers would be in a very bad way but for the beet crop.  Our tillage acreage of wheat, barley and oats would be very low but for the way the average farmer is now getting into the beet, because beet, even though you have to work very hard at it and you earn every penny you get from it, is the crop that is paying the farmer better than any other tillage crop.  The result is that a vast number of people are growing beet and it is only natural that they have to sow in rotation other grain crops of oats, barley and wheat.  But for the prices we have been getting for beet for a good few years, the acreage under wheat or barley would be down much more than it is.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has any control of this, but the growers of beet are entitled to a substantial increase per ton on the price at the present time.  The time has come when they <Col N="1769" /> are entitled to a fair return.  Lt.-General Costello is meeting the farmers' representatives very well and I hope that when the Beet Growers' Association make their case to him, he will find that it is a good one.</P>
    <P>Regarding land reclamation, we find in north Tipperary, and apparently it is happening all over the country, that when you make an application for land reclamation, you are more or less put on a waiting list.  You may plan only to clear a couple of acres and get them ready by a particular time to plough, till and so on, but by the time you are reached on the waiting list, it has gone beyond that.  I should like to see a reversion to the arrangement of some years ago, whereby, if a contractor were doing reclamation work in your area, you could get him to do your work as well.  That worked very satisfactorily.  I do not know whether the idea of the waiting list was that too many people were looking for land reclamation and the Department wanted to slow it down.</P>
    <P>There is one other point in this connection.  I do not know whether the Minister can rectify it.  There are some places in my area where a number of farmers were very anxious to carry out land reclamation in the cleaning up of a river but found that one person, perhaps living at the very far end, at the outlet, could hold up the whole scheme.  It is very hard to overrule any objection straight off but it is wrong if 100 or 200 acres of land are to go bad through swamping for the sake of perhaps a small garden that would be flooded.  I am not saying that the Minister should have power to compel the scheme to be done but perhaps he could look into the matter.</P>
    <P>There is another question which I am sure other speakers will go into very fully, that is, the question of the Agricultural Wages Boards.  There is great dissatisfaction with the way they are operating. It is ridiculous in 1963 to expect agricultural workers to try to exist and rear a family in any decency on the wages allowed to them.</P>
    <P>We have had circulars regarding the eradication of warble fly.  We in north <Col N="1770" /> Tipperary are wondering if the Minister could give us a headline on that.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that the attitude of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in declining to supply important information to Deputies as to the activities of Telefís Éireann is contrary to the assurances given by the Minister during the debate on the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959; Dáil Éireann, therefore, calls on the Government to arrange that all reasonable information will be supplied by the Minister to Deputies when requested.&mdash;(Deputy Corish.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last night this motion was discussed, I pointed out that in regard to questions in this House about the Television Authority, it was a waste of time trying to elicit facts because either the questions were ruled out before they got to the Minister concerned or, where the Minister did get the limited number of questions which passed through a screening process, he then blandly pointed out that he had no function in the matter and referred Deputies to the Television Authority for further information.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish and other speakers said here that the public as taxpayers and as licence payers to the Television Authority are entitled to information on its running and are certainly entitled, through their representatives, to a certain amount of respect from the officers or the people who control Telefís Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a body like this was set up by this House, it was not intended that they were to live and operate from an ivory tower as completely independent of public opinion as if they lived on another planet.  It would appear that they have taken unto themselves the belief that they are supermen and are aping the Mickey Mouse pictures which they show on <Col N="1771" /> their screen.  I am afraid it has gone to the head of the members of this Authority and I blame the Government for allowing that position to arise.</P>
    <P>Some people may argue that the Government are leaning over backwards, through the provisions of the Act, to ensure that as far as the public are concerned, there is no interference by the Government with the running of the television institution.  In relation to the Acts of this House, it would appear that such is the case, that the body is independent but, as is the case with other State or semi-State bodies which are by Act supposed to be independent, the Government have taken the backdoor method of exercising control.  The simple way it is exercised is: pass the legislation first making the body independent and then proceed to place in the controlling body of that organisation your own nominees.</P>
    <P>That is what has happened in the Television Authority.  The Government appear to be out of the picture but behind the scenes, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or any other Minister can take up the telephone and exercise as much control over the running of Telefís Éireann as if he were a member of the Board itself, because the Government have put one of their key Party nominees on to the controlling body of Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out here the other night&mdash;and I was quoted incorrectly in the papers &mdash; with reference to various items of controversy that appear to have been kept off Telefís Éireann: &ldquo;When Eddy says no, it's curtains for the show.&rdquo;  I was misquoted in the papers as saying: &ldquo;If Kevin says no, it is curtains for the show.&rdquo;  In fairness to whoever Kevin may be, let me say I did not use the name &ldquo;Kevin&rdquo;.  I said &ldquo;Eddy&rdquo; and I will leave it at that.</P>

      <P>This approach to State and semi-State bodies is dishonest on the part of the Government.  It is no use trying to tell the public that the Government have no influence when there is a hatchet man prepared to do all the chopping inside a State body.  It would be much better to have control exercised over such a State or semi-State body by an all-Party Committee of this House.  If controversial matters arise, as they do from time to time, and matters of public importance in connection with the functions of Telefís Éireann arise, the proper way to deal with them is to have them investigated by an all-Party Committee in this House who could examine the situation in conjunction with the officers of the Authority.  Such action would save the Minister from a good deal of criticism and it would place responsibility on other groups in this House to see that a balance was kept.</P>
      <P>As regards the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I am satisfied that he personally has not intervened in the running of Telefís Éireann, that he is innocent of any behind-the-scenes action or the use of the telephone for the control, or shall I say, the control by mirrors, of Telefís Éireann.  That does not mean that other members of the Cabinet are not doing it.  They can be doing it without the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs being informed of what is going on.  We must appreciate that in regard to some programmes over which controversy has arisen, the hand of his Party has reached into the Television Authority and contacted the Party member in that Authority who in turn has been in the position to do the necessary hatchet work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Authority as it stands must have a little more regard for this House.  We are precluded in this debate from going into detailed discussion of this question but if we take their approach to members of this House as proof of what they think, it should be an eye-opener to the public as to what Telefís Éireann thinks of <Col N="1773" /> Dáil Éireann.  Some time ago, the Television Authority pointed out that they were anxious for members of Dáil Éireann to visit the studios in Montrose.I have often been invited, like other members of this House, by a State body, Bord na Móna and other such bodies, to visit as part of a group of Dáil Deputies the works of one of these companies.  However, the invitation was always issued to me personally as an elected representative for a constituency.</P>
    <P>When Telefís Éireann decided to invite Deputies to visit the studios, the only way my invitation came was through the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am not in Fianna Fáil and I take a very dim view of receiving an invitation, as a public representative, to visit Montrose studios through the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party who was handed a bunch of invitations by some backroom boy in Telefís Éireann and told: &ldquo;Dish those out to members of the Dáil and arrange to have them out in groups on dates to be specified.&rdquo;  I want no invitation from Telefís Éireann to visit their studios unless it comes to me personally.  I will not accept it through the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party or anyone else.  I mention that because to me, at any rate, it shows in what regard members of this House are held by the Television Authority.  It was just a casual performance, just as you would bring a busload of school-children on a visit to the Zoo or to the Dáil itself and have them shown around by the Chief Whip.  That is a point I would like the Minister to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>On 11th October, more by accident than by design, I looked at a programme from Telefís Éireann.  It was <i>Encyclopaedia: the Union of South Africa</i>.  That programme nearly gave me blood pressure.  This Government have, for many months, tried to show their antagonism in the United Nations and elsewhere towards the type of government that operates in South Africa.  The film shown that evening was nothing other than a documentary which was a publicity stunt by the South African Government.  If that film was paid for it was a scandalous <Col N="1774" /> waste of money and was a waste of the time of the Authority.</P>
    <P>I rang the Authority straight away and I was put through to some individual who described himself as public relations officer and he told me to calm down.  He said that they often got telephone calls after a programme from people who were very indignant but that when these people got time to cool off, they were not too bad.  I asked could I be given an explanation and from that day to this I have not had a word from the Authority.  I believe the Minister has more regard for the members of this House, being a member of it himself, than to allow them to be treated in such a way by this Authority.</P>
    <P>I have frequently been asked by people to raise various questions here about Telefís Éireann and my questions have been disallowed.  On many occasions I felt that if the questions had been answered, a good job would have been done for Telefís Éireann instead of allowing the rumours to grow and go around without contradiction.That is the reason I feel that the Minister is very foolish in interpreting the Act in such a narrow fashion and that he is only doing harm to Telefís Éireann by not giving information when it is asked for.  It is a bad answer to tell me to go to the Authority for my information because we know they will give no information to Deputies on matters of a controversial nature.</P>
    <P>Comment was made here on the political débâcle that took place on Telefís Éireann on the night of the No Confidence Vote in the House.  No one need suggest to me that Deputies have tender skins and that they do not want criticism on Telefís Éireann.  To suggest that would be wrong and I do not think that is why Deputy Corish and other Deputies were critical of the programme.  If a professor or anybody else is called on by Telefís Éireann to comment on a matter of political importance, I would like to give it as my opinion that there is no such animal in Ireland as a neutral observer or any institution that could be accepted as neutral.  If the Man above Himself came down to comment on that programme, He would not be accepted by <Col N="1775" /> one side as neutral and I will not say which side.</P>
    <P>The proper approach of the Authority should be to give both sides a fair crack of the whip.  You cannot have one without the other.  It was a bad mistake that night and I hope the Authority will learn from that mistake. If they can spend so much time copying BBC and UTV, if they can learn so much about Coronation Street and the disc jockeys of BBC and UTV, they may also copy the type of programme put on by these stations as far as politics are concerned.  All political parties in Britain get a fair crack of the whip and if the leader of the Government there gets a roasting, the other side of the picture is presented as well.  No Deputy would be afraid of answering critical questions, provided the programme was a fair one.</P>
    <P>I have watched interviews on Telefís Éireann&mdash;I am not now referring to the show that took place recently, but to interviews at airports and other such places.  It is pathetic to hear the stupid questions that are asked and it looks as if the interviewer, on most occasions, is afraid to ask questions for fear he might lose his job within the hour.  The public are not impressed by that approach because they have access to similar programmes on the BBC.  I am very glad of that because as long as that access is there and they have the opportunity to look at such programmes on the other stations, they are able to judge how pathetic are the attempts made by Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>The excuse will be put forward that Telefís Éireann is young.  Telefís Éireann is young but if you get something young starting off on the wrong lines, you are going to have a hard job changing it on to the proper lines. If Telefís Éireann starts off on the wrong lines in its formative stages, we will be unable to do anything about it.  It will be impossible to mould it into an institution of which the Irish people will be proud.  Nobody is proud of it now and there are very few programmes that are worth looking at. The top man in Telefís Éireann said recently: &ldquo;You cannot please everybody; it would be an impossibility to <Col N="1776" /> please everybody.&rdquo; I hope he did not crack his skull in thinking up that great thought.  It is wonderful to discover that suddenly, that you cannot please everybody.  One thing which is certain is that Telefís Éireann is fast succeeding in pleasing nobody.  Which is worse I do not know.</P>
    <P>Like every other Deputy, I should like Telefís Éireann to be something of which we would all be proud.  I do not want programmes that just suit me, but a decision on the arranging of programmes, or anything else like that, should be made by people who understand this country, who understand rural Ireland and know what it is like. I do not think it could ever be seriously suggested that an Irishman could go to Spain or France as head of a television authority and decide on the kind of programmes for the French or Spanish people.  No Irishman could be expected to do that and he would have a brass neck if he attempted to do it.  We do not want that happening here.</P>
    <P>It is time we had a few intelligent programmes, discussions in which social and economic problems would be spotlighted.  I would ask the Minister to use his position of power on this occasion with the Authority in regard to the preparation of programmes and ask them to put on programmes that are, if you like, thought-provoking discussions which will cause people to think; and which will be vigorous and in which no punches will be pulled.  If they do that, a truer picture of life will emerge.  After all, even in local publichouses, one hears first-class discussions and debates in which no punches are pulled.  Why is it that when we set up an Authority which is to portray life in the country, to be as true to life as possible, the result is a milk and water effort?  We do not get programmes worth looking at.</P>
    <P>Most of the points I should like to raise are on matters of detail and it would be unfair to try to discuss them on this motion.  The motion itself, even though it is very mild, may be the very thing necessary at this stage.  The Minister is anxious to see the Television Authority doing a first-class job.  If he takes the advice given to him here, he will give, as far as <Col N="1777" /> possible, all the information he is asked for by members of this House. If he does that, he will be doing a good job for television if they have nothing to hide in regard to questions put down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was put down following my answers to three questions asked by Deputy Dr. Browne on 4th April, 1962 on matters in which I clearly had no function and which I suggested he should take up with the Authority.  I was not breaking any new ground in making this suggestion.  The same type of reply had been given to a number of other questions following the establishment of the Authority; and even during the period 1st January, 1953 to 31st May, 1960, when Comhairle Radio Éireann were responsible under the Minister for the broadcasting service, it was not unusual to invite Deputies to address their questions on programme matters to the Director of Broadcasting.</P>
      <P>The motion as worded conveys the impression that I have unreasonably withheld information from Deputies in a large number of cases.  What are the facts?  Since the Authority was established on 1st June, 1960, I was asked 147 Parliamentary questions regarding radio and television matters. I replied to 126 of these questions, although many of them concerned matters in which I had no special function. There were only 21 cases where I said that I had no function or suggested that the Deputy address his inquiries to Radio Eireann.  In other words, I gave the information in six out of seven cases.  Does this record bear out the suggestion that I have been unreasonable in withholding information from Deputies?  On the contrary, it seems to me that it could be held that I have been unreasonable in asking the Authority for information about matters of day-to-day administration or programming in order to enable me to reply to Deputies' questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here I would like to point out that in the three years 1957 to 1959 the average annual number of Dáil questions on broadcasting matters was 23. Following the setting up of the statutory authority, one would have expected <Col N="1778" /> a drop in this number, even with the television service that was then initiated.  The figures for recent years are, however, as follows:</P>

    </table>
    <P>I suggest that the inference to be drawn from these figures is that some Deputies have been unreasonable in looking to me for information about broadcasting and television in view of my now limited function in these matters.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree of course that all reasonable information should be supplied by the Minister to Deputies when requested and that has always been my practice.  The question is: what is reasonable?  Since the Broadcasting Authority Act was passed, I have never refused to supply information on any matter in which I had clearly a function.  Difficulty has arisen only in relation to matters which fall primarily within the Authority's bailiwick.In replying to such Parliamentary questions, I have been as informative as possible on matters concerning general broadcasting policy and on matters which gave rise to public interest or concern.  I have, however, suggested that other questions looking for detailed information about individual programmes etc. should be addressed to the Authority.  Some Deputies apparently consider that this practice is contrary to assurances given by me during the debate on the Broadcasting Authority Bill, but I cannot agree that the quotations given by Deputy Corish in his speech on 12th November contain any such assurance.</P>
    <P>The whole tenor of my remarks on the Bill was that broadcasting was a creative medium which was not suitable to a Civil Service form of organisation, with the detailed controls which are inherent in such organisations, and that the new Authority should be quite free to exercise its functions of providing a national television and sound broadcasting service, with power of intervention by the Minister or the Government confined to a small number of matters in which State interests must be safeguarded. <Col N="1779" /> Moreover, I stressed that the Authority would have the maximum freedom regarding programmes and matters of day-to-day administration.  It would be quite inconsistent with this approach if the Minister were to supply information to Deputies on day-to-day matters which involve no question of general policy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already the position between 1953 and 1960 when Comhairle Radio Eireann were functioning. The appointment of that body made no change in the Minister's legal position but he announced that he intended to entrust them with the day-to-day policy of broadcasting and that he himself intended to intervene only in questions of important policy.  He appealed at the same time to Deputies to refrain from asking Parliamentary questions about details of day-to-day broadcasting and to address their inquiries to the Director of Broadcasting and I am glad to say that Deputies, in general, did as he requested.</P>
    <P>This was the position when I introduced the Broadcasting Authority Bill. In the circumstances I have described, is it conceivable that I should give the House an assurance that the entire working of the proposed new independent statutory authority could, with propriety, be raised here by way of Parliamentary question and answer? But whatever about assurances, the fact I would like to repeat is that since the Authority was established, there were only 21 cases out of 147 where I referred Deputies to Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish may wish to be reminded of something he said during the debate on the Broadcasting Authority Bill.  I quote from col. 610, volume 180 of the Official Report of 16th March, 1960 where the Deputy, referring to the position of fact at the time the Bill was introduced, said:</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister said that legally he was responsible for Radio Éireann, even for the day-to-day administration.  I do not say that there was any malice in the evasion of the responsibility by this Minister or any of the past Ministers in regard to the day-to-day <Col N="1780" /> running of the station but I think it is desirable that the Authority should be transferred now on a legal basis to this Board which this Bill proposes to establish because I do not think it is desirable that the Minister should be questioned in this House, as he has been on many frivolous matters raised from time to time in regard to plays, items of news, songs or other programmes that Deputies thought were undesirable or offensive in any way.</P>
    <P>At column 611 of the same volume, Deputy Corish said:</P>
    <P>When the statutory body is established, any criticism had better be directed towards that body.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to Deputy Dillon's remarks on the Committee Stage of the Bill when he felt that there was some ambiguity in an off the cuff reply I gave to a question asked by Deputy Dr. Browne when we were discussing the absence of a provision regarding censorship.  At col. 1578 volume 180 of the Official Report for 31st March, 1960, Deputy Dillon said:</P>
    <P>I rather imagine that we desire this Authority to have a certain quasi-autonomy while retaining in the Oireachtas the ultimate right to determine major issues of policy but that, in setting up the Authority, by implication, we divest ourselves of the claim to deal with each programme by way of Parliamentary question and answer as we are entitled to deal with the day-to-day administration of the Minister's Department by Parliamentary question and answer.</P>
    <P>At cols. 1578 and 1579 of the same vol. I made the position quite clear. During the present debate, Deputy Corish quoted what I said at that time but I think it desirable to repeat portion of it here.  I said:</P>
    <P>I do not want any doubt to exist in regard to this matter.  When Dr. Browne asked the question I assumed he was making reference to a programme that would be regarded by the people as generally <Col N="1781" /> objectionable.  ...If such an objectionable programme were put out by our broadcasting service and our people took grave exception to it and so expressed themselves, I think it would be very hard for a Minister to resist a discussion on the matter in this House, a matter which was of vital interest and which so affected the moral standards of our people.  It is true that the Authority will be an autonomous Authority and that the Minister will not have any interference whatsoever with the day-to-day programmes of that Authority but we have an overriding responsibility to our people in the matter referred to by Dr. Browne.</P>
    <P>In other words, I felt that the Minister should have some responsibility in programme matters which are of wide general interest or concern.</P>
    <P>I think it would be appropriate at this stage to quote what I said on section 31 of the Act which gives the Minister the power of veto.  In col. 761 of volume 179 of the Official Report for 24th February, 1960, I said:</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that this section is not intended to provide the Minister with a general power of censorship as the whole approach has been to place the minimum of restrictions on the Authority in the matter of programmes.  However, the service to be provided will be a national one, and in the final analysis, there must be reserved to the Government some means of ultimate control over broadcasts which might be inimical to the national interest.  The power is necessary for use in most exceptional cases and I am sure that no Minister would try to abuse it.</P>
    <P>This power of veto has never yet been used.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen Radio Éireann's third annual report and statement of accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1963 which was issued recently.  These annual reports contain much useful information about the Authority's activities and I think that Deputies should refrain from asking <Col N="1782" /> Parliamentary questions on matters which are covered in them.  I feel sure that if any Deputy has suggestions on how the reports could be improved or made more informative the Authority will be glad to receive them and will give them the most careful consideration.In this connection I have been assured by the Authority that Deputies are very welcome to visit the television studios at Donnybrook to see for themselves the conditions under which programmes are produced and to discuss their views on how the programmes can be improved with the Director-General and his staff.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy McQuillan could take the matter up with the Director-General.He could write to him and say when he is going up to see him rather than depend upon his invitation, regardless of the manner in which it is sent out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to section 26 (2) of the Broadcasting Authority Act and asked whether the Authority had been asked to include in its annual report information on any particular aspect of its proceedings.  I may tell the Deputy that following the issue of the Authority's first report my Department furnished some comments on how future reports could be improved and made more informative.  It suggested, for instance, that more facts and figures should be given regarding programmes, advertisements, etc. Deputies will have noticed, I am sure, that the later reports are more informative.If I consider that further information on any particular point would be useful, I shall certainly use my power under this section to have the matter covered in the annual report.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish also referred to section 17 of the Act and quoted my reply to Deputy Treacy and Deputy Rooney on 30th October, 1962, regarding the use of Irish on Telefís Éireann.  I thought at the time that my reply was a full and reasonable one and I am still of that opinion.  It would seem that Deputy Corish's real criticism is not that I refused to give information on this matter but that I had not intervened to ensure that Telefís Éireann would do more than they were doing to promote the use of <Col N="1783" /> Irish.  May I point out that, at the time these questions were asked, the television service was in operation for only ten months and that none of the provincial transmitters was in operation?I felt, therefore, that it was too early to criticise the Authority for failure in any particular direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish further referred to my reply of 4th April, 1962, to a question by Deputy Dr. Browne who wanted me to direct Telefís Éireann to reject advertisements for cigarettes on their programmes.  I would not agree and in reply to a supplementary question, I said that the Oireachtas had taken this matter out of my hands and placed it in the hands of the Authority. Deputy Corish objects to my saying that I have no responsibility in this matter.  I would like to point out that my only function in relation to advertisments is that under section 20 (3) of the Act the total daily time fixed for advertisements and the distribution of that time throughout the programmes require my approval.</P>

If this is intended to refer to an officer of the Authority, I am authorised to say that no officer of Radio Éireann has any financial interest whatever in any company supplying film material.</P>

      <P>To my mind, there is a big difference in principle between the <i>An Fear agus a Scéal</i> programme and the interview with Professor Williams.  The Authority considered the former to be so lacking in moderation on a matter concerning the security of the State that it decided that it should not be broadcast.  In the other case, no such vital national interest was concerned and the criticisms of the programme were that Professor Williams was not objective or impartial in his comments on the political Parties.</P>

      <P>It would be wrong to convict the Authority of political bias on the basis of one or two isolated programmes; it should be judged on the way it has dealt with programmes over an extended period.</P>
      <P>I have sometimes thought that programmes could have given the Government a fairer crack of the whip.  I and my colleagues would have liked things done differently at times.  But we realised that this is what had to be expected when an autonomous body was set up.</P>
      <P>I might say at this point that the decision to place the conduct of Radio Éireann under an independent authority was taken by the Government with very considerable hesitation and doubt.  The view was strongly expressed at the time that direct ministerial responsibility for the control of the authority, and for its television and sound programmes, was the preferable arrangement.  Arguments advanced by Deputies opposite in this debate suggest that this view is shared by others in the House.  The present arrangement must be regarded as experimental.  If the Government have reason to think that it is not working satisfactorily, they will reconsider it.  While the direct responsibility of the Minister for the programmes would create some new problems, it would remove others.  It is not yet clear on which side the balance of advantage lies, but if we should decide to restore the principle of direct responsibility by the Minister, it will involve legislation so that the Dáil will have full opportunity of debating it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Again and again it has been said at the Committee of Procedure and Privileges and again and again the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party has given an undertaking when a matter was raised that it would be complied with, that when a Minister came in here and read a speech, he would do the House the courtesy of circulating copies of the speech so that Deputies could look at it while it was being read.  I regret the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who normally observes the usual courtesies, has broken not merely the courtesy of the House but also the specific undertaking of the Chief Whip of his Party.</P>
      <P>I should not have intervened in this debate at all were it not for the television broadcast that took place following the Dáil debate on the recent vote of No Confidence.  Immediately after that telecast various constituents of mine got in touch with me objecting violently to the partisan nature of the broadcast.  I did not see it for the same reason as the Minister said he did not see it.  I wrote immediately to the Director General of Telefís Éireann and asked to be shown the recorded script of the broadcast because I felt that it was perhaps unfair to judge purely on hearsay evidence when I had not seen it myself. I regret that the Television Authority replied saying they were not prepared to make the script available to me or any other Deputy and quoted as their reason for doing so the reasons given by the Minister himself on 17th November, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not having seen the telecast myself, <Col N="1788" /> I can only say that all the reports I have received show clearly that the information was not disseminated in the manner required by section 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>That section states:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Authority to secure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>to secure, mark you</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;when it broadcasts any opinion, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    <P>Nobody can deny that the matter discussed that night was a matter of public controversy and current public debate.  Everybody will agree, in fact, that whether the Government is going to stand or fall is the most important controversy that can take place in any year.  It was the duty of the Authority to secure that the information, news or feature was presented objectively and impartially.</P>
    <P>As I say, I did not see it myself, but everybody to whom I have spoken has taken the line, not in relation to the Radio Éireann political correspondent, may I say, but in relation to the views expressed by Professor Williams, that the Television Authority failed in its duty of presenting the feature objectively and impartially.  I do not blame Professor Williams for having his views.  He is entitled to them just as I am entitled to mine.  The Act, however, is most specific; in a matter like that Telefís Éireann must disseminate its views objectively and impartially. They failed to do so completely on that occasion.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for me to criticise the Television Authority on that occasion without, at the same time, making it clear that on another more recent occasion I felt they approached the matter in the correct way.  As the Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party, I received last Friday a letter from the Television Authority in which they informed me that it was their intention to have a political discussion on the <Col N="1789" /> turnover tax and to have that on a date in December.  On the following day, I received a letter saying that the political discussion which was to take place in December was going to take place tomorrow night and that they were inviting&mdash;I mention this to show they were perfectly fair on this occasion&mdash;to take part in that debate a representative of the three main Parties.  Needless to say, we in Fine Gael accepted that invitation with alacrity.  I understand the Labour Party likewise accepted the invitation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Television Authority for their impartiality in extending an invitation to all three main Parties and I must confess I was astounded when I was informed today in a letter from Telefís Éireann that the Fianna Fáil Party had declined the invitation to participate in the discussion.  I mention that to make it quite clear that Telefís Éireann are not always to blame for operating in a way that is not objective and impartial.  In the Professor Williams instance, I am quite sure they failed in their duty.  In the recent case to which I refer, they did their duty.  The unfortunate thing is the Government have run away from public discussion on the turnover tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate in order to put a few facts straight.  I do not condemn the effort to which reference has been made for the same reason as some of the other speakers.  Someone was put on Telefís Éireann on the night of the vital vote here and that someone made a scurrilous attack on the Labour Party and on its Leader in particular.  An insulting reference was made to Deputy Corish.  Now all of us in the House have been the victims from time to time of letters written without real names being signed or signed by someone so little known that the names mean nothing to most readers.  We all of us bracket that type of letter as anonymous.  It was an insult to the intelligence of the viewers to put on Telefís Éireann an anonymous speaker. The person who was put on that night was not known to the general public. He was put on to attack someone who was well known.  He should have been <Col N="1790" /> treated by Telefís Éireann in the same way as the anonymous letter writer is; he should not have been allowed to put his views before the public the way in which he did.</P>
      <P>The only member of the Government Party who has spoken on this matter, with the exception of the Minister, made an attempt to justify this action by Telefís Éireann on the ground that we all have to take attacks made on us in the Press and from public platforms.  Of course, we have.  If we merit these attacks, or someone thinks we merit them, they are perfectly entitled to make them; but we do not have to pay a £4 licence to listen to these attacks.  That is the difference and I think the individual who made the comment did not appreciate that particular point.  He did not seem to understand that it was a different thing altogether.</P>
      <P>So far as the Minister is concerned, I am rather surprised at the attitude he has taken in this debate.  I have known him a long time.  He is a reasonable, courteous man.  I was rather surprised to find him trailing his coat across the floor of the House. Perhaps it was not his own coat he was trailing.  Deputy Sweetman pointed out that he read his speech and I may assume, perhaps, that it was someone behind the scenes who presented the coat to be trailed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In vol. 180, col. 1595, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> The Government will have to bear in mind that in section 18 the Authority is obliged to maintain impartiality in the presentation of news and public discussion.</P>
    <P>He did not say anything about limited function there.  By &ldquo;the Government&rdquo;, I take it he means the Minister.  Surely the Minister will agree that, if he is obliged, there is no limitation.  He either does something or he does not do it.  He also stated: &ldquo;The Authority must be free to present its own news and information service.  I am satisfied that the Authority is conscious of its obligation to preserve impartiality and objectivity in its programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to letters received by him as Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party from Telefís Éireann. I, as Whip of the Labour Party, received similar letters.  Like Deputy Sweetman, I also would like to say that in this instance Telefís Éireann seemed very anxious to do the right thing.  Not alone that, but they were very honest when they gave the reason in the letter from which I shall quote now, the letter of 20th November:</P>
    <P>Further to my letter of November 15th, I have to inform you that the Fianna Fáil Party has declined our invitation to participate in the discussion of the Turnover Tax which we had hoped to transmit on November 21st at 9.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>Since we would not be able to maintain the impartiality required of us in matters of public controversy without the participation of the principal supporter of the measure under discussion, we must, with regret, cancel the programme.</P>
    <P>Here is an example where Telefís Éireann were particularly anxious to be impartial and where the Government were particularly anxious that such a programme would not be put on the screen.</P>

      <P>We know they got instructions to attack and, unfortunately, one of the Deputies attacked the Minister for Local Government at Question Time to-day.  Deputy P.J. Burke did not know it was the Opposition he was to attack.</P>
      <P>There were three programmes taken off: &ldquo;Guth na Tíre,&rdquo;&ldquo;Broadsheet&rdquo; and &ldquo;An Fear agus a Scéal&rdquo;.  The Minister has given the explanation that he considered one of them subversive.Was &ldquo;Guth na Tíre&rdquo; considered subversive?  Was &ldquo;Broadsheet&rdquo; considered subversive?  Was that the reason they were taken off or was it not that they were presenting a cross-section of Irish life?</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister must accept responsibility for something like this? Surely, in view of the statements he made when the Authority was being set up and since that in this House, he has to admit that it is his job to see to it that things are done properly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a comment by Deputy McQuillan about an invitation to Montrose which he did not like and the attitude he adopted to it but it is on record here that a member of the Labour Party who could not go to Montrose on one of these organised parties phoned at a later date to say that he was anxious to see Montrose and asking if it would be possible to make arrangements so that he could see it.  What was he told?  He was told he should join an organised party.  I do not know whether they meant a political Party or not.  Maybe they meant that he should become a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and there would be a great welcome for him out there.  That may have been the idea. However, that was the comment made and that, apparently, is the way the public relations personnel in Telefís Éireann deal with people who want to go there to look around.  So I am afraid the Minister's invitation to get <Col N="1793" /> in touch with Telefís Éireann and they would be welcome there does not seem to have worked out so well.</P>
    <P>There was a very apt comment made last week in the French Parliament by a Deputy who suggested that the Minister who is in the same position as our Minister here was becoming the Minister for propaganda.  I should not like to see our Minister for Posts and Telegraphs becoming a Minister for propaganda but there is a grave danger, if the present trend continues, that that will happen.  It may be a very useful thing around election time to have all propaganda given out through the national television service.  It would not last too long, however, and when the election was over, the people who would be trying it on might find that they had made a big mistake.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I appeal to the Minister, when he is asked a reasonable question here, not to do the childish thing that another Minister does here and say he has no function, that it has nothing to do with him, that Deputies should go elsewhere.  The Minister for Transport and Power owns those words.  They are his stock reply to practically everything he is asked.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is a reasonable man, a courteous man, an intelligent man. Therefore, he should establish the fact that he is entitled to be able to give the information which, on the setting up of the Authority, he guaranteed to this House he would give.  He should now be prepared to give that information to the House and not force on Deputies the necessity to put down a motion such as that before the House to-night.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that the people who are running Telefís Éireann must get freedom to run programmes as they want to.  I know quite well that there has been very severe criticism of Telefís Éireann here and I should like to go on record as saying that I do not agree with a lot of the criticism levelled at Telefís Éireann as regards programmes.  I believe that, like every other television station, there is good and bad in it.  I believe that they do give a fair amount of reasonably good material.  They give a fair amount of <Col N="1794" /> tripe, but most television stations do that.</P>
    <P>The one thing which most people in this country seem to criticise is that the television station is in the unique position that, in addition to being subsidised by licences, it is subsidised by advertisements and yet claims to be chronically short of money and, for that reason, has to produce sub-standard programmes.  Perhaps my taste in television material differs from that of other members of the House. In my view, the Television Authority have on occasions risen to great heights and have on occasions descended to very great depths, but, taken all in all, they are perhaps making a reasonable effort to get on and to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>But when it comes to the question of important national problems, that is where the Minister will find himself running into deep water if he allows the Television Authority, or allows his Party to use the Television Authority, to send out a certain type of propaganda, and particularly if he allows them to use it for the purpose of an attack on personalities, because that would not be accepted by the Irish people.</P>

      <P>On reading the motion, it sounds reasonable but I am quite satisfied that what the movers have in mind is not what they say in the motion.  I have no objection to the House being given all reasonable information, but, quite obviously, the motion is intended as an attack on Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann because they are not subject to this House.  In my opinion, it would be a bad day for this House and for the people of this country if, in fact, Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann were subject to the Minister or to this House in their day-to-day actions because, if they were, they would curry favour with whoever would be in power, especially if the people in power were strong.  In other words, it would become a one-sided affair.  In the long run, it is for the good of the people and for democracy that Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann should not be subject to this House in their day-to-day <Col N="1795" /> actions.  It would be a very dangerous thing if, in fact, they could be subject to the attacks of groups here who are in the main wrong and unreasonable. Politics is not based on reason; it is based on expediency.  It is based largely on lies, on what you can put over.  We do not want institutions, therefore, to be subject to that sort of influence in the House.</P>

    <P>In regard to what Professor Williams said, I do not know the man but it would be very difficult for an intelligent man to say other than what he said.  Politics is for chumps.  At least, that is what Machiavelli said. That is how he described people who were so easy to be convinced, who did not reason.  Surely the people on the <Col N="1796" /> other side of the House did not expect people like Professor Williams to be chumps?  If intelligent people go on Telefís Éireann, they have to express a commonsense view in their knowledge of the subject under discussion. The whole attack on the Government recently was of the stuff by which chumps, but not intelligent people, are convinced.  Deputies opposite talk about getting a fair show. They have a monopoly of all the yahoo in the Press.  Even here when leaders are asked to speak, it is a case of Fianna Fáil Party speakers, then Fine Gael and then the Labour Party.  That is three speakers against one.  You have the advantage all the time.  Even on Telefís Éireann, we are told that the Leaders of the Fine Gael Party and Fianna Fáil were asked.  That would be two to one&mdash; two yarns against one.  With all the yarns you had on your side, assuming they were all yarns, you would have a monopoly of yarns.  You have no reason for complaint because some independent person expressed an intelligent point of view.</P>

      <P>The truth is that what is being said about the Government even on Telefís Éireann was a monopoly of nonsense and lies.  I do not want to talk any more because there is no point in talking here.  I do not want to talk before a lot of silly, ignorant people either, but I will at any time before an intelligent body of impartial people.</P>

      <P>I will say no more than this, that if Professor Williams or anybody else expresses a point of view, just because it is on one side more than the other, it is the most natural thing in the world that an intelligent person should give his view. A judge gives a view and does not please both sides.  One thinks he is right and one thinks he is wrong, if he gives a proper type of sane judicial view.  I say again that it would be <Col N="1798" /> a dangerous thing for anybody&mdash;Radio Éireann or Telefís Éireann&mdash;to be subject to the pressures in this House.  It would be a dangerous thing for democracy.While I have no objection to any reasonable information being given, I would object to these bodies being subject to the pressures of politicians.  I hope that they remain independent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Sherwin would be at one with us in consideration of this motion.  He said in the latter portion of his speech that whilst he did not think that Telefís Éireann should be subject to attack for its various programmes, the Minister should give all reasonable information to the elected representatives of the people.  That is all that this motion asks.  I admit that there has been in this debate a certain amount of criticism.That is inevitable when people talk about Telefís Éireann and we stray into the error of talking about individual programmes.  This motion of ours was not intended nor has it been a medium by which to attack Telefís Éireann for its various individual programmes.  This, frankly, is an attack on the Minister and not on Telefís Éireann.  As Deputy Tully has said and as most people here will agree, within the short space of time during which Telefís Éireann has been established I do not think that anybody could criticise it unduly when one has regard to its resources and its personnel at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last Tuesday night, because we are the representatives of the people, whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or Independents, the Minister is bound to give all reasonable information, but since Telefís Éireann has been established, despite the figures he has given us as to the number of questions answered, the invariable reply we get from the Minister, if not in the initial reply, certainly in reply to supplementary questions, is that the Minister has no function.  I am not suspicious of Telefís Éireann for what it does.  I am not critical of views expressed by Telefís Éireann, whether by those who make comment on public affairs, newscasters, playwrights who have their plays shown on Telefís <Col N="1799" /> Éireann or anyone else.  I honestly believe that the Minister should, as he promised he would when he successfully sold the Broadcasting Act to this House, give information to the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about people wanting him to interfere with the day-to-day administration of Telefís Éireann.  He talks about people wanting to question this, that and the other programme.  When he spoke on 31st March, 1960, he said as reported in volume 180, at column 1575:</P>
    <P>If it should happen that there would be a television show that would not measure up to our standards it would be necessary for the Minister, or the Government, to take immediate cognisance of that, and for the Authority itself to take cognisance of it and do something about it to make certain there would not be a repetition of shows that were sub-standard, so far as our ideas of good shows are concerned.</P>
    <P>He repudiates that to-night.  Has the Minister had occasion to reproach Telefís Éireann in any single instance for the type of programme they show? Does he think that all the programmes shown on Telefís Éireann are in accordance with the standards of the Irish people?  He must, because he does not interfere.  He pretends that it is non-interference, but it seems to me that he could not care less what Telefís Éireann does.  He does not seem to have any inclination whatsoever to take an interest in the affairs of Telefís Éireann.  He was eager, in selling the Act to this House, to assure Dáil Éireann that if any reasonable information were required, he would give it.  He assured Dáil Éireann that if a question were raised as to any particular programme, not alone could it be raised by question but a motion could be put down in the House.  He said, for example, that if a county council thought that a certain programme was objectionable, it might be debated in Dáil Éireann by way of a motion.</P>
    <P>No matter what Deputy Sherwin may think of any of us in the Opposition, I would say that we are <Col N="1800" /> a lot more important than any county council, and if we have views, the Minister should listen to them.  If we require information, he should be prepared to give it.  We do not want to run Telefís Éireann and we do not want to run Leinster House.  We do not want to go to the extremes to which the Minister suggests we want to go. It is not the intention amongst the Labour Party that the Minister should tell Telefís Éireann what particular programme ought to be put on from day to day or from week to week.  We accept the position whereby Telefís Éireann has autonomy.  We also demand that the Minister accept the responsibility given to him by the Government under section 18 and section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that if we want information, we should ask the Director.  I asked questions of the Director on two occasions.  The first one related to the percentage of live programmes as compared with canned programmes.  The second was one which I had previously asked the Minister; how many times the Directors met.  I could not be given that information.Had they something to hide? Had they met too often?  They will not give information.  Deputies S. Dunne and McQuillan have told us how they were received.  One was told to calm down and when Deputy Dunne said: &ldquo;What the hell&rdquo;, there was an objection as the person to whom he spoke was not used to that sort of language.</P>
    <P>The Minister says all the information we require is contained in Radio Éireann's third annual report.  This was published about a week or two weeks ago and that is the report for the year 1962-63, up to 31st March. I think that is far too long to wait for that type of report.  If information is asked of the Minister, he should be prepared to give the information he has up-to-date, just as the Minister for Finance did today when he answered a question about financial returns up to the latest date for which figures were available.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that as far as the Labour Party is concerned we do not <Col N="1801" /> care what Professor Desmond Williams thinks about the Labour Party or any individual in it.  We would be prepared to defend his right to say those things.  I am not concerned with whether he is a supporter or a member of Fianna Fáil but all I ask is that when Telefís Éireann gave these facilities to one person to give what was subsequently described by the Minister and Deputy Sherwin as objective comments on the proceedings of Dáil Éireann on 30th October, similar rights should be given to other people. The Minister defended the right of the Director to have just one person in the studio on that occasion and give his comments on the members of the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Independent Deputies.</P>
    <P>I questioned the Director on that and we had a pleasant conversation. He told me that the interview had not been pre-recorded but he defended the idea of just one man giving his comment.One man, if he is honest, can have only one view and I think Fianna Fáil would have been entitled to object if he had lambasted Fianna Fáil.  The only objection we had to the programme is that the two points of view were not put forward in it.  Whether the Director General knew the views of Professor Williams or not I do not know, but, as one of my colleagues reminds me, he could have ascertained them before he put them on and he should have had the other point of view put forward.  I gather the Minister did not approve of the programme and I will say that the Director General will not put that type of programme on again so that the fact that this motion has been put down in Dáil Éireann has done some good.</P>
    <P>We want to see political controversy on Radio Éireann.  We want to see Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Deputy Sherwin appear on Telefís Éireann and debate things that are topical in the general life of this country.  I do not accept the reasons given by the Minister and the Director General for the cancellation of <i>An Fear agus a Scéal</i>.  What is going on in Telefís Éireann?  Up to 6.30 p.m. on that date, they were advertising the fact that Con Lehane was going to be interviewed by <Col N="1802" /> Proinsias MacAonghusa and between that and 10.30 p.m., we had the cancellation.Surely somebody should have known what was in the interview?I understand that the interview was done two or three days before Telefís Éireann advertised it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the programme was cancelled because it was regarded that what was said by Con Lehane was subversive.  Could what was said by Professor Williams on the live programme not also have been subversive?  He could have said: &ldquo;To hell with Lemass, and up the IRA&rdquo; and what could be done about it?  It is nonsense to say that you can censor the pre-recorded programme and let people like Professor Williams go on the live programme and say what he likes.  He could be subversive.I suggest that if you employ somebody to conduct a programme of this nature and if you invite a reputable man like Con Lehane for interview, his comments should have been heard by the people, no matter what they were.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be concerned about expenditure on Telefís Éireann. Recently we were told that the licence fee was to be increased from £4 to £5. I am sorry the Minister did not have an opportunity to reply about the matter I am about to mention but he must have heard of the play &ldquo;Miss Julie&rdquo;.  Perhaps he will get a chance later to tell us about it.  I understand that this play was produced by Telefís Éireann at a cost of between £1,200 and £1,300.  I do not know when it was due to be shown but I have been told now that it has been cancelled because it was considered not fit to be presented to the Irish public.  I accept that.</P>
    <P>If those who set themselves up as censors consider that a play is not fit to be presented to the Irish public, I accept it, but is this a waste of £1,200 or £1,300?  Can the Minister answer that now?  Now that he has been told about it, is he prepared to inquire about it and tell the Dáil about it?  Is he concerned about these things or is he prepared to leave it to the people in Telefís Éireann and never ask a question about it?  Will we be told about <Col N="1803" /> the waste of money on &ldquo;Miss Julie&rdquo; when the Minister presents his new Bill here next week?</P>
    <P>There is only a minute or two left for me and there is so much I want to say.  We do not want to be unreasonable with the Authority or to interfere with its day-to-day operation.  The Minister has said that all the questions we have put to him were answered but he answered the easy ones and referred the ones which he thought were sticky to somebody else.  The Minister threatened me and said that if I repeated what I had said here about canned programmes outside the House, somebody would take action.</P>

The Minister's research people had better look at the debate again because what I said was &ldquo;a person&rdquo;. This matter was brought up in the general debate when the Bill was being put through the House.  I ask him now to examine his conscience and ask himself if, in fact, what was forecast in that debate has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from Limerick, a constituency so closely associated with milk and bacon production, it is natural I should have an interest in the parts of the Minister's speech dealing with these two important arms of our agricultural industry. For me, the Minister's speech was remarkable not so much for what it contained but rather for what it omitted. The most serious defect in it was the lack of any detailed reference or clearcut expression of opinion on two recently published documents which will have a vital bearing on the development and progress of Irish agriculture.I refer to the reports of the survey teams which investigated the dairying industry and the bacon industry.  Most people had expected that the Minister would avail of this opportunity to give us some idea of his views on these two important documents.  In particular, we were hoping he would give us some indication of how far the Government would be guided in their policy for agriculture by the revolutionary recommendations contained in both of these reports.</P>
      <P>Each of these reports contained a variety of recommendations.  The most important were those which recommended that a large number of our creameries and bacon factories should be closed down.  They recommended a reduction in the number of creamery undertakings from 197 to 30 and also that the 600 premises in operation should be reduced to 150.  The fact that the wholesale closure of our bacon and milk-processing plants should be recommended in the year 1963 is a terrible reflection on Government policy in recent times.  It represents a complete contradiction of the targets proposed for agricultural expansion in the Blue Book.  I believe if we had been given a realistic policy in recent years, the output from our farms would have reached the stage where we would not alone be utilising the capacity of our existing plants to the full but would be taking steps to expand them and erect new ones instead of closing down so many now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The omission of detailed reference to these reports in the Minister's speech is a very serious one.  My reaction to it was that perhaps the Minister and the Government had decided not to go <Col N="1807" /> ahead with the implementation of the recommendations contained in the reports.  However, a short paragraph in the Blue Book, <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, leads me to think otherwise.  Paragraph 41 states that the recent survey of the dairy industry had shown there was considerable scope for better returns to creameries and farmers through improved organisation.  I do not accept this at all.  In view of what has been stated in the Blue Book and the danger that the Government will be influenced in future policy making by the recommendatitons of the survey team, it is necessary we should avail of the opportunity presented by this debate to make as close an examination as possible of the possibilities of the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>I have before me the observations of the four organisations vitally connected with the dairy industry.  They have been unanimous in their rejection of the main recommendations of the survey team's report.  Any attempt to implement the main recommendations of this report without thorough examination of its implications could involve most serious consequences for the dairying industry.  It would be fatally easy to embark on costly changes which not alone might be socially undesirable but economically disastrous.The vital importance of the dairying industry in our economy should now be fully recognised; I do not think adequate recognition has been given to it.  Unless that is done in the immediate future, I am convinced the targets for agricultural expansion set out in the Blue Book can never be achieved.</P>
    <P>The increased output of cattle and high quality milk envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will primarily depend on the co-operation of creamery farmers in the dairying areas.  They own about 55 per cent of the cow herds.  Pig production, while perhaps secondary, is closely related to the economy of the dairy farmer.  If the Blue Book targets are to be achieved, the dairy farmers must be enabled to improve the carrying <Col N="1808" /> capacity of their holdings, increase their dairy herds, modernise cowbyres and install necessary cooling equipment and water supplies.  There is no doubt of their ability to increase output or about the capacity of their farms to carry increased stock, provided &mdash; this is important &mdash; adequate assistance is available to them.  The assistance by way of grants, credit and advice at present available is totally inadequate to permit of any improvement taking place and the first step towards achieving the Blue Book targets must be a new deal for the dairy farmer.</P>
    <P>The new heifer scheme will not be much use to the average dairy farmer because most of them are carrying as many cows as they can afford and the scope for expansion is very limited. Taking into account the present system, the £15 grant is not going to be nearly sufficient incentive to increase herd numbers.  The possibility of increasing these numbers and increasing output of high quality milk is very great but we must be realistic, and there is no point in setting targets unless we get the means to achieve them.  If we want to increase the number of cows, the dairy farmer must have the capital to make up the difference between the £15 grant and the actual cost of the animal which would now run to about £50.  To carry the extra stock on the average dairy farm, the farmer will have to improve the carrying capacity of the farm. This will mean more liberal use of fertiliser, new techniques in grassland management and conservation for winter feeding and will entail very large capital outlay which the average dairy farmer is not at present able to meet.</P>
    <P>It will also make increased demands on our advisory services which are now totally inadequate.  Any increase in cow numbers will lead to an increase in milk output.  There is scope there: in fact we have a recent statement by Mr. O'Reilly of An Bord Bainne that about 20 million extra gallons will be needed next year to meet our export commitments.  It is vitally important that the milk should be of the highest standard.  To produce <Col N="1809" /> high quality milk is not easy. Most dairy farms will have to improve byres or erect new ones, adopt a milk parlour or open yard system, new equipment will need to be installed, including, perhaps, milking machines, cooling equipment and running water.</P>
    <P>All these improvements are recommended in the report but while the team pointed out the need for improved quality of milk and showed how that could be achieved, no attempt was made to show how or where the farmer could find the capital to effect these improvements.  It is foolish to think that the average dairy farmer at present can effect such improvements. For example, the grants available now for the improvement of cowbyres amount to £9 per cow for the erection of a new byre up to a limit of £15. That is a total of £125.  From inquiries I have made from farmers who have erected them, it costs between £30 and £40 per cow for a new byre.  I was in a cowbyre on Monday which cost £37 per cow.  The dairy farmer with 25 or 30 cows who decides to erect a new byre will have to spend between £1,200 and £1,500 and the maximum grant will be £135.</P>
    <P>For reconstruction of an existing byre a grant of £5 8s. is given to a maximum, again, of 15 cows or a total of £81.  This goes only a very small part of the way in meeting the cost of reconstruction and improvement.One of the things that it is most difficult to understand is the fact that the farmer who erects a milking parlour gets very little assistance.  I am convinced from experience that the only way to get top quality milk is by means of a pipeline milker.  The ordinary bucket machinery is becoming obsolete.  The device of the future will be the pipeline milker taking the milk direct from the cow to the churn.  The cost of erecting a milking parlour is at least £400, and the building to hold the equipment will cost anything from £200 to £400.  The average expenditure then is £700 to £800.  The maximum grant available is £20.  I am informed that this grant of £20 is not specifically available for a milking parlour.  I saw the list of grants available <Col N="1810" /> and milking parlours are not included in that list.  The only way in which the £20 can be claimed is if a milking parlour is put in as a loose shed for livestock.</P>
    <P>There are no grants available for milk coolers, another vital piece of equipment.  The assistance available to the farmer at present, particularly to enable him to improve the quality of his milk, is totally inadequate.  I realise it is no use being critical if one cannot put forward some concrete suggestions.  I believe the only incentive which means anything to the dairy farmer is an increase in the basic price of his milk.  The heifer scheme will not effect any great improvement. The grants are wholly inadequate.  The first and most important step is to give the dairy farmer an economic basic price for his milk.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the farmer will have to be compensated for the extra trouble the production of high quality milk entails.  I agree with the recommendation of the survey team that a bonus be paid on a special grade of high quality milk.  Thirdly, there is need for credit facilities.  I stated here before that I have plenty of evidence to show that a large proportion of the dairy farmers have obtained the maximum credit they could obtain.</P>
    <P>If we are to effect all these improvements and reach the target set out in the Blue Book, there will have to be an improvement in the credit facilities available at the moment.  I have been told&mdash;I have not had time to check&mdash;that interest rates on agricultural credit here are the highest of any agricultural nation in Europe.  I am also told that the agricultural credit available in Denmark, one of our biggest competitors, carries an interest rate of 1½ to two per cent. From that point of view alone, the suggestion made by the Leader of the main Opposition, Deputy Dillon, with regard to the provision of £1,000 interest-free loans for farmers is wholly excellent and I was surprised that there was so much criticism of the suggestion by the Government Party. Deputies on both sides who are familiar with the present set-up in the creamery areas will agree that improved <Col N="1811" /> credit facilities are very much needed.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, there is need for advisory services.  The survey team were concerned mainly with advice being made available to farmers to enable them to produce the quality milk now so necessary.  I am in complete agreement with that.  There is need for advice on the efficient operation of new machinery and equipment.  I have known dairy farmers to install milking equipment without receiving proper instruction on the actual operation of that machinery; the results were disastrous. There is need for advice on hygiene, avoiding diseases like mastitis, and so on.  I am in complete agreement with the need for providing adequate advisory services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the dairying industry, the survey team deals at length with the present organisation of the creamery industry.  They say there are too many small units.  They recommend that a considerable number of creamery premises be closed down and that processing should be concentrated on large centrally situated units.  They recommend that the present method whereby producers carry their milk to the creamery should give way to alternative methods of milk collection.  A number of such methods are dealt with, such as bulk transport by tanker and multi-can haulage.  The team has not given any comparative costs.  I know one place in Limerick where multi-can haulage is in operation.  The cost is 1½d per gallon.  The IAOS has supplied me with figures for operations of this kind in other places; 2d per gallon is the average cost of transport. It must be remembered that the distance at present is not a long one because in the intensive dairving areas one does not have to travel very far before one finds a creamery.  The question is: what will it cost to transport that milk a much longer distance to the larger centrally-situated processing unit intake point, the intake being anything from 15 million to 20 million gallons?  It will cost a good deal more.</P>
    <P>There are also the costings which have been done by the IAOS which show that the present system of cream <Col N="1812" /> separating station is operating for under a penny a gallon.  So that the suggestion that the small creameries be closed down and processing be concentrated does not seem to stand up to any analysis in the matter of costs.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, it is significant that the four organisations, the National Farmers Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, the Irish Creamery Managers Association and the IAOS, while admitting that there will be examples of small creameries which could economically be closed down, do not accept this suggestion that the wholesale closing down of the small creameries and the substitution of bulk transport for the present method will achieve any worthwhile economies.</P>
    <P>I am trying to be as fair as possible and I have expressed agreement with a number of the findings, but one of the worst features of the report is the apparently hostile attitude of the survey team towards the co-operative idea of organisation.  The report shows a complete misunderstanding of the principles and practices of co-operative undertakings.  The members of the survey team have shown a lack of appreciation and understanding of the basic principles applying to co-operative organisation and they also appear to know little or nothing about the practical working of the committees of co-operative creameries.</P>
    <P>In one part of the report a suggestion is made that if the creamery industry had been organised on non-co-operative lines it would have developed very differently and of course, by implication, with better efficiency.  This attitude of hostility towards the co-operative idea of organisation is very difficult to understand because throughout the report reference is made to the efficiency of the Danish dairying industry and the team seems to have forgotten that the Danish dairying industry is organised almost entirely on co-operative lines.</P>
    <P>While the survey team dealt at length with the co-operatives and succeeded, I must say, in showing them up in a very poor light, very little reference was made to the Dairy Disposal Company which is responsible <Col N="1813" /> for 25 per cent of the intake in the creamery areas.  The Dairy Disposal Company was in an ideal position to take the initiative in pioneering new developments in the creamery industry as it possessed both vertical and horizontal integration but what steps have the company taken to rationalise the creamery industry?  What are its costings?  How does the fact that in County Clare it controls the dairying industry from three centres help in the matter of economy?  Is it not a fact that the co-operative creameries, by and large, pay a better price to the producer than the Dairy Disposal Company pay?</P>

      <P>I said was it not a fact.  Is it a fact?  I know of one particular case in County Limerick where a small co-operative creamery with an intake of 750,000 gallons is paying a higher price than the Dairy Disposal Company pay three miles away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Minister.  I cannot understand why the survey team should have adopted this attitude to the co-operative idea of organisation.  Again, the survey team is critical of the co-operative for their lack of mutual co-operation.I do not think that this criticism is fully merited.  There is considerable scope for greater co-operation between the co-operatives and between the Dairy Disposal Company and the co-operative societies and, in fact, there are a number of examples of where this inter-co-operative approach has been very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing I did not like about the report&mdash;and, of course, it was a logical sequence to the criticism of the co-operative idea of organisation&mdash;is that it made only very little reference to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and, in fact, ignored completely the outstanding services which this organisation has given to the <Col N="1814" /> dairying industry.  Every dairy farmer, every member of a creamery committee, everyone associated with the dairying industry is aware of the tremendous service that has been given by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society in the matter of promoting co-operatives and I was surprised here last week to hear one Deputy from the opposite benches&mdash;I think it was my friend Deputy Gibbons&mdash;saying something to the effect that he did not think the IAOS was doing a lot for the dairying industry.  It might be no harm to place on record some of the contributions and some of the services which the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society have rendered to the dairy farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>The IAOS has been responsible for promoting greater co-operation among the co-operatives to which I have already referred.  There is an outstanding example in my part of the country in the Golden Vale Food Products, which is an organisation of 16 co-operative creameries which is engaged in the processing of milk products. The IAOS has pioneered the use of whey and other by-products in the dairying industry for pig feeding.  It has been responsible to a large extent for the growth and expansion of the artificial insemination stations.  It has given day-to-day guidance to the various creamery societies throughout the country.  One would expect that a survey team examining the dairying industry would at least give credit where credit is due.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, and most of the people engaged in dairy farming and in the creamery business with whom I have discussed it are likewise convinced, that the reorganisation of the creameries suggested in this report will definitely not yield the economies which the team think they will yield.</P>
    <P>But there is another place where there is room for considerable improvement.There is considerable scope for rationalising the processing of dairy products.  The manner in which the processing plants are at present organised and, in fact, in many cases, their location, leave much to be desired.  I have no doubt at all that considerable economies could be effected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> This whole question of the rationalising of the processing of dairy products is tied up with another important problem, that of diversification.These words &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;diversification&rdquo; have been bandied about quite a lot.  We have all been speaking about them and we may not have been fully aware of all the implications.  I have advocated diversification and rationalisation myself, but it is not as easy as some people seem to think it is because it is a fact that in most of the major dairying countries butter is the dairy product.  We ourselves are not alone in that.  I have figures here which show that in New Zealand 80 per cent of manufactured milk is turned into butter.  In Denmark, it is 72 per cent and here in Ireland it is 81 per cent, so that while we should be looking out for opportunities to divert as much milk as possible into products other than butter, we must at the same time not lose sight of the fact that butter is, and will in the foreseeable future remain, the dairy product.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad to read of the success of the Kerrygold campaign in the north of England.  It is true to say that if the prices obtained there for our butter can be maintained, there is no more economic outlet for milk. People are under a very big misappre-hension about this whole question of diversifying milk to products other than butter.  I heard a statement made that butter was a dead loss but I do not think that is so.  As I have said already, while butter will remain the dairy product, we should at all times be on the lookout for opportunities to divert milk from butter into other products, provided the other products guarantee an economic outlet.</P>
    <P>On the question of rationalisation, I believe that there is hope for this.  I am always very conscious of the fact that in the premier dairying county of Limerick, the vast proportion of the milk being produced there is being transported long journeys.  Some of our milk from the local co-op is going 70 miles to Rathmore to be processed into chocolate crumb and then transported to Dublin.  There should be <Col N="1816" /> room for improvement and certainly for economies in this direction.  I also read recently that a milk powder plant has been established in the Minister's county of Cavan.  Is it not true that there are a number of milk powder plants in the south of Ireland which are operating well under their full capacity?  Is it not also a fact that the creameries in the west and north-west of Ireland are not able to produce sufficient butter to meet the needs of those areas?  Is it not true that a considerable amount of butter is being transported from the south of Ireland to the western and north-western counties?  Surely there is room for rationalisation there?  We should exercise extreme care and caution in the matter of locating milk-processing plants.  We have seen what happened in Drumkeen and in Wexford.  Extreme care should be taken to avoid a repetition of those failures.</P>
    <P>Another little example of where rationalisation is needed is the fact that while there is no restriction on the haulage of whole milk, there is a restriction on the haulage of cream.  I know one co-operative society in County Limerick which for the past couple of years has been buying the entire cream output of three small auxiliary creameries in the area and it was prevented from utilising the cheapest transport it could have got. There is room for rationalisation there, too.</P>
    <P>I feel that the ideal set-up so far as the processing of dairy products goes, and the way in which rationalisation can be carried out most effectively, is in the type of set-up to which I have already referred at Rathluirc; Mitchelstown is another example, although it is organised as a co-operative on slightly different lines.  If we can encourage this type of co-operative organisation for the purpose of processing dairy products and if the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society is given the necessary finance and powers to achieve it, then rationalisation in the entire dairying industry will take place gradually and logically without any disruption.</P>
    <P>The marketing of dairy products is a very important matter and, as I <Col N="1817" /> have already said, I am particularly glad at the progress made in the campaign in the north of England.  I am delighted to pay tribute to Mr. O'Reilly for the tremendous work he has done, not alone in the Kerrygold campaign in the north of England but in opening up new markets for butter and other dairy products in so many different countries.We have got to a state when in order to meet the present order book, we will need an increase of something about 20 million gallons in 1964.</P>
    <P>I did notice, whether it was in the Minister's speech or in the newspapers, a statement by the Minister to the effect that a campaign would be initiated here in 1964 to create a greater awareness of the value of dairy products. While we have the largest <i>per capita</i> consumption of butter in the world, our cheese consumption is very low. I do not think there is a general awareness of the nutritional value of milk and dairy products, and particularly of cheese.  Propaganda, publicity and perhaps education would have an effect in making people more aware of the nutritional value of milk and dairy products.</P>
    <P>There is one chapter in this report which contains two recommendations that have found universal agreement. Nobody can disagree with them.  One is that improved laboratory facilities should be made available for the testing of milk and dairy products and the other, that there should be adequate research facilities.  The survey team in recommendation 27, paragraph 179, recommended that the accommodation and staffing of butter-testing stations should be increased and that a number of regional laboratories should be provided for chemical and bacteriological analysis of controlled samples of dairy produce.  This is absolutely necessary.  The other recommendation is in paragraphs 221 and 227 on page 45: &ldquo;That provision should be made to service the industry adequately with research facilities&rdquo;.  These two things are vitally essential to the further progress of the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at length with the dairying industry and I do not intend to go into the bacon industry in anything <Col N="1818" /> like the same detail.  The recent development by the co-operative creameries of pig-fattening stations is an ideal one and will have a very vital effect on the future development and expansion of pig numbers and bacon output.  The scheme whereby the creameries have set up large fattening units utilising the by-products of the dairying industry and lease progeny-tested sows to local farmers is an ideal set-up and should hold out great hope for the future of the industry.</P>
    <P>I wish now to make one or two points of a general nature.  I have already referred to the question of advisory services in connection with the dairying industry but these are specialist services.  The advisory services generally are totally inadequate and the system of appointing instructors on a temporary basis was a bad one. A considerable improvement has been effected in that matter in the past year or two but the system was bad because the adviser who was appointed on a temporary basis did not get sufficient time to see the plans which he had initiated come to fruition.  I want to repeat what I said on the occasion of this debate last year, that the general idea behind the parish plan was a good one.</P>
    <P>One of the great advantages of that plan was that it brought the adviser into intimate contact with the local community over a limited area and he was therefore much better able to understand the economic, social and psychological problems of that area. It was a tragedy to scrap it and the Minister and the Department should have second thoughts about that decision.I know there was a number of problems associated with the parish plan, such as the duplication of services and the question of whether it should be directed from Merrion Street, but all these were difficulties which could have been overcome.  The idea of an adviser working in close co-operation with a local community and as a member of that community was a good one.  The basic idea behind the parish plan has been confirmed over and over again in recent years by the mass of documentation from community <Col N="1819" /> development experiments in various parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make has to do with co-operation.  I notice from the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> that an examination of the possibilities of co-operation was being made by an American expert.  I do not think there was any need to bring in an American expert to examine the possibilities for co-operation here. From my knowledge, there are officials in the Department of Agriculture who have experience in the field as parish agents or as instructors promoting co-operation among producers.  A number of them have studied the co-operative movement abroad and I cannot see where the need was to bring in the American expert to tell us how we might encourage our farmers to co-operate.</P>
    <P>An adequate advisory service and the promotion of co-operation among our farmers are two very important matters.  To show that I am not speaking here in a merely academic manner, I should like briefly to tell the House of a practical experiment in co-operation with which I happen to be closely associated.  A group of ten farmers in my parish came together a few years ago and discussed ways and means as to how they might combine to produce more efficiently.  We realised early on that the success of the experiment would depend on the availability of specialist advisers.  On representations being made to the Limerick County Committee of Agriculture, one of their advisers was permitted to give extra attention to this particular group.</P>
    <P>Once a fortnight for the past three years, that group has held a meeting with the adviser, alternating from house to house, and after those three years, the adviser has reported that production has been increased by 43 per cent.  That is a perfect example of the value of co-operation and the specialist services in getting more efficient production.  There was one flaw in all this, that with that 43 per cent increase at the end of three years, with two further years to go in our five year plan, the adviser <Col N="1820" /> obtained a permanent appointment in the midlands and we were faced with the possibility of his leaving.  We are hoping that as a result of representations, he will be allowed to remain on but that bears out the point that the temporary appointments were a bad idea.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was a disappointment because it omitted reference to a number of important issues. On the whole we can say that there is nothing in the Minister's speech to indicate new thinking on the development of our major national industry. There is no indication of a new or more enlightened approach to the economic or social problems of rural Ireland.  Certainly there is no attempt to overcome the farmers' lack of confidence in the present administration, or no evidence of the dynamic leadership which is now so necessary if agriculture is to expand.</P>
    <P>I believe the biggest task confronting those charged with the responsibility of looking after our major national industry and of developing and expanding it to the fullest, is to create incentives and a climate of opinion which will make progress possible. This can be done only by dynamic leadership and a rational Government policy.  Unfortunately, there seems to be very little hope of achieving this while we have an urban-minded Taoiseach who on numerous occasions has shown a lack of understanding and knowledge of the problems inherent in farming.  We have the greater misfortune of having a Minister for Agriculture who has been openly hostile to the farmers' organisation.  As I said, I believe the targets set out in the Blue Book on economic expansion can be achieved, provided we get a rational Government policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I often wonder if it would be better to stop the clocks in this House because obviously very few people can read them.  I have great sympathy for the Minister because I realise he is operating under great difficulties.  Judging by the number of Deputies who waited here all day for this important debate and by the even <Col N="1821" /> smaller number of spectators in the Public Gallery who took an interest in it, I am inclined to say if something happens, may God help agriculture. Were it not for the fact that the bells were out of order today and were ringing continuously, would anybody have been here at all?</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that in this country agriculture is so much different from its counterpart in other countries.  It always appears to me that the people who know most about agriculture, that is, if we are to take them seriously, are people who have no association with agriculture at all.  We appear to be the best country in the world for theoretical farmers and, I suppose, the worst for practical farmers.  At least we appear to have very few practical farmers but then I suppose it is often difficult to blame the farmers because in most cases they are very seriously misled.  If anybody goes to a farmers' meeting, will he find a farmer in the chair, or a farmer acting as secretary, or even a farmer acting as treasurer, if one becomes necessary?  He will not. But did anybody in this House ever see a farmer as chairman of the IMA, or chairman of the INTO, or put in charge of the Ecumenical Council or anything like that?  No.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that as far as advisers on the agricultural side of our lives are concerned, they are all people having no association with farming.  Only a week ago, we had a homemade general down the country talking homemade agricultural economics to the farmers and promising them £1,000 free credit.  On the other hand, when the same gentleman had the power to give them something, he could not give them a 2d stamp. Are the farmers daft that they are going to be misled by that type of misrepresentation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a few big meetings in the west of Ireland recently all aimed, moryah, at helping farmers but really aimed at helping the people who convened the meeting, shopkeepers, teachers, doctors and priests.  None of them wanted to lose his clients and they impressed very forcibly on the farmers that if they grew sufficient carrots, their future would be assured. <Col N="1822" /> I can well imagine any Mayo man weeding carrots, growing them for an undisclosed profit, while he has much more remunerative methods of making money without accepting advice from those who know nothing about farming.I hope the farmers of Mayo and the farmers generally will have enough commonsense to pursue the policy they believe is right and not allow themselves to be dictated to by people who are just trying to use them as pawns in a game, be it political or economic.</P>
    <P>It is time somebody spoke out on this because those people are being misled and the Department of Agriculture is often being held up to ridicule wrongly.  It is unfortunate that due to circumstances in the past, over which we had no control, and the denudation of the country, there is a great imbalance in the farming community whose numbers are very dense in the bad lands of the west and very small in the good lands of the midlands.  That imbalance will have to be corrected. I do not mind whether it is the priest, the doctor, or the shopkeeper who is concerned.  There is only one solution for agriculture, that is, to send back to the good lands of the midlands the people who were chased out of those lands by Cromwell and his like.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the people of the midlands who look down on us, and who have tried to prevent us from getting back, I want to say that there has been only a very rare case of failure among the people who have left my county.  I have gone to the trouble of seeing these people in their new homes and on their new farms.  Those farms are unfortunately still too small but the few that have been taken up here are doing more for agriculture than all those who have been in the midlands for the past five centuries. The more who are taken back there, the sooner will agriculture be put on a proper footing.  Unless they are brought back, unless those estates are divided up and given out to these people, agriculture will never come to anything here.</P>
    <P>What kind of agriculture have we in the midlands?  For the want of a better description, I will call it a butter and cream agriculture.  Surely it is well known today that cream and milk can <Col N="1823" /> be processed into other things besides butter?  It is extraordinary in a world where practically half the people are half-starved that we, who have the best land in Europe&mdash;perhaps in the world&mdash;cannot supply our goods competitively to world markets.  I listened for over an hour to Deputy O'Donnell talking about the Golden Vale.  The grass grows there in spite of them.  If we in the west had that land and that grass, we would not be here preaching poverty like some of the midland people have been preaching since I came in here today.  Indeed, we would be well off.  If a man with 35 cows is looking for Government softness, there must be something wrong with him; he is not doing his duty.  If any man in my constituency could be assured of keeping ten milch cows, he would not be coming here craving Government assistance.</P>
    <P>When I go through the midlands, what do I find among these alleged farmers?  They do no work.  They spend one half of the year going to the races and the other half going to funerals, and a few hours at Mass.  That is their sole contribution to the agricultural output of this country.  They have not even the gumption to pay a proper rate of wages to their workers.  Those are the people who come along in their Mercedes and other posh cars and have the effrontery to accuse the Government of not treating them properly.  I see no reason why they should be assisted at State expense.</P>
    <P>I know poor people who came up from my constituency to 35 acres in the midlands.  They are not looking for soft money from anybody.  They go out and work.  They have their crops saved in time and are not afraid to work.  They are an example to the fellows who have been preying on the Government and on the ordinary people for far too long.  There is a scheme for everything.  In fact, we are more and more becoming a nation of &ldquo;schemers&rdquo; and nothing else.  They would not get out of bed in the morning if there was not some kind of scheme behind them.  They would not baptise their children without a scheme of children's allowances.  The whole thing is crackers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1824" /> It looks nice on paper to say that £39 million will be made available by the Government, but I should like some kind of assurance that £38 million of that will not go to the big farmers in the midlands and £1 million to the poor farmers in the west.  I am sorry the Minister is not here because I would like an assurance that there would be a reasonable distribution of this money&mdash;that it would go to the people who really want it and not to the people who have already got heaps of it or, if they have not, it is because they lost it on horses and not on agriculture.  I should like an assurance that it will go to the poorer farmers and not to the armchair farmers in the midlands who, because they have money already, can take full advantage of these schemes.  If a man has money he has no trouble in making money.  If a scheme is introduced, there should be a difference in its allocation as between the man in the west and the man in the midlands. The man in the midlands can get £5,000 in a scheme in which the man in the west cannot get even £50.  That is something which badly needs reexamination.I am completely in agreement with the new heifer grant. It should have been introduced long ago.  But again only the big man can take advantage of it.  The Minister should be careful to ensure that that will not happen.</P>
    <P>There are many glaring deficiencies so far as the Department of Agriculture are concerned.  They have spent millions trying to eradicate bovine TB.  If the west is free, how long will it remain so, in view of the present attitude of the Department?  Anybody who wishes to smuggle a calf can smuggle all the calves he wishes across the Shannon at any hour of the night.  I cross that river twice and sometimes four times a week.  I have never yet been held up, and I could have six or seven calves in the boot of my car.  With this new £15 scheme, every cow in the west will suddenly calve.  We know what happened in the North.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in saving the Government £15 a calf.  However, if a reactor is found in a man's herd in the west, he will not be able to sell <Col N="1825" /> again for a long period.  That will be very serious.  At present, a calf can be at least 12 months before it is tagged.  That certainly leaves things very open to all types of devilment, to put it mildly.  The inspectors have been stopped from tagging the calves. They should be sent out to tag them as soon as possible.  The present position is leaving a very wide gap for the reintroduction of bovine TB in the west.  What I am saying will not go down well with all the farmers, but if they have commonsense, they will see the point of it.  If these gentlemen have to spend two years without selling an animal, they will see that what I am saying is correct.  In my area, 6,000 or 7,000 calves are born each year.  It would only cost a few shillings each to tag them.  It is fantastic that the present position should be allowed.</P>
    <P>One thing that gets my goat is the tremendous amount of money lost to agriculture because we are not exporting whiskey in the quantity we should. Scotland can sell millions of pounds worth of whisky to America.  But we are the pioneers so far as whiskey is concerned.  Today you have these hoary, old whiskey barons who believe whiskey should be as old as themselves before anyone can drink it.  They are codding themselves as well as the Irish farmers because our people who are in large numbers in England and America and Scotland taste Scotch whisky and when they come back here, they buy it and that is costing Irish farmers many a pound because the produce of their land will not be bought and the sales of Irish whiskey are reduced.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why these people cannot produce whiskey readily saleable or why they cannot take 20 times as much produce from the farmers for whiskey production.  If any man here had the option of a glass of poteen or a glass of whiskey, he would immediately take poteen.  The Minister or somebody should remedy this grave injustice to farmers because the whiskey barons, as I know them, are already well-off and do not trouble to get markets for their products.  They <Col N="1826" /> are doing well enough.  We should be able to produce whiskey to sell in Britain and the US without any difficulty.</P>
    <P>Another thing which must affect many midland farmers&mdash;it does not greatly affect my people&mdash;is the manufacture of sugar.  There is no reason why any sugar should be produced here except from sugar beet and for the sake of the few people permanently employed in a few factories through taking stuff from Dr. Castro and his friends, I think this is a great injustice to our farmers who should be asked to provide sufficient sugar for all our requirements.</P>
    <P>We all know the nonsense that goes on regarding wheat.  Anybody with money can buy all the conacre he wants and if God is on his side, he cannot go wrong with the guaranteed price.  That is not fair, as it puts Irish farmers out of a livelihood.  Most of these big people are English people or doctors or Dublin businessmen.  I know many of them.  Somebody should take steps to eliminate this business.  If beet can be grown by contract, why not wheat?  It is time something was done about it.</P>
    <P>Most of what I say has probably been said by others but I probably have a different viewpoint.  I notice that the Department will move a man from the west of Ireland from a place worth £150 to £400 and give him a place worth, perhaps, £5,000.  While the Minister will give a grant for drainage of land in the west, he gives no grant to grow grass although thousands of acres of bog extend from the farms around Erris and other such areas.  With grants, these lands could be seeded, fertilised and made to grow grass, and if the Minister provided such grants, he would benefit not only the people there but many others, as the owners would not be anxious to leave their holdings if they could be enlarged.</P>
    <P>Some of the schemes are so stupid that only people with brains, down in the west, can see how mad they are. Why not give grants to turn bogland into grassland, which it has been proved can be done?  It grows so <Col N="1827" /> quickly they cannot keep it down. They give semi-free seed which is not a great benefit when it is the endproduct that should be subsidised if we were sensible.  Why not subsidise the potatoes produced rather than provide free seed?  Everybody would be satisfied and only the man determined to do a good job would take the seed. There would be no case like the man who said: &ldquo;I left them to God and God left them to me and between us, they turned out a bad job.&rdquo;  If the man knew he would get a good price, he would look after the crop.</P>
    <P>The marketing techniques in the agricultural industry are either crazy or non-existent.  The best proof of that is that when Mr. O'Reilly went to sell butter, he found he could sell three times what we had.  Some Deputies did not approve: they had hoped he would be stuck with it.  That did not happen.  People should be sent out to sell other things besides butter. We have bacon, for instance.</P>
    <P>It is hard to take the pig business seriously.  It must be difficult for a man to produce the type of pig he is being told to produce when he never tastes it.  I have a document here and on page 10, there is some kind of formula which I guarantee no man or woman listening would be able to comply with to get a pig to qualify for the maximum price at a bacon factory. It is like something you would see at Cape Canaveral where they send up spaceships.  It is crazy.  If the bacon is that good, why not let us taste it? Then we might be inclined to produce it.  As it is, if you want to sole your shoes or put a gaiter in a tyre, you could not get better stuff than what we get in the west of Ireland.  Send us some grade A 1 pigs and let us taste the meat.</P>
    <P>Many a farmer will agree with what I say because while he is supposed to produce this type of pig, he does not know what it is.  Only in Dublin do they know, apparently, and yet what I get here is just as bad as what I get in the west.  Why does the Department not do something?  Why not put this famous bacon which they say the British have gone daft about on our <Col N="1828" /> own tables?  That might make quite a difference.  The farmers will produce pigs if it is economic but they are very suspicious of the activities of the factories.  If the factories decided to buy pigs liveweight, that, alone, I think would mean a substantial increase in the number of pigs.  As it is, one man sends off a pig and gets Grade A 1: another, whose pig seems better, gets Grade B 2 or something like that.  What is the first man to do on the next occasion when he finds this difference in price?  If they all sold them there on the spot liveweight, even if they lost money, there would be no grievance.  There would be an incentive to rear pigs.  Some genius who never saw a pig except in a picture or a drawing had this brainwave.The pigs are measured.  Because one pig is an inch and a half longer than another pig does not mean that the bacon will taste differently.</P>
    <P>Whom do these people think they are codding?  They are codding only themselves but the unfortunate thing is they are destroying an industry which could be worth millions of pounds. The people are being made mugs of. It is time someone spoke out about the hypocrisy that is going on.  No matter what is said about the farmers, they are the best workers in the country. They survived all kinds of persecution and, were it not for the farmers, we would have no nation today.  There must be something wrong when they complain, despite the fact that they are in fairly good circumstances.  If commonsense prevailed, instead of bribes and doles, they would very soon get on their feet.  I am not criticising the present Minister.  We have had worse than he.  We had the Minister for Grass, the Minister for Calves, the Minister for Drains, the Minister for Eggs, and so on.  But the present Minister will have to do something to appease the farmers.  Schemes are all right, but they are drawn up by schemers.</P>
    <P>I come to the funny side of Agriculture now.  I do not know who produced this document.  I know it was not the Minister.  I wonder did he read it?  It is one of the funniest documents I have ever read.  How does anyone know exactly how many milch <Col N="1829" /> cows, or heifers, or calves there are in the country?  How does anyone know there are so many cattle over one year and under two years, over two years and under three years?  Perhaps it is possible to compute these figures, but the man who knows the number of sheep in the country is a genius.  He should get full marks.  So should the man who knows the number of ducks. I have six ducks and I am certain they are not on this list.  The man who knows the number of geese&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is someone here in this city who needs to have his head examined.  What man knows for certain that there were 767,200 ducks in the country in 1956 and there are 337,000 in the country today?  It is time there was an end to this codology. I do not mind civil servants sitting in an office having a soft time trying to cod the public, but they will not cod me.  Here we have the number of acres of grass.  From the figures given, it is clear the country is nearly once and a half as big again as it is.  If this sort of thing does not end, if these figures are produced again next year, and I am here, I shall not let them go as lightly as I have this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want an explanation as to how the Minister can know the number of <Col N="1830" /> ordinary fowl or how he can state that they dropped from 13,527,200 in 1956 to 10,638,300 this year.  I know there is not a hen in the parish in which I live on that list.  I know there are many hens in other parishes which have not had the honour of being recorded here.  I am sure there is many a missing duck and many a missing goose.  I ask the Minister to eliminate this stupid nonsense in future.  If there is not some absolutely certain method of computing these figures, then they should not be put before us at all.</P>
    <P>As far as I remember, these statistics started in 1926.  Members of the Garda Síochána were sent out to get them. The garda went into the first house and it depended on what that man thought of his neighbours as to what figures appeared, but I can assure the House he always gave far more animals to his neighbours than he gave to himself.  It is on that kind of record the Department of Agriculture is still operating.  I ask the Minister to get proper figures, throw these into the fire and stop insulting our intelligence.</P>

      <P>A feature of the speeches from Fine Gael benches right through the year has been the alleged bankruptcy brought about generally and, in particular, in agriculture, by Fianna Fáil policy.  Last week, I listened to Deputy Donegan, shadow Minister for Agriculture in Fine Gael, enunciating Fine Gael policy.  He formulated so many schemes that, on one hand, he was like a tape recorder gone wrong and, on the other hand, he talked in so many millions he was like a slot machine gone wrong.  He did not have to put the penny in.  The millions rolled out.</P>
      <P>Where was he going to get them if the position of the country is as we have been told week after week, month after month?  But if Fianna Fáil went out and Deputy Donegan came back, in a week he was going to find money by the million.  Of course, there was this difference&mdash;the difference between promise and performance.  His memory must be very short.  He should well remember the difficulties into which his Leader ran when he was Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a speech made by <Col N="1831" /> Deputy Dillon to the County Waterford Committee of Agriculture in Dungarvan.  He made a proposal to the dairy farmers of Ireland, a proposal which he called a new charter of freedom, that would usher in for the dairying industry in Ireland a golden era.  The proposal which he made was almost to coax the dairy farmers to accept a reduction of twopence a gallon.  That was the difference between promise and performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The price existing at that time was 1/2d a gallon.  So that the prosperity which Deputy Dillon was asking the dairy farmers to accept was, in effect, a cut of twopence a gallon.  That was the difference between Deputy Donegan's promise and Deputy Dillon's performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time Deputy <Col N="1832" /> Dillon made this offer of 290/- a cwt for butter, it was a wrapped up figure. Its impact as far as the price per gallon was concerned did not reveal itself immediately to the dairy farmers because many of them did not know what 290/- a cwt for butter represented per gallon of milk.  From statistics available at the time and from the returns made from creameries, we know that it takes 256 gallons of milk to make one cwt of butter.  That is an accepted figure.  That left 34/- for manufacturing costs, packaging, transport and all other incidentals.</P>
      <P>On the returns made at that time to the Department of Agriculture by 156 creameries, 52 creameries, at 290/- a cwt for butter, could barely pay 1/- a gallon for milk and on the costings which 104 creameries returned they could pay only from 8½d. to 11¾d. That was the difference between promise and performance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon had his opportunity to do something for the dairy farmers. Remember, they represent, in the main, the very small farmers in our agricultural set-up.  Dairying is of itself a small-farm business.  The offer which Deputy Dillon had to make to the little farmers at the foot of the Knockmealdowns, the Maharees, the Comeraghs, away in Rockchapel and other places in the recesses of West Cork was a cut of 2d a gallon in those 52 creameries which showed the best economic return in relation to manufacture costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The conclusion is quite untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the conclusion. The figures cannot be refuted.  Deputy Donegan spoke in terms of millions. There were millions, millions, millions. Again, of course, it was promise.  If Deputy Donegan should by any chance become Minister for Agriculture, once he got there his excuse would be again that the economy of the country was in such a state after Fianna Fáil that he could not put all the grand schemes he had enunciated into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, when answering a deputation of creamery milk producers refused their request on the grounds <Col N="1833" /> that his predecessor had been far too generous.  At that time the subvention from the Exchequer was approximately £3 million.  Today the subvention is over £6 million, showing that as far as the dairy farmer is concerned he did much better with Fianna Fáil than he did with Fine Gael or than he could hope to do with Deputy Donegan as Minister for Agriculture. That is the difference between promise and performance.</P>
    <P>In the national economy, dairying and its allied industry, cattle, represent something in the region of 50 per cent of our total national output.  That includes, of course, processing industries based on milk and milk products. I listened to Deputy T. O'Donnell speaking about dairying, coming as he does from Limerick which he calls the premier dairying county.  He was trying to make an analogy between Ireland as a butter producer and New Zealand.  He was arguing because of course most of the creameries in County Limerick are butter producers and it would suit his political line to advocate the manufacture of butter, and he was making a comparison between the very large amount of milk manufactured into butter in New Zealand, and arguing that in Ireland we should continue to do the same.</P>
    <P>One of the things that Deputy T. O'Donnell forgot was that the New Zealanders produce approximately 200 lbs of butter fat per acre while here in Ireland we produce about 50 lbs.  Those two figures would leave that argument completely bottomless. In terms of milk production per cow it would probably be unfair to make comparison between milk production here and in New Zealand because most of the New Zealand dairy cows are Jersey cows with a very high butter fat yield.  A fairer comparison would be between Ireland, Denmark and Holland.  The recent figures are: Ireland, approximately 450 gallons per cow; Denmark, 750 gallons; and Holland about 840.  No matter what we do or say, or what kind of argument we put up to suit the particular types of dairying in our constituencies, in the final analysis, when we come to export any milk product no matter <Col N="1834" /> what State support is given, we will still be in competition with those very efficient milk producers.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell talked at length about the creamery pattern in County Limerick.  One of the things he did not say was that 70 per cent of Limerick creameries are within four miles of one another and the remaining 30 per cent are within six miles. Any person knows that those creameries were located for pony, horse or donkey transport, and now many of those creameries are only collecting centres where milk is collected and transported in bulk to manufacturing plants 30 to 60 miles away.  Many more of them have as their only equipment a rotary churn to produce butter.  He said that all the farmers' organisations in County Limerick were quite satisfied with the pattern of the setup there. I do not know if any one of the representative groups of farmers' organisations in these counties ever studied the report to which he was referring in relation to those creameries.  Many of those creameries are protected by the peculiar structure of our dairying industry: No. 1, they are protected by the fact that we have price support; and No. 2, and this is one of the main factors in their protection, the supplier is stuck to a particular creamery.  He cannot switch from the creamery to which he is connected even though it is inefficient and there is a much more efficient one within a reasonable distance of him.</P>
    <P>Again, there was the implication that it was a job for the Minister for Agriculture.Is it not a job for the farmers' organisations in the area?  Must they not realise that corresponding organisations in other countries have a sane, rational approach in relation to the streamlining of the dairying industry? We know quite well that six or eight years ago the Danes did what it has now been proposed to do in the report to which Deputy T. O'Donnell referred.  We cannot have small, uneconomic creameries.  The net result is that in the final analysis the least economic ones and their suppliers will be the first to scream for another increase in the price of milk, because their price will be lower than that of <Col N="1835" /> the more efficient ones, and right along it is the State and the taxpayer who must compensate the supplier for the inefficiency of the unit or the incompetence of the creamery manager.</P>
    <P>If in eight or ten years' time we have to come in to a European Economic Community, can we with that kind of structure face the highly developed and highly organised dairying structures of the countries with which we will have to compete?  Of course we cannot.  It is very easy to get up and say that the local creamery must be preserved as if it were a parish hall or a social centre. Even at four miles apart in the area when you look at the average creamery, you will see tractors and trailers pulled by motor cars.  You see very few horses.</P>
    <P>Again, of course, there was a reference to bulk collection.  If our dairy industry is sensible, if our farmers' organisations are sensible, they must ultimately come to some Minister for Agriculture with some rational scheme. These units are too small and do nothing but collect milk and sell it and have it taken 30 or 40 miles away to manufacturing units.  With all these small co-operative societies which is the pattern in County Limerick, in parts of Tipperary and indeed in parts of Cork county, they will, if they are sensible, have to get together and produce some rational scheme whereby those small units can be at least federated together and some processing unit can be erected to serve the small units that come into the federation.</P>
    <P>One of the things necessary as far as milk and dairy products are concerned is that we must be geared to manufacture that milk product which will give to the producer the highest prices and which has the easiest sale in whatever markets are available. That cannot be done with a small unit. You must have a central processing unit that will be at least viable enough to process milk into the product which will give the best price on the market. The small unit can never hope to give the help and advice which the bigger unit can give to its suppliers.  To <Col N="1836" /> argue along the lines argued by Deputy T. O'Donnell, that all these small creameries, 60 per cent of them four miles apart and the remainder six miles apart, could compete against the Danes, is hopeless argument.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, whoever he may be, who is going to take the step of bringing in some reasonable and rational arrangement in this regard is going to be in trouble.  We all know that many of the promoters of these small creameries have no business training whatever.  Many of these people stick out their chests and say that they are directors of such and such a co-op but they have no business training and the supreme authority is the creamery manager.  He is a Rainier in his own Monaco.  He is the boss in his own republic and he will condition the shareholders and members of that co-operative.  It is illogical and unreasonable for any of us who have any idea of the problems facing Irish dairying in a competitive European market to argue along the lines argued by Deputy T. O'Donnell.  If the Irish dairy farmer is found inefficient against that competition, he will scream and then the Government must cushion him, and must continue to cushion him, because of his lack of efficiency and of competence.</P>
    <P>There is a big number of people engaged in the dairying industry in this country.  I have seen a figure of 100,000 Irish farmers producing milk for creameries and 10,000 producing milk for distribution.  There are 4,500 people employed either directly or indirectly in the creameries and processing industries associated with milk.  One of the extraordinary features of our eating habits here is that we are the second largest consumers of butter in the world.  We eat about 40 lbs of butter per head per year.  We almost eat ourselves out of house and home when it comes to butter.  A contrasting figure is the consumption of cheese. With those 40 lbs of butter, we eat only two lbs of cheese per head.  The Americans eat 12 lbs of butter per head and 18 lbs of cheese.  That is an extraordinary difference in the eating habits of two people and I often wonder what the reason is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> I am glad the Minister has considered setting up this body, which, it is hoped, will make milk products popular.  I often wonder why many of the people concerned in the liquid milk trade have not made an effort in this direction.  In Britain, I have seen milk obtainable in cartons by putting 6d into a slot machine on the roadway. One of the features of restaurants and snackbars all over the place is the milk shake.  Flavoured milk is sold in practically every snack bar and restaurant and one of the things that amazes me is why, in our major centres of population, we have not been able to push the sale of flavoured milk as they do over there.  If the Minister can, through this organisation he proposes to set up, make milk popular in either liquid or manufactured form, and if he can raise the consumption of milk products other than butter, he would be contributing substantially to the dairying industry and we would be consuming a much higher proportion of our milk products here at home.</P>
    <P>As far as cheese manufacture here is concerned, the figure is over 3,000 tons per year.  Some cheese is exported but it is only a very small proportion of the 3,000 tons we produce.  Cheese is mainly consumed at home and is mainly manufactured for the home market.  Let us consider the amount of cheese manufactured and exported from Holland.  Holland represents an area the size of Munster so it represents an area which is actually the size of our main dairying area, outside the Dublin Milk Board District.  They export from that area approximately 100,000 tons of cheese.  The Danes export to all countries something between 75,000 tons and 80,000 tons of cheese.  In addition to that, the Dutch export close on £90 million worth of horticultural produce and £20 million worth of bulbs, so if we are to think in terms of intensive farming, as against extensive farming, we have the comparison of their huge exports from an area which is about the size of Munster.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Bord Bainne have at last decided to sell packaged or rolled butter.  I do not care whether they call it Kerrygold or Three Leaf Shamrock.  At least you do not have <Col N="1838" /> this crude looking 56 lb. block at the end of a counter or butter made up in rolls with no title except the rather dubious title of &ldquo;Produce of the Irish Republic&rdquo;.  At least there has been a breakthrough.  I remember that one of the things that struck me in some of the big shops in England was the attempt being made by the Danes to sell their butter.  I saw Danish butter in rolls made up in tinfoil like a packet of biscuits.  It was carried to an extreme which you would scarcely believe.  I saw the butter being sold in a self-service shop in a sealed bakelite container.</P>
    <P>Of course the temptation was there for the housewife and all she had to do was pick up her half pound, or pound, or whatever it was, put it in her bag and put it into the refrigerator when she went home.  When she wanted to use the butter, all she had to do was take it out, still in the container, and put it on the table.  That was an attempt to sell a product not alone in a package but with an added facility as far as the buyer was concerned.You will have seen the advertisement on television for margarine&mdash; I do not know whether it was Stork or some other brand; I am not allowed to advertise here&mdash;on which it is stated that it contains 10 per cent of Irish creamery butter.  That was quite a common advertisement.  I hope Bord Bainne will continue to develop a market not for bulk butter but butter in a package in the way our competitors sell their produce over there.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell, among other speakers, referred to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  I think we are all prepared to admit that we have travelled a very long way in this matter.  If we are fair, we have to give credit to the Minister and the section of his Department which deals with this problem for having done a tremendous job.  I know it has been done at considerable expense but very few people believed that we could have made the progress we have made in the time this scheme was in operation. I am glad the Minister is pushing ahead with the scheme and that purchases of infected cattle have been speeded up in the southern counties. Despite the fact that we have <Col N="1839" /> slaughtered something like half a million cows the Minister has been able to record an increase in our cow population, which is a feature we should not lose sight of.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the heifer scheme. I heard somebody over on the other side describing it as a tuppenceha'penny scheme.  Of course if you produce a scheme, no matter what its beneficial results may be finally, there is always the practice of trying to get some group discontented, trying to neutralise its value by sowing in the minds of a certain group the idea that they are being &ldquo;done&rdquo;.  I do not know if anybody ever got up here to represent the ranchers.  Did the ranchers ever have a representative in Dáil Éireann?  Was anybody ever honest enough to say: &ldquo;That poor devil wants to live too&rdquo;?  We have heard about their Mercedes and their Jaguars but because they represent only a very small fraction of the voting population they do not count.  When it comes to the man in the other section, however, his cognomen is &ldquo;poor&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;poor&rdquo; is used with a quiver in the voice and if you could persuade the poor fellow that he was being &ldquo;done&rdquo;, then no matter what the benefits of the scheme might ultimately be, you would have done something to neutralise its value and take from the credit which might be due to it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the heifer scheme, do we not all know that calves are produced not on ranches but away in the foothills and in the mountains and on the poor farms?  As I said earlier, dairying is a small farm economy.  Is there anyone here who will argue logically that if you put a bounty of £15 on a calving heifer, that portion of that £15 will not go down to the producer? Is it not going to create competition for the purchase of heifer calves? That competition is bound to inflate the prices of these calves, whether they be six months or one and a half years old.  Finally, the £15 will come to be distributed from the very bottom up.</P>
    <P>But it is a popular line, because there are more small farmers than there are ranchers.  Try to implant in <Col N="1840" /> his mind that the scheme is not for him, that he cannot get any benefit from it, and then you completely neutralise its value.  The taxpayers' money will be doled out for this scheme, and whether it amounts to £2 million or £3 million, it means that amount of money will be circulating among the agricultural community from the small fellow right up to the rancher.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the ranchers are interested in calf heifers.  I do not think the man with 300 or 400 acres is interested in them.  It is a group of people in between.  So long as you can imply that the scheme produced by the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Paddy Smith from Cavan&mdash;I do not believe there are many ranchers, in Cavan&mdash;is exclusively for ranchers, you are going to neutralise any political kudos Fianna Fáil might hope to get from it or any kudos the Minister for Agriculture might hope to get. As Deputy Sherwin says, this is part of the political gain.  You always decry, if you can, what the other fellow has done and say: &ldquo;If only I could get the chance, look at what I would do.&rdquo; Deputy Donegan is a classic example of that.  He made a speech which lasted two days and every farmer could say: &ldquo;I hope we will see him in Merrion Square because we will have Home Rule and blue duck eggs.&rdquo;  That was his approach&mdash;to try to put it over &mdash;but he cannot do so when there are a few of us around.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister for Agriculture has considered some scheme for the eradication of contagious abortion.  Bovine tuberculosis and contagious abortion are the scourge of the dairy man.  I only hope we will not have as many eliminations with contagious abortion as we had with bovine tuberculosis.  At least we have the advantage of having a weapon with which to fight contagious abortion, as we also have to fight the warble fly.  It is about time we introduced schemes to eradicate these two further evils from our cattle herds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can hardly speak about dairying <Col N="1841" /> without some reference to the pig industry.  Some of the older Deputies will recall contributions I made on various Estimates since I came into the House.  One of the things I hoped would develop as a basis for our pig industry was that we would have pig fattening units based on our creameries. I said here on many occasions that the difference between profit and loss in pigs is knowing the job.  Let no one think otherwise.  If you think pig raising is a simple matter and if you go into it in a big way without knowing your job, you are certain to burn your fingers very badly.  It is a job you must know if you are to make money at it.</P>
    <P>One of the things that amazes me is why in the west of Ireland, where you have so many small farms, the pig population is disappearing.  It should be an industry suited to the smallholder.  You may argue that we cannot grow barley in the west and that it is too dear to transport it there. That is no argument.  The poorest of land will give you a very high yield per acre of potatoes.</P>

      <P>An acre of potatoes will give you approximately 16 tons. If you get anything near that yield, you will get twice the food equivalent of an acre of barley.  The pattern has changed everywhere.  In the old day all the farmers were poor; there were no wealthy farmers.  No matter what we say now, by comparison with 25 or 30 years ago, farmers are well off.  Do we not all remember the pattern on the small farms?  Two sets of pigs were produced every year, one to pay the June rent and the other to pay the December rent.  No matter what happened these six or eight pigs were produced.  There were no cash crops then.  Wheat was grown mainly for thatch; oats was grown for horses and the beet industry did not exist.  Now we have cash crops.  The standard of living, no matter what is said, has gone up considerably.  There is an absolute revolution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in thought so far as Irish agriculture is concerned.  We know the pattern that obtained.  Those not too old or too young will remember whole families remaining on the farm. They had to find something to do even though the profit was very small. Twenty or 25 years ago the farmer's daughter wrapped herself in a canvas bag and went out to feed pigs.  She had to get a dowry before a man took her as his wife and she had to do something to make the money.  Now she goes to a secondary school and you find her as a matron in a hospital or something like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>This proves that it is farcical to argue that there is the same pattern in agriculture now as 20 years ago.  Neither have we the concentration of spinsters and bachelors that we had in the countryside some years ago. They may exist but they are no longer on the old farm.  The whole pattern has changed.  Instead of three or four pigs being fattened you find larger units of 200 or 300 because on the basis that if you make 30/- a pig on five fat pigs it is not worth the bother but if you make 30/- on 200 it is quite a difference.</P>

      <P>We have all sorts of arguments about the sort of pighouse we should have.  I heard some Deputy talk about whether it should be the solari or the Danish but whatever type we use we must have the right kind of piggeries.  It takes about 6¾ cwt. of meal equivalent to bring a pig to about 200 lbs. provided you have the right kind of house but you could add almost 2 cwt more to that if you have not.  Thus we see where the difference comes in between profit and loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the experiment carried out some time ago over a wide area here regarding pighouses or fattening houses showed that night temperatures in most of these houses dropped to 40 F.  You see where the housing problem comes in when the people who have experience always say that you must maintain the temperature of <Col N="1843" /> a fattening house at between 60 F. and 70 F.  The wrong kind of house can cause you problems which over a large number of pigs will cost considerable money.</P>
    <P>I must not forget the pig breeding schemes of the county committee of agriculture.  I do not know whether rural Deputies have had the experience we had in Cork where a feature of every monthly meeting was an obituary list of dead boars&mdash;boars who died in service.  I wonder what is the usefulness of that scheme.  I cannot understand whether the boars died from natural causes because the veterinary certificate is not very specific.  I do not know if there is any section of the Department which can discover the reason why we have such a high casualty rate among boars doled out by the county committee of agriculture.I feel that when the boar becomes aggressive and the wife of the cottier or owner becomes afraid of him she has him certified and he suddenly disappears.</P>
    <P>As a breeding scheme it is worthless, because before you can test the boar's progeny he has disappeared and, whether he is useless or useful, he has gone.  I wonder if the veterinary certificates are worth anything?  Does anybody trace the cause of the high mortality among these boars?  Did anybody ever try to find out if they died of diseases which are congenital or otherwise?  One would imagine if they did, their ancestors would be traced and got rid of.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell spoke of efficiency.I should rather not use that word.  Possibly he was quoting from the report.  I do not think the report was very complimentary regarding the whole pig set-up, from the breeding angle, from the dead pig to the bacon produced.  I wonder if there is not something wrong.  I have heard complaints from people abroad saying that Irish bacon was varied, nothing consistent about it.  There was a wide variation between the cured product of one factory and that of another.  If we are to use the Danes as a comparison, we know they can get 23/- per <Col N="1844" /> pig more than the value of the resultant bacon, for the offals, than we can get here.  That surely is a very, very big factor as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the new manager who came up here from Cork has been doing something.  I remember mentioning here on one occasion that we had about 20 agents in Britain supposed to be selling Irish bacon&mdash;that was before the Bacon Board was set up&mdash;and we had three Danes employed pushing the sales of Irish bacon against their own. One can hardly believe that, but it is true.  The present body are doing one sensible thing.  I have often said that you cannot create a taste for a product unless you keep that product continually on the market.  As far as we are concerned that was one of our major failures in relation to much of our Irish produce.  It was sent over to Britain and handled by British agents. An agent dropped 5 cwts here and another 5 cwts somewhere else; he did not come back to his first customer for six months.  We could never hope to create a taste for Irish bacon and Irish butter.</P>
    <P>What is the present position in Britain?  The Danish wholesale society in Britain have over 50 selling centres. These centres are scattered all over the country, mainly in or adjacent to built-up areas.  Their main task is to sell Danish products and to advise the producers in Denmark in relation to market trends, keep the Danish products continually in the shops all over England, Scotland and Wales, and to take complaints in regard to any Danish product.  Those complaints are followed up and traced back to their source.  I was in one of these centres in Herefordshire and the employment content of that one unit alone was well over 100 people, with no job except salesmanship.  We had no such organisation.We had nothing at all comparable.They had high-powered advertising.  You saw the flash on the television screen: &ldquo;This week's best buy Danish gammon&rdquo; at so much per lb.  There was a Danish week during which Danish products were displayed.</P>
    <P>That is the leeway we have to make up.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission are doing a sensible thing.  They have <Col N="1845" /> concentrated on certain areas in which they know they can supply our products and keep them continually before the people.  In that way they can create a taste and, as we expand production here, they can expand their sales from these centres.  That is a sane and sensible approach.  If anybody is interested, he can go back on the records and he will find that for years on these various Estimates for the Department of Agriculture I have advocated exactly that kind of set-up for our produce in Britain.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to experiments. I do not know if it is generally known that a feature of Danish pig production at the moment is the stalling of pigs.  The stalling of sows is a common feature of Danish agriculture. Each sow is held in her own cubicle. Sows can be very destructive and anybody who has ever dealt with, six, eight or ten sows knows the destruction of which they are capable.  It is not so bad when it is your own property, but they can tear through a neighbour's property like tanks.  Sows are now stalled in Denmark.  They are fed a balanced diet and they remain quite healthy.  They produce healthier litters.  Indeed, the figures available show they produce slightly increased litters.  There is no need to leave the old lady loose if one has a grudge against one's neighbour so that she will go in and root up his crops.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing Continental breeds of cattle and I am glad the historical Spike Island is now being devoted to a purpose other than that to which it was <Col N="1846" /> devoted in other days.  We are inclined to talk here of dairying and its competitiveness and we seem to forget that beef production and the sale of beef is a very competitive business.  We have schemes for progeny testing dairy bulls.  I do not know how far we have got in the testing of beef bulls.  The Americans have gone very far in progeny testing of beef bulls.  A recent experiment carried out by the Germans indicates that they too are very advanced on that line.  I have here the result of an experiment.  I do not know what the breeds were, but they were probably Hollsteins. The experiment was carried out on 41 bull calves.  They were slaughtered at 8 cwts.  Each had consumed 23 gallons of full milk, 90 gallons of skim, 9 cwts of concentrates, 5¼ tons of beet top silage, 8 cwts of hay.  None ever saw a pasture.  That experiment pinpoints for us that, as well as being efficient in dairying and efficient in pig production, we must also make ourselves efficient in beef production. I am glad the Minister is importing some foreign breeds.  Nobody can say what the results will be but, at least, the Department of Agriculture has taken the decision and we hope that in the next five or six years some figures will be available to show the results of this experiment.</P>
