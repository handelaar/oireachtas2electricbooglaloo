      <P>On the Order of Business, Sir, you have indicated in a letter to Deputy Dillon that the motion standing in the names of Deputy Dillon, Deputy Cosgrave and myself was, in your view, out of order.  I should be glad if you would be good enough to quote me the Standing Order under which you so ruled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Order No. 47 relates to reopening a discussion. The motion we have put down is in pursuance of Section 65 of the Finance Bill which was recently passed and which specifically contains the provision that the Minister is entitled to terminate or vary in any manner or respect whatsoever, and as from a specified day, the turnover tax.  We are putting down our motion not for any repetition but in pursuance of the specific section of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am ruling under Standing Order No. 47 which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No member shall reopen a discussion on a question already decided during the same Session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;same Session&rdquo; by precedent&mdash; which has been accepted by the Committe on Procedure and Privileges&mdash;is <Col N="188" /> the preceding six months.  The question therefore is whether Deputy Dillon's motion on the turnover tax is a question already decided during the preceding six months.  Deputy Dillon's motion, which is dated 23rd instant, asks that the turnover tax be suspended pending the result of a by-election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a general election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a general election.  The House, on 17th July, 1963, passed the Finance Bill, 1963, containing the tax and on previous days, on amendments moved, specifically approved of the tax.  The period which has elapsed since that time is only some days over three months. Deputy Dillon's motion, therefore, reopens discussion on a question already decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In the copy of Standing Orders furnished to me from the Clerk's Table, there is no mention whatever of the preceding six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Six months has always been accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no Order in the Standing Orders mentioning the six months which you have just purported to read out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No; in saying six months I did not quote from the Standing Orders and it certainly was not my intention to mislead the House.  However, six months has been recently accepted as being, for the purpose of this Standing Order, a &ldquo;Session&rdquo; by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and they have recommended the period to be substituted for the word in the version of the Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand you to rule, Sir, that Section 65 was passed for no purpose and that it is not open to us to call on the Minister to introduce an Order under Section 65?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to do with the provisions of Section 65 of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You say, Sir, that on a given date Dáil Éireann enacted a certain tax.  Dáil Éireann enacted the <Col N="189" /> Finance Act.  In the Finance Act enacted by Dáil Éireann, in the reference you give, there is the express provision contained in Section 65, which is part of the decision taken by Oireachtas Éireann in passing the tax, which confers on the Minister a power to terminate or vary in any manner or respect whatever, and as from a specified day, the turnover tax.  Surely, unless our procedure is to be made a farce, that is the decision we took?</P>
      <P>What we are now asking the Government to do is to exercise the power we conferred on them by the Finance Act passed by Oireachtas Éireann, that is, to terminate or vary in any manner or respect whatsoever, and as from a specified day, the turnover tax. That is expressly stated in the Act. We are asking the Minister to exercise that power.  Where is the repetition in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>My duty is to operate Standing Orders in respect of motions submitted to me and to prevent repetition of debate.  I have nothing to do with what the Minister is empowered to do in respect of the provisions of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely what you have stated was a decision taken in the House on a certain day?  The decision was to pass the Finance Bill, not any one part of it.  Part of that Finance Bill was a specific power to do the very thing we are now asking the Government to do.  By virtue of the Finance Act, which was passed by Oireachtas Éireann, we are asking the Government to exercise a power expressly provided in the Act.  What is the purpose of putting that power into the Act if the Government are not to be allowed to use it?  It is an invitation to use an express power created by the Act to which you have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask you to reconsider this matter in the light of the plea now made that this is not a repetition of any kind, but a request to exercise a specific power&mdash;not a general power but a power to terminate or vary in any manner or respect whatsoever, and as from a specific day, the turnover tax.  I am asking you at least to reconsider your ruling in the light of <Col N="190" /> the reference to that section.  Otherwise, it would be saying that, although we enacted the Bill in that sense, the enactment is now null and void.  Will you reconsider that point, Sir?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not know what is the implication of the Deputy's statement, but I had to consider the matter carefully in the short time I had at my disposal.  Also, I had to consult with my advisers.

      <P>It is in the normal practice to give Government time for a serious motion by an Opposition Party involving a vote of confidence in the Government but even if the Ceann Comhairle had not ruled otherwise, I would not have been prepared to interrupt business for the irresponsible motion in the name of Fine Gael Deputies.  I think the motion in the name of the Labour Party is in a different category and I am prepared to allocate all the time on Wednesday next to discuss it.</P>

      <P>I spoke last night under great difficulties not because I am afraid of anything or anyone but because I have a throat ailment and there was nothing but shouting and bawling and crosstalk when I was trying to speak.  I hope we shall have a little courtesy this morning.  I am particularly concerned with two motions, one in the name of Deputy S. Dunne and the other in the name of members of the Fine Gael Party, the substance of which is that the Housing Committee did not do its work and should be dissolved.  The Fine Gael motion states we should have a Select Committee to go into the whole thing. Those motions serve no purpose, any more than if the blind tried to lead the blind.</P>
      <P>Taking Deputy Dunne's motion first, he is not correct in what he says.  He wants to create the picture that 8,748 citizens are on record as wanting houses and should get houses.  That is not true.  How could it be true when it includes the man who owns a house and perhaps wants to get another? Anybody who writes to the Corporation and fills in an application form although he might have three rooms and be alone in them, has his name put on the list.  That means nothing. What has meaning is the number of people the medical officer considers are entitled to dwellings.</P>
      <P>When an application is made, an inspector is sent out and a report comes back on the number of rooms, the cubic capacity of the rooms, the number of people there and their sex and the medical officer decides that this person should be considered and perhaps not, as he has enough accommodation but, yet, that other person's name remains on the housing list.  It is false to suggest that almost 9,000 people are in need of housing and that the Corporation are doing little or nothing about it.  The true picture is that about 4,500 people are at the moment on the waiting list, people the medical officer has recommended for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne says that only 309 dwellings were built in 1961, another false picture&mdash;that we built only 300 dwellings when, say, 4,000 need houses. The Deputy says nothing about the <Col N="193" /> vacant houses.  It is like a man saying: &ldquo;I was not working this week; I am broke&rdquo;, although he has £5 in another pocket which he won on a bet.  It is false to ignore the huge vacancy rate which in 1961 was 1,260.  Therefore, in that year there were 1,500 dwellings available for those in need.  That is the true picture.  The Fine Gael members know the truth but they are here to create another picture.</P>
    <P>Why was it that only 300 dwellings were built in 1961?  It takes approximately two years to build a house and perhaps three or four to build a flat.  When you decide to build houses, the site must be prepared, sewerage and water laid on, which may take up to six months.  While that goes on, sketch plans go through the Housing Committee and to the Minister and back to the Committee.  Various bills of quantities must be prepared.  We must know how much we are going to spend, what type of house should be built and what materials used.  Then we have to advertise and give builders time to examine tenders.  We may have to advertise a second time.  All that procedure is necessary and at best only a little time could be saved.  Then the builder goes on the site and the actual work begins.  That takes two years.</P>
    <P>Only 300 dwellings were built in 1961.  We must now go back to 1959 when we decided that we should stop building on the perimeter.  Nobody objected.  No Fine Gael member objected, although there are three of them on the Housing Committee and 11 on the Council and everything that the Committee does is open to discussion and debate.  There were no objections in 1959.  How could there be when the vacancy rate was mounting? It was 1,600 in 1960; it was 1,400 in 1959.  Not only that, but in 1959, and subsequently, there was a reluctance on the part of people to go out to houses on the perimeter.  I gave the figures here last night.  I cannot falsify figures because there is nothing to stop anyone asking the City Manager, and proving I am a liar, if I falsify figures. I have all the data at the tips of my fingers.  In 1959, the big worry was what to do with the empty houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan does not attend meetings of the Housing Committee although he is an active man on the Council.  Deputy Ryan wanted to know in 1959 how many houses were lying idle.  In 1959, there were 1,000 applications from Finglas and Ballyfermot, the perimeter areas, from people who wanted to get back into the city.  No one can dispute that. It is on record.  There were approximately 1,450 vacancies for the year. On one particular date, there were 117 houses lying idle.  Two-thirds of those wanting houses would not take them. They preferred to stay where they were.  The ratepayers were moaning about the houses lying idle and being wrecked by children.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barron put down a motion not to build any more houses on the perimeter but, instead, to build flats in the city.  Everyone agreed.  There was not a single objection voiced in relation to the position in 1959, 1960 and 1961.  In 1962, the wise guys became active because the position was changing.They were not wise guys earlier. That is the truth.  What sane man would build on the perimeter when 117 were lying idle on one day?  The Manager suggested to us that we should concentrate on flats in the city. We agreed.  The whole Housing Committee agreed, including the 11 members of the Fine Gael Party. There is nothing on record to show they objected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position was the same in 1960. There were 1,600 vacancies in 1960. The wise guy asks now: &ldquo;Why did you not build flats?&rdquo; That is a different question.  We have not enough sites.  There are not sites for car parks. The sites for building flats are limited.  It is one thing to go out to a green field in Finglas and throw up a house.  It is a different matter when it is Wolfe Tone Street.  First, there are a great many people living on the site.  It has been proved that flats do not solve the shortage.  Flats are what the people want, but they do not solve the problem.  For example, we demolished all the dwellings in Dominick Street.  There were, I think, 1,000 families in Dominick Street.  We could house only 600 of them in flats.  Flats <Col N="195" /> do not solve the housing problem.  You are faced then with delay in getting people out of the houses to be demolished first of all.  You have the business interests to contend with; in Church Street, solving that problem took eight or nine years.  The business interests hold up everything.  Demolition takes time.</P>
    <P>Some people, perhaps, understand the problem better now.  The people would not go to houses on the perimeter; they wanted flats.  We decided to build flats.  There is a limit to what one can do by way of flats.  One can talk in terms of thousands when it is houses on the perimeter.  One can talk in terms of only hundreds when it is a question of flats in the city.  Who in 1959 and 1960 would suggest we should go on building houses on the perimeter when there were vacancies everywhere?  I searched for minutes this week.  There are people, of course, who are anxious to get a vote; they like to appear in the papers.  If they thought there was a shortage of demand they would be the first to appear in print.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan is a good man at asking questions.  In fact, we had to change Standing Orders because of Deputy Ryan and the late Deputy Peadar Cowan; they had a habit of filling up the agenda with questions on everything under the sun. There was never a question as to why we were not building houses out on the perimeter.  In 1960, Deputy Ryan was worrying about the empty houses.  I asked a question in 1960 which had occurred in Corporation minutes of the Municipal Council with regard to the number of vacancies which have occurred in Corporation dwellings during the past 12 months and the numbers for the previous three years.  Up to 31/12/59 there were 1,821. Would anyone of any intelligence suggest that we should go on building on the perimeter when that was the situation?</P>
    <P>People can talk, but no one knows the future.  If a man has his shop half full of beans and he has no sale for them, he will not fill the other half <Col N="196" /> of his shop with beans.  Let there be no nonsense about it.  In 1961, there was a drop in vacancies, not a very big drop; the number dropped from 1,660 to 1,250.  Immediately we saw that, we started the housing drive again on the perimeter which proves that there was no slowing up.  We acted as good judges would act.  We were watching the market.</P>
    <P>I shall prove that.  I have the material and anyone who wants to challenge me can do so.  I will not be challenged because politicians are cute. If one says a thing which is true, one is not challenged because it would result in adverse publicity for the challenger.  I am not like the lawyer who meets his client and has to depend completely on what the client tells him.  I said here last night that I have the highest attendance record on the Housing Committee.  Except on a couple or three occasions, when I was either engaged on other Corporation work or ill, I have not missed a meeting in the eight years I have been a member of the Corporation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am in a position to say that there was no justification whatever for the suggestion that the Corporation were asleep in 1959 and 1960. If they were, so were the critics.  I saw no letters in the newspapers at that time saying we were not building houses.  I did see letters asking what we were building the houses for, saying that it was costing up to £700 to repair some of the houses we had built.  But let us get away from this political business.  There was a drop in 1961, before we got cracking.  We must remember that 1961 is only two years ago and that we cannot overnight solve all those problems and jump from 300 new houses to 1,000.  It is not done that way, because, first of all, we have not got the organisation. We have to build dwellings, but we have also to build something else.</P>

      <P>Their job is to prove the other fellow wrong all the time, to ask: &ldquo;How can he be right when we are?&rdquo; I know this game perhaps a little better than they do.  There are, at the moment, 1,400 houses under construction.  What more can anyone do?  That is a jump from 400 to 1,400. For argument's sake, say 1,000 extra people want dwellings in a given year. How could we provide 1,000 more dwellings over and above what we are doing in a given year?  Wise guys will say it can be done, but will they tell us how?</P>
      <P>The city manager is a straight-forward fellow, not a politician, and he has put forward this suggestion: &ldquo;Let anyone who can suggest how we can get extra houses tell me.  Let us give up all this talk about increasing our efforts and all that; let us not waste the time of the officials and of the other people who are on the job. Tell us how to get one extra dwelling built.&rdquo;  Of course there were no answers because most of the people who were talking did not know what they were talking about.  There are 11 members of Fine Gael on the City Council and they, with all the other 45 members of the Council, may at any time attend meetings of the Housing Committee.  Although the Housing Committee have only 18 members, all the other Corporation members are entitled to attend.  They may participate in debates and make any other efforts they think are necessary, except vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any of those people have any suggestions, let them tell us.  Recently we sent a deputation to the Minister which lasted for three hours during which we discussed, as experts, the entire housing situation.  We were <Col N="198" /> talking on a subject about which we knew something.  We had the assistance of officials, so all the brains on the subject were there.  Where, then, would be the wisdom in appointing a Select Committee of members who know nothing about the subject, and who would be unable to do anything except yap and keep on yapping?  I shall say no more on that subject.</P>
    <P>There was one point raised during the debate with which I feel I must deal.  Deputy Dunne said we should rub out the Housing Committee.  I am damn certain that if he were a member of that committee, he would not make a suggestion like that.  That committee are the bulwark between the people and officialdom.  They are the protectors of the people, as I shall illustrate in a moment.  There is a point of view rampant that all tenants should pay a rent of £2 a week and we have been putting up an annual fight to prevent it happening.  The only thing that prevents it is the stand being made by the members of the Housing Committee.</P>
    <P>Still on this subject, I must say that almost half the members of the City Council want to put up the rents and the other half have to wage a continuing fight to prevent it.  Only six months ago, there was a suggestion that all SDA houses should have the rents raised by 5/- but it was defeated by the casting vote of the chairman. Thanks to my being wideawake at the time, these tenants did not have their rents raised by 5/- a week.  As I have said, not only the officials but 50 per cent of the council members want to raise the rents by 5/- per week.  There is also a proposal to increase all flat rents to the SDA rate.  Therefore, I say Deputy Dunne knows nothing about it.  He is not, however, any worse than the others.</P>

      <P>He is entitled to look for a few votes like the others.  I do not blame him.  I blame the people because if they only considered what politicians say before believing them, then the politicians would not be able to pull their legs.  You cannot tell the <Col N="199" /> truth to people because, as Mr. George Browne, the Deputy Leader of the British Labour Party, said on television recently, you must be diplomatic or you will not get elected.  President Kennedy said the same thing.  So long as the people want lies, they will get them.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, there is no case to be made for a Select Committee. What we want are suggestions, constructive and thoughtful, as to how we can add one more house to our stock. I should like to pay a tribute to many of the members of the Housing Committee, though I do not wish to name them.  They are the hardest working committee in Ireland.  Not only do they meet twice as often as any other committee, but they sit from 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock when other committees finish in half an hour.  We have the entire administration of the section to deal with.  Quite a lot of our time is taken up dealing with deputations.</P>
      <P>Let us give up this nonsense, these empty words.  We saw in England the passing in 1960 of a Rent Restriction Act which gave the landlords power to increase rents to any level they liked.  That happened and many poor people were asked to pay £5 a week for a single room and they were thrown out on the street if they looked crooked.  I have been in England once or twice every year since 1960 and I know what the position is.  The result has been that our people have been drifting back home.  In the past two years, approximately 900 families have come back.  How could we have foreseen that?  Of course we could not, any more than Fine Gael could have been expected to foresee the Suez crisis in 1955, a year before it happened.Because there were no dwellings to be got in England, our people rolled home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what happened at the latter end of 1951 and particularly in 1952. So, the crowd decided not to go.  The menfolk went over but the families remained here.  We were faced with a declining vacancy rate.  The vacancy rate was only 600 last year.  In 1960 it was 1,600 and it was 600 in 1962. How are the members of the Corporation <Col N="200" /> to forecast the rate?  We have to be sensible.</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk politics here but perhaps if there were a change of Government, and a collapse as there was in 1956, people would go over again to England and we would have to stop building again.  Of course, when I sit down, others will rise to speak.  It is like a debating society where everyone can get one over.  They do not consider the poor suckers outside.They will not take action.  They may take action when it is too late.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points, apart from housing, I wish to mention. The Minister can help here.  The Minister suggested that we ought to build skyscrapers.  That is a point, although skyscrapers are very expensive.  The Fine Gael Party says: &ldquo;To hell with the expense.&rdquo;  That is all very fine.  It could be said that the turnover tax is required, among other things, to provide money for housing but they are not going to give us the money.  It is also wanted to subsidise industrial schemes to provide employment.  They are not going to use the money.  It seems to me that politics is a game. You appear to want something but you block it because if you provide it, it will be something for which you can be blamed.  If you appear to want it and block it, you appear to be wanting it to be done; you are all right for votes.  If the Government say: &ldquo;We want £2 million,&rdquo; you block it because it will involve a tax on cigarettes or beer and you say: &ldquo;We will not have that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Skyscrapers cost a lot of money.  It has been shown that flats are expensive.You can build a house for £2,000 but a flat providing the same accommodation costs very nearly £4,000.  As you go up, the price rises because elevators must be provided.  I am not objecting to flats but there is one snag.  Under the law, there is a density rate laid down which applies to flats and skyscrapers and all the rest. The Minister will have to change the law.  The density rate is 100 persons to an acre.  In other words, we have to ensure that there are not more than 100 persons living on an acre.  In other words, parks and open spaces must be <Col N="201" /> provided.  The position is not so difficult in England where they allow 130 or 140 persons to an acre.  Until the law is changed, we can do nothing about it.  When people have the bright idea of building flats they are not helping because the Corporation must provide larger space because the law prescribes a density rate.  The Minister will have to consider that matter.  We could easily surmount the problem by putting into the flats only small families or old people.  The Minister must look into the question of the density rate because, apart from finance, that is what is holding us up at the moment.</P>

      <P>For some time past, I have been trying to get some form of conveyance across the Liffey.  The matter was mentioned last night by Deputy Burke.  This is no gimmick. There is a real need for such a service. It should occur to anybody who stands at But Bridge and looks down the Liffey that there are thousands of people on both sides of the Liffey who may have to come all the way up to Butt Bridge, cross the bridge and all the way down on the other side. That is a silly performance at this hour of the day.  There is a ferry system that everyone knows about.  King Charles allowed the citizens to have a ferry system.  It dates back 300 years. It is a silly thing.  It operates only at certain hours of the day and provides a service for only a certain number of workers.  It shuts down at 7 p.m. and is not available at the week-ends. People who are crippled cannot get down the steps.  There is definite need for a ferry service across the Liffey.  A bridge would be desirable but the idea of the erection of a bridge is rejected because of the interference with valuable shipping installations and because of the cost.  I understand that there is provision for a bridge in the fifth part of the town plan which will not be undertaken for 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are losing £5,000 or £6,000 a year on the ferry service.  It is a joke. A tunnel should be provided for pedestrians or for traffic.  Some people, not having considered the matter, <Col N="202" /> motivated by ignorance or jealousy, oppose the idea.  In politics people oppose you through ignorance or jealousy, if you have a good idea for which you may get good publicity. The utility of the idea does not enter their minds.  A few people oppose me but the council strongly supports me. A letter appeared in a number of newspapers from a carrier organisation whose business involves crossing the Liffey daily.  The letter appeared in yesterday's papers.  Replying to the suggestion that the idea was a joke they said the joke was that it was not done 25 years ago and they demanded that it be done immediately in view of all the congestion on Butt Bridge and all the waste of time involved.  I have another important letter from another body supporting the idea&mdash;the Dublin Port Area Protection and Development Association.  This is an organised body.  I understand the Minister received a copy of this letter. They demand something like it immediately.These are informed people who know the position just as I know the housing position, unlike some of the fellows who go on the Select Committee, who know nothing, who like to hear themselves talking, who may be jealous of Sherwin who may get his name in the paper.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to consider this question.  I do not care whether it is a tunnel, a bridge or anything else, but something must be put across the Liffey.  There are many other matters that I could raise but other Deputies want to get in and I want to facilitate them.</P>

      <P>Having waited some 16 months for this motion to come up, having been attacked before I opened my mouth about it at all, before I advanced any arguments, I should now like to recite the terms of the motion. It reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Local Government to take power to abolish the Housing Committees of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council on the grounds:</P>
      <P>(1)  that, despite the fact that Dublin Corporation officially admits that applications for housing accommodation were received from 8,748 citizens, the record shows that only 309 dwellings were built in 1961, and that present building proposals seem to be based upon a plan to provide dwellings for only one family of every eight who apply;</P>
      <P>(2)  that Dublin County Council despite its acknowledged waiting list of housing applications of 988, in 1961 erected only 52 houses and appeared to have no immediate plans for the construction of more than 90 odd in 1962, or a ratio of one dwelling for every ten applications received; and</P>
      <P>(3)  that the housing plans of these bodies do not make sufficient provision for the accommodation demands arising from the annual number of marriages in the city and county;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and that, further, Dáil Éireann considers that, in the light of this obvious neglect of responsibility and disregard for the hardships being suffered by thousands of persons living in overcrowded conditions, particularly as Corporation or County Council subtenants and as occupiers of rat-infested apartments, the Minister for Local Government should set up a Dublin City and County Housing Authority <Col N="204" /> charged with the urgent and essential task of speedily providing a dwelling for all Dublin citizens who are in need of a home.</P>
    <P>That was put down 16 months ago and the figures given relate to a situation which has not improved in the meantime.  This motion was put down 12 months before any houses collapsed in the city of Dublin, in Fenian Street or anywhere else, and before the present panic measures being undertaken by the Corporation were even thought of.  It had reference to the then existing housing situation which has been worsened five-fold by reason of the discovery by the Corporation that there has been existing in the city a problem of which they apparently were ignorant up to now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there were people living in tenements which were about to fall.  Is it to be thought seriously that these tenements began to decay only within the last few years? I understand the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation are now directing a block by block survey of the city to discover how many people are living in these dangerous buildings or condemnable buildings.  Is it suggested that these buildings got into this condition only within the past couple of years?  Is it not patently obvious to anybody who wants to be frank and open about the matter that this problem was always there but the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation did not do their job and did not take steps to tackle it?  Is it not a sad commentary that they had to wait until the noise of houses falling down woke them out of their slumber?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a document which is the report of the City Manager and town planner dated 24th June, 1962, which I think is the most recent housing report made by him.  The City Manager of Dublin is a man who knows more about housing than any other person in this country and who is one of the outstanding figures, as far as housing is concerned, indeed in Europe.  I am one who had the honour <Col N="205" /> to be associated with him 15 years ago in tackling what was then a housing problem infinitely greater than that which now confronts the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The City Manager gives a resume of the history of housing over the years and of the extent of housing provided by public authorities in Dublin.  In 1948, the housing deficiency was estimated at 20,000 houses.  The housing deficiency at the present time, according to the apologists for the Housing Committee, is only a fraction of that. They say it is something like 5,000. My contention is that it is in the neighbourhood of 10,000.  Whatever way you take it, the problem today is as nothing compared with the problem which faced the present City Manager when he was Housing Director in 1948.  It was possibly by the application of the energy which the City Manager brought into play and the energy displayed by the public representatives of the day, the members of all Parties of both the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council who were vitally concerned with this problem, which resulted in over 19,000 houses being built in the seven years from 1948 to 1955.</P>
    <P>There was in that, of course, the fundamental element that must be in any housing drive which is to achieve anything, that is, a fanatical zeal to get a result, a fanatical zeal to solve the problem, a sympathy with the sufferers, not a contempt for them; not a love of abusing them but a fellow-feeling for them and a knowledge of how they are living.  There was all that there in those years and it was there in abundance.  I want to pay publicly a tribute to the present City Manager, and although his health suffered as a result, he has the great satisfaction of knowing that there exist in Dublin many thousands of families who would be without houses, were it not for his energy and application.</P>
    <P>Time passes, and there came on the Corporation other representatives or perhaps the same people who became a little tired, I do not know, but in any event the housing drive slackened down.  Vacancies, as has been described <Col N="206" /> by the previous speaker, began to be more plentiful and many people seemed to get the notion: &ldquo;The housing problem is solved; we have enough houses now.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw your attention to the fact, as was mentioned here, that Dublin Corporation diminish the number of applications by referring to the applicants who have been passed as being qualified for rehousing by the medical officer and the medical officer has to work in conjunction with the section which deals with overcrowding or work independently on considerations of health.  What are the considerations of overcrowding?  In the report to which I have referred, the manager states that to some extent the inspectors worked to a standard of two persons per room maximum, ruling out infants and reckoning a child of from one to ten years as half an adult.  That <Col N="207" /> was the yardstick used by the inspectors in regard to overcrowding.  It does not seem to conform to any decent civilised modern standards, that infants should be regarded as not taking up any space, or air, or that a child should be regarded as half an adult and took half the space of a grown person.  Surely these standards are outmoded and belong to an age we thought was happily past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to this because it is a survival of a time when the public authorities thought they had no obligations in regard to housing except to keep the rates down, when in fact they were just ratepayers themselves and had little or no other interest than this.  My complaint about the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation is that they became completely inactive some five years ago, that they should have been alive to the situation and known that even if there were houses vacant, that was a temporary phase.  It should have been obvious to them that the marriage rate, the decay of old houses, the dissatisfaction of people with their existing accommodation and the demand for a higher standard of living will always create a condition wherein housing will never be solved in the fullest and absolute sense of the word.  Therefore, they were neglectful of their duty and they deserve to be abolished because they did not plan for the future.  The City Manager indicates in this report, and I agree with him, that from the moment of the inquiry into the need for housing in a particular local authority area until the family goes into the house, flat or cottage, a period of five years on average will elapse because of the various snags that may arise from time to time.  That particular statement underlines all the more clearly the responsibility which every local authority has to plan ahead and to be alive so far as they can be to the situation that may develop in the future.  No such efforts were made, as far as I can discover, by the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee. Even at present, we find that the Corporation are trying to obtain land for <Col N="208" /> house building on the outskirts of the city.  They are meeting with opposition and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My point is that the time when housing committees such as that of Dublin Corporation could have been of any use has long since departed.  It may be that the continued existence of a housing sub-committee may be of some slight use but in the context of the modern world and in the context of the development of this metropolis the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation having proved themselves to be somnambulistic&mdash;if you will forgive the word&mdash;have outlived their usefulness and should be abolished.</P>

      <P>I am particularly concerned, not with conditions in the centre of the city but with Ballyfermot and the problems of subtenants in that area, which is a colossal problem.  The Corporation, because of their own lack of planning over the years and a lack of foresight, have now been forced to undertake a detailed examination of the city to discover further people in need of houses, people who are living in dangerous buildings, and the prospect of people in Ballyfermot being rehoused has receded into the remote future.</P>

The traditional and age-old difficulty of in-laws springs up and makes life intolerable for both parties.  One case <Col N="209" /> which I have in Ballyfermot may be of interest.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave it to people to think out for themselves what sort of situation that creates and how undesirable it is.  I believe that hundreds of these subtenants in Ballyfermot and other suburban areas are much worse off than many being housed by the Corporation.  Not all of the houses out of which they are being taken are genuinely capable of being described as dangerous.  The measures being taken now are to some extent panic measures, locking the stable door when the horse has gone.  It is very unfair to people who have had their names on the housing lists for some years and had been confidently anticipating that they would be housed by Dublin Corporation to be told now: &ldquo;We do not know when you will be housed; whether you will be housed this year, next year or the year after.&rdquo; They are going to examine the city to find out every last single person and give them houses before the others.  In my view, it is just another indication of how the Housing Committee have allowed the situation to develop by their lack of planning and foresight.  I maintain, have maintained and will continue to maintain that they should be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to turn, by way of relief from this very sordid and depressing subject, to the county council which I find even more sordid and more depressing.  Dublin County Council share with the Corporation the tremendous upgrowth in building for which the present City Manager was responsible in the years 1948 to 1956, roughly.  There was a great flowering of building in the administrative area of the county during those years.  By some extraordinary coincidence, there <Col N="210" /> arrived on the county council, at exactly the same time as the present members of the Corporation arrived on the Corporation, gentlemen who also took the view, apparently, that the housing problem was solved and that we would have no more housing problems in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>When I put down this motion, the most recent information I could obtain at the time was that the number of applications for houses lodged with the county council stood at 988.  A total of 90 odd houses were erected last year and in the previous year only 52 houses were built.  In a report in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of Wednesday, 30th January of this year, we read of an interview with the Chairman of the Dublin County Council in the course of which it is stated:</P>
    <P>Just under 1,000 County Dublin families are urgently in need of new houses but at the present rate of council house building&mdash;67 last year and 59 in the previous year&mdash;many may have to wait up to six or seven years living in overcrowded or condemned houses.</P>
    <P>Official figures in the County Council files show that to-day there are exactly 917 applicants for rehousing, but it is generally accepted that the actual number of families who need new homes may even be twice that number.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council have been criminally lazy in this matter.  I regret to have to say it because most of the members are personal friends of mine but somebody has to say it.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of families throughout County Dublin for whom no hope whatever is extended of being rehoused.  Efforts have been made and will continue to be made to blame the Government for this.  I do not think that this Government, this Minister, or the previous Government or the Ministers attached thereto are responsible. I think it is gross dereliction of duty, and let us be quite honest about it, by the people who were elected to the local authorities to do a certain job. I have spoken to many of them and I have expressed this view.  On occasion the answer given to me has been: <Col N="211" />&ldquo;We have tried to do this but the County Manager will not let us.&rdquo;  The answer to that is: &ldquo;Why not suspend the County Manager?&rdquo; That is not done although the power is there to do it.  There is also power in the County Management Act to compel the Manager to do a specific thing if the council feel it should be done.  As far as I can see, Dublin County Council have just gone quietly off to sleep.  The content of my argument is that here in the city and county we have a unique and evergrowing problem. Dublin city and county is the place towards which the entire population of Ireland seems to be hell bent.  It seems to be the highest ambition of everybody in the country to get to Dublin.  Some go to the extremes of getting themselves elected.  However, the ambition is to get to Dublin and if they cannot get accommodation in the city they are looking for it in the county.  It is a bad thing, socially.  The city and county are far too heavily populated.  The country is being denuded of its population, as we all know, but this is the problem and it is there.  It is the problem that has to be grappled with.</P>
    <P>I consider that the methods available to grapple with the housing problem are out of date.  At the time when there was that tremendous spurt of housing which brought the housing problem within measurable distance of solution, in so far as it can ever be said to be at such a stage, the present City Manager was appointed Housing Director.  His sole responsibility was to look after housing.</P>
    <P>In my motion I ask that there should now be set up one authority with as much fanatical zeal as applied in other years to bring the housing problem within handling distance.  There still must be officials in the public service with a social conscience who would be prepared to undertake this task.  When I point out the faults of local authorities I do not wish to include everybody.  There are always exceptions.  There certainly are members who would be anxious, I am sure, to participate in such an authority and to make it work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> I think all the arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of the creation of such an authority.  It is completely unreal to have Dublin Corporation operating in respect of housing and indeed drainage and water services, which are inherent in the housing problem, independent of the county council.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that because of this separation of city and county officials in the matter of housing and services there often arise conflicts which occasion delay, the net result being that the people in the county suffer all the more for lack of the particular matters which are the subject of such contention.</P>
    <P>Every argument is in favour of modernisation and rationalisation to regard the city and county as one unit for the purpose of housing so as to bring impetus and drive towards the solution of this problem.  I should like to instance one particular and peculiar aspect of the housing problem as it is affected by this separation of the city and county.  There are portions of what appear to be the physical city of Dublin in the administrative county of Dublin.  Take Walkinstown, for instance.  Any person not knowing the city would readily and instantly imagine he was in the city because it is a highly built-up and urbanised area&mdash;but he is not in the city: he is in the administrative county of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Suppose you have there a family urgently in need of rehousing.  Suppose, for instance, at the present time there is a family living in a dangerous building which is about to fall down on them.  If that family were in the city, there would be a prospect of being offered a dwelling within a measurable time.  But they are not in the city; they are in the county and by virtue of that there is no possibility for several years to come, because of the inactivity of the Housing Committee of the County Council, that they will be offered alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>That is an extreme case, but there are very many cases of overcrowding of families&mdash;husband, wife and, say, 2, 3, 4 or five children&mdash;living in these perimeter areas and enjoying the very <Col N="213" /> scant benefits of city residents and enduring all the disadvantages of county residents.  These people pinpoint the need for some cohesion, or somebody who will bring about cohesion, in this vital matter.  To my mind, the matter of housing is at the present time the one great social problem facing us.  Nearly every other social problem, which confronts every society, has been tackled by one Government or another.  Some little progress has been made towards raising the standard of living of our people.  It must be said that for almost the past 40 years or so the question of housing remains the fundamental problem.  No matter what we may do in the matter of increasing production or raising wages, or of what we may do to make people wealthy in the financial sense, it is all of no avail if we do not provide the very fundamental need of the family, that is, the home.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that there are loans, and so on, available and people can avail of them if they want to build their own houses.  Not all, and certainly not the workers, particularly the workers in my area in Ballyfermot, are so well paid that they can put aside sufficient every week over a period of years in order to assemble a deposit to put down on a house.  In that matter, I may say that deposits in the Dublin perimeter area, for houses which are being built under the Small Dwellings Acts, have now increased to £300.  That is a lot of money to get together.  The suggestion that people could help themselves more by buying houses may appear laudable on the face but it is not very practicable because of the present high costs of houses.</P>
    <P>In that regard I saw recently where the Minister indicated that he would be prepared to make additional grants available to people who want to build under the Small Dwellings Acts.  In doing these things&mdash;which I know are being put forward with the best intentions&mdash;I wish the Minister would take some steps to ensure that these housing grants do not just become additional profit for the builder.  In many cases, and with the passage of time, housing <Col N="214" /> grants which are made by the Government just become additional profit for the builder without in any way helping the purchaser for whom they are originally intended.  Some steps should be taken to avoid profiteering.  At the same time, I do not suggest that builders should be discouraged from that kind of work.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister consideration of this motion.  I think he is a forward-looking Minister so far as housing is concerned.  If he examines the position in relation to Dublin city and county he must feel, as I do, complete dissatisfaction with the present set-up.  It is very hard and very distressing on the many thousands of people who are sub-tenants and living in overcrowded conditions to now be told by Dublin Corporation that nobody can foresee when they will be housed.  It is a most appalling thing. I meet these people every week in Ballyfermot, which is the largest working-class area in Ireland.  I go there every Sunday, and I am sure my colleagues go there, and I meet the people and I find a lot of them are moving to England because of inability to get houses.  Housing then is urgent and is associated with every single aspect of our economic life.  It is also an important factor in emigration.  I want to appeal most strongly to the Minister to accept my motion, consider it, and abolish these two committees.If they ever had any use, and it may well be argued that they had, they have lost it and, in my view, they have proved they have passed their time.  Certain of the gentlemen who are members of them, or who got into control of them, did not measure up to the job, and I would press my motion on the Minister.</P>
    <P>So far as the Fine Gael motion is concerned, I mentioned that in my view the housing committees of the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council are somnambulists. Perhaps I will be excused for using that polysyllabic word, but I would describe the Fine Gael motion as a sleeping draught for somnambulists and, therefore, not worthy of support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not hold up the House very long.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on his achievements during the year and, in deference to his expressed wish, I do not propose to say very much about the recent changes in the road traffic code, especially about the establishment of the 30 to 40 miles per hour speed limits, beyond saying that the people of two areas in Mayo&mdash;Kilkelly and Ballindine&mdash;have suggested to me that the speed signs should be put up in both of those towns.  From what I know of them, I would say that they have a good case.</P>
      <P>I should like, in particular, to congratulate the Minister on the announcement recently of special proposals to deal with housing in rural areas for old people.  I have been for many years&mdash;I think since I came into the House&mdash; trying to urge on the Mayo County Council the desirability of allocating houses to old people in rural areas. They have consistently refused to do anything about it.  I think it is inhuman to ask a person who has been born and bred on the land to move into a town at the end of his days.  That person does not wish to move into town and wishes to die in the place where he was born. I think that a county or a local authority which cannot offer such people even a reasonable two-roomed house in which to spend their latter days do not deserve to be given responsibility for local government. The Mayo County Council have failed in this regard over the years.  I am glad they have now been given a further opportunity, by means of the Minister's recent proposals, to show at least some common humanity.  I challenge them and demand that they should do so.</P>
      <P>I am afraid also that Mayo is one of the counties where little use is being made of the grants available for the removal of eyesores, otherwise known as derelict sites.  Here again, the Government, and the Minister in particular, have given the lead to us and to others who have the local responsibility to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to road policy generally, I think the Minister is probably aware that there are misgivings in counties <Col N="216" /> like Mayo about the provision of enormously wide tourist roads in certain areas while minor roads are being neglected.  If the evidence of one's eyes is accurate, it would appear that it is the intention to construct an enormously wide roadway between Kilmovee and Kilkelly in County Mayo.  The people of this area do not see any reason why such a road is necessary.  The condition of the road at the present time is not good.  Indeed, it is poor and the road is too narrow but the fact that this is so does not mean that the remedy is to create a highway such as one would see from New York to Yonkers.  The local people feel that until such time as many essential minor by-roads are developed the cart is being put before the horse.</P>
    <P>In connection with the latter type of road, I recently made representations to the local authority in Mayo regarding the road in the Doocastle area which must be developed if a huge strip of bog is to be capable of being put into production.  The reply I got from the county engineer was to the effect that he has no say in the matter and that he can do this road only if some individual county councillor chooses to have it put on the next five-year plan.  It seems utterly incredible to me that a county engineer can properly be described as such if he has no authority to do something which he agrees should be done for the benefit of the people in the area.  In this case it would enormously benefit the people locally, not merely by making work available to them but having a whole strip of bog available for development and sale.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister can do anything about that matter.  I have written to him about it already. I suggest to him that it places representatives and others in an invidious position if they have to hawk themselves about to every county councillor in the county before a particular road, which should obviously be done, can, in fact, be constructed.  It is ludicrous to suggest that county councillors can take an interest as against pressing problems which are local to <Col N="217" /> them.  To suggest to a county councillor that he should devote any money available to him to something at the far end of his area is not a very practicable proposition.  He would be very bad news in his own immediate area if he diverted money for work at the far end of his area for which he does not see any urgency.</P>
    <P>There have been serious complaints over the years about the condition of the Charlestown-Ballyhaunis road, which at a recent meeting was described as being the worst road in Mayo.  Indeed, somebody described it as the worst in Ireland.  It is the trunk road between Galway and Sligo. It certainly appears to me to be a curious policy which ordains that the Kilmovee-Kilkelly road should be an enormously wide turnpike while the Ballyhaunis-Charlestown road should be left aside.  Of course, it is not the entire road between Ballyhaunis and Charlestown but only a particular stretch of some seven or eight miles which, in fact, is dreadfully bad and dangerous.</P>
    <P>I have some misgivings, too, about the money spent on the main road between here and the west of Ireland. I do not know whose corns I will be treading on now.  I do not intend to hurt anybody personally, but I go through Maynooth every week and I honestly fail to see the great advantage to be derived by road users and the public generally from the enormous amount of money spent on changing the junction opposite the church.  I think it is monstrous as it is now.  While there was a sharp bend before that it was not dangerous.</P>
    <P>I also notice that huge sums of money are being spent in removing &ldquo;S&rdquo; bends over railways and rivers. I wonder, again, if the spending of that money is justified.  Experience in America has proved that if you put down a perfectly straight road for 100 or 150 miles people will kill one another out of sheer boredom.  Experience in this country and in England has proved if you have a very long stretch of highway the average speed goes up according to the perfection of the road.  When there is a slight mistake <Col N="218" /> or a blowout instead of having one car in an accident you have 20.  The Americans have gone so far now as to put deliberate twists and bumps on the roads so as to keep the attention of the driver focused on his job and not induce him into that state of somnambulism which Deputy Dunne was talking about a few minutes ago.</P>
    <P>This is an important matter because we are spending vast sums of money. I think we are spending a vast sum of money in removing the bridge outside Edgeworthstown.  I think it was perfectly all right as it was.  I know there was an &ldquo;S&rdquo; bend but it came at the end of a very long stretch of road when it was impossible to do any speeding.  If it is adequately signposted or sufficient warning is put up, then the motorist will be forced (a) to come down from the high speed, (b) to negotiate this difficult &ldquo;S&rdquo; bend, and (c) to set off again.  All of these things help to focus the attention and keep the reflexes going.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I am afraid the standard of driving in this country is lamentably low.  It is lower than in England and infinitely lower than in France and Germany.  The standard of courtesy in this country is very low, very much lower than in England, where the standard is almost as high as in France.  I do not know what the Minister for Local Government or anybody else can do in regard to that because I believe that the driving test is only a partial answer to the problem involved.  I sincerely hope, when the driving test is introduced, that it is not made the sort of laughing stock it is now in England.  It seems to me from what is happening, that it is mechanical efficiency, giving signs, putting out flippers, winkers and waving one's arms about like billyoh, which is regarded as the important thing.  As a result of the system they operate in England Stirling Moss, the greatest racing driver in the world, failed his driving test.  I think it is hardly going to be suggested he is not a good driver.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, when driving tests are introduced here, that that sort of mechanical efficiency will not be the lodestar.  Again, where speed generally is concerned, the biggest element is skill.  That appears to me to be forgotten.  Therefore, when the driving test is introduced, I hope it is not the waving of arms and the paying of lipservice to the rules of the road that will be taken into account but the skill and reaction of a driver under pressure.  I would also recommend to the Minister the American practice of giving a licence to a driver only for a limited area.  I read some time ago of a man of 70 whose licence allows him to travel only from his home to the centre of the city and back again and who cannot move at any time outside a radius of three or four miles.  A limited licence of that kind, particularly for older people, would be a help.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to notice that the Minister is interested in the provision of swimming facilities throughout the country.  It is deplorable that so little swimming is done.  I accept there are many places inland where it is not possible for children to swim because they have not the facilities, but even at the seaside it appears to me we are not now a swimming conscious race. We ought to be.  There is nothing better for people than swimming.  I hope that the local people in small towns will make the necessary effort to provide at least some swimming facilities for youngsters and that they will do this with or without council assistance &mdash; although I would hope that in this case the grants would be available from the Department rather than from the council, who would mess them up no matter how simple they were.  I hope the leaders of public opinion in small towns and in the counties will encourage the youth to take up swimming, which is surely one of the finest physical exercises anybody can perform.  A word of praise is due to those people, some clerical and some lay, who have without help from anybody tried to provide at least minimal swimming facilities for the youth in their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I wish to thank the Minister and ask him to continue the efforts he <Col N="220" /> has been making over the past year or so to speed up the examination of houses for grant allocation and the actual allocation of the grant.  The position has improved very much in the course of the past two years or so. I appreciate the Minister is up against considerable difficulty in this matter but the ordinary person, who is probably in need of the money, who owes it to contractors and builders' suppliers, is hardly likely to appreciate the niceties of administrative difficulty. The Minister is to be commended on what he has achieved in the past few years, but I would ask him to press ahead to further improvement in the next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of the last speaker those who contributed to this interesting debate referred mainly to the problems of Dublin.  The picture is very much the same in my own city of Waterford.  Some Deputies have been trying to place the blame for our not having sufficient houses, and I think the best thing I can do is to say what I think we should do about the problem.</P>
      <P>Some local authorities did not build houses in 1959, 1960 and 1961.  It has been said here that people were offered houses and did not take them, but nobody told us why they did not take them.  The reason in my area was that the houses were too dear. Housing costs were too high.  We operated a scheme whereby people living in low rented council houses, built 30 or 40 years ago, were asked to swop and go into highly rented houses.  We allowed them swop even though there might be only one person in the house.  The Department agreed with that and I commend them for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1950 Housing Act gave permission to local authorities to give a grant of £275 in addition to the Government grant.  In 1952 this was amended to operate on a means test basis.  To get a full supplementary grant an applicant could not have more than £8 per week in family income.  This meant that any person in an urban area borrowing under an SDA loan could not qualify for the additional grant. He could get half the Government <Col N="221" /> grant from the local authority if he qualified for a house of the working class type.  From 1952 on the income figures were scaled upwards with the cost of living.  Now a full supplementary grant may be given by the local authority, but to a person with family income of £832 only.  That is £16 a week.  There are many people in urban areas with members of their families working in factories.  They themselves, the fathers, would be working and bringing in much more than that.  If they wanted to build under an SDA loan, they would not qualify.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that in cases like that he should allow these people to qualify.  They have improved their position and are now able to repay the loan.  They would be in a position to build good houses if the Minister would qualify them.  In 1948 there were reconstruction grants from the State and the local authority of £80 each.  The figure is now £140 for each, or one-third of the approved cost, whichever is the lesser.  Pre-war, the subsidy for working class houses was two-thirds of the loan charges up to £400 of the capital cost of rehousing or one-third of £450 for direct housing.  After the war, the same subsidy obtained until 1950, with the addition of a subvention to bring the rate of interest on borrowing from 3¾ per cent to 2½ per cent subsidy on a capital basis of £750.  After 1950 the subsidy basis was increased to £900, then £1,000 and it is now £1,500.</P>
    <P>In other words, the subsidy granted in relation to working class housing has been doubled since 1948 but the grant for private construction remains the same.  In 1950 local authorities were permitted to give £275 without any conditions.  Now it is limited to those with £16 a week.  I particularly direct the Minister's attention to this because in many areas there are many people who could build houses under the Small Dwellings Act and are debarred by what might be called this means test.</P>
    <P>Subsidising of housing and reconstruction causes extraordinary expenditure in the Department and local authorities and, obviously, the subsidy should be frozen.  All this is tied up in <Col N="222" /> a jumble of red tape between the Department and the local authority and the Minister should try to simplify the procedure.</P>
    <P>The employment of State engineers and architects for the checking of local authority schemes should be dispensed with and let local authorities and their officials conduct their own affairs.  I put this very seriously.  This is one of the things that are slowing down housing.  Local authorities or their officials get out plans and specifications for a housing scheme.  These are brought before the council and examined and the engineers are asked questions about them and eventually the council comes to a conclusion that everything is in order.  That is all done in one evening.  A great deal of trouble is undertaken by the council; they go to see the site and what is being done. They approve of it, the engineers appointed by the Local Appointments Commission approve of it and eventually the city manager approves of it and the auditors, but goodness knows how long it will be before the Department inspector arrives.</P>
    <P>This has been the experience of practically every Deputy.  The engineer from the Department comes along and makes some change or turns down a scheme on some footling excuse.  I do not know what the position is with regard to Waterford city's housing scheme that has been sent in.  In the course of construction we have 28 houses, tenders sought for 90 houses at Kingsmeadow and 54 at Hennessy's Road.  I do not know about these. They are with the Department but we have had so much delay and it is so hard to get things back from the Department that it is difficult to get contractors to tender for houses.  We have a very good direct labour scheme and without it we should have hardly built any houses in Waterford in the past seven or eight years.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and his officials to cut through the jungle of red tape regarding the submission of plans and specifications and their sanctioning. The same applies to reconstruction.  A person applies to the local authority, submits a plan and specification.  The authority sends an engineer to look at <Col N="223" /> the house and he reports on it.  He ensures that the standards laid down by the Department in regard to such things as the type of concrete blocks to be used and the kind of roof to be provided are complied with.  That must be sent to the Department and there is an interval.  After a long time the Department's officer appears and this harassed man goes around and covers a small number of the applicants.  The others with whom he does not deal are frantic.  Then there is another long silence.</P>
    <P>Eventually, say, permission is granted and a small contractor does the job and it is finished.  Then the local official inspects it.  That is not enough.  It must be inspected again by the Department's inspector before the grant is given.  The result is that small contractors are tearing out their hair trying to get their money.  I find that not only in my own constituency but in others.  I respectfully submit that this is the most important factor in housing, that employment of State engineers and architects to check local authority schemes should be dispensed with.  If that is done, housing will be speeded up, giving the Minister what he wants.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister wants houses but there is no use in blaming local authorities who have been getting out plans and specifications and sending them to the Department and having them turned down because the Department say the house is too expensive. It is expensive because costings have gone up.  They are continually going up.  The average cost of building per square foot of working class houses in 1948 was 30/-.  In 1963 it is 55/-.</P>
    <P>The Department did not come to the rescue of local authorities in the matter of the grant.  When the costs went up so quickly I did not expect the Minister to have made the grants climb at the same rate but they should have increased with the cost.  The result is that we go to the trouble of preparing a scheme and it is turned down because it is too expensive.  The Minister told Deputy Kyne and myself that a tender for houses in County Waterford was £200 per house more <Col N="224" /> than it would cost in other areas.  The fact is we find it difficult to get tenders on local authority houses.  The time lag is too great.  A man puts in his tender and it goes to the council.  The council must send it to the Department and God knows how long it takes to come back.  Costs are probably going up and the contractor thinks he is going to be &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have heard members of this House talk about the pursuit of votes, and so on.  I believe we are faced with a thankless task where housing is concerned; but it is our intention to face the task at all times.  When you give a man the key of a house you are not necessarily conferring a favour on him; he will show no gratitude for the rent collector's visit every Monday morning.It is our duty, however, to house our people and it is our intention at all times to press on with housing.</P>
    <P>I know that flats are very expensive. They are not an economic proposition. Neither is housing.  It must be remembered, too, that flats can be erected more conveniently to work and business.Dublin Deputies have referred to flats.  There is a great demand for flats.  I believe bigger subsidies will have to be given to enable the erection of more flats in central positions in the various urban areas.  Flats would provide a solution to the housing problem not alone in Dublin but in Waterford, Cork and Limerick as well.  It is difficult to get sites in Waterford, I know, but I believe we could get one or two sites if we had sufficient assistance from the Minister and his Department in the erection of such flats.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his opening statement that the survey which the housing authorities commenced in 1960 to ascertain the extent of unfit housing which now remains has not been completed in detail for all areas.  He also said that what the local authorities regard as being in need of replacement is in the order of 25,000 dwellings, of which 20,000 are in rural areas; 50 per cent of unfit dwellings are occupied by one or two persons.  I submit we do not need very big houses to rehouse that 50 per cent.  There is too much insistence on the standard house.  Surely <Col N="225" /> a lesser standard of housing would meet the needs of these very small families.  If, in time, these families outgrew the accommodation, then the local authorities could rehouse them in larger houses, using those vacated in the process for small families again. There could even be provision for an addition to these small houses should the need arise.  I believe that approach is worthy of consideration.  Small houses for newlyweds proved very popular at one stage.  The rents were low.  Newlyweds started their married lives in them and when the time came that they required more accommodation they were transferred to larger houses.  In turn, the local authority was glad to have the small house available for other tenants.</P>
    <P>I commend the Fine Gael motion to the Minister.  There are more people with good ideas about housing than those specially delegated to that task.  A Select Committee, judging by the tone of the speeches here, would be an excellent idea.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the idea very carefully and to accept it.</P>
    <P>Again, he should consider the enormous rise in the cost of housing.  Local authorities will have to get more generous help to enable them to provide housing.</P>
    <P>With regard to road safety, a national campaign should be launched. My heart is with the Minister in his crusade.  There is too much reckless driving, too much thoughtless driving. Of course, it is not always the motorists who are guilty.  Pedestrians can behave badly too.  They breast their way out into oncoming traffic, without looking right or left.  If a motorist manages to avoid them, they will tell him something; if he does not manage to avoid them, of course, they cannot tell him anything.  He is a murderer then.</P>
    <P>There are safety associations but a nation-wide campaign will have to be launched, with the assistance of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Education.  Lectures are given in the schools.  Films are shown.  More will have to be done.  The children will have to be taught to interpret the signs and signals.  The hazards will <Col N="226" /> have to be brought home to them. Proper conduct on the road for children, whether on foot or on bicycles, should be brought home strongly so that these appalling tragedies will not continue, so that every time we pick up a paper we will not read of the awful grief suffered by Irish families every morning.</P>
    <P>Of course the Department of Justice must come into this and must see to it that the most severe penalties are imposed for interference with traffic warning signs on roadsides or streets.  A life was lost on an Irish road last year because some vandal had reversed a traffic sign.  The programmes on television are a step in the right direction.  I shall leave the rest to the Minister because I know he is as deeply concerned about this as any Deputy.  It is up to us to give a lead to the people to make the roads safer.</P>
    <P>I do not like to intrude on the Dublin bailiwick but several Deputies mentioned the great difficulties experienced in the city because of parking and general traffic problems. Nowadays, they are putting up large skyscraper office blocks in the city centre.  These will bring enormous communities of workers into the busiest areas and chaos will be the result.  Those who have been putting up office blocks outside the city&mdash;and I refer particularly to the skyscraper being developed on the canal banks&mdash; are looking to the future.  They are helping out the efforts to relieve traffic in the city and their workers will have to travel far shorter distances than those who will be employed in the new offices at O'Connell Bridge and Eden Quay.  I understand that the great business barons who have been occupying skyscrapers in the centre of New York are now moving into the green belt outside the city where access is easier both for workers and business people.  The Minister must give his permission to those proposing to build such blocks in Dublin and I trust he will consider what I have said when future applications are received.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made regulations for noise abatement.  Anyone who stands outside Dáil Éireann at 10.30 <Col N="227" /> any night can see and hear young men on motor bicycles without silencers creating such a clatter.  I have had complaints from my own constituents, particularly those living in built-up areas with young children, about the noise made by motorcycles and by cars.  Owners of small cars take the silencers off and put on fishtail racing silencers which make a real clatter.  I would urge the Minister to draw public attention to the fact that this regulation exists and that it will be strictly enforced.</P>
    <P>While on this subject of nuisance, I would draw attention also to the fumes pouring from diesel lorries.  We are told these fumes are highly dangerous to public health; yet we do not seem to be doing anything about them.  I travelled on the Naas Road yesterday and was in a real fog for quite a distance.I eventually overtook the culprit.I thought he was the only one but there was another boyo in front also pouring out these fumes.  If those drivers had been stopped and warned that they would be prosecuted, I think it would have had a salutary effect.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of road grants.  Deputy Seán Flanagan said he was appalled at the money being spent on road widening in his own consituency and on a corner at Maynooth which he said did not need widening. I have not seen any of these schemes but I know Deputy Seán Flanagan to be highly reliable.  What I have to say about road grants is in connection with my own constituency.  My constituents pay more in rates per head of the population than any other constituency in Ireland; yet they get practically the lowest Road Fund allocations.I can quote figures for past years to show that ducks and drakes are being played with the millions in the Road Fund.  Waterford county received £142,000 in 1953, £141,000 in 1954, £137,000 in 1955, and £127,000 in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959 and so on, until this year when we got a small increase.</P>
    <P>We have CIE road transport.  That is something that I warned the Minister would come up if his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, were <Col N="228" /> let loose and the Minister that night told me that I was exaggerating and he told Deputy Kyne, my colleague, that he was exaggerating.  The extraordinary thing about it is that at least we made a reasonably good forecast. People talk about what the railways lose, what CIE is losing, what is going to happen about it, and so on.  What has not come out is that in one year alone the Minister paid out £397,500 in railway closing grants.  I asked the Minister a question on Thursday, 14th March, 1963 about the grants allocated for road works in the financial year 1962-63.  The total for railway closing grants is £397,500.  We in Waterford got £15,000 to take down the metal bridge going into Tramore.  I and my constituents would have liked to see that £15,000 being spent on some county roads but evidently the Department thought otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have been appealing to the Minister down through the years about the raw deal my constituency is getting.  As I have said to the Minister before, we pay the highest rate per head in this State.  I see here a heading &ldquo;Tourist Road Grants&rdquo;.  They are running from the 1953's up to the latest available date.  There are favoured counties that get £55,000 a year; others £35,000; others £10,000; others £25,000.  Waterford is bringing up the rear with £5,000.</P>
    <P>I was told in the House at one time that these were special Gaeltacht grants.  Then I was told they were not; that they were given for various other reasons that nobody could ever tell. Cavan is quoted as receiving £10,000; Sligo, £25,000; Roscommon, £25,000. I have not been able to find any Gaeltacht areas in these places and I would remind Deputies that there is a Gaeltacht area in Waterford&mdash;Ring&mdash; that may not be unknown to them, and that Waterford would qualify.  We have been very badly treated in regard to the Road Fund.  We were getting more money nine years ago than we were getting up to 1959-60.  As far as the city of Waterford is concerned, from memory, I can tell that Waterford city in the 10 years ended 1960 paid over £550,000 into the Road Fund and got back £40,000 in grants. <Col N="229" /> The kind of grant we get is about £8,000.  Yesterday, my colleague Deputy Jones said that we had now reached the stage that we had eliminated the old dusty roads.  I have to find fault with him because we have not eliminated the old dusty roads. The principal thoroughfare in Waterford city is the quays.  The road there was surfaced in the most primitive way.  The road was tarred and dusty grit was thrown on it.  The shopkeepers in the area protested because their shops were covered with dust and the whole thing had to be swept away.  The Minister may say that that is not his responsibility.  I say that it is because we get such a parsimonious road grant that we have to do this footling kind of job.</P>
    <P>We pay the money but we do not get it back.  We get £15,000 for taking down one of the Tramore railway bridges and we would not get enough money to do one of the main thoroughfares that could be classed as a first-class main road having regard to the amount of traffic on it.</P>
    <P>I am again appealing to the Minister about this matter.  We in Waterford are entitled to and should get a larger road grant.  The intake was about £4,000,000 in 1954.  It is nearly £7,000,000 now and we are no better off.  There are roads being built in favoured counties that are going nowhere.There are roads in my constituency that serve populous areas, such as the road from Fews to Clonea and if Telefís Eireann or any film people want to make a film set in the 1920's for which they require an oldfashioned road they can have that road and several other roads in Waterford. The reason they are not improved is that we do not get the money.  Waterford County Council are never afraid of striking rates.  As I have pointed out to the Minister, we strike the highest rate per head of the population in the entire country.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that &ldquo;local government&rdquo; is a misnomer.There is no such thing.  It is centralised government in the Custom House.  All power is in the Custom House.  I put it to the Minister that the real job for a Minister for Local <Col N="230" /> Government to do is to create local government.  I shall conclude my remarks by reading this short paragraph &mdash;it is not a case of over-simplification &mdash;the employment of State engineers and architects for the checking of local authority schemes should be dispensed with and local authorities should be allowed to conduct their own affairs. Give the local authorities the responsibility.The county managers have been appointed by the Local Appointments Commission.  The local engineers or borough surveyers have been appointed by the Local Appointments Commission.  They bring their plans and specifications and so on to the council.  If the council O.K.s them that should be enough.  It should be necessary only to notify the Department of what they are doing.  It should be necessary for them only to tell the Department that they are building the houses to the Department's standards and of the size laid down by the Department.If the Minister will do this he will do a great job for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be brief because I realise that a number of my colleagues who are also members of Dublin Corporation want to defend themselves perhaps.  First of all, I want to make myself clear.  I do not go along with some of the criticism that has been hurled at Dublin Corporation, in particular the Housing Committee.Some people have criticised the Housing Committee and I regard that criticism as ill-informed.  Likewise, I do not agree with the contention made that only one person on the Housing Committee knows everything and does everything.  That is also ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I also believe that the blame should be properly apportioned and I think the Minister's Department is responsible for the situation that has been adverted to in relation to Dublin.  I appreciate that the Minister has been endeavouring to improve things in his Department but I have a fear he is hindered by a considerable amount of red tape.  My reason for saying that is that some months have passed since the emergency was declared in Dublin in regard to houses falling and the corporation having to cope with what were <Col N="231" /> described as dangerous buildings.  Even up to the present time there is no indication as to how long more this emergency will last.  All during this emergency there was a marked absence of the interest of the Department of Local Government in this whole matter.</P>
    <P>At present there are over a thousand families living in overcrowded conditions and they have been held up waiting for accommodation because of this declared emergency.Some of them have six, seven and eight children and they have been repeatedly told, although they are in that predicament for over 12 months and possibly two years, there is no hope for them, that first preference must be given to the people in dangerous buildings.  This is a hard thing to get across to the people and it is left to the public representatives in particular to do this.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty we experience is that the Mendicity Institute in Dublin is being utilised to house people who are homeless.  People are obliged to go there and there are some of them who have absolutely no hope of getting accommodation.  There are husbands separated from their wives and children and nobody is in a position to tell them how long this will continue.The only answer we get is: &ldquo;We are going to build more and more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is also the problem affecting people in dangerous buildings who have been refused accommodation because they are not old enough. Quite a number of young married couples who found ourselves in dangerous buildings have been told: &ldquo;We cannot house you.  You are not old enough.  We can only house old couples or single old people.&rdquo;  We find ourselves wondering what is an old person.  What age does one have to be to be accommodated now?  We know that when it comes to obtaining employment from Dublin Corporation you are too old at 40.</P>
    <P>One thing that struck me during this emergency, which is still in existence, of course, is that the builders who have made a lot of money out of building houses in the city of Dublin <Col N="232" /> did not offer to do anything to cope with this emergency.  There is a situation in Dublin as if a bomb fell but there is no concern for the people who have become the victims of this unfortunate happening.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that there is such an absence of sympathetic consideration on the part of the Department of Local Government.  There is abundant evidence that the Department has not done what it should have done.  It has been responsible to a great extent for delays in acceding to recommendations or representations made to it by the Dublin Corporation.  I have said I am not blaming the Minister for it but some Local Government Department official or officials are responsible for carrying out this work and I would urge the Minister to look into this matter.  It is extremely serious and it appears to me that the people who are handling the situation have not got sufficient contact with it or have not set about trying to find out what exactly is wrong.</P>
    <P>It cannot be overstressed that no public representative can get a person a house.  He can only make representations on behalf of the family that comes along to him for his assistance. It is unfortunate that some people&mdash; and I am glad to say they are few in membership of the Dublin Corporation&mdash;delude people in that way. Regulations have been made by the Dublin Corporation for the allocation of houses.  The allocation officer conforms with those regulations.  The regulations are made having regard to what is there and I often wonder how some of these people carry out the job when they know the situation is becoming more hopeless every day.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to take a greater interest in a section that has been set up in the Dublin Corporation, the Welfare Section.  This section is for the purpose of looking after corporation tenants and their needs, not only in an emergency.  It is an extraordinary thing that in that welfare section there are not more than six people looking after the whole housing estate in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister also to try to come to some positive understanding <Col N="233" /> with the Dublin Corporation in respect of the provision of badly needed amenities on housing estates. I see no reason why the Minister should not arrange for amenities to be created when the houses are being built.  In a part of the area I represent, Finglas and Finglas west, there are six shops in the estate looking after approximately 15,000 people.  Needless to remark the shops open and close when they like.  For years now the people in Finglas have been clamouring for more shops.  Recently there was an attempt made to introduce supermarkets in Finglas.  In one case the plans for the supermarket were rejected because they neglected to provide a car park.  The type of people who live in Finglas and Finglas west do not shop in cars.  They bring their prams with them to shop.  I am making the point that the Minister and his Department should have a closer connection with the people in the Corporation in the making of these plans.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to expect recreation centres to be provided when houses are being built.  In many housing estates in Dublin there are open spaces and people are still waiting for something to be done.  We are still waiting for something to be done in connection with the itinerants who are at the moment using the open spaces.  The result is that the itinerants' horses stray around the locality and are found to be destroying the efforts of people looking after their gardens. To see so many horses roaming about Finglas and Finglas west one would think they were preparing for a western film.  That brings me to the question of the pounds in the city. There is a small number of pounds and it is ironical to find that the cost of capturing a horse or horses is greater than the fee charged by the pound keeper.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the system of grants and loans for houses. Recently Dublin Corporation made an effort to increase the grant and the loan with a view to encouraging people who could afford to purchase their own houses.  It was visualised that if this were done it would ease the problem as far as the waiting list was <Col N="234" /> concerned.  At the moment we find that a person who sets out to buy a house in the Dublin Corporation area is faced with having to pay a deposit of £150, £200, £250 and in some cases £300.  You might as well ask these people to pay £3,000.  The idea in the minds of the members of the Dublin Corporation&mdash;all of whom, irrespective of Party, are genuinely interested in the people's needs&mdash;is to try to help these people in regard to the deposit. At the back of most people's minds, however, is how to get over the difficulty that will be experienced from the builder.  There is no guarantee that the builder will not increase his price if we increase the grant and the loan. Perhaps the Minister could do something about that.</P>
    <P>There is little point in increasing loans and grants if the increase is going to go into the pockets of the builders.  That will not bring about the position we desire.  An effort should also be made to have potential purchasers realise their legal entitlements in this matter.  It is generally found in Dublin that people who set out to buy their own houses are people who have not large incomes&mdash;if they had they would not qualify&mdash;and they are in such a hurry to obtain the house that they will sign anything or do anything. It is often found that the solicitor who acts for the builder will also act for the client.  There have been numerous cases in Dublin of people finding that things which should have been done in their houses, to put them in proper condition, were not done and the time within which they could do anything about them has gone by.  This needs tightening up.  The Minister may tell me that it is a matter for Dublin Corporation but policy should come into it.  The Minister is in a position to make recommendations, suggestions and even orders in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>I also feel the time has come for the Minister to consider formulating a policy in connection with rating so far as members of the working classes are concerned.  Just as we have differential renting in corporation houses so it would not be a bad thing to consider differential rating.  A number of people who are now buying their own houses <Col N="235" /> find themselves eking out an existence. You will find those who will tell you that people in a particular spot are badly off but undoubtedly there is abject poverty in some SDA houses because of the ground rents and rates and because of their hire-purchase payments on furniture and so on.  Such people are crying out for some relief and some consideration.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider arranging for the Dublin Corporation to concentrate more on the provision of public conveniences. There is a great lack of them not only in the centre of the city but at outlying points of the city also.  At the moment the holdup is due to money and that is where the Minister can come in and provide money for such an important project.  I would also ask the Minister to endeavour to get his colleague the Minister for Health to arrange for night dispensaries in housing areas.  If he does that it will certainly be a boon to the people concerned.  I see little point in referring a matter like that to the Dublin Health Authority because in the final analysis the money has to be found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody denies that a serious housing problem faces the citizens of Dublin following the tragic collapse of old houses some time ago. Dáil Éireann is doing no more than its duty in devoting time to a full scale discussion of the problem and one hopes that out of such a discussion some reasonable suggestions towards its solution will come.  To my mind nothing will be gained by pandering to the popular pastime of scapegoat hunting and suggesting the Dublin Corporation or the Government precipitated a crisis by deliberately neglecting their duty.  Such charges are not true.  An examination of the workings of Dublin Corporation over the past few years proves that.  As was pointed out in the City Manager's report which was circulated earlier in the year the Corporation found itself in a serious and unprecedented position in 1958 and 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It discovered that the number of vacancies were increasing at an alarming rate and a pause had to be made <Col N="236" /> while the authority took time to consider this amazing position.  Perhaps here was where the first mistake was made but who is to apportion the blame?  Here there was a group of men faced with a tendency which they had no reason to believe would not continue, so that fresh acquisitions and preparation for future housing development were delayed.  But the trend did not continue.  Over the following two years it was found that the number of families leaving Corporation dwellings actually decreased and continued to decrease at a phenomenal rate until the Corporation found itself with an ever decreasing number of vacancies on existing housing estates.  An all out housing drive had to be initiated with all the inevitable frustrations and delays.  Property had to be acquired, compulsory purchase orders had to be taken out and confirmed, long legal processes had to be faced and all the time the demand for accommodation was increasing.  I should like to remind the House that this increase was due to a fallen emigration rate and an increase in the numbers returning from abroad.  Proof of this latter trend can be seen in the fact that it was found necessary to reduce the prescribed residential qualification of six months to three months in order to allow those returned emigrants to have their names placed on the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The terms of Deputy Dunne's motion, to my mind, are unrealistic. The figure of 8,784 includes applications in respect of which it is doubtful if the Corporation have a responsibility &mdash;large numbers of able-bodied single men and women, for instance, and old people who do not wish to live with their families.  There may come a time when the authority can help such people and, to my mind, they are at present doing tremendous work in that direction.  However, the main efforts must be directed towards housing families of three, four, five and upwards.</P>
    <P>It is not true that present building proposals are based upon a plan to provide a dwelling for one in every eight who apply.  The plan is to provide a dwelling for every family who need it and who cannot provide one <Col N="237" /> for themselves.  There are in construction at the moment in Dublin city, according to the latest available figures, 772 houses and 617 flats, making a total of 1,389 dwellings.  In addition, site development is in progress at Bonnybrook, Coolock, for the immediate construction of 700 houses to be followed by another 500, making 1,200 in all in this Bonnybrook, Coolock, scheme.</P>
    <P>Very recently, the builders moved into Macken Street and are preparing to erect 54 flats.  There are many other schemes in the city where the builder is about to move on to the sites.  It is worth mentioning that from the date the housing crisis started in June until the end of September almost 600 families in, I think, those four months have been rehoused.  Add to that the fact that the building trade is working to full capacity and it must be admitted that there is no evidence of irresponsibility there.</P>
    <P>Certain other factors over the years have had the effect of obstructing the Dublin Corporation's efforts to build flats in the city centre.  One of them was the old town planning legislation which earmarked certain areas as industrial zones.  This may have appeared at the time as an excellent use to which all property in the city centre could be put.  For instance, it must have seemed practical and practicable and necessary to transform almost all of the south quays into an area of industry and transit sheds and warehouses.  It seemed an ideal location, close to the docks and shipping. But the human element was forgotten.</P>
    <P>A sturdy historic parish complete with church, schools and all their social implications cannot simply be wiped off the map even at the behest of industry.  However, this mistake has now been rectified with the passing of the new Regional and Town Planning Act.  The Corporation will now have power to proceed with flat development in this area and so allay the anxiety felt by the clergy and laity at the depopulation of their parish.</P>
    <P>Not the least of the obstructions the Corporation had to meet during its efforts to clean up the Dublin slums was the attitude of bad landlords. <Col N="238" /> These people allowed their property to deteriorate despite the efforts of the authority to persuade them to make their dwellings habitable.  These people had certain rights, no doubt, and our courts&mdash;framed, as they are, within a democratic system&mdash;must be careful to respect them.  However, certain submissions have been made by the Corporation to the Minister which will result in legislation designed to curb the activities of these very bad and unscrupulous landlords.</P>
    <P>No fact of the problem is being overlooked or neglected and the formation of some new body to replace existing committees would bring us no nearer, to my mind, to the solution of the problem.  The Dublin City Council is there and it includes men and women of all shades of political opinion.  Any indictment of it must include every Party in this House.  Under Fianna Fáil Government, money has never been spared for housing.  This Party's name has become, I think, synonymous with our housing drive.  Even the houses built during the last period of the Coalition were built as a result of the preparation and financing done by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the deterioration in old dwellings the real cause of the housing problem has been the tremendous resurgence in the national economy.  Fewer people are leaving the country so that more people need houses and more people can afford new accommodation.  This tremendous demand for housing of every type, public and private, has not been caused by irresponsibility or lack of interest but, in the final analysis, is a tribute to the drive and energy which to my mind has brought good government and prosperity to every one of our people.</P>
    <P>Lastly I should like to say that this prosperity has brought its problems and they are problems which we are facing and taking steps to solve.  This Government who have shown such a realisation of the country's needs in every respect will not in my view fail the people of Dublin or of our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in support of the motion in the names of a number of Fine Gael Deputies and on which Deputy D. Costello spoke last night.  Speaking for Limerick, I believe that the suggestions contained in this motion represent the only approach to the solution of the awful housing problem which presents itself at present.  On a number of occasions over the past 18 months, I have referred in this House to the appalling housing situation in the city of Limerick.  I recall, when speaking on the debate on last year's Estimate for the Department of Local Government, that I dealt at length with the problem of the acute housing shortage in Limerick and the hardships being imposed on so many families there.  At that time, I was relying on facts based on my own observations and investigations and I think there was a suspicion in some quarters that I was perhaps exaggerating the situation.Since last year, however, new and more accurate evidence has come to light which proves beyond all doubt that the housing situation in Limerick is, if anything, even worse than what we thought it was a year ago.</P>
      <P>Shortly after last year's debate on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, one of our national newspapers conducted an inquiry into the Limerick housing situation and the findings of that inquiry were published in two articles last December.  I am quite sure the Minister will have read those articles and most Deputies, also, will have read them.  I have no doubt that they were shocked and amazed that such a situation has existed in Limerick and should have been allowed to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 9th March of this year, the Limerick City Manager called a conference of his officials in the Town Hall.  The City Manager issued a directive to the officers present to examine the position of the housing of the working classes in Limerick and to advise him on the findings.  In particular, he asked them to inquire into the following: how many families in the city of Limerick are in need of rehousing and how many families would be in need of rehousing when the <Col N="240" /> present schemes are completed.  The report of that investigation was published in a booklet <i>Report on the Housing of the Working Classes in Limerick City,</i> a copy of which I have before me. These officers reported to the City Manager at page 4 of this Report:</P>
    <P>We have assessed from the applications on hands and from an examination of the private housing stock that there are at present 1,335 families in the city in need of rehousing.</P>
    <P>They also found there were 900 occupied unfit dwellings in the city. This clearly proves the situation is very bad.  While this survey presents a clear statistical picture of the housing situation in Limerick, it does not tell the full story of the misery and hardship resulting from this acute housing shortage.  It does not tell the story of the inhuman living conditions which almost 1,400 families in our city have to endure.  It does not tell the story of the families living in single rooms in dangerous, rat-infested, rain-soaked buildings.  It does not tell the story of the plight of the newly-weds who are forced to pay exorbitant rents for single rooms in condemned buildings.</P>
    <P>The situation in Limerick is absolutely dreadful and every day it is becoming more serious.  In case the Minister might think I am exaggerating, I should like to draw his attention to a news item in last Tuesday's <i>Evening Press</i> under the headings &ldquo;Families Facing Mass Eviction&mdash;A Grim Situation in Limerick&rdquo;.  This report says:</P>
    <P>Seventeen families living in a 250-years-old house at Nicholas Street, Limerick, are facing the prospect of being put out on the street.  They are under eviction notice from Limerick Corporation, and so far have received no offer of other homes.  There are no sanitary facilities in the house, which is one of a number rebuilt after the siege of Limerick in 1691.  Each family occupies one room and buckets of water are carried up from the one available tap.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday evening last I visited those families.  I have never witnessed such <Col N="241" /> a sorrowful, heart-rending scene. There are 17 families, each living in one room in this huge building.  There is one tap at the front to supply water for the 17 families and there is one toilet at the back.  I have seen the broken stairway, the rotten floorboards, the leaking roof and the 101 other sidelights of this awful situation.</P>
    <P>In this newspaper report also the comments by the occupants, who were interviewed by the reporter, are worthy of note.  Mr. Thomas Twomey, aged 39, a building worker, who has been living in the house for the past two years, said he had applied to the Corporation on a number of occasions to get alternative accommodation but had no success.  Mr. Twomey is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>When it rains heavily we are flooded out and most of us have no electricity or heat except for the occasional fire.</P>
    <P>Mr. Thomas Griffin, who, according to the newspaper report, has two children under 10 years of age, said:</P>
    <P>Since 1960 I have applied three times for a house.  I will take anywhere that is suitable.  If we continue living here the whole place will eventually fall down around our ears.</P>
    <P>But the saddest story of all is that of Mrs. Marie McNamara, aged 27, who said:</P>
    <P>My husband Gerard has a very bad asthmatic condition, and we have lost three children as a result of the terrible conditions we are living under.</P>
    <P>This is not an isolated case.  If it were so, the problem would not be so acute.  As I have already pointed out, the survey conducted by the Limerick Corporation shows there are almost 1,000 unfit buildings.  Over the past one and a half years I have visited many families in other buildings. While I do not think I have seen anything to equal the deplorable conditions in which the 17 families in Nicholas Street are living, I have seen cases which are almost as bad.  As I said, we have almost 1,000 inhabited unfit buildings.  In the Parnell Street <Col N="242" /> area there are 59; Edward Street area, 48; Vizes Field area, 78; Windmill Street area, 55; Gerard Griffin Street area, 76; Denmark Street area, 31; Watergate area, 60; Johnsgate area, 131; Abbey area, 55; Island Road area, 72; Thomondgate area, 134; Garryowen area, 61.  For other areas the number is 122, giving a total of 990 buildings which have been certified as being unfit for human habitation.</P>
    <P>That is the situation in Limerick. Words are not adequate to describe it, but I have tried to be as factual as possible and to produce evidence to highlight this situation.  One cannot help asking the obvious question: How did this situation come about?  I have given a good deal of thought and study to this and the only place I can find the answer is in the official figures given in reply to a question I tabled on 9th May, 1962.  The Minister gave me the figures for house building by Limerick Corporation from 1956 to 1962.  Those figures show that in the financial year 1956-57, 200 houses were built; in 1958-59 no house was built; in 1959-60, 175 houses were built; in 1960-61, 108 houses; and in 1961-62 no house was built.</P>
    <P>The present housing shortage in Limerick is therefore due to the fact that since the present Government took office there has been a drastic decline in house building.  The figures for Dublin quoted last night by Deputy Declan Costello prove that.  The figures for Limerick prove, and the figures for the entire country prove that there has been a drastic decline since 1957.  This decline, as Deputy Costello pointed out, is the logical result of deliberate Government policy, a policy which has diverted the resources of the building industry from the provision of houses for the workers to the erection of luxury hotels, palatial public buildings and so on.  These facts speak for themselves.Speaking for Limerick, the present housing situation there is certainly due to the drastic decline in housebuilding since 1957.  Between 1957 and 1962, there were two financial years during which not a single house was built in Limerick city.  But <Col N="243" /> for that, we would not have the present deplorable situation.</P>
    <P>The housing report, in addition to stating the present situation, attempts to forecast future needs and on page 3 the total number of families in need of rehousing on 31 March 1956 is estimated at 830.  Taking into account the average annual increase in applications, that will mean&mdash;and it is a conservative estimate&mdash;that by 1965 we shall still have 1,000 families needing houses.  Obviously if we continue the average annual output of the past few years, the situation will never be solved and we will be faced with a repetition of what has happened within the past few days.</P>
    <P>A colossal task faces Limerick Corporation, and I believe the Corporation are facing up to their responsibilities but I am not at all satisfied that the co-operation forthcoming from the Department of Local Government has been adequate.  My reason for saying that is that there has been a lot of controversy over the past two months in Limerick concerning the proposals in regard to the Watergate housing scheme.  At a meeting of the Corporation in September, several members expressed their dissatisfaction with the delay of this scheme and it was agreed that a deputation should go to the Minister for Local Government, the deputation to consist of some members of the Council, plus the Dáil Deputies.  That was six weeks ago and up to the present we have not received any indication from the Minister as to whether or when he is prepared to receive that deputation.  We are beginning to surmise all sorts of reasons for the Minister's attitude which is certainly questionable.  Why did he not receive the deputation?  What is the position now regarding the Watergate scheme?  I ask the Minister when he is replying to state the present position in regard to this scheme which will not solve all our housing problems but will at least relieve the urgency of the situation.</P>
    <P>I have been wondering if it is possible to provide some temporary accommodation in Limerick for families who have to be removed from dangerous buildings.  I have read with <Col N="244" /> considerable interest of new developments in prefabrication and wondered if it was possible to erect quickly, say, 200 prefabricated buildings in Limerick to accommodate those removed from dangerous buildings.  The Minister said that some steps had been taken in that direction in Dublin and that temporary accommodation which he described as of a caravan type was being provided.  There is urgent need for some such provision in Limerick city.</P>
    <P>I have said what I wanted to say about Limerick housing.  It is a disgraceful state of affairs.  It gives me no pleasure to retail what I have seen and heard.  I appealed to the Minister last year to do something about it but I think the motion under discussion now suggests the best solution:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, viewing with great concern the appalling housing conditions which exist at present in the City of Dublin and the country generally, and believing that urgent and drastic measures are necessary to alleviate the present situation, resolves to establish a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann of fifteen persons for the purpose of:</P>
    <P>(a)  investigating the causes of the present housing shortage,</P>
    <P>(b)  evaluating the future housing needs for the City and the country generally,</P>
    <P>(c)  examining the present legislation relating to housing and its administration, and</P>
    <P>(d)  considering the steps necessary to deal with the present situation,</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>which Committee would be required to report to Dáil Éireann within three months of its appointment and would have power to send for persons, papers and documents.</P>
    <P>I earnestly ask the Minister to accept this motion.  It would enable us to get down to the task and make life something easier for many families in Dublin, Limerick and other areas.</P>

      <P>Might I point out that the Deputy said that a request <Col N="245" /> for a deputation had been made six weeks ago and that no reply had been received by Limerick Corporation? That is entirely wrong.  Not only was a reply sent to the Corporation but it was before a meeting of the Corporation and since then, we have had a reply to our reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not stand up in defence of Dublin Corporation, even if I speak as senior alderman and a member of the Housing Committee.  I have listened to those who know all and I am satisfied that nothing I heard requires me to defend the Housing Committee of the Corporation.  Each year over the past three or four years, I have suggested to the Minister that the Government should set up a Ministry of Works, having in mind this housing situation, a situation I have recognised for many years.  While the Fine Gael motion is on the right lines, I do not think it is a solution to the problem.  We all know that a committee is the quickest way of burying a problem.</P>
      <P>It was stated here this morning that, in 1948, 20,000 houses were needed by Dublin Corporation.  Indeed, that body advertised in all the English newspapers asking for tenders for prefabricated houses.  A deputation was sent over to study the different houses to find out the type most suitable for our needs here.  There were certain difficulties.</P>
      <P>We have to face the fact now that housing constitutes a national crisis. Deputy T. O'Donnell referred to the position in Limerick.  I am aware of it. I spent last month down there.  The Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation are not completely free agents; they have upon them the check of the Allocations Officer.  He, in turn, is subject to the Minister and his Department by reason of the subsidy. There are certain circumstances in which the Minister will withdraw the subsidy.  If all the conditions are not complied with, the subsidy will not be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure every effort is being made by the Department of Local Government, the local authorities and everybody concerned to alleviate the appalling <Col N="246" /> situation.  I believe the setting-up of the suggested Committee would not prove as decisive or as successful in solving the problem as the suggestion I have made that we should adopt the same approach as has been adopted across the Irish Sea.  There there is a problem of 50,000,000.  We have roughly 3,500,000.  They can cope with the problem.  They can build new towns almost overnight.</P>
    <P>Last year we gave the Corporation greater powers in regard to acquisition.Why not multi-storey flats on the sites acquired?  No question of too deep density can arise.  We are blessed with one of the finest parks in the world almost within the city centre, now that so much building is taking place outside the city proper.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin spoke at length this morning.  I do not believe Deputy Sherwin was ever on a building site in his life.  We have built beautiful flats.  The ones at Dolphin's Barn are a credit to the city of Dublin.  They are four-storey flats.  Think of the cost of acquiring that site, the cost of supplying the various services, the compensation paid to those dispossessed, and all that cost for four storeys when we could just as easily have made them 16 storeys.  There is no reason why we should not build on that scale.  There is nothing to deter such building.  The only objection was apparently on aesthetic grounds, that the skyline might be interfered with. It is not being interfered with now at Butt Bridge or O'Connell Bridge.  We seem to have got over the aesthetic difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, do not need any convincing of the appalling conditions in Ballyfermot and elsewhere in the south city.  There is a house in Ballyfermot in which there is a married daughter, her husband and her child; there is also a married son, with his wife and child; both are sharing a small room in a Corporation house.  The Corporation cannot house these people because of the crisis. There is no hope for them.  There was talk this morning of what we will do in Raheny and Edenmore.  If people have to wait much longer, accommodation will not be needed: they will <Col N="247" /> be dead.  There is no reason for appointing a Select Committee.  The decision should be taken now.</P>
    <P>According to Mr. O'Mahony's report &mdash; he was Housing Director &mdash; we needed 30,000 houses in 1948.  We did not build any pre-fabs.  In one year we built over 2,000 houses; in another year, we went down to 200 houses. Obviously there is something wrong. When Mr. O'Mahony expressed the fear that we would have too many houses, I reminded him that the Government had appealed to our own people to come back to Erin; our craftsmen and skilled workers would gladly come back if they had a hope of getting a house.  They have not a hope in the world.</P>
    <P>If one inquires about housing now one gets the stereotyped reply that all applications will have to wait until those removed from dangerous buildings have been housed.  That is the situation confronting the Minister, the Corporation and prospective applicants.There should be more cohesion between the Department and the local authorities.  I am not suggesting that the Department are to blame for the absence of cohesion; I am not being partisan because of the emergency that undoubtedly exists.</P>
    <P>I should like here to draw the Minister's attention to the plight of families who have been in occupation of corporation houses for the past 20 to 30 years.  Numerically their families may not have increased, but as they grow, the sex element enters the matter and though those people have come to care for their houses, they have become inadequate as the families grew.  Many of them would therefore like to build some addition at the back, say, a kitchen or an additional bedroom.  They do not own their houses because the Corporation will not sell.  I submit these people should be eligible for grants to help in the provision of such additions.  It need not cost the Corporation anything and it would enhance the value of those houses.  It might also have the effect of easing somewhat the present housing pressure.  The Department could also <Col N="248" /> help by having plans and drawings made for the help of those people, and made available at a nominal price of, say, sixpence.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already of the system of inspection and have criticised the method of recruitment of inspectors. At the moment the position is pathetic. In Section 12 of the relevant Housing Act, the Minister introduced a provision which at the time was aimed at alleviation of unemployment.  In that, it has failed utterly.  The Deputy from Waterford who spoke earlier to-day went into detail on the method of inspection of work in order to qualify for grants for reconstruction.  I am aware that the applicant submits the plans, starts the work and that eventually, on approval locally, an independent inspector comes from the Department. Perhaps he sees a slate fillet near the chimney which has been there for a hundred years.  He says the work does not comply with the regulations, that the slate must be taken off.</P>
    <P>That is the type of situation being created under the present inspection system and it again raises this question of the qualification of inspectors. I hope the Minister will use that analytical mind of his to remedy this situation about which I have been speaking for the past three years.  I have not the temerity to suggest that the Fine Gael Party withdraw their motion in favour of ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish to congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he has introduced this Estimate and on the progressive trend it suggests in relation to local government generally and to his Department.As is quite natural, the debate has hinged quite a lot on housing, not alone in Dublin but throughout the country.  I should like to say a few words on that subject, but first I want to criticise and to protest against the motion of the Party opposite in regard to housing in Dublin to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the motion as a piece of political window-dressing from a reactionary Party whose past performance was a retreat from their obligations on housing in 1957.  In a very detailed fashion, Deputy Sherwin gave the reasons why this Dáil does not <Col N="249" /> need a Select Committee to go into this matter.  The issues are quite simply explained by the atmosphere of 1956 when, as Deputy Sherwin explained last night, the Corporation were confronted with a very difficult situation&mdash;an increasing vacancy rate and vast emigration.  That did not relate only to Corporation tenants but also to people who occupied houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, by people who had obtained loans.  Keys were handed in, as I explained in previous debates.</P>
    <P>Altogether, 600 small dwellings were left empty on the Corporation's hands. It was in that atmosphere and on advice tendered to us by our officials that the Corporation decided to taper off their housing programme in the perimeter areas.  At that time it was the best move to have made.  It is easy now, when the situation has changed, to hold up hands in horror and blame the Corporation and the Government for the situation that developed.  These are facts and they are on record.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carroll referred to the appeal sent out to workers in England in 1948 on the accession of the Coalition Government.  It is true that a large number of workers come home every year, but unfortunately their stay was short-lived because of the situation that developed in 1956.  Then they had to emigrate again and that was one of the contributory factors to the present situation.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation Housing Committee have done tremendous work for the housing of Dublin citizens in the past 20 years and my estimate is that in that time they have catered for 50,000 families under their various types of housing programme, in houses and flats.  It is true that the policy adopted at the beginning was to house families first.  In that process, unfortunately, the situation developed that very small families, mainly families consisting of elderly couples, were left in these decaying, crumbling tenements.The great majority of these tenements are situated in areas scheduled for housing re-development. In June last there was the unfortunate occurrence that highlighted the particular <Col N="250" /> problem.  I should like to place on record here my tribute to the housing department officials and the Housing Committee itself for the way in which they have endeavoured to meet that unfortunate situation.  They worked night and day, Saturdays and Sundays, into the early hours of the morning.  They provided a 24-hour service to deal with the situation.  It is by no means controlled because, in the light of what was revealed to the various inspectors in regard to various properties in the city, it has been decided to augment the staff and a survey will be carried out on remaining dwellings in the city.  To what extent that survey will accentuate the present position, we do not know.  These are factors we must keep in mind in approaching the housing problem.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Corporation of some years standing, I was one who was critical of the present housing department organisation.  I mentioned that some months ago to the City Manager.  I said that the organisation as at present constituted was inadequate.  The assistant City Manager has been delegated functions from the City Manager in respect of housing, streets and engineering activities.  The housing department is headed by a principal officer, Mr. Molloy, and other officials.  They have a large housing estate to administer.  There are something in the region of 25,000 corporation tenants.  The fact that the Corporation have such a huge estate creates many administrative problems. If I offered that criticism it is not that these men are not doing their job. They are doing it very well.</P>
    <P>I should like to see an organisation set up in the Corporation headed, for instance, by Mr. Molloy, which would be solely devoted to the solution of Dublin's housing problem.  There is a city architect who has other duties to perform as well as his duties in regard to housing.  I should like to see an organisation set up which would be independent and unfettered by other administrative functions, which would be devoted to solving the housing position here.</P>
    <P>The present situation has arisen out of changing trends&mdash;the return of families from England.  A large number <Col N="251" /> of these were successful in being rehoused by the Corporation up to June last.  Other families have since returned.  Active members of the City Council will testify that their main preoccupation today is dealing with housing cases.  We have an insight into the problem and we understand the situation but it certainly calls for a more dynamic approach if the problem is to be solved expeditiously.  The Corporation are pushing ahead as fast as possible with their schemes.  The Minister for Local Government took the initiative some weeks ago in calling the Corporation officials and councillors together to discuss this matter. I understand that these discussions are not yet concluded but I do hope that something on the lines I have suggested will emerge, that some separate organisation to deal with Dublin's housing situation will result.</P>
    <P>The finance is there.  The country's confidence is unimpaired.  I believe that, given the full co-operation of the Department of Local Government, the Corporation officials and the trade unions themselves&mdash;they have a big part to play&mdash;a solution will be found to this housing problem.</P>
    <P>One of the unfortunate features of the past number of years was that local authorities could never seem to be able to anticipate their housing requirements.When I was elected to the Corporation, our target was 20,000 houses, as a result of a Housing Commission appointed by the Government in 1939, which reported that Dublin city needed 20,000 houses.  More than that number of houses have been built, and efforts were made to induce people to build houses for themselves.  Yet the situation today is that at least 5,000 houses are urgently required in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would urge upon the Minister for Local Government that in his discussions of the situation with Corporation officials he should look into the question of setting up a separate organisation within the Corporation to deal exclusively with the housing problem.There are associated problems to be solved.  There is the question of obtaining additional sites.  Sites have become an acute problem.  There is <Col N="252" /> also the question of services and the provision of a large-scale drainage scheme to enable further houses to be provided.  All these matters require the undivided attention of skilled officials if they are to be solved.</P>
    <P>There are some members of the Corporation, including myself, who feel that perhaps the situation might be met by the setting up of a national housing trust.  I do not know whether that would appeal to the Minister for Local Government or not but I throw that out as a suggestion&mdash;a national housing trust something on the lines of the agency that was created to provide houses for State servants and employees of semi-State bodies.  Perhaps that could be examined to see if it would be possible to provide an organisation that would meet the situation on a planned basis.</P>
    <P>One other matter that I should like to refer to is the question of traffic in Dublin city.  It is a matter that is becoming more urgent as each day passes.  The Minister has pointed out that there has been a seven per cent increase in vehicular traffic in the past five years and that is likely to develop. I have had experience of the frustrations and time-consuming delays in trying to get through the centre of the city.  The Corporation took the step some time ago of engaging the services of continental consultants and it is a matter of regret that, so far, their report has not been presented.  I was given to understand it was to be ready in August and now I have been told it may not be ready until January.  The Corporation have one of their officials over in Germany helping the consultants in relation to the survey carried out here.  I do hope that when this report comes to hand, the Minister will readily get the funds necessary to ease traffic in Dublin city by the provision of a bridge or a tunnel.  Indeed we are years behind other countries in that regard.  In proportion to our size, we have a higher ratio of regular traffic than some other cities; yet we have never attempted to provide the facilities for freer movement.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of town planning appeals.  I wish to urge <Col N="253" /> the Minister to do all he can to expedite the consideration of these appeals.  We had to adopt a plan some years ago and a number of proposals came in from various interests in the city.  They had to be turned down and appeals were made to the Minister for Local Government.  The consideration of such appeals should be speeded up by the appointment of more staff.  I understand there is only one appeals officer operating in the whole of the Twenty-six Counties and it is humanly impossible for him to handle these appeals as quickly as the public would like.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister again on his Estimate and I hope that as a result of the discussions here, the problems, particularly in relation to housing, will become easy of solution in the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the fact that the Minister's Department is one of the most important and the largest Department in the State and concerns an enormous variety of activities in connection with the organisation of our society here, it is a remarkable thing that in the annual debate on the Minister's Estimate, the entire discussion seems to centre on the deficiencies in the system of providing houses for our people.</P>
      <P>It is, I suppose, evidence of troubled consciences with all of us and there is no doubt that there is a public conscience in this matter which is slowly being awakened.  That, of course, is a good thing.  I hope that conscience will never be completely satisfied and I must refer to the extraordinary humanity that was embodied in the appeal made by Deputy Declan Costello here last night, a humanity that was wider than any Party divisions and to which I think all of us who heard it responded.  I think the speaker who has just finished now, Deputy Timmons, and Deputy Costello are probably completely at one about this matter and the words Deputy Timmons has just used, that a dynamic approach was needed, might have been used last night by Deputy Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures have been used&mdash;&ldquo;bandied&rdquo; is a word I do not want to use&mdash;across <Col N="254" /> the House here indicating the increase or the decrease in the amount of activity in house building in the past six or seven years.  That does not produce the atmosphere which will enable us all to recognise that the task is a task for all of us.  Going back 40 or 50 years in the history of this society we live in, it will be seen that enormous improvements have been made and an enormous amount of building has been done.  We did inherit, however, a frightening problem of inadequate housing conditions in Ireland and our task is greater than that in many other countries around us.  I would refer particularly to the Scandinavian countries where the problem was not set against the same historical background in which the ordinary Irish were compelled to live on the outskirts of Irish towns and were housed without any great advertence to the conditions under which they lived and brought up their families.</P>
    <P>The problem is recognised by all of us as being serious and as being one to which we in our time must attend, but, in the words of Deputy Timmons, we must ensure that a more dynamic approach is made until we get over the hump of the problem that is there.  I do not propose to say anything more about our failure or otherwise to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I want to speak not about what we do in this regard but how we do it. The urgency of the problem should not blind us to the need for dealing with the problem in a way that will not earn the criticism of our successors in regard to aesthetics or the quality or the character of what we provide by way of accommodation for our people.  The absolute urgency of our needs in the past made us lose sight of a great deal of desirable detail in the provision of housing.  It is all-important that the Minister's Department should now attend to these matters.  This need not in any way slow down the essential task of providing houses but it would be necessary to ensure that the places where we ask our people to live will be attractive places.</P>
    <P>We have all seen evidence up and down the country of good and bad housing schemes.  We have seen the <Col N="255" /> monotonous rows of large blocks of concrete dwellings and then we have seen where imaginative officials in some counties have provided what was graceful to look at and, I am sure, pleasant to live in.  This aspect should be very forcibly emphasised by the Minister's officers in respect of schemes submitted to the Department, that cubic capacity is not enough, that graceful building and proper landscaping are matters which will pay dividends to us all. I know of one housing scheme in County Clare to which I have always great pleasure in directing the attention of visitors whenever I pass it. It is a pleasure to look at it.  I doubt if in the long run it cost more money to do that job well as to do it within the bare Departmental requirements.</P>

    <P>A major difficulty is occasioned by the time taken in printing such a large document, which averaged just under twelve months for each of the three volumes in question, and was even <Col N="256" /> greater in the case of preceding issues.

      <P>The marketing of Irish turkeys in Britain, including such matters as the securing of advance orders, is a function of the licensed turkey exporters.  My Department's function is to keep in touch with the market situation and to provide information and advice on market trends which will be of assistance to producers and exporters in getting the best possible returns for their sales.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not make a material contribution to that end if some steps could be initiated to ensure that licensed turkey exporters would provide salesmen in the London market with a realistic prognostication of the quantities of turkeys they would have to offer during the Christmas season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been investigated here in discussions which took place on more than one occasion <Col N="258" /> between wholesalers and my Department.It would be impossible in fact to give any reliable forecast as to the availibility of supplies and the time at which such supplies would be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister could seek the co-operation of the licensed exporters in making an effort to give an approximate figure, even if it were 10 per cent plus or minus, to salesmen in the British markets and if he were in a position to do that, does he not think that would greatly facilitate the sales of Irish turkeys by salesmen who are at present in the dilemma that they can offer the retailers in England little or no assurance as to the quantities that will be available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had discussions with the wholesalers here on that particular question only last month. The Deputy himself will realise that it is not in fact the difficulties of marketing that have affected turkey production but the pattern of production that has developed in Great Britain.  That is what has made the problem of the producers here what it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the number of turkeys produced here has declined rapidly during the past few years mainly because markets at an economic price have not been found for the turkeys?  I am sure the Minister will agree that the prices paid for turkeys during past years were uneconomic?Surely it is the Minister's responsibility to make an all-out effort to provide economic markets for turkeys?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the pattern of production, as I said, that has taken place in Britain for the past six or seven years that has created this position.  The turkeys being produced in Great Britain in tremendously large units are produced and sold without subsidy of any kind.  Turkeys being produced under the traditional methods cannot compete with that system of production.  While it is true to say that the number has decreased here, the numbers of turkeys produced on the <Col N="259" /> traditional basis have decreased, and if you take figures in the Six Counties, the fall in the production there has been even steeper than here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions were asked by the Deputy previously and I <Col N="262" /> gave him a very full answer.  In the first place, the arrangement that has been made whereby the Sugar Company can sell ten per cent of its production on the home market has been found acceptable by the Sugar Company itself.  The food processing industries set up and proposed to be set up by the Sugar Company are intended mainly for the export market.  Furthermore, of the six private enterprise companies now producing, they are Irish-owned as to 90 per cent of their undertakings and they purchase the raw materials from the same source as the Sugar Company, that is, the Irish farmer, to whom they pay over £1½ million annually for their supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that a number of the other companies in this line of production are subsidiary companies of parent companies in Britain; that, in addition, they draw 40 to 70 per cent of their requirements of raw material from abroad and this material is processed in Ireland? Under these circumstances, why should the Minister place restrictions on the Irish Sugar Company which depends on the Irish farmer for the entire raw material for its production?  Is it not scandalous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the six companies to which the Deputy has referred, four are wholly Irish-owned.  The remaining two companies have a majority Irish interest so the suggestion that any policy is being dictated as far as these companies are concerned from outside is all wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that Messrs. Ranks (Ireland) Limited propose to close their branch at Shannonvale, Clonakilty, County Cork next month; and, if so, if he will make representations to Messrs Ranks with a view to averting its closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is presumably aware, the fall in flour consumption has caused a problem of excess productive capacity in the flour milling industry and has resulted in the closing of a number of mills.  In these circumstances, I do not propose making the representations suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the withdrawal of employment for 25 workers in Shannonvale district is a very serious matter?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Minister agrees with that suggestion, he does not think it worth his while to make representations to Messrs. Ranks Ltd. on the subject matter of this question.  Does he think that that is a fair outlook on his part in this matter?  Does he think it is a matter that does not concern him at all&mdash;that it is not worth his while to make representations to Ranks?  Let the Minister answer that part of the supplementary question first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  Will the Minister not agree that, some years ago when it was proposed to close this mill, as a result of intervention by interested parties the mill was allowed to remain open?  It was assumed that if the Minister condescended to intervene, possibly he would get these people, who, I understand, are closely associated with him, to keep their mill open at Shannonvale and so keep employment for 25 workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the prospect of the disemployment of some 20 workers in Shannonvale, Clonakilty.  The Deputy is also aware that there has been a drop in flour consumption.  That has been a feature in all European countries and indeed throughout the world where the standards of living have been increasing.  I have certain powers in relation to flour mills to ensure that while in production they mill the quota of flour allocated to them.  However, where a mill closes down because it finds operations uneconomic, I think it would be exercising my powers to too considerable an extent to try to require people to remain in uneconomic production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the increases recently announced in the various types of coal are attributable to increases in costs outside the control of the trade.  These include increases in import price of coal and in freight and handling charges.  Having regard to the competition that exists within the coal trade and between coal and other fuels, I am not satisfied that there is any useful purpose to be served by the imposition of statutory price control.</P>

    <P>In a report of 5th July last, the Assistant City and County Manager <Col N="270" /> informed the Dublin Council Council that there were then 1,006 applications for rehousing on hands, of which 478 would qualify for full subsidy.

    <P>In an addendum to the report, in the form of a tabular statement, a copy of which I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report, the Manager set out details of the housing needs in various areas in the county and of the steps which were being taken to meet those needs.</P>

      <P>An inspector of the Department was last in Kerry in the period 19th to 31st August last when he dealt with the proposals on hands at that time.</P>
      <P>It is hoped to issue a decision in regard to 63 of the cottages shortly. Since the beginning of last March, approval has been given to the erection of 100 cottages.  Work was in progress on 56 cottages at the 30th September, 1963.</P>
      <P>It is not considered that there has been undue delay in dealing with the proposals, having regard to the volume of building work which the local authority is initiating.  Efforts will, however, be made to expedite decisions, particularly in regard to all cases which the local authority consider to be urgent.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Proposals for the erection by Kerry County Council of single rural cottages received on the dates stated and which are awaiting decision in the Department of Local Government:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>An immediate decision could not be given on the Corporation's proposal, as originally submitted, because it was not accompanied by certain technical details relating to levels, roads and sewers which were necessary for the proper consideration of the project.

      <P>The Walshes Avenue Area Housing Order No. 1 of 1961 was received in my Department on the 2nd December, 1961.  Action on this order was deferred at the request of the local authority pending the submission of the Green Lane Area Housing Order No. 1 of 1962, which was received on the 13th November, 1962, so that the public inquiries could be held about the same time.</P>
      <P>Public local inquiries into these orders were held on the 12th and 13th June, 1963.  The examination of the evidence of the inquiries and the inspector's reports have been completed and a decision will be issued very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, having regard to the fact that Dublin Corporation 3½ per cent stock 1960-65 is due for redemption within two years, and that further low interest bearing stocks are due for redemption in the near future, he will indicate what assistance the State will give to prevent housing rent increases to meet increased capital debt charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the State subsidy towards the loan charges on capital debt incurred in the provision of local authority houses is in the form of a percentage of the loan charges, the appropriate percentage of any extra charges incurred on re-borrowing would automatically become payable from State sources.</P>
      <P>I may point out, also, that practically all the houses financed out of the proceeds of the Dublin Corporation stock referred to by the Deputy are let at differential rents related to tenants' incomes.  Consequently, the rents may not be expected to be affected by changes in the level of loan charges.</P>

      <P>County road improvement grants generally were reviewed in the light of the very great progress made in recent years in the programme for the provision of dust-free surfaces on county roads.  Where the programme had been completed, as in County Dublin, the grant was discontinued this year.  The amount allocated last year to Dublin County Council for county road improvements was £43,100 but the Council transferred all but £1,000 of this amount to main roads. As the Deputy is aware, I have urged the road authority to proceed with all possible expedition with the much needed improvement of the major traffic routes in Dublin county and I have given them an assurance that the necessary funds will be provided for the purpose.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the tax differential between taxis and other small public service vehicles, both of which enjoy concession rates as compared with private cars.  The differential in favour of taxis was first introduced in 1926 and was maintained under the provisions of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952.  It is allowed because of the more onerous conditions under which these vehicles are required to operate and it is not proposed to amend the law in this respect.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the scheme of old age (contributory) pensions in 1961 enabled many persons, who would otherwise have been dependent on the non-contributory pensions, to qualify for contributory pensions which are not subject to a means test.  The volume of work falling to social welfare officers of my Department was accordingly considerably reduced and a further reduction was achieved by transferring purely clerical work from these officers to other grades.  In these circumstances and in the interests of efficiency and economy it was necessary to reorganise the work of social welfare officers and this reorganisation entailed a reduction in the number of these officers, with <Col N="291" /> a consequential closing of social welfare officers' stations.  I am quite satisfied that there will be no deterioration in the service available to old age pensioners or other recipients of social welfare benefits by reason of this reorganisation.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the grave discontent to which the Deputy refers.  Preliminary work on an area of 26½ acres recently acquired in Kilmovee district commenced on 14th September, 1963.  The lands form part of Ballinlough forest and men were transferred from other properties of that forest to deal with the preparatory work at Kilmovee.  It is anticipated that it will be possible to employ some local men when planting of the lands commences in a month's time or so.

      <P>With your permission, A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions No. 79, 80 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>The increases in the radio and television licence fees were authorised following representations from Radio Éireann regarding the inadequacy of its licence revenue.  I intend to go into details when introducing the Supplementary Estimate that will enable the payment of an increased grant to the Authority in respect of higher fees.  In the meantime I would simply point out that the subsidy of £500,000 permissible under Section 22 (2) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, has been exhausted and that, in addition to a general rise in costs, the Authority has to met extra operating expenditure as a result of extending the television service to the provinces and of its efforts to provide more and better home-produced programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Gallagher's first application for a special allowance under the Army Pensions Acts was refused in Bealtaine, 1960, because he was not found, on examination by Bord na nArm Phinsean, to be incapable of self-support by reason of permanent infirmity.  He re-applied this year and was again examined by Bord na nArm Phinsean with the same result.</P>
      <P>I understand that Mr. Gallagher's position as postman ceased in 1959, because of the condition of his health. While his main disabilities, viz., deafness with some varicosity of veins, may have rendered him unfit to continue his duties as postman, they were not considered by Bord na nArm Phinsean as rendering him incapable of self-support by reason of permanent infirmity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that certain married soldiers in the County Kildare area are living in accommodation that cannot be described as wholly satisfactory.  The shortage of married quarters for soldiers has not, however, been confined to this area but has been a problem at various military centres.  A programme for the erection of new married quarters at the centres where the needs were greatest and for the improvement of old type married quarters in certain barracks was drawn up some years ago and has been actively pursued.  New housing schemes have already been completed in Dublin, the Curragh Training Camp, Athlone and Cork and eight new houses are in the course of erection in Naas.  It is hoped to commence the erection of a further twenty new houses in Athlone this year to replace old type quarters which have been condemned.  It has not yet been determined when or where the next quota of new houses will be erected but the needs of Campa Tréineála an Churraigh and of Cill Dara will receive full consideration in the light of the circumstances obtaining when a decision is being taken in relation to the location of the next housing scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Defence what facilities are provided by his Department for the training of candidates for posts as pilots with Aer Lingus; whether fees must be paid by candidates to his Department; whether any portion of the fees of £300 for the first year and a further sum for the following six months, required to be paid by candidates to Aer Lingus, are paid over to <Col N="320" /> his Department; whether these fees were fixed in consultation with his Department; and, if so, why they were fixed at a level which excludes all but the wealthy section of the community from availing themselves of the opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Trainees selected by Aer Lingus are given the instruction necessary to enable them to obtain the Commercial Pilot's Licence and the Instrument Rating.  The course, which is residential, lasts approximately one year.</P>
      <P>Fees are not payable by the trainees to my Department.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus pays the Department for the instruction and accommodation of the trainees.  It pays the cost of meals to the Officers' Mess concerned.</P>
      <P>The sum of £300 and the further sum referred to in the question were not fixed in consultation with the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister approve of the idea that a fee of £300, for a start, and another large sum after the passage of six months should be paid by any young person or by his parents?  How does the Minister reconcile the payment of public moneys and the facilities given where the openings are available only to the wealthy section of the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have told the Deputy, the sum of £300 and the further sum referred to in the question were not fixed in consultation with the Department.  The Deputy may be aware that this special training of pilots for Aer Lingus was carried out in Perth &mdash;some part of Scotland in any case&mdash; and to enable such pilots to be trained at home the Department of Defence facilitated Aer Lingus&mdash;on repayment &mdash;in the way I have indicated in the answer.  The details of the scheme are a matter for arrangement between the Department of Transport and Power and the Department of Defence.  We certainly do not nominate the fee which any trainee has to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want the Minister's view on this.  Does he agree with me it is unjust that quite a large <Col N="321" /> section of the community are excluded by virtue of the fact that the fee is so exorbitant?  Would he not agree that it would be more desirable, if a fee is necessary, to allow that to be repaid over a period of years than to take it immediately on accepting a candidate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is losing sight of what I have said.  The Department of Defence is not responsible for the details of the scheme.  All we have done is to facilitate the Department of Transport and Power to set up such a scheme.  It is for them to work out the details of it and I suggest the Deputy should make his representations to the Department responsible for the detailed working of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The special compilation of figures on the lines suggested would involve an exceptional amount of clerical work and the collection of material from all Garda stations.  I do not consider that the value of the figures would justify the work involved especially as it would be impossible for the Garda Síochána to offer any worthwhile opinion as to the relationship, if any, between the accidents and possible breaches of speed-limit regulations, nor could any valid conclusion on this matter be drawn from any figures that might be compiled.</P>
      <P>Garda returns of road accidents during the year are processed by the Central Statistics Office and the results are made available to both Houses of the Oireachtas as early as possible in the new year.</P>

      <P>The answer is in the form of a tabular statement which with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In connection with the information given in the tabular statement, I should like to point out that, strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a &ldquo;dealing&rdquo; in the Registry of Deeds.  The Registry of Deeds merely records the existence of deeds and conveyances which fall to be privately examined and interpreted by any person investigating the title to land.  Registration in this instance consists simply of the lodgment and recording of documents. The Land Registry, on the other hand, registers the effect of documents following on examination of the title and of the documents by officials of the Registry and this registration constitutes an authoritative record of title which is guaranteed by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress, I was saying I thought we could all agree on the need for dynamism in the provision of houses for our people.  There has not always been, nor is there now, agreement about the need for attending to the details of aesthetics in the provision of houses for our people.  I was referring to certain very attractive schemes in some parts of the country which were a credit to the architects and local authorities that devised them and which I have had great pleasure in showing to visitors from other countries.  A phrase used here by Deputy Jones struck me as being particularly appropriate in this regard. He said housing begets respect.  I thought that was a singularly effective remark and I want to enlarge it slightly by saying that well-designed and useful housing begets very considerable respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his Department have a great deal of power and they should use it.  It is desirable that they should improve upon some of the things that have been done in the past. Any of us who go around the country with our eyes open see the bleak and comfortless blocks devised for human habitation.  No attempt is made at landscaping or grouping of houses.  No attempt is made to have tree plantations in the middle of housing schemes. Take, for instance, the ESB&mdash;this is an old matter of mine&mdash;who disfigure housing landscapes with these ugly supply lines which they are all too prone to run in the most convenient possible way from their point of view but the ugliest possible way from the point of view of giving pleasure and rewarding the eyes.  I do not see why the ESB should not be compelled to supply their service wires in the most discreet manner.  If they cannot be put <Col N="342" /> underground, let the supply wires be run along the back of the houses but let us get rid of these hideous tree trunks they stick in our city streets, footpaths and housing estates and the heavy wires they string along on them from house to house.</P>
    <P>It is only the Minister and his Department who can provide the cure for this kind of thing.  The Minister's Department should insist that where public money is being spent, or permission given for any kind of housing, whether it is working class housing or private housing, certain standards should be set and every effort made to see they are not departed from.  A requirement should be that a housing scheme should be landscaped, that trees should be planted and that when new, virgin land is taken over, and trees are already growing there they should be allowed to remain and the houses should be placed amongst them. How much more graceful that would make a scheme.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday in one of the national newspapers I read a letter by somebody who was complaining about a builder who had developed an area in the south side of Dublin which had a long row of trees&mdash;probably part of an old demesne&mdash;and when he had built his common place houses, that was the word they used, he proceeded to cut down every one of these trees and the houses which had been somewhat enhanced by the presence of the trees were exposed in all their hideous, vulgar and unattractive shapes.  We are very bad about that type of thing and none of us can do enough to put an end to such desecrating and desolating activity.  The Minister and his officials and officials of the local authorities must at all times ensure set standards and that where people are being asked to live whether it is in the working class houses or where permission is sought for private building schemes every natural addition, tree growing and landscaping, should be attended to.  The effect that will have on future generations is not easily measured.  Of course, you have a kind of cleaning-up mind which you find among public officials.  They love to get everything square and tidy.  They take an area and after getting permission <Col N="343" /> build 40 or 45 houses and put them into monotonous, soldier-like ranks.  They must be deplorable areas to live in.  I certainly would not like to survey constantly that kind of monotonous and unattractive place as an inhabitant.</P>
    <P>There are other problems in housing.Last night we discussed things which are happening in the city of Dublin, the collapse of old buildings. That problem is common to the larger places in Ireland.  In all the cities when we sought to deal with the problem of providing shelter in the crudest possible way&mdash;crude in the sense of getting on with the job&mdash;we moved to the periphery and put up housing estates there.  We left a hollow core in those towns and cities.  I think the technical word used by architects is a twilight zone, places of decrepitude, and now the buildings are coming down. Although it could not be justified on an actuarial balance sheet, I think rescue work could be done on a lot of these houses and that a lot of them should be saved if only for the sake of not having an empty shell.  If it costs a bit more to reconstruct one of these houses than is normally envisaged we should start thinking whether it would not be wise to spend that money.</P>
    <P>One of the drawbacks of periphery building is that rents are high and the expenses of people living there are higher still because of the cost of transport.In the middle of cities we have these old houses which could be reconstructed.There are houses that have been pulled down and areas left blank and houses should be erected in these places.  It is not going to be easy to justify in the matter of costs but there is another kind of balance sheet and they could be justified.  These old streets should not be left toothless, as it were.  Where corporation or town councils are providing houses for their poorer inhabitants, even though it costs more, they should be permitted to build one or two houses in these gaps and keep the heart of the city reasonably sound.  There are odd places where houses could be built thus enabling people to live more closely to where they work and amuse themselves.  This would keep the city <Col N="344" /> reasonably intact and not something which flourished outside its own centre and died in the centre.</P>
    <P>One of the troubles we have is that councils lose the subsidy where sub-tenants are housed from working class houses and there is a tendency to create a new kind of slum.  That has been a sore point and the Department's case is a reasonable one but we will have to take a look at the matter.  People who 20 or 25 years ago married and went into working class areas have reared children who are now themselves married.  We have not been able to provide houses for them with the result that they have gone into their parents' homes to live.  We just cannot evade that problem much longer.  We must make sure that local authorities will suffer no lack of grants or subsidies by housing those people who have been compelled to stay in their parents' homes.  If it was confined to proved relatives, say a son who married and brought in his wife, it would be a sensible thing to decide to provide a full grant or subsidy for another house.</P>
    <P>I have found that in the city in which I serve in the matter of public affairs the cost of houses has increased considerably in six or seven years.  I take it that the Minister has found this experience is not unusual.  I have found that tenders for working class houses are about £400 more than they were some years ago.  I do not know the pattern in the whole country but I should like the Minister to discuss this in his reply to the debate to ensure that the present considerable amount of building being done in the country, in various forms of activity, is not making the housing bill too high for us to look at.  After all, if we pay roughly £2,000 for a house and if we ask for a long-term loan to repay it over 30 or 40 years, then quite a great deal of money will eventually be paid for the house.  The effect upon rents would be an immediate relief if these prices could be reduced somewhat.</P>
    <P>I think prices in building now are somewhat above what they would be if we had more competition in the <Col N="345" /> building trade.  In that regard, the various grants which the Minister's Department pays and enables local authorities to pay are completely unreal.  We must look at that again. Other Deputies have stressed the obvious addition to costs by the Dublin inspection system whereunder the central authority send engineers and architects to inspect works which qualify for grants.  I think there is something to be said for trusting local authority officers to superintend this work.  But, above all, the time element would be enormously improved.</P>
    <P>Now I propose to point out that we have a very considerable inheritance in this country.  We are very fortunate in some ways that we escaped the Industrial Revolution of 100 odd years ago.  We should do everything possible to ensure that our industrial progress does not mar the landscape.  But, more than that, we should do everything possible to ensure that the more graceful inheritance that we have should be valued very highly by us.  I do not propose to refer to the Georgian houses, and so on.  However, it would be no harm to refer to the proposal to cover over the canal here for municipal purposes.  I do not want to deal objectively with the matter but to stress the importance of some kind of control over that kind of proposal.</P>
    <P>If people do not see immediately how important a waterway such as this canal is, running as it does through the city of Dublin; if they do not see its importance from the point of view of sheer visual pleasure and enhancement of the scene they probably will never understand it.  I am convinced there are enough people in the country and I hope in the Minister's Department to make the difference.  There must be officers in most local authorities to see that this kind of proposal cannot and should not ever be entertained by anybody.</P>
    <P>There are people with whom you cannot discuss this matter because they do not see the enormity of their proposal and discussing the matter with them is pointless.  I hope there are more of the other kind of view. I hope there are more councillors and more Ministers and more Dáil <Col N="346" /> Deputies who will set their faces very firmly against any such despoliation.  I am not even discussing this canal from the point of view of preserving a waterway to the Shannon, although that is quite important.  We all know of the importance of tourism.  That anybody should attempt to interfere with the beautiful vistas of the canal on the south side of the city is outrageous and I think there should be public outcry about it.</P>
    <P>The greatest care should be taken when services and proposals of this kind are formulated that we are all on the watch to prevent that kind of mind obtaining control of the proposal.  We must guard against the view that the important thing is to send the water here or the sewerage there and to hell with everything else.</P>
    <P>In the city of Cork a fortnight ago we had a lengthy discussion in the Corporation because some of the councillors there thought it would be desirable to cover over with concrete one of the branches of the River Lee. The Lee surrounds Cork.  One of the branches, not a busy one, is a rather attractive waterway.  These people said they wanted to cover it over with concrete for its whole course through the city to provide a great car park for the citizens and visitors.  I thought it was a shocking proposal and I am glad to be able to say that the city council reacted in the same way and that there were only three votes in support of the proposal to do this thing.</P>
    <P>I met business people and others outside who considered that business was much more important to the city than this kind of thing.  Even accepting that lowest possible standard, I said I would admit that the business of tourism is important and that any city situated such as Cork requires to have these amenities of the eye&mdash;the landscaping and the beauty of the place&mdash; preserved.  One businessman said that if people cannot bring in their cars here what good is anything else.  He described it as sentimental poppycock. I am standing for that sentimental poppycock.  I hope the Minister and whoever succeeds him and the officers in his Department will continue to stand for that kind of sentimental <Col N="347" /> poppycock in this country.</P>
    <P>What we have we should value. God knows, enough bad things were done in the past by our fathers and some by us.  However, we should set our faces against it and realise that there is a great deal more in living than the bare rudiments of shelter and services.  There are graces to which we must pay tribute.  We should always have a kind of aesthetic censorship in relation to what we propose to do.  If that had obtained from Victorian times onwards we should have been spared a great deal of the ugliness we now have to look upon.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his senior officers are, I am sure, at one with those of us who feel that way about these things.  The legislation about derelict sites and town planning is all part of that mind&mdash;and a very desirable mind it is.  We must keep in check the people who think the shortest cut is the best cut.  I should like to pay tribute here to the booklet recently issued by Bord Fáilte.  It is very witty and informative.  It shows how easy it is to improve the places in which we live.</P>
    <P>In the matter of street and roadside advertising, I think we are not strict enough.  The advertisers themselves would probably in the long run be quite agreeable if we said we would put an end to all such advertising because if nobody had an advantage nobody would seek to continue the matter.  It would be a shame if the roads leading from the cities and towns became disfigured in the manner in which roads in other parts of the world have become disfigured by advertising.  If all roadside advertising is prohibited there is no loss to anybody.</P>
    <P>Another matter in which I have an interest&mdash;and in which I hope the Minister has also&mdash;is the quiet development of our small seaside places. The Minister should get the local authority to ensure that the efflorescence of tin shacks and discarded railway coaches stops.  We are obviously facing a reasonable upsurge in our tourist trade.  A great many people will come to this country because of what we have to give them.  But, for <Col N="348" /> goodness' sake, let them not leave the country with a bad taste in their mouths about the kind of thing we do here.  Let us not disfigure our little bays and beaches by uncontrolled sprawling and ugly erections.</P>
    <P>The Minister could very profitably ensure that every county council with a coastal area be made alive to the need for preserving our beaches.  I do not want any elaborate construction done, but I want to prevent eyesore constructions being erected.  These little places really contain the best of what we have to offer to foreigners. They do not want the other type of thing.  If the beaches are reasonably kept and if the tin shacks are frowned upon effectively by the county council, you will get development of a desirable kind.</P>
    <P>In regard to the smaller places inland, I mentioned in a previous debate on this Estimate the experiment carried out in the town of Norwich in Great Britain.  It was something on the lines of what is outlined in the Bord Fáilte booklet, but a bit larger. All the shopfronts in the principal streets of Norwich were face-lifted.  A lot of paint was used and ugly things were taken off the kerb sides.  The result was an extremely attractive change.  The Minister's Department could well envisage a very satisfactory development whereby we would subsidise local groups who would undertake to do this face-lifting of our towns.  It is going to be good for those who live in these places if we can all insist on these improvements.  Children growing up in these areas will have an added consciousness of the need to preserve and not despoil.  Indeed, it should find a place in the curriculum of the schools.  Services like television could be used to indicate the lines on which to go.  Above all, we should inculcate pride of place in all our people.</P>
    <P>I have already referred on other occasions to the proliferation of roadside signs.  Many of these signs are, I know, essential from the point of view of traffic, but I wonder if they are not defeating their own objectives.  In 50 yards of Patrick Street in Cork, I counted no fewer than 20 poles, all bearing different messages&mdash;to stop, go <Col N="349" /> on, turn left, do not turn right.  In those 50 yards, only a genius could absorb all the instructions about what he should do and should not do.  We have allowed it to become overpowering. I described it previously as a footpath forest.  We would want to do something about the simplification of these signs.</P>
    <P>A slight fault I have to find with the towns I have been in is that occasionally there is stupid location of street names.  I go to a corner to try to find out what street I am in and I find no indicator at the corner of the street I am seeking.  Frequently these indicators are not maintained by the local authority in a clean and defined manner.  If we are to provide the traveller from outside with information and if the growth of motor traffic enables more of our own people to go around the country, we should help them in this way.  Street names should be clear.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure if I agree with all the proposals being made at local authority meetings to scrap old placenames and street names and substitute for them what I would describe for want of a better word as patriotic names.  Many of the names we seek to scrap would not, in the context of present thinking, be regarded as patriotic.  However, these people lived in these places and they left their mark on the places in which they lived.  Now a change is taking place.  They have largely been dispossesed and their descendants are inhabitants of a different country.  The old place names remain.  They indicate the passage of time and they are a record of history. I think they should be left there.  If we want to honour the names of our current leaders, let us wait and proceed to put them in new places.  Do not let us obliterate the marks of time.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which the Minister could give attention concerns waterside cities where there are harbour authorities.  It is a matter of providing protection for the people on land, to keep them away from the water and so to prevent the tragedies that occasionally happen in these places.  Frequently there has been great delay in getting adequate protection because of powers of harbour authorities and local authorities.  In <Col N="350" /> the city of Cork some years ago, it was only because of the great reasonableness of the harbour authority that we were able to get as far as ensuring that what happened at a particular place would not happen again.  At present they are jointly agreeing on other proposals so that some form of protection will be provided.  I am aware of the need for keeping the quayside accessible and available for its proper work of discharging and loading boats, but, with the growth of motor traffic, the danger is greater. The harbour authority should be subordinated to the civic authority in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the parking of cars and other transport in our towns.  We seem to be moving towards a slow strangulation.  I believe, the time will have to come where we shall have to give inducement of some kind to local authorities to erect elevated parks, lifts and so on in city centres.</P>
    <P>We can all be proud of the very great development and good work done in the servicing of roads in this country.  It is something commented on favourably by every visitor.  I have often wondered whether something could be devised in the making of roads to give a slightly white surface which would help a night driver.  Any of us who drive at night know the great comfort of coming onto a newly-concreted road where the car's lighting system appears completely efficient. The engineers who provide road surfaces should not deem it beyond their skill to devise something that is quite different from the black, shiny surface that appears as a wall of darkness to the night driver on a rainy night.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department should indicate to local authorities who are undertaking road works on major roads the kind of road signs they should employ to indicate that works are in progress, the distances at which they should be placed from the work and the time the signs should be taken away when the work is finished.  At two different parts of the main road between Dublin and Cork, there are signs which say &ldquo;Danger: work in progress&rdquo;.  You drive on and on, expecting to come to the work in progress and eventually <Col N="351" /> you find the road work has been completed but the signs have been left there.  The Minister should remind roadmaking authorities that these signs should be clear, should be placed at the correct distance and there should nearly be an agreed formula about the wording on them.  They should be taken away immediately the work is done.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Flanagan who said that our craze for straightening roads and taking all the bumps and bends out of them has elements of danger.  I do not think the M1s and M2s are good or necessary in Ireland.  I do not think the contours or configuration of the country lend themselves to that kind of road.  I have seen some of the great earth-cutting equipment in use so that a flat road may go straight through the countryside.  I think this can cause unhappiness in regard to the landscape and unhappiness to the driver who drives for long periods.</P>
    <P>There is a railway bridge near Cork city which is almost an S-bend.  It is in fact the end of the Dublin road to Cork.  I have always opposed anything being done about straightening it out and this was before the Minister's proposals about speed limits.  It works on the mental state of a driver and makes him think in terms of slowness so that when he gets into the city, he will be thinking in terms of 20 or 25 miles an hour rather than 60.  I think an obstruction occassionally has its merits.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Jones in his remarks about public libraries.  When the Library Council was established, it was a considerable step forward.  I do not know to what extent the idea generated is flourishing but I should like to know what grants have been applied for by local authorities and library committees and what grants are to be made.  I have been interested in this all my life because I think the growth of literacy in Ireland is one of the greatest needs we have.  We would hear much more informed comment on many matters if more reading had been done.  It is a pity that the good proposals contained in that action are not <Col N="352" /> sufficient because of the grudging minds of many local councillors.  The first thing they light upon at an estimates meeting is the library rate. It is really a frightening phenomenon. I should like to hear from the Minister how the work is going.</P>
    <P>The Department is one of the most important, extensive and far-reaching of the Departments of State in the way it wraps up the life of the citizen and influences him.  There are three units in it, the public representative on the local authority, the manager and the Ministers' Department.  We have also the long-suffering citizen.  The enormous growth of function in my lifetime has made the work of local government almost too great a subject for a public representative.  The managerial system was the inevitable result and public representatives had to be prepared to shed some authority.  They are, after all, the transient government and the manager and his staff are the permanent activists.</P>
    <P>How well we make the system work will be measured by the commonsense we all bring to it but the figures the Minister has quoted alone of rating returns and expenditure by local bodies indicates the enormous size of the work.  In that work there are many anomalies and many time and money wasting procedures.  The Minister's Department should help to short circuit and eradicate some of the red tape that surrounds the entire activity. The work is becoming greater and its impact on the local representative is becoming less, of necessity, because he is not able to do it.  A good public representative now would be wise to concentrate on a very few aspects of his council's work and let others take on specialised work in other aspects. None can do all of it and never was the jack-of-all-trades in local affairs more the master of none.</P>
    <P>If councillors took an informed interest in certain aspects of the council's work, the whole thing would add up to the kind of competence we require.  We should not be depressed by criticisms on financial points by certain well-organised groups.  The figures we got yesterday for the change in the value of money mean that the <Col N="353" /> rates sought from citizens in 1939 should now be three times as much but in very few local government areas is that the case.</P>
    <P>There is a great task to be done. The Minister's Department can have enormous influence on it, provided all the things I have outlined in my speech are attended to as well as the ordinary day-to-day work of providing housing, roads and so on.  It can also influence very much our people and the places in which they live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that the Minister's Department is perhaps the most important one as far as the ordinary people are concerned, because most of the functions cover the ordinary citizen from the cradle to the grave, from the house he grows up in to the cemetery where he ends, which, in most cases, is the responsibility of the Department.  The big mistake we make here is that we tend to try to argue some of the features of local government on a purely political basis and even with the present situation in the House, I think it is most unfair and unreal for either side of the House to try to give the impression that the entire running of the Department would be, or has been, better done by one side or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that there is a building boom now, that over the years there has been a shortage of housing, but the people who have been forcing the pace in regard to house building are not the members of this House as such but the people at local authority level and, to be fair to them, people at local authority level belonging to the various political Parties.  The Labour Party claim that in most councils on which they are represented they are the champions of housing.  We must admit that there are people in Fine Gael, in Fianna Fáil, and even Independents, who are very actively associated with the campaign for better housing.  It is most unfair that Deputies should try to give the impression that this activity is confined to one group and that, because Fianna Fáil are in power, a great many houses are being built or, because at a certain period an inter-Party or Coalition Government were <Col N="354" /> in power, a great many house were built.  That is utter nonsense.</P>
    <P>We all know that the Department can influence building by the type and amount of grant made available and the speed with which applications are dealt with.  The really big push, however, comes at the local level.  While most of us are elected on a political ticket most of us try to leave our politics outside the door when we enter the council chamber.  That is as it should be.  At the moment there is a big rush on housing.  I do not propose to deal with housing here in Dublin because it has been dealt with here already.  We heard Cassius Clay himself giving his views today.  I do not propose to deal with them.  Some may agree with them.  Some do not. I am not in a position to state categorically that somebody had to be put out of a house because the house was dangerous.  I do not know personally if that person had to stay a night, a day, a week or a month on the side of the road.  If that happened it is a disgraceful situation.  If it did not happen, then our newspapers have been printing something entirely wrong. Newspapers do not usually print a lot of lies.  But somebody must be at fault and the only charitable comment one can make is that, if it did happen, then steps should be taken now to ensure it does not happen again.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the building of labourers cottages or houses for the working classes, as they are called.  A peculiar situation has evolved in a number of counties as a result of the housing boom.  Local authorities decide to build houses.  Time is required in which to select the tenants and ensure that they are really what they say they are in order to qualify for the two-thirds grant when the houses are built.  The Department must be satisfied with the type of house, etc.  All that takes time.  It takes far too long and the time taken could be shortened without impairing the efficiency of the scheme.  When all the formalities have been complied with there is a tendency on the part of the Department to force the local authority to take the lowest, or a pretty low, tender.  What happens?  The bonds <Col N="355" /> are prepared and the contractor is told to go ahead.</P>
    <P>Now that contractor has in the meantime got another contract, or a number of contracts, from which he will make more money and he simply uses the local authority houses as a means of ensuring continuity of employment for his workers.  Men will arrive on the site and dig the foundations.They may put in the foundations and even go as far as the damp course. They then disappear for months on end until one wet day comes and they arrive back again on the site, do another little bit of work, and go away again.  In some cases they have not even started the contract.  In one instance, when the local authority told the contractor that the time in which he should have completed the house had expired and they proposed to cancel the contract, the contractor's reply was: &ldquo;Cancel away.  I have plenty of work to keep me going.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a pretty bad state of affairs and we must lay the blame for that on both the local authority officials and the Department.  If a contractor contracts to build a house, or a number of houses, and does not complete the contract within a reasonable time, for reasons of his own, he should not be considered any longer, no matter what his price may be in future schemes. Local authority officials say that, even if they advertise again, the same contractors will compete and they are back where they started.  The whole trouble arises because of the practice I have described.  Contractors are not interested in building these local authority houses at all and they contract at a price, therefore, which does not even pay them for doing the work in a reasonable time.  The Department should stipulate a reasonable contract price and accept the nearest to that, not the nearest to the lowest tender. If that were done we would get houses built much more rapidly than at present.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities are adopting what I regard as a reprehensible system.  The Department of Local Government lay down regulations under which they will give two-thirds subsidy towards houses for those who come <Col N="356" /> out of condemned or overcrowded houses.  There is no difficulty about that at all.  The difficulty arises when the houses are built.  The local authority calculates the rent not on the actual cost to the local authority but on the gross cost of the house.  If the repayment is 45/- per week the local authority inform the tenant that the house cost 45/- per week to build and they will give it to him at 30/- per week, allegedly knocking off 15/-.  That has the effect of giving a subsidy to the county rate from the local authority or from the Department of Local Government building grants. That was never intended and steps should be taken immediately to prevent the continuance of any such system.</P>
    <P>There is, too, a tendency to introduce a system now whereby tenants of existing houses will carry the subsidy required on future housing of the working classes.  That was never envisaged by legislators.  Even when we had a foreign Government here such houses had to be let at a fair rent and the balance carried on the general rate. If it is the intention to carry the balance through the existing tenants we shall have to change our laws.  Since we have not changed the law, I suggest local authorities should be notified by the Department of Local Government that they are not entitled to do this sort of thing.  Apparently they are under the impression that they are.</P>
    <P>I would particularly ask the Minister to refer, when replying, to this system of subsidisation of rates from the grants which he gives to local authorities for housing.  I would ask him to ensure that this system is dropped.</P>
    <P>There is another thing happening too at local authority level with regard to housing of which the Minister must not either be aware or have the full facts. The vesting of county council cottages is carried out under the system that those erected before 1948 are vested on a 50 per cent annuity and those erected after 1948 on a 75 per cent annuity.  I recently came across a number of cases where people had vested houses which were built after 1948 and were, in fact, being asked to pay more than the existing rent.</P>
    <P>Certain reasons were given for this <Col N="357" /> but my opinion is that either a tenant should be entitled to vest a house if the law provides for such vesting or he should not be permitted to vest it at all.  Somebody should devise a new scheme under which a person who had the house rented at 9/- a week could not be asked to pay £1 a week plus rates after vesting.  The existing situation is ridiculous.  I suggest it is not legal and I would ask the Minister to comment on it when he is replying.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities endeavouring to assist in the housing of the working classes have, instead of erecting cottages, offered certain facilities.I am glad to see that Meath County Council are one of the local authorities who are in the forefront of this type of work.  They have, in most cases, bent over backwards in order to facilitate people who want to build their own houses.  They are prepared to give a subsidy as well as a supplementary grant equal to the amount given by the Department of Local Government.  If a person who wants to build a house gets a grant of £300 from the Department, Meath County Council give him the same amount, provided his income is under £832 or his valuation under £50.  As we all know, the 1962 Act precludes the giving of a supplementary grant to those over these limits except in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Meath County Council have also suggested recently the giving of loans at 4 per cent interest to a limited number of people.  This will encourage such people to build their own houses instead of depending on the local authority, because they can now borrow up to £1,000 from the county council and, with the grant from the Department of Local Government, will be able to build their own houses.  I suggest that the Department might consider&mdash;there have been rumblings about the Minister's intention to introduce a new Housing Bill in the not too distant future if he is still in a position to do so&mdash;whether it would be desirable to make available loans at lower than the present interest rates to local authorities for this purpose.</P>
    <P>One of the factors which affects very <Col N="358" /> much the cost of a house is the price asked for a site.  I know the Minister has circularised local authorities and has asked officials to bring to the notice of members the fact that local authorities had authority to acquire sites and sell, lease or give them to people who want to build houses.  I am also aware that quite a number of local authority members did not get that information despite the fact that the Minister passed it on to the officials with a reminder.  The information was stifled somewhere between the Minister's office and the county manager and I submit that the Minister should in future see to it that if he gives an order that information is to be passed on to local authority members the information is duly given to those members.</P>
    <P>The price of a site is one of the items which will run up the cost of a house and I would suggest that the Minister again circularise local managers and instruct them that, where it is possible to do so and where there is a demand for housing, an effort should be made by the local authorities to acquire sites.  I know of quite a number of very suitable sites in different areas in County Meath where people are anxious to build houses but the people who own those sites for one reason or another will not build on them, will not sell them but just hold them there despite the fact that local authority services are either passing through or beside the sites.  I suggest the local authorities be requested to use their powers to acquire such sites because apart entirely from the fact that it might relieve the local authority from the necessity to build cottages and pay for them, it also means the local authority will after a period be getting an income from the rates and it will enrich the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister very rightly referred in his opening statement to the fact that a number of what I would call urban authorities have not been availing of their right to give supplementary grants.  The excuse always given is that they could not afford it.  If they give a supplementary grant of £300, <Col N="359" /> one local representative told me, where 1d in the £ raises only £10, it would take 30 pence in the £ on the rates to provide a supplementary grant to help one person to build a house.  Of course, the alternative was for the local authority to build a house themselves, so the cure would be worse than the disease.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, ask the Minister to try to assist local authorities who are in that position.  Perhaps the correct way of doing it would be to have housing made, not a matter of responsibility for little towns scattered throughout the country, but for the general rates in the county at large.  I submit it would result in a much more effective housing programme being carried out throughout the country.  It would mean that the responsibility and the demand for housing would go to the county council and not to the urban councils.  Perhaps some of the urban councillors would not like that but they cannot have it both ways. That is one solution.</P>
    <P>There is another problem affecting rural areas of which the Minister may not be aware and I wonder if we could have a statement on it.  Somebody may wish to build a house but finds that the only site he can get is on a vested county council plot.  Sometimes when there is an acre of land with a plot, the owner of the vested cottage is prepared to give half an acre or whatever is required to build a house on.  The trouble is that the person intending to build a house cannot get a loan, if his intention is to build on part of a plot attached to a vested cottage.  The Minister, I am sure, knows a way in which that can be altered and I would ask him to alter it without further delay because quite a number of houses have been held up for that reason.</P>
    <P>There is a problem which I raised with the Minister by way of a question some time ago and which has come to my notice recently again.  When I raised the matter with the Minister he gave me the answers which he got from the local authorities concerned and which to a certain extent were correct. I should like to discuss the matter for <Col N="360" /> a minute or so.  It is the question of people who are building houses beside towns.  One of the regulations laid down is that they must have water and sewerage.  The simplest thing to do is, if there is a supply of water and a sewerage scheme in the town within a reasonable distance, to ask the urban council or whoever is responsible for the town to give a connection.  Two points have arisen.  One is that the urban authorities say they cannot have water or sewerage connection for all sorts of reasons.  The second is that they will say they can have the connections but demand payment out of all proportion.</P>
    <P>I know that there is a certain type of jealousy between people who live in towns and who pay town rates and people who build a house immediately outside the town and pay the county rate and are getting supplementary grants which are not available in the town.  At the same time, I cannot see why a county manager, who is manager for the town and for the county, should agree that the person who builds a house on the edge of the town should be asked to pay a fantastic sum for services.  I know that quite a number of people have offered to pay the difference between the county rate and the town rate for services.  Personally, I think they are rather foolish to do so.  However, the offer has not been acceptable.</P>
    <P>There is one instance which I brought to the notice of the Minister. A man who had a small field of seven or eight acres beside a town was using the field for grazing.  He was paying £10 for the use of water.  He built a new house on the field, only 100 yards outside the town and assumed, as he was already paying £10 for water, that he could connect the supply to the house.  He did so but got a bill for a further £10.  When I brought the matter to the notice of the Minister the Minister said there was nothing wrong.  Maybe there is nothing wrong with charging £20 for the use of water but it is a matter in which the Minister should intervene.  There is an area in which a number of houses could be built but people are not prepared, in <Col N="361" /> addition to the outgoings for rates, repayment of loan and so on, to pay such an amount for a water supply. As a result, building has been stopped.</P>
    <P>There is another question which has also been brought to the notice of the Minister and which is coming before the local authority in the near future for discussion.  It is the case of people who bought a site beside a town.  The county manager did not think it was a good idea that they should buy this site.  He thought they should buy a site inside the town.  They had tried 14 different people, none of whom would sell them a site.  They bought the site outside the town and intended to build houses on it.  The urban council have offered to give them a connection.The county manager said he is not prepared to agree that the council should provide the services from the edge of the urban council area out to these 14 houses concerned.  I was present when these people made an offer.  Five of them were tenants of urban council houses.  They offered to give an additional eight housing sites to the county council free, gratis and for nothing.  The county manager objected to it and it could not be done.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is the type of encouragement that should be given to people who are prepared to put themselves into debt in order to house themselves.  That has been done by a county manager who is well known to have been more than helpful over the years in the matter of housing.  What I am trying to put across is that if somebody gets an idea at the back of his head that something is wrong which everybody else thinks is right he should not be allowed to ride that hobbyhorse to the detriment of everybody else concerned.  That is what is happening in this case.  If a person is prepared to build a house for himself he should receive every encouragement and niggling objections should not be raised.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about it all is that time and again applications are made by urban councils and, indeed, by corporations to take in areas where houses have been built.  These people <Col N="362" /> have no objection at all if that is done in this case.  We are told that this would interfere with the town planning of the area but before those people started even to buy the site they got general town planning permission and got particular permission for the type of house they proposed to erect.  In the circumstances the present situation should not be allowed to continue. The matter is before the Minister and I would ask that he should indicate to the manager that he does not approve of that sort of codology.</P>
    <P>On the question of repairs to houses, the Minister has recently made a great attempt to get a backlog of housing inspections dealt with.  He has a number of inspectors looking after the matter.  He has a number of people looking after the question of grants for repairs.  The slowness in payment after the inspections have been carried out would suggest that the Minister may not have adverted to the fact that if he has six engineers inspecting the houses where originally there was only one, he requires six times as many people to deal with the matter administratively. It would appear that the Minister has not taken that into account and that the same staff are attempting to deal with the very heavy backlog which is being cleared off at the present time.  Might I suggest that the Minister should inquire about the matter and do something about it?</P>
    <P>As far as repair grants are concerned, the new idea of allowing essential repairs to be carried out is helping a great deal.  The grants for reconstruction which have been given over a number of years have been availed of very generally.  The system is working pretty well.  I do not know whether it is intentional or not&mdash;perhaps the Minister would inquire from his officials if it is intentional&mdash;but I find recently that when a big number of repair grants are applied for in a particular county the inspector begins to be a little stricter than he would have been before and, when the unfortunate person has everything finished, comes back and says: &ldquo;Do you know, I think you would be better off if you put a window there&rdquo;.  The man has not put a <Col N="363" /> window in the position suggested either because he does not think it necessary or it is not mentioned in the original plan or because the window would face north.  Or, you may find an inspector saying that a door must be put in a certain place or suggesting some other alteration.</P>
    <P>The general effect of this is to hold up grants.  It holds up the payment to the man doing the job and discourages people in the locality who had been thinking of doing similar type of work.  If that idea has been passed on from higher up, I would suggest that the Minister should have the engines reversed and should issue an instruction that if a job is started and is properly done a certificate should issue and payment should issue.  There should be none of this codology in <Col N="364" /> order to slow up payments so that the demand on the Exchequer will not be as great as it would be if the work were passed for payment at the same rate as was formerly the case.  I may be entirely wrong.  If I am, I apologise to the Minister but it would appear from what I have found out recently that something like that is happening.</P>
    <P>The question of the cost of the erection of houses has been under discussion over the past couple of days and whether or not it is possible to erect a cheaper type of house than that now being erected at local authority level is a matter that should be considered.</P>

      <P>The information requested in respect of 1961-62 and 1962-63 was furnished in reply to questions by the Deputy on the 6th December, 1961, (Dáil Debates, Vol. 192, Col. 1313) and 19th July, 1962, (Dáil Debates, Vol. 196, Col. 2878).  The increased primary allowance (seven-tenths of the general rate in the £) provided under section 3 of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1962 applies to all holdings of agricultural land with valuations up to £20 and to the first £20 of higher valuations.  The supplementary allowance (one-quarter of the general rate in the £) provided under Section 4 of that Act applies to land valuations in excess of £20.</P>
      <P>Following is the information in respect of 1963-64:&mdash;</P>
