    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the quantity of strontium 90 in milk in this country in last May and in May, 1962.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the settled scheme of testing for Strontium 90 in milk, samples taken in each period of approximately six weeks are bulk tested.  Samples taken in the first half, approximately, of May are bulk tested with the samples taken in April and those taken in the later half of May are bulk tested with those taken in June.  The average levels of Strontium 90 per gram of calcium in samples tested over the periods April to June in 1962 and 1963 were 18.5 and 34.5 micro-micro curies respectively.  The maximum level compatible with safety is many times greater than these figures and the levels found have at no time given cause for anxiety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why the subsidy has been withdrawn from Thurles racetrack; and if he will take immediate steps to have the subsidy restored in order to maintain that amenity for traders and patrons of that race-meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy has in mind grants paid by the Racing Board. Under the Racing Board and Racecourses Act, 1945, such grants are a <Col N="940" /> matter for the Board itself.  I understand from the Board that a number of racecourses have been a cause of financial anxiety to it over a period of years.  Thurles was a case in which, following a general review of such racecourses earlier this year, the Board decided that, subject to any further representations the Racecourse Executive might make, financial support would have to be withdrawn.  The Board, I am informed, has arranged to meet a deputation from the Thurles Racecourse Executive shortly in order to make a final decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to <Col N="941" /> answer Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>The Director of Ordnance Survey informs me that publication of the latest <i>Map of Dublin and Index to Streets</i> was announced on the 3rd September, 1963.</P>
      <P>The Director has not received complaints of delay from booksellers in filling orders for the new publication. All orders have in fact been met in a matter of days but some of the larger orders were dispatched in more than one delivery.</P>
      <P>Maps are normally issued on receipt of orders.  In this case some 7,000 copies were printed, of which 4,261 have been issued to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees payable to medical witnesses for giving professional evidence in court depend on the period of absence from home and the place where the court is located. If the evidence is given in the witness's home town, the fee varies by reference to the time factor between £2 5s. 0d. <Col N="943" /> and £4 14s. 6d, similarly, if the evidence is given outside his home town, the fee varies between £3 3s. 0d. and £6 6s. 0d.  Where more than one case arises on the same day, an additional fee of £1 11s. 6d. is payable for each extra case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the article &ldquo;Hours and Earnings of Agricultural Workers in England and Wales&rdquo; which appeared in the May, 1962 issue of the monthly publication <i>Economic Trends</i> published for the British Central Statistical Office.</P>
      <P>In this country, particulars of the number of males engaged in farm work are obtained each year in the June agricultural census and are published by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Agricultural Wages Board, following the making of each Agricultural Wage (Minimum Rates) Order, publish a memorandum setting out in respect of the various areas the wages of male and female agricultural workers, overtime rates, rates for Sunday work, annual holidays, weekly half holiday and related matters.</P>
      <P>The type of information regarding the classes of agricultural workers, actual hours and earnings contained in the article referred to is not available here.  It is doubtful if the classification of agricultural workers on these lines has any relevance in our circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is not considered that the expense which would be involved in estimating actual hours and earnings here would be justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="947" /> Agriculture if he has received any recommendation from the Agricultural Wages Board regarding additional holidays with pay for agricultural workers; if so, if he will indicate the nature of the recommendation; and when it is proposed to introduce legislation in relation to such holidays in order to give effect to an undertaking given by the then Minister in the Dáil on 29th March, 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Following are the terms of the motion which has been adopted by the Agricultural Wages Board and which has been received in my Department:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in order to put agricultural workers on the same footing as other workers in respect of public and/or Church Holidays, the Board request the Minister for Agriculture to consider the question of introducing legislation to give agricultural workers an entitlement to Public Holidays or Church Holidays, with pay, similar to that provided for other workers in Section 8 and 9 of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961 (No. 33 of 1961).</P>
      <P>As recently as 1961 an Act was passed increasing the entitlement of agricultural workers from six holidays with pay to twelve such holidays per annum, and the Board did not then suggest that Church or Bank Holidays should be added.  In fact, an amendment to that Act on the lines of what the Agricultural Wages Board now proposes was rejected by this House. In the circumstances, I would require to be fully assured that positive and compelling reasons exist for introducing so soon after the recent Act fresh legislation on the lines proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that, as the law stands, agricultural workers must be considered as second-class citizens?  Every other type of worker is entitled to a minimum holiday but agricultural workers are, by law, entitled to six days less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the passing of the 1961 Act, I felt, and I still feel, that, knowing the practice that is followed as far as Church and other holidays are concerned, the position of <Col N="948" /> the two classes of workers is comparable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is referring to Cavan where there is the practice of giving Church holidays but unfortunately, that does not operate in the rest of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>(a)  The form of application was received in my Department on 29th September, 1962, but was not fully documented and the outstanding information was not received from the applicant until 19th November, 1962.</P>
      <P>(b)  There inspections have been carried out by my Department's inspectors.The first inspection, on 14th January, 1963, revealed that the standard of workmanship was very poor and that certain substandard fittings needed to be replaced.  The applicant was informed accordingly.  Following a subsequent request for grant payment, an inspection on 15th June, 1963, showed that the applicant had departed from the original plan.  This necessitated a third inspection in order to clarify the position.  It is now shown that the new house is connected with the old dwelling and it will accordingly be necessary for the applicant to block-up the connecting door before final payment of the grant can be made.  The applicant is being informed accordingly and arrangements are being made for payment of an instalment of the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="949" /> (c)  There has been no undue delay on the part of my Department in dealing with this case.  The applicant himself was responsible for most of the delay.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda Síochána that the filming in question, which was being carried out on behalf of the proprietors of the premises concerned, was to commence at 6 a.m. but that the glare of the morning sun made it necessary to postpone operations until 6.45 a.m.  Filming then began but was suspended between 8.10 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. approximately so that traffic flow would not be interfered with.  When traffic lightened, filming was resumed but was discontinued after about ten minutes at the request of the Garda Síochána as there was some slight traffic congestion mainly due to the presence of onlookers.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that serious delay was caused to any traffic, and only one complaint was made to the Garda Síochána about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday evening that this Bill is to a large extent introduced by the Minister as a tidying-up measure.  In his statement on the Bill, the Minister says that the amendments it proposes are not radical and are entirely in the nature of modifications of the earlier Act, the Act of 1952.  I was pointing out yesterday evening that there are in fact a number of rather important changes being made in the Bill.  Some of them are, I think, commendable &mdash; certainly quite unobjectionable&mdash;but there are, however, a few matters contained in this Bill which the Minister should examine more closely before the Bill becomes an Act.</P>
      <P>As I see it, there are six main features in the Bill.  First, as the Minister pointed out, the Adoption Act, 1952, provides for the adoption only of either illegitimate children or orphans.  The first change the Minister proposes making in the Bill is in connection with the case of illegitimate children where the natural parents have married in the interim between the birth of the child and the making of the adoption order.  It seems to me to be reasonable, provided there are adequate safeguards in connection with the consent of the parents of the child, that the Board should have the authority to make an adoption order in such cases without having to go into all the detailed inquiries to which the Minister referred.  All of us can see that from a practical point of view it is not desirable that the Board should be put to the trouble of making exhaustive inquiries in all cases when possibly there might be only one or two cases coming within the scope of the particular category which this change in the Act is designed to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second major change proposed in the Bill is the raising of the age limit of children who may be adopted. Under the Act, the children must be between the ages of six months and seven years.  It is proposed in this Bill to raise the upper limit to nine years. <Col N="962" /> The Minister indicated with regard to this change that it was being made at the request of the Adoption Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They suggested 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They even went further to suggest 21.  My only comment is that I am surprised the Board should recommend this change. The change which the Minister is effecting by this Bill may be regarded as a minor one.  It is a comparatively slight extension.  In fact, I think it will apply only to cases where the child was in what I might call the family of the adoptive parents prior to attaining the age of seven years.  To that extent, the change is certainly limited and I see no harm in it but it surprises me to learn that the Adoption Board were seeking to extend the upper age limit for the adoption of children.</P>
      <P>The next change being brought about by the Bill is in connection with the ages of the adoptive parents.  Under existing legislation, it is provided that the adoptive parents must have attained the age of 30 years.  The Minister now proposes to reduce that to 25 years provided the couple have been married at least three years. Again, while that is a substantial change in the existing legislation I do not think anyone is going to object to it.  I do not think exception can be taken to it.</P>
      <P>The next matter to which I want to refer is a change that I regard as a rather radical one in the legislation notwithstanding the Minister's introductory statement that none of the changes proposed was radical.  It is the changes in regard to the citizenship of the adoptive parents.  Heretofore under section 11 (5) of the 1952 Act it was provided that the board might not make an adoption order unless the applicant, or if the applicants are a married couple, the husband, was an Irish citizen or had been ordinarily resident in the State during the five years preceding the date of the application. Under section 5 of the present Bill the Minister is simply sweeping away the existing provision regarding citizenship and the five years' residence within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> It is true, as the Minister says, that under subsection (4) of section 11 of the 1952 Act it will still be a necessary qualification for the adoptive parents that they should be residing in the State.  I do not think that is any use once section 11 (5) of the 1952 Act is taken out.  The meaning from now on, as far as I can see, is that so far as residence is concerned the only qualification which will be necessary for an applicant is to show that he is resident in the State at the time of the application.There is nothing whatever to provide that the week after an adoption order is made he may not clear out of the State for good.</P>
    <P>I can see that in some cases of adoption that may not be of particular importance but remember that the code of legal adoption applies to orphans and it may be an orphan aged five or six or seven whose whole heritage has been Irish who can now be taken out of the State the day after an adoption order is made and the Minister seems to be relying as a safeguard against that kind of situation merely on the fact that section 11 (4) of the 1952 Act is still to continue in operation.  It provides only that the applicants reside in the State.  I think it is fair to say that the only meaning that can be attached to that is residence in the State when the application is made but that it does not in any way tie them to residence in the State once the order has been made.  Consequently, I regard the change proposed in section 5 (2) of the present Bill as quite undesirable and I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider it before the next Stage.</P>
    <P>The next feature of the Bill which I regard as important and again, which I regard as an extremely radical change notwithstanding what the Minister said, is in regard to section 7 of the Bill.  It is interesting that in his introductory statement the Minister dismissed section 7 as purely a drafting amendment not worthy of comment by him in the House.  The explanatory memorandum which the Minister issued with the Bill gives considerably more information than the Minister himself gave in his opening statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> Under the Adoption Act of 1952, certain essential requirements are laid down in section 13 with which the adoptive parents, the applicants applying for the adoption of a child, must comply.  These requirements are in no way harsh but are the type of requirements that any reasonable person would feel are the bare essentials in the case of adoption.  The applicants are required to be of good moral character; they should have sufficient means to support the child they are adopting and the applicants should be suitable persons to have parental rights and duties in respect of the child or, if the applicants are a married couple, that both of them should be suitable persons.Those were the minimum essential requirements laid down in section 13 of the 1952 Act.  The Act then went further&mdash;I assume for the purpose of protecting the child that was to be adopted&mdash;and in section 17 authority was given to the Board to make what might be regarded as provisional orders, interim orders of adoption, where they were, so to speak, putting the adoptive parents on a kind of trial or probationary period.</P>
    <P>The situation up to now has been that even in the case where the interim order is made the Board had to be satisfied that the minimum essential requirements of section 13 of the Act, good moral character of applicants, sufficient means to support the child and suitability to exercise parental rights and duties in relation to the child, were fulfilled and the Board had to be satisfied those essential requirements were fulfilled even when making an interim order.  In his introductory statement the Minister referred to section 7 as only a drafting amendment which did not call for comment. In the explanatory memorandum, however, this explanation is given:</P>
    <P>The Board has power, under section 17 of the 1952 Act, to make an interim order giving the custody of the child to the applicant for a probationary period not exceeding two years, provided the circumstances are such that it would be lawful for the Board to make an adoption order in the case.  Strictly interpreted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> May I interpolate here that I think it should be strictly interpreted?</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;this may mean that the Board must be absolutely satisfied at the time of the making of the interim order as to the suitability of the proposed adoption, although if it was in fact so satisfied the need for an interim order would not arise.  This section of the Bill proposes to allow the Board to make an interim order although it is not, at the time, fully satisfied in all respects as to the suitability of the proposed adoption.</P>
    <P>You have now, therefore, the situation in which the Minister is inviting this House to say to the Adoption Board: &ldquo;Even though you are not satisfied that the applicants are of good moral character, or even if you are not satisfied that they have sufficient means to look after the child they propose adopting, or even if you are not satisfied that they are suitable persons to have parental rights and duties in respect of the child, you may nevertheless make an interim order giving these people the custody of the child for a period up to two years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is all wrong.  I think the true meaning of the 1952 Act in relation to interim orders was that the Board, quite rightly, had to be satisfied on these minimum requirements, but they could have other doubts in their minds.  They might have felt that, because of the age or condition of health of the applicants, there was some doubt in their minds on the general question of suitability.  They might have felt, for example, that while the minimum requirements under section 13 were in every way complied with by the applicants, some matter regarding the environment in which the child would live &mdash; I am talking now not of the actual home but of the general surroundings where the home was situated&mdash;caused them some doubt because they did not regard the environment as entirely suitable.  They might have some other doubts not related in any way to what I regard as the minimum requirements under section 13 and, nevertheless, because the minimum requirements under section 13 were complied with, <Col N="966" /> the Board had the authority of the Legislature under the 1952 Act to make an interim order.</P>
    <P>All that is now being swept away and the Minister is saying, in effect, to the Board: &ldquo;It does not matter whether you have doubts regarding the good moral character or the general suitability of the applicants; you may thereafter, once this Bill becomes law, make an interim order for a period of two years.&rdquo;  I believe that is an extremely radical change.  I am surprised at a man of the Minister's intelligence not having either sufficient knowledge of the Bill he is proposing or else endeavouring to gloss over this as merely a modification, a mere drafting amendment, not requiring any comment.  This is a very serious change in the Bill and one I would ask the Minister seriously to reconsider before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The last feature in the Bill to which I want to refer is also, to my mind, if not entirely a radical change, certainly a substantial change in the existing law.  It is the provision contained in section 9 of the Bill.  As the Minister explained, section 9 of this Bill is designed to remove the obligation of notifying the local authority of the placement of the adopted child in a house in their area.  Under section 2 of the Children (Amendment) Act, 1957, that obligation exists; it exists even in the case of adopted children in respect of whom an adoption order has been made or who have been placed by an adoption society.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy with the Minister's arguments but I do not think he is doing the right thing in making as substantial a change as he is making in this section of the Bill. The Minister is correct, I think, in his opening statement, when he says that &ldquo;Prospective adopters would have been obliged by law to ascertain and pass on to the local authorities particulars which in several cases they did not know themselves and they did not want to know and that could, if known to them, be a source of constant anxiety.&rdquo; I take it what the Minister is referring to there is the obligation under section 2 of the Children Act, 1957, to notify <Col N="967" /> the health authority with regard to the name, place, date of birth, and so on of the child.  To that extent, I have some sympathy with the Minister's argument and I think it would be no harm at all to remove that particular obligation&mdash;to arrive at a situation in which, while notification was given to the health authority, it was not necessary to give the name, place and date of birth of the child.</P>
    <P>I would, however, seriously recommend to the Minister that he should leave the rest of the obligation unaltered.  The necessary machinery for child welfare inspections and child welfare care, if necessary, already exists in the various local authorities. As I understand the position, if the Adoption Board are themselves to be faced with the task of physically inspecting and satisfying themselves with regard to the homes in which these adopted children are placed, they will require a very large extension of their staff.  The machinery is already there.  I agree some of the particulars required under section 2 of the Children Act of 1957 could be eliminated, and might well be eliminated, in this Bill.  The fact is, however, that the child welfare officers are already there in the service of local authorities and can be a valuable source of information to the Adoption Board; that machinery could be made available to the Adoption Board.</P>
    <P>If the Minister operates section 9 of the Bill as proposed, it will mean, in effect, that the existing machinery, which is there and available to the local authorities, and at present available to the Adoption Board as a source of information, will in fact no longer be available.  I would urge the Minister again to have another look at that section of the Bill before Committee Stage.  As I say, I would go with the Minister to a limited extent.  Some amendment to cut out the danger of anxiety or embarrassment to the adoptive parents, some measure to safeguard, if you like, the confidential nature of information given to them, might be desirable, though I am not sure it is necessary.</P>
    <P>I feel sure the local authorities and <Col N="968" /> their social welfare officers are very much alive to the responsibility of their position in this matter.  If it is thought some measure to safeguard any information of a confidential nature should be taken, well and good. However, I think the Minister is making a serious mistake in removing entirely the obligation to notify, as he, in fact, is doing in Section 9.  I do not think I have anything further to say except to express the hope that the Minister will reconsider the sections to which I have referred.  If he does that, this is a Bill that will improve the present position.  I should like the Minister to let the House know the extent to which the changes he is making in this Bill, particularly those to which I have referred, have the support of the Adoption Board or were made at the request of the Adoption Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the tributes paid to the members of the Adoption Board.  I wish also to ask the Minister whether the Board made any recommendations to him in connection with the problem of birth certificates.  The Minister will recall that up to the passing of the Act in 1952, there was only one birth certificate available and that was known as the long certificate, the normal certificate.  Of course, that meant this was available only to legitimates.</P>
      <P>The question arose in 1952, and, indeed, earlier, of providing some means of helping illegitimates to obtain birth certificates and thus remove this stigma of illegitimacy that had attached to them over the years.  The 1952 Act provided for two certificates, the usual long certificate and, in addition, the short certificate which did not show the names of the parents.  The long certificate still showed the names of the parents.  Indeed, up to that the illegitimate child had the name of the mother only on the birth certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1952, in my opinion, was not sufficient to meet the problem as it existed and I should like the Minister to comment on how the present arrangement is working out generally in the country.  I feel sure he has evidence in the Department on that <Col N="969" /> and perhaps he has information from the Adoption Board on it as well.  I can tell him that in parts of the country 90 per cent of the people who look for birth certificates demand the long certificate.  That means that those who are unfortunate enough to be illegitimate are immediately suspect as far as their colleagues and companions are concerned when they can produce only the short certificate.  Whatever about the situation in the city of Dublin, in rural areas, the position is anything but satisfactory.  I have been asked by a number of people in very responsible positions to bring this to the notice of the Minister in the course of the Second Reading of the Bill.  My personal belief is there should be only the one birth certificate.</P>

      <P>At this stage there should be sufficient Christianity in the world, particularly in this country, to enable us to pass legislation at this stage that will bring such a situation into operation.  I know that behind the scenes there are people who do not want that change in the legislation: there are people who preach Christianity and practise black magic, as far as I can see.  They preach Christianity but they do not practise it. They want to visit on the children the sins of the parents.</P>
      <P>I have nothing further to say except that I welcome the amendments in existing legislation which the Bill introduces.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us some information on the position about birth certificates because I shall put down an amendment on the matter, if it is still necessary, when the Committee Stage comes along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This question fortunately has now come into the realm of virtually non-controversial discussion and I feel in relation to this Bill that the Minister must at this stage be acting on the reasoned knowledge that has been acquired in the ten odd years of the working of the Adoption Act. I do not find myself obsessed by certain fears that have been expressed; I do not find I can read into this Bill <Col N="970" /> some of the radical changes or some of the possible consequences that other people read into it.</P>
      <P>I have a very definite outlook on this problem.  I had it when the parent Bill was going through the House and still retain it.  While we are dealing with a problem that does involve some delicacy in its ultimate resolution, I think it would be very unwise of this House to try to put any technical impediment in the way of the easier and more effective projection of this adoption conception into our society. I subscribe to the view expressed by Deputy McQuillan that it is our bounden duty to alleviate as far as possible, and to safeguard from any impact as far as possible, children who have no will, no control over the circumstances in which they were conceived and born.</P>
      <P>My outlook has always been radical enough to consider that there are no illegitimate children, that there are only illegitimate parents, and that it is our duty as a Christian legislative assembly, as a predominantly Catholic legislative assembly, to help in every way this laudable and most successful work of the Adoption Board.  Matters that have been attacked here and sections that have been attacked here as being radical are humane in their concept and serve to alleviate in the main the lot of the person who cannot alleviate it for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the agitation in Deputy McQuillan's mind when he talks of the two birth certificates.  It must agitate the mind of anybody with a really fundamental interest in this question of adoption, because there must be some reasonable formula to obviate this unconscious stigma which arises, possibly not in our highly populated areas but certainly in areas in rural Ireland with a limited population.The Minister is not so naïve that he does not realise that in rural Ireland everybody's business is everybody's business and anybody's business is everybody's business.  When there is any question of prospective employment or of some kind of appointment, and there is a discrimination made between the long certificate and the short certificate, there is <Col N="971" /> always this stigma which is not the responsibility of the unfortunate person who has to suffer the consequences of the short certificate but the responsibility of some people removed from the scene.</P>
    <P>Over the years, I have watched the Adoption Board get over its growing pains and get down to work in a most commendable way.  I do hope that, with his many failings, the Minister will not rush at this very involved and complex problem without having recourse to the opinions and experience of those people who have so ably served their purpose in the State structure.  We should have a sufficiently broad concept of all the sensitivity behind this problem to ensure that our legislative proposals will be so framed as to enable the Adoption Society and the Adoption Board, in certain circumstances that they feel are to the advantage of the adoptee, to dispense with limiting technicalities and other matters that might cause a crux and might delay or prevent the establishment of a child in a home where it could prosper and grow up to be a worthwhile citizen.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the proposals made in relation to the change <i>vis-à-vis</i> the local authority or the health authority are as radical as suggested by my experienced colleague, Deputy O'Higgins.  They are beneficial to the extent that they remove a stigma, even if it is only a shadow stigma, that need not be there.  Rightly or wrongly, my concept of our approach to this whole problem is that we have to be as sensitive and as delicate as possible to ensure the least possible impact on the adoptee.  In fact, I am prepared to accept what might be deemed radical if it gives the adoptee a better chance.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the people who have proved so effective and successful since the commencement of the 1952 Adoption Act will overlook the three essentials of moral standard, capacity to maintain the child and suitability of the parents for parental responsibility.I believe that the people who have tackled and grown up with this problem in the very effective way that the Adoption Board have will be more <Col N="972" /> than conscious of these overriding necessities.</P>
    <P>The atmosphere of non-controversy about this subject on this occasion is not quite the atmosphere in which we saw the embryo legislation of 1952 arrive among us.  Fortunately, experience has been gained and a growing tolerance has set in and we now have the proof of the value of the Board that took over the task of pursuing the Legislature's intentions.  We should be careful to ensure that every amendment we make in future comes before the House in a non-controversial way in the light of the experience of the people whose efforts to date we have commended so much.</P>

      <P>There are one or two provisions in this Bill with which I am not completely satisfied unless I am misinterpreting the changes which are being made.  In my capacity as a public representative, I have come across cases in which difficulties have arisen and which I feel should be remedied.  I noticed with interest one point the Adoption Board recommended to the Minister, that the upper age limit for adoption should be 21.  As I read it, a period of grace of only two years beyond the age of seven years for a child to be adopted is allowed.  Am I to take it from that that if the application has been made within the prescribed period, that is, from six months to seven years, the extension period is then allowed to nine years only, or am I to take it that the extension is between the ages of six months and nine years that the application can be made?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  I take it that if the application is made before the age of nine years and the child is with the parents before the age of seven years, the adoption may be granted at practically illimitable age.  I should like the Minister to clarify that definitely because the Minister knows I have had one case before his Department and before the Adoption Board which perhaps is a somewhat unusual one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too clear about this matter.  I take it if the application is made before the age of seven years, up to nine years may be granted.  When the Minister is replying perhaps he would tell the House up to what age an adoptee may be accepted by the Adoption Board, always provided the application has been made before nine years.  I feel that the two cases I have in mind are not covered by this new legislation but I stand subject to correction on that.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to make is that the position is, and always has been, that the consent of the parents has to be given for the child to be adopted by whatever family propose to adopt the child.  For that reason, I want to know what flexibility is allowed to the Adoption Board.  I have in mind a case in which the parent concerned&mdash;there was only the one known parent in this case&mdash;gave consent to the adoption but did not give it according to the full legal terms which always appeal so forcibly to lawyers and who always like to have everything cut and dried.  She had not signed a document before a commissioner for oaths.  The parent left the country and although there was no tangible proof for the Adoption Board that she was still alive, she was supposed to be somewhere in the New World according to her grandmother who, however, produced no evidence whatever to show that this was so.  As a result, this case was held up for about seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it forcefully to the Minister that this child was growing up with this family with whom he had been since he was a child.  He then reached the age at which he was to <Col N="974" /> make either his First Holy Communion or to be Confirmed&mdash;I am not quite sure which&mdash;and for which he had to give his parents' names.  He could not give the names of the parents who had adopted him because the Adoption Board would not accept him on account of the grandmother saying that the mother was alive.  I made repeated applications on behalf of the people who wished to adopt him but I could not get anywhere.</P>
    <P>I should like to know that there was, somewhere in this legislation, provision to cover cases like that.  I admit it is an unusual one but I put it to the Minister that it very often happens that mothers of illegitimate children will go away to another country as they wish to start life afresh.  They may go to America, to Africa or anywhere else. Are we to have a situation obtaining within the confines of this Bill that a difficulty such as this may occur, that a person may be waiting many years before the adoption will go through? In this case I believe that what happened ultimately was that the Chairman who administered the law very vigorously&mdash;I think he was a retired district justice&mdash;said that within the Act there was nothing he could do, but he was succeeded by another man, who I think was also a lawyer, who took another look at the Act and said that this was an impossible case, that they must do something about it and the unfortunate child was permitted to be adopted.</P>
    <P>If the Minister takes a realistic look at the situation, he will realise that there are very many difficulties in regard to the illegitimate child, particularly in relation to the mother of the child who, in so many cases, goes away and starts a fresh life and gets married. I do not think we can divorce these two problems I have mentioned, one from the other.  The first is in the event of a parent being out of the country.  Surely it should be possible to provide for a period in the Act for the adoption of the child when the consent is not obtained.  The child should be given a new chance in life.  Why should the child be prevented from being adopted because the parent has gone out of the country or is too selfish to sign a document giving consent?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> The other point is in regard to the upper age limit.  I am thinking of one case and there was a second case, before the Minister became Minister for Justice, with which I had to deal in my constituency.  The children in these cases had reached the age of 14 or 15 years before they could be adopted.  Perhaps the Minister would clear up my problem.  If he has not made provision for the type of cases I have cited, will he do so within this Bill because if he does not, then as far as I am concerned I believe the new Act will be utterly and entirely useless.</P>

      <P>I should like, first of all, to thank Deputies who have contributed to the debate for the manner in which they have made their contributions and for the obvious care and thought they have devoted to this measure.  I feel that most of the matters that were discussed could more appropriately be debated on Committee Stage and I do not wish at this stage to get involved in a Committee Stage discussion.The purpose of the Second Reading debate has been achieved in that it is clear that all the Deputies who have spoken welcome the Bill in principle and regard it, in the main, as being desirable and useful.  I am very glad of that because, as some Deputies have said, we now have this system of legal adoption since 1952 and it has been a tremendous success. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, nearly 7,000 children have, through the workings of the Act and the Adoption Board, been given a chance in life which otherwise they would not have had, and the benefits which flow from that in the human and social spheres are inestimable. The benefits accrue not only to the child but, possibly in even greater measure, as we all know, to the adopting parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill came about in this way. When I came into my present office, naturally one of the spheres of activity at which I looked was the system of adoption.  I said to the Adoption Board in so many words: &ldquo;You have been operating this Act since 1952, for <Col N="976" /> approximately ten years, and I should like you to submit to me your detailed views on its operation and whether there is anything in it which is hampering your work or any way in which it could be improved.&rdquo;  The Board did that with the very great care and thoroughness with which they do all their work, and they submitted a comprehensive memorandum on the manner in which the Act was working and where they were experiencing difficulties and where the path could be smoothed out.</P>
    <P>We submitted these suggestions of the Board to the greatest possible scrutiny that we could bring to bear. Naturally we had discussions with persons who are engaged in this great work.  I need not elaborate to the House on who these people are&mdash;they included social workers, persons in adoption societies, various religious authorities and so on.  It was only when we went through that process of discussion that we finally made up our minds as to the modifications proposed in this measure.</P>
    <P>I must, with all due deference to Deputy O'Higgins, who, I know, has considered this very carefully and has given his views in his usual forthright and sincere fashion, repeat my opening claim that there is really nothing radical in what is proposed in this measure. It is simply a process of modifying the original proposals in order to make them work better.  The solid basis of the 1952 Act and the fundamental principles of that Act are not interfered with at all in this measure.  I can assure the House that the officials of my Department, who keep in touch with developments all over the world in these matters and who attend international conferences, and so on, have more than once been complimented by delegates of international organisations on the adoption system in this country. Some people go so far as to claim that it is as fine a system as could be devised and has worked as well as any in the world and, as Deputy Seán Collins very wisely pointed out, it would be foolish and irresponsible to make any change without the most careful consideration of what we are doing.  I want to assure the House that <Col N="977" /> we have given the greatest possible care and thought to what we are doing and we are satisfied that it will not interfere at all with the fundamental soundness of the system and, at the same time, it will make possible a number of desirable adoptions which otherwise would not be possible.  That is what we would all like to see.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan may regard me as doing something of a Pontius Pilate act when I say that, unfortunately, the question of the long and short birth certificates is not proper to adoption legislation.  The Act in which he is interested is a piece of legislation promoted by the Minister for Health who controls the system of the registration of births, marriages, and deaths, the issue of birth certificates and so on. The Act which brought about the short birth certificate was the Vital Statistics and Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1952.  In so far as adopted children are concerned, there are two alternatives.  They can have a short birth certificate using the adoptive surname but not disclosing the fact of adoption or they can have a long birth certificate showing the adoptive surname and the names of adopters as adopted parents.  Neither certificate refers to the original name and I can make this point to Deputy McQuillan. There is nothing anywhere available to the public to connect the original registration of the illegitimate child in the Custom House either with the short birth certificate or the long birth certificate available to an adopted child.  In other words, the cross-index between the adoption register and the original register in the Custom House is not available to the public.</P>
    <P>I want to reinforce here, if I may, what Deputy Collins and Deputy McQuillan have said in this regard.  I am aware of instances where there has been some modicum of stigma cast on adopted children.  We will all agree that this is completely and entirely undesirable.  We would all appeal to our fellow citizens that there should be nothing of this sort.  Of course, the whole purpose of the adoption code is to make the adopted child equal in every way to the ordinary child born into the family.  That is, of course, where I think Deputy O'Higgins is <Col N="978" /> mistaken when he criticises the proposal to exclude inspection by local authorities.  I think the institution of that system of inspection was accidental and was never meant because the idea of the local authority inspecting the home in which the child was placed for adoption is, I think, inimical to the whole system of adoption.</P>
    <P>The machinery of inspection by local authority officers is, of course, a safeguard in cases, where children are boarded out with persons.  I think it is a mistaken conception to apply that at all to adoption circumstances.  That is particularly so when we realise that, if we were to continue this arrangement, the child placed for adoption would be subject to two different sets of inspection.  It would, on the one hand, be subject to the thorough inspection, scrutiny, and so on, of the Adoption Board and its staff, which, of course, is only proper, but in addition, there would be a separate system of inspection by local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not before placement, but I am talking about inspection after placement of places where children are placed for adoption. These children are subject to inspection by the Adoption Board and its staff.  I am subject to correction in this but I think I am right in saying that the Adoption Board may, if it wishes, request the assistance of the <Col N="979" /> children's officer of the local authority if it desires to have a particular inspection carried out by that officer or to ascertain any particular piece of information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows more about it than I do.  I should like to ask the Minister to inquire into that.  Is the inspection undertaken by the Board the inspection undertaken by the child welfare officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Adoption Board has its own inspectors to do this work. I am subject to correction here but I am almost certain it can also avail of the services of the children's officer of the local authority for particular purposes.But the essential thing is that it is all the time under the aegis and control of the Adoption Board, and not the local authority, and that is the way it should be.  These inspections should be a matter for the Adoption Board and it is a misconception to place them under the local authority in any way.</P>
      <P>As regards citizenship, I do not want to broaden this into a Committee Stage debate.  We can go into it fully on Committee Stage when, I think, I will be able to satisfy the House completely that the abolition of the nationality citizenship requirement is completely desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, the position is this: our citizenship laws are so wide at the moment that a very large number of categories of people can qualify as Irish citizens.  Deputy O'Higgins's argument was that a person could adopt a child and immediately leave the country.  Surely it is better that a person, who is going to adopt an Irish child and reside here, should use the machinery of our Adoption Act, thereby coming under the scrutiny of the Board rather than take the child out of the country and have it adopted under the laws of some other country, which may be any other country in the world?  What we are now doing will make it easier for people to adopt children under our, as we think, nearly perfect system of adoption and then take the child abroad rather than do <Col N="980" /> as they are doing at the moment, take the child abroad without any reference whatsoever to our Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They can still do that but the requirement that they must reside here for five years or be an Irish citizen is an irksome restriction on these people and would encourage them&mdash;indeed, in some cases would force them&mdash;to take the child abroad without reference to our Adoption Board and have it adopted under the laws of some other country.  If we do this, we do encourage them to submit themselves to the scrutiny of our Board and have the child legally adopted under our system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a safeguard but at least it is not a discouragement. If you are going to insist on the stipulation that prospective adopters must reside here for five years before our Adoption Board will give them legal adoption, then surely they are much more likely to take the child away, whereas if we abolish this requirement and make it possible for them to adopt a child when they have resided here for any length of time, provided the Board is satisfied as to their suitability, then they are more likely to avail themselves of the provisions of our Act and to have the child adopted in accordance with our requirements.</P>
      <P>We will come to section 7 on Committee Stage and can have a full debate about it then.  I just want at this stage to say that Deputy O'Higgins does not seem to me to be correct in his interpretation of what we are doing and why we are doing it but it is better to leave that over until we have the full freedom of the Committee Stage debate and, if Deputy O'Higgins can then persuade me that what I am doing is wrong, we shall have the Report Stage to mend our hand.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if Deputy Esmonde got exactly what I was trying to say with regard to the change we are making about ages.  There are two separate sets of circumstances.  First of all, there are a number of cases at the moment which, because of the provisions of the 1952 Act, have gone over the age limit for adoption and we propose to give the Board power, in all of the cases we know of, at any rate, to put that position right.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The objects of the Bill can, I think, most conveniently be considered under two broad heads: first, the prohibition of the use of airguns by children and, secondly, the amendment, in a number of ways, of provisions of the Firearms Act, 1925.  As far as the proposed amendments of the 1925 Act are concerned, it can be said that the Bill is very much a Committee Stage Bill, so to speak: the amendments are a miscellaneous group and it is not my intention to refer to them in detail now. I think, however, that the proposal to control the use of airguns is in a different category.  It is a matter of importance both in principle and in practice and, on that account, I should like to begin by reading an extract relating to airguns from the explanatory memorandum:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no explicit reference to airguns in the Firearms Act, 1925, but in practice smooth-bore airguns of a calibre of .22 or over, and all rifled airguns, have been looked on as firearms and, therefore, capable of being lawfully held or used only on the authority of a firearm certificate granted, as far as residents in the State are concerned, by the local Superintendent of the Garda Síochána.  Accordingly, since firearm certificates may not lawfully be granted to persons under the age of 15 years (and in practice would seldom if ever be granted to a person under 16 years), these types of airguns are already forbidden to children <Col N="984" /> and they may be held by older persons only with the consent of the Garda Síochána and on payment of the excise duty that is levied on firearm certificates&mdash;generally £1 in these particular cases.  There is, however, no control on the sale or possession of smooth-bore airguns of a calibre below .22.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill is that all airguns should be classed as firearms, and since the Bill also proposes that the minimum age for holding a firearm certificate (either for an airgun or otherwise) should be raised to 16 years, the effect, as far as airguns are concerned, would be that (except at shooting galleries or the like) no child under the age of 16 years would be allowed to have or use an airgun, and those over that age would be allowed to do so only on the authority of a firearm certificate.</P>
    <P>The reason for the proposal is, of course, the number of serious injuries that have been caused by airguns. Members of the medical profession and others with direct experience of these injuries have, for years, been advocating some restriction of this kind.  In one Dublin hospital, they have about a dozen patients every year with eye injuries caused by airguns, and about half of them result in the permanent loss of an eye.  That is only one hospital&mdash;admittedly one that specialises in eye treatment&mdash;and only one type of injury.  I do not think it is necessary to go beyond these figures: six people, nearly all children, every year losing completely and permanently the sight of an eye, and six others with eyesight impaired.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, people who argue, quite reasonably, that airguns are but one cause of accidents.  Children can be injured by catapults, or knives, or by falling off bicycles or down the stairs at home.  Moreover, only a very small minority of airguns ever lead to a serious accident and the question arises whether everybody is to suffer because of the misdeeds of a few.  Finally, the argument has been used that this is a matter for parental control rather than legal sanctions and that it is undesirable that the law <Col N="985" /> should be such as to relieve parents of their obligations.</P>
    <P>While it is right that full consideration should be given to these arguments, I think we can dismiss without difficulty the one about parental responsibility because it is, I suggest, clearly invalid and based on an inadequate examination of the facts. It is undoubtedly true that the parents of the boy with an airgun have a very definite responsibility to ensure that he does not misuse it or, if they cannot do that, to take it from him, but that is no answer to another child who is injured by a pellet from the gun or to the injured child's parents.  The injured child's parents may have done everything a parent could do to discharge their responsibilities and for anybody to brush aside the question of the State's responsibility on the plea that it is a matter for the parents would surely seem to them to be adding insult to injury.</P>
    <P>As regards the other arguments against control, I readily concede that, in my opinion at all events, they are valid as far as they go.  It cannot be denied that there are other sources of accidents and that only a small minority of airguns cause accidents. But accidents by airguns are something the community, by its laws, can do something about, and the fact that we cannot solve every problem is no reason for not tackling those we can. Secondly, we have to try to compare the benefits of airguns with their cost in terms of suffering, mental and physical, to so many people&mdash;people who, may I stress, are usually innocent victims of the carelessness or recklessness of others.  Airguns are not an essential of life.  Training in the proper use of an airgun is, no doubt, beneficial, but there are other ways for boys to learn discipline and, as we all know, the great majority of boys have to get along without them, either because their parents cannot afford to indulge them to that extent or because their parents are unwilling to take the risk of injury to others.</P>
    <P>The prohibition, in fact, will affect only a small minority.  It is well to bear in mind, too, that with the greater variety of toys and amusements that <Col N="986" /> is now available, the loss of this one source of amusement is of even less significance than it might have been twenty years ago.  Undoubtedly, there are cases where parents have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that the airguns would not be misused, but obviously distinctions between different children would be quite impossible, and the general interest must take priority.</P>
    <P>As regards the method of control, the proposal is, as I have said, that airguns will be classed as firearms. This was not the only possible approach.  It would be possible simply to prohibit persons under a specified age from having or using an airgun, but this would present serious practical difficulties of enforcement.  It would mean that the airguns at present in the hands of children could be retained in the house and there would be a standing temptation to children to take out an airgun if it were left lying about the house with no particular responsibility on anybody to look after it.</P>
    <P>In practice I would expect that, under the proposal in the Bill, the great majority of airguns at present in the hands of children will be destroyed and that only a small fraction will be retained by adults under the authority of firearm certificates.  In these cases, the adult to whom the certificate is given will be responsible for the safe custody of the gun and should he fail in this the certificate will, of course, have to be revoked.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have noticed, the prohibition extends to all guns capable of discharging a slug.  It is not possible to make any valid distinction between weak guns and strong ones.  Most of the accidents are caused at very close range, and a weak gun can be nearly as dangerous as a strong one in these conditions: they can all damage a human eye.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the other provisions of the Bill can, I think, best be discussed on Committee Stage, but perhaps I may mention briefly some of the more significant proposals.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands has asked that power be sought to suspend temporarily the use of all firearms either generally or in particular areas <Col N="987" /> as there may be periods when weather conditions are so bad that such action is the only practical method of ensuring that game is not slaughtered indiscriminately.  Section 3 of the Bill proposes, accordingly, to empower the Minister for Justice to make orders of this kind at the request of the Minister for Lands.  The orders would have a validity of a month and would be capable of being annulled by resolution of either House.  A similar provision&mdash;section 4&mdash;proposes to empower the Minister for Justice, in the interests of the public safety, to order the handing up to the Gardaí of all firearms, or certain classes of firearms, in a particular area for a period not exceeding a month.  Again, it is proposed that such an order may be annulled by resolution of either House. I do not envisage that recourse need be had to that particular provision save on the rarest occasion, but I think it is desirable that the power should be there in case a situation calling for its exercise should arise.</P>
    <P>Another proposal that may be of interest is contained in section 7.  This section is designed to enable the Garda Síochána to dispose of a substantial number of firearms that have accumulated in their stores over the years and the owners of which have been unwilling to take any steps to sell them or otherwise take them off the hands of the Garda Síochána.  The proposal is that the Garda may sell the firearms if the owner declines to remove them, but the proceeds are to be given to the owner.  Section 8 is a similar provision relating to firearms that may come into the possession of the Garda in future.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Act proposes that, instead of having new certificates issued each year, the Garda Síochána may renew a certificate from year to year.  This proposal would relieve the Garda of a significant amount of clerical work.</P>
    <P>Another proposal which I would like to mention is contained in section 12, which is designed to ensure that, where an occupier of land is not able to avail himself of the right to have a &ldquo;limited&rdquo; firearm certificate for the <Col N="988" /> shooting of vermin on his land, he may nominate somebody else to get the certificate.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill proposes to add to the categories of persons who are exempt from the requirement to have a firearm certificate as a condition of having or&mdash;in some cases&mdash;of using a firearm.  Under existing law, firearms dealers and persons engaged in the business of warehousing are exempt, but there is no specific exemption for their employees.  The Bill proposes to remedy the omission.  In addition it is proposed that certain categories of persons will be exempted provided, in each case, the local Superintendent of the Garda Síochána expressly authorities the exemption.  For example it is proposed that members of rifle and gun clubs will not need to have certificates in respect of rifles and guns they use at target practice or at competitions, provided the club itself is in possession of an authorisation and the range is authorised.  Other proposed exemptions are for operators of rifle ranges in amusement halls and at carnivals and for members of the public using such ranges; for auctioneers; for persons taking part in theatrical performances; for persons starting athletic races; and for persons taking part in ceremonies and using firearms issued under the authority of the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Section 23 (1) (a) of the Larceny Act, 1916, makes it a felony to rob a person while armed with an offensive weapon and section 28 of that Act makes it a misdemeanour for a person to be found by night with any dangerous or offensive weapon with intent to break or enter into any building and to commit a felony.  Section 25 of the Bill proposes to provide that unloaded firearms and imitation firearms are, for the purposes of those sections of the Larceny Act that have been mentioned, to be deemed to be offensive weapons.  It is already clear that a loaded firearm is an offensive weapon for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the Bill proposes to make it an indictable offence for a person taking a motor vehicle without the permission of the owner to have a firearm or an imitation firearm in <Col N="989" /> his possession unless he shows that he had the firearm or imitation firearm with him for a lawful purpose at the time.  Section 27 has a somewhat similar provision in regard to the offence of resisting arrest or escaping from lawful custody.</P>
    <P>These are, I think, the most important provisions, and I do not think I need say any more about them.  I would, however, like to mention that, as the amendments are fairly extensive, I considered the question of consolidation but, on balance, decided against it.  It will be noticed that practically all the amendments propose additions to what is already in the Firearms Act, 1925, rather than changes in the text of the existing provisions, and, if a consolidating Bill had been drafted instead of this one, it would have been a much more bulky document and its examination by the House would have been made unnecessarily difficult.  There would be no commensurate advantage, especially as the subject is not one on which there is any body of common law which needs to be re-stated or clarified, and consolidation can more efficiently be undertaken at a later date.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the close of his remarks, the Minister referred to a point I had intended urging on him&mdash;the question of the consolidation of his Bill and the earlier Firearms Act.  I agree with the Minister that in view of the size of the 1925 Act, which was very considerable and the additions proposed by this Bill, the resultant Act would be a bulky volume. However, I should like the Minister to consider in future legislation of this type that it is well worth while consolidating from a number of different points of view.  Certainly, from the point of view of anyone in the legal profession who has occasion to examine these Acts and advise on them, it is obviously more convenient that the law should be contained in one Act, if possible, rather than that it should be necessary to thumb through a number of different Acts. From the point of view also of the <Col N="990" /> occupants of the benches, particularly the District Court bench, it would be a matter of convenience to consolidate as far as possible.  The ordinary district justice has not got so readily available to him the services of a legal library as the people sitting on the Circuit Court and High Court benches.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, the principal feature of this Bill is to bring within the scope of control airguns, and I think there will be general approval in the House for that step. The Minister indicated, when introducing his Estimate about a year ago, that this measure was under consideration.The only comment I want to make is that it might have been brought before the House a little more speedily than it was.  However, it is here now and, for my part, I very strongly approve of the measure to control airguns.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me&mdash;and I think it is a suggestion worth passing on to the Minister&mdash;that it might also be as well to consider anyway the possibility of making it necessary before firearms certificates are issued in respect of airguns that the applicants should have had some training in the use of airguns and firearms generally. Particularly in the case of young people with airguns, such practice is available to them in a number of rifle clubs.  Certainly, as far as the city of Dublin is concerned, it is available.  I appreciate as I am speaking that it might not be possible to provide for this in an Act but it would be possible by way of regulation.  It certainly would be an additional safeguard if the applicant for a certificate to cover an airgun were required to produce to the superintendent&mdash;or to the sergeant as it may well be when the Act goes through&mdash;some note from the secretary or person in charge of a rifle club to show he has had some practice or experience, even theoretically, in the use of the gun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approve of the provision, which is also contained in the Bill, to raise the age limit from 15 to 16 years.  As the Minister stated, there are in fact a great number of additions to the 1925 Act being suggested in this Bill.  Most of them are matters which, if they require <Col N="991" /> discussion, require Committee discussion rather than Second Reading discussion.Therefore, I do not propose saying any more, except in reference to two small points about which I want to ask the Minister.</P>
    <P>First, with regard to the question of the temporary banning, so to speak, of firearms in a given area for a month at the request of the Minister for Lands, authority for which is being taken in this Bill, there is a safeguard being provided in that if any such order is made, it can be annulled by resolution of this House within 28 days after its making.  But am I not correct in thinking that that is simply eye-wash?If the prohibition order is only to be in operation for a month, the month would certainly be well up before a resolution annulling the order would be discussed in this House.  Consequently, I do not see any value at all, as far as a safeguard is concerned, in even having the power to annul vested in the House&mdash;although I would strongly object if that power were to be taken away.</P>
    <P>What I intend suggesting to the Minister is that something in the nature of a notice should be given before the order is made, and that would give any bodies who might be interested in the proposal an opportunity to consider it, to get in touch with representatives in the House if they feel the order should be annulled, so that there could be reasonable discussion in the House in time to cancel out the Minister's order, if it were thought desirable to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a small point in that connection the Minister may have considered, and I should like to know the answer.  The present position is that if there is a close season in respect of particular game, a person is not entitled to take or shoot the particular game affected by the close season order, but a person in entitled to go out with a shotgun and search for other types of game.  Under this Act, the Minister envisages a complete prohibition, so that a person will not be entitled to carry firearms, including a shotgun, in a public place while that prohibition is in force.  It seems to me that is principally <Col N="992" /> to get over a difficulty with regard to evidence.</P>
    <P>I know the desire is for game protection.  I see a danger which certainly the Minister for Lands would appreciate, but perhaps not the Minister for Justice, that is, the fact that very often it is necessary to take measures to protect game by means of the close season order or something like that when the game is very young. It is often equally important at the same time to protect game by destruction of vermin and that is most effectively done&mdash;I think most people will agree&mdash;by gun clubs or other syndicates of that sort getting together and organising vermin shoots.  It seems it might take away from the object it is intended to achieve if, in a given area for a given period, the possibility of destroying vermin by shooting is to be ruled out.</P>
    <P>The last thing to which I shall refer, and I know I shall get little sympathy from the Minister on this, is to a protest I have made on several of these Bills containing a provision similar to this provision in section 24 of the Bill. This is just a provision introduced into the legislation to relieve the authorities of the obligation to prove their case in prosecutions they bring.  In section 24, it is provided that where in a prosecution for an offence under the principal Act, that is, the 1925 Act, the existence or non-existence of a firearms certificate or licence under section 17 of the principal Act or authorisation under section 2 of the principal Act, is material, where any of those things is material, it shall not be necessary to prove that the certificate, authorisation or permit does not exist.</P>
    <P>In his explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill, the Minister says the reason for that section is that it would cost the Garda authorities a certain amount of time and trouble to check the records if they were required to give formal proof.  My point of view &mdash;and I have urged this more than once in the House and from both sides of it&mdash;is that it should not be any part of the work of this House to set up a position where a person is regarded as being guilty until he proves his own <Col N="993" /> innocence.  The ordinary code we have been operating throughout the years has been that a person is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty but in Act after Act going through this House in the past decade or so, the kind of provision contained in section 24 of this Bill is creeping in and particularly so in some of the present legislation dealing with road traffic offences.  It occurs in other legislation also.  I regard it as objectionable and the sooner some Minister, whether the Minister for Justice or another, sets his face against allowing that kind of provision to be included in his Bills, the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commend the Minister on introducing this Bill.  It should have been introduced many years ago.  For quite a while, there has been public outcry about gun accidents, particularly those caused by the use of various types of weapons by children. Perhaps some of them were of a very tender age but in their hands a gun of any kind is extremely dangerous.  Not only have accidents occurred which have caused injury to eyes and so on but regrettable deaths have happened as a result of the use of these weapons. The Minister is to be complimented on introducing this measure.</P>
      <P>Apart from the injury to the person which has occurred, we are all aware of the destruction caused to public property.  In portion of this city at present, there seems to be a certain group of people&mdash;I do not know whether they regard themselves as a club or not&mdash;who delight in firing through plateglass windows and in parts of the city, we can see public property seriously damaged.  Not only is property involved but I know of one case recently when a very serious accident to a person nearly resulted. The fact that it is public property that is involved does not lessen the offence; private property has also been affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a very good step forward to ensure that in future not only will various types of guns be prohibited to children under 15 years but to children under 16 years.  I am rather sorry the Minister did not make it 17 years.  I do not agree with Deputy <Col N="994" /> O'Higgins that training in the use of guns is beneficial.  In one part of the Minister's statement, he said that training in the proper use of airguns is beneficial.  I do not think it is beneficial for children, no matter how you look at it.  Up to now they have been allowed indiscriminate use of them and I do not think that if they were taught to aim better and go nearer the eye or the bulbs of lamps in public lighting or anything else it would be beneficial to themselves or anybody else.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken the right attitude by raising the age and in prohibiting entirely the use of those guns.  There is the question of what is going to happen when the Bill becomes law.  We know there are a great number of these types of guns in the country at present and that just now in preparation for the Christmas trade, there are a vast number of them in the shops.  I hope this measure will be passed before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>I should like it, if the Minister can have it passed to-day. Otherwise, the tremendous slaughter of small animals and birds which usually takes place during the winter will not be prevented because I am afraid the prohibition of the Minister for Lands on the killing of birds and game in hard weather would not apply to the vandals using airguns against helpless creatures.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated in his opening speech that he would expect that under the proposals in the Bill the great majority of airguns at present in the hands of children would be destroyed and that only a small fraction would be retained.  The Minister is being naïve.  I think he knows as well as I do that will not happen and very serious steps will be necessary to ensure that these guns do not remain in the hands of children.  We all know of doting parents who will not let the little dears be deprived of the guns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister must be very strict to ensure that when a law is passed, it is, in fact, obeyed.  Otherwise, it will only be a matter of time until people will come back again with their guns and other methods of destruction.  Therefore, when the Bill becomes law, I hope the Minister will clamp down generally and insist that the law applies to everybody.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister made the point that he could not differentiate between those who would say they would like the children to have these weapons and would see they would not do any harm and others.  In other words, the Minister cannot differentiate between the very rich, who would be the last to agree unfortunately to having the guns taken away from their children, and those who would prefer their children not to have these weapons at all.  We will, of course, have to ensure that the law will be obeyed and that penalties are imposed, if necessary, to compel obedience to it so that there will be no reversion to the existing position in which you meet tiny tots going around with these destructive weapons.</P>
      <P>There is reference to rifle clubs and gun clubs.  Possibly Deputy O'Higgins did not appreciate the point that there are areas in which there are no gun clubs or rifle clubs and it would be unfair to someone living in these areas to compel him to go some place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think any parents, whether rich or less than rich, will worry about this.  They all welcome the Bill.  The parents of children who have these weapons are generally bullied by the children into buying them.  They live in fear ever afterwards of some injury being done.  If there are £25,000 to £40,000 worth of these things in the country, I wonder should we just destroy them?  Perhaps those who distribute them would buy them back again and export them.  They are property.  They are valuable.  They could be utilised in fairgrounds and shooting galleries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which it has accepted this small but, I think, reasonably useful measure.  I agree with Deputy Tully that we should ensure the law is enforced when it is passed.  That is desirable in regard to any law.  It is the least we can do when we go to so much trouble making the law.  In this instance it is particularly desirable that we should ensure something is done about the existing stock of weapons.  Now I announced this proposal a long time ago, much earlier than one would normally do it, specifically in order to put all concerned on their guard and thereby ensure that traders and others would not be at any great loss.  I will discuss with the Garda authorities the question of ensuring that the law is made strictly applicable in regard to airguns in the hands of children at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will also see if there is anything we can arrange on the lines suggested by Deputy Barry.  Offhand, I do not think there is any obstacle to his proposal. The Bill exempts firearms dealers, and so on, from the provisions with regard to licences and my immediate reaction is that there is nothing to prevent what Deputy Barry suggests taking place.  It would not be an undesirable development, but I am not sure that we should as good international citizens unload our arms on some other country.  Presumably some of these weapons could <Col N="997" /> be used in shooting galleries, rifle ranges and so on.  I am sure that that will be done to some extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins is, as he said himself, fighting his usual battle on behalf of the accused against the State.  On this particular occasion, I do not think his fear is really warranted.</P>

      <P>Yes, in his dealings with the State.  The difficulty we have to deal with may be seen from the fact that we have had on occasion to send an officer of my Department distances of up to 100 miles to prove that members of illegal organisations had not got firearm certificates for Thompson machine guns.  That is, I think, bringing the thing too far.  We propose here that it will not be necessary for us to prove a person had not got a certificate when he himself does not even claim that he had one.</P>

He will not be convicted merely because he cannot find the certificate.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This comparatively short Bill proposes to abolish the death penalty, <Col N="998" /> except for treason, for certain offences of a military character and for offences which, in the Bill, are called capital murders.  Penal servitude for life is being substituted for the death penalty in ordinary murder cases.  In addition the Bill provides for the abolition of the doctrine of constructive malice and for some consequential amendments arising out of the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
    <P>The text of the Bill has been available since before the summer recess. When published it had what one might call a quiet reception.  I think it is reasonable to say that this indicates that the Bill is generally in accord with public feeling, and that its provisions can be considered in an atmosphere free from the emotional tension that the issue of capital punishment has often evoked in other countries.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the provisions of the Bill I think it is desirable to refer to the background of the problem and to indicate briefly what the position is in other European countries.</P>
    <P>From ancient times the punishment prescribed by law on conviction for murder has been death.  If the jury convict an accused person of murder, the judge must, except where the accused is under 17 years of age, pronounce the sentence of death.  He has no discretion to impose any other sentence.  The jury may return a verdict of &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; where the accused person establishes to their satisfaction that he was insane, within the meaning of the rules governing insanity as a defence in criminal cases, at the time he committed the crime. In certain cases of serious provocation, the jury may return a verdict of manslaughter instead of murder.  In infanticide cases, the District Court may alter the charge of murder to one of infanticide when returning the accused for trial; where the District Court does not do so, the jury may return a verdict of infanticide or concealment of birth.</P>
    <P>The death penalty is prescribed for the following crimes as well as for murder: treason, certain military offences under the Defence Act, 1954, piracy with violence and the wilful <Col N="999" /> killing of a person protected by the four Geneva Conventions of 1949; in the latter case, there is provision for the alternative sentence of penal servitude for life.  No one has ever been charged with any of these offences since the inception of the State.</P>
    <P>During the period 1946 to 1962 inclusive, 82 murders were committed. Of the 73 persons arrested, 34 were found insane and unfit to plead; seven were found guilty but insane.  Sentences of death were passed on 18 persons, including three women.  Three of the men were executed&mdash;one in 1947, one in 1948, and the third in 1954.  The remaining 15 persons had their sentences commuted to penal servitude for life.  The longest term of penal servitude served by any of these 15 persons was 11½ years, the shortest three years.  The average term was six years.</P>
    <P>Up to the 18th century, capital punishment was carried out all over the world for a wide variety of crimes. Some of the capital offences would nowadays be regarded as comparatively minor.  The executions were often accompanied by torture.  The movement towards the amelioration of punishments and the ultimate abolition of the death penalty commenced about the beginning of the 18th century.  During that century, the number of crimes which attracted the death penalty was considerably reduced.For example, the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which applied to this country, reduced the number of capital crimes from over two hundred to murder, treason and piracy with violence.  In other countries the death penalty was abolished completely, usually after a period in which sentences were not carried out or in which the law allowed imprisonment as an alternative.</P>
    <P>The death penalty has been abolished in Austria, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal.  San Marino, Sweden and Switzerland.  In Belgium and Luxembourg, the law still provides for capital punishment <Col N="1000" /> but it is not implemented.  Apart from one exceptional case in each of these two countries there has been no execution since 1863 (Belgium) and 1879 (Luxembourg).</P>
    <P>There are five member countries of the Council of Europe, apart from Ireland, which retain capital punishment: France, Greece, Spain, Turkey and Britain.  In Spain, and in Greece, except in the case of a crime against the integrity of the national territory, the law provides for an alternative penalty of death or imprisonment.  In France and Turkey, though death is the only penalty prescribed, the judge can always, indirectly, by invoking extenuating circumstances, have recourse to imprisonment instead.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland law is the same as here; in Scotland also the death penalty is retained.  In England and Wales, the law was amended in 1957 to abolish the death penalty for all murders except five cases of &ldquo;capital&rdquo; murders, namely, murder in furtherance of theft, murder by shooting or explosion, murder to evade arrest or to escape from legal custody and murders of police and prison officers.  The 1957 Act also provided that a person convicted of non-capital murder should remain liable to the death penalty if he had been previously convicted of murder.</P>
    <P>These categories of capital murder were obviously selected from the point of view of protecting society against professional criminals, especially those carrying arms, and were designed to deal with the particular circumstances obtaining in England.  However, the discrimination between capital and non-capital murders has been criticised as being illogical and as enabling some persons convicted of the most brutal murders to escape the death penalty. For example, a petty and unpremeditated theft committed at the scene of a murder can mean the difference between murder and capital murder.  A husband can be hanged for shooting his wife dead in a fit of temper but not if he kills her by poison administered over a long period.</P>
    <P>That, briefly, is the position about the death penalty in European countries. <Col N="1001" /> We are among the small minority of countries which retain it for murder.</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn to the arguments usually advanced in support of the abolition of capital punishment. It is said that capital punishment tends to degrade society by undermining the value of human life; that it is not a peculiarly efficient or a unique deterrent to murder; that, with its marked emphasis on the retribution element in penal philosophy, it distorts the proper aims of punishment; that it destroys the possibility of reforming the offender; and that it destroys the possibility of rectifying error; innocent men have been hanged.</P>
    <P>The case against abolition consists mainly in a rebuttal of these arguments.The question as to whether and to what extent capital punishment is a deterrent to murder is of particular importance and it might be thought to admit of a clear answer having regard to the research which has taken place on this subject on a world-wide basis over a long period.  This is not so.  Statistics produced of the effect on homicide rates in the various countries of the abolition of capital punishment are apt to be misleading, mainly because it is almost impossible to draw valid comparisons between different countries owing to differences in the legal definitions of crime, the practice of the prosecuting authorities and the courts, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>The matter is further complicated by the fact that in most countries where capital punishment has been abolished, statutory abolition has come after a period when the death penalty was in abeyance, and this creates the problem of what date should be taken as the dividing line. A British Commission on capital punishment reached the general conclusion that there was no clear evidence, in any of the figures they had examined, that the abolition of capital punishment had led to an increase in the homicide rate, or that its reintroduction had led to a fall.</P>
    <P>After a careful review of all the evidence they had been able to obtain as to the deterrent effect of capital punishment, they considered that <i>prima facie</i> the penalty of death was <Col N="1002" /> likely to have a stronger effect as a deterrent on normal human beings than any other form of punishment and there was some evidence&mdash;though no convincing statistical evidence&mdash; that that was in fact so.  But this effect, they said, did not operate universally or uniformly, and there were many offenders on whom it was limited and might often be negligible.</P>
    <P>They stressed that it was important to view this question in a just perspective and not to base a penal policy in relation to murder on exaggerated estimates of the uniquely deterrent force of the death penalty.  A recent Council of Europe survey, referring to a comparison made of crime figures before and after abolition, said that the abolition of capital punishment had not been reflected in any European country by an increase in the number of crimes formerly punishable by death.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the view has been expressed that it would be reasonable to suppose that the deterrent force of capital punishment operated not only by affecting the conscious thoughts of individuals tempted to commit murder, but also by building up in the community a deep feeling of peculiar abhorrence for the crime of murder.  However, from the practical point of view the value of capital punishment as a deterrent to potential murderers must be relatively slight so far as this country is concerned in view of the fact that since the end of the war only one in twenty-four of those charged with murder, and only one in six of those sentenced to death for murder, were in fact executed, and that there has been no execution for nine years.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these considerations, the Government came to the conclusion that in normal conditions there is no case for retaining capital punishment except as a deterrent, and that there is no reason to suppose that an increase in murder cases in this country would follow abolition, contrary to the experience of other countries which have abolished it.  As I have mentioned, most other European countries have abolished or virtually abolished the death penalty. <Col N="1003" /> The Government considered, too, that it was undesirable that the solemn formula of the death sentence should continue to be pronounced, when it was followed so frequently by commutation of the sentence.  Moreover, the present is an appropriate time to abolish capital punishment inasmuch as no execution has taken place here for over nine years and the matter has not been the subject of public controversy.  However, the Government are of opinion that these considerations are not fully valid in regard to certain offences and that in these particular cases the public interest requires that the death penalty be retained.  It will be accepted, I think, that persons who murder from political motives will not be deterred by the prospect of imprisonment.  Accordingly, the Government decided that treason and any form of &ldquo;political&rdquo; murder must continue to be punishable by death.  Certain capital war-time offences already provided for in permanent Defence Forces legislation are also being excepted from the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
    <P>One of these capital offences&mdash; mutiny with violence&mdash;could also occur in peace-time but here again imprisonment would offer no deterrent to potential mutineers.  As regards murders of members of the Garda, it must be borne in mind that in this country the police are unarmed and have a special claim to whatever additional protection the law can give them by providing the deterrent of the death penalty against the violent criminals they have often to contend with.  As regards the murder of prison officers in the course of their duty, the type of criminal likely to be involved would not be deterred by the threat of a prison sentence.</P>
    <P>In general, it seems to me that three courses of action were open to the Government when considering this issue.  As so often happens, each of the possible solutions was not entirely free from disadvantage.  The Government could have decided to take no action but to let the death penalty fall into disuse in much the same way as Belgium and Luxembourg did.  Such a <Col N="1004" /> decision would have involved trial judges in continuing to pronounce an empty formula when passing sentence in murder cases.  Moreover, I think it is important that the Oireachtas should lay down clearly in what circumstances, if any, the death penalty is liable to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Government could have abolished the death penalty for all crimes, whether military or political or otherwise.  For reasons I have mentioned, the Government are not prepared to go this far at present.</P>
    <P>The third course of action open to the Government, and the one decided upon, is based on their view of what is requisite for the maintenance of public order and the security of the State, and I hope it will be acceptable to the general body of public opinion. I know that some people will urge sincerely that the death penalty should be kept for particularly heinous murders such as murders by poison, sexual murders, murders of children and so on.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that there is such a great variety of circumstances in which murders may be committed, ranging from the most blameworthy to those having some extenuating or mitigating aspects, that it is impossible to list satisfactorily in a statute those murders which are so heinous as to merit the death penalty.  Many countries have attempted to list these circumstances by law so as to establish precisely what constitutes the kind of killing which should be punished by death.  I think it is true to say that in every case all these provisions have given rise to serious anomalies in operation. There is also the aspect that in many cases where the public have been initially shocked by the circumstances of particular murders the mental condition of the perpetrators has been such that they have been found not to be criminally responsible.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill represent the Government's opinion of what is necessary at present to maintain law and order and the security of the State. It may be that a situation will develop in the future&mdash;and I hope it will&mdash; which will enable the Government to reduce the categories for which the <Col N="1005" /> death penalty is being retained without any risk to the national interest, or it may be&mdash;thought I consider it unlikely in peace-time&mdash;that it may be necessary to reintroduce the death penalty for certain offences.  It is on this practical basis that the Government presents its proposals for the consideration of the House.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the abolition of what is known as the doctrine of constructive malice.  The doctrine means that in the case of an accidental killing which takes place in the course of committing a felony&mdash;at any rate a felony involving violence&mdash; or other offences, such as escaping from lawful custody, the fact that there is no malice aforethought is not sufficient to keep the crime outside the definition of murder.  This was, at any rate, what the doctrine of constructive malice was taken to mean originally. The scope of the doctrine has been narrowed by judicial decisions over the last hundred years and there is a certain amount of disagreement as to what the precise extent of its present application is.  The doctrine was abolished in England and Wales under the Homicide Act, 1957.  It never applied in Scottish law.  The Government have come to the conclusion that there is no case for retaining it any longer.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may be wondering why the Bill does not touch on another related subject to that of capital punishment which has been somewhat in the news in recent years, that is, the question of insanity as a defence in murder cases.  We are not dealing with that problem in the Bill because it is a question affecting criminal proceedings in a wider sense&mdash;not merely in murder cases.  The question of amending the present rules&mdash;which are known as the M'Naghten Rules&mdash;in the light of modern medical and legal thought on the question of insanity, and the question of making legal provision for the doctrine of diminished responsibility as was done in England and Wales under the 1957 Act, are at present under examination, together with a number of other aspects of the law relating to mentally-ill prisoners.  Any changes in the present law in this <Col N="1006" /> regard which may be found to be necessary will be incorporated in a separate Criminal Justice Bill in due course.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and request that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it clear at the outset that the arguments which I propose to make in connection with this Bill are personal ones.  We in the Fine Gael Party have considered this Bill carefully and have come to the conclusion&mdash;I think rightly &mdash;that a Bill of this nature is one on which individual Deputies must be guided entirely by their own convictions and their own conscience.  Certainly so far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, we are leaving this Bill, if it should be voted on, to a free vote of the Deputies of our Party, all of whom are entitled to express their own personal views and personal convictions in regard to it.</P>
      <P>I believe this is one of those subjects about which many people feel most strongly and, as in the case of many subjects on which people do feel strongly, often they are not entirely prepared to see the other person's point of view.  This Bill is one which we must consider in the context of the society in which we live.  In Ireland, we have a nearly entirely Christian country and a very largely Catholic country and it seems to me that, having regard to that fact, it is true to say that people living in this country recognise the value and sanctity of human life probably more than any other communities which are not as Christian or as Catholic as we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told the House what the proposals in this Bill are.  It abolishes the death penalty except in the case of, first, treason; secondly, capital murder, which is then subdivided into three different categories; and thirdly, offences for which the death penalty is already provided in the Defence Forces Act of 1954.  Capital murder, as defined in this Bill, falls into three different categories: first, the murder of a Garda or prison officer acting in the course of his duty; <Col N="1007" /> secondly, murder in the course of furtherance of offences under particular sections of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939; and thirdly, political murder which is the murder of a visiting head of State or representative of a foreign Government.  These are the various categories in respect of which it is proposed to retain the death penalty and, as the Minister has already mentioned, one of the sections in this Bill proposes to abolish the doctrine of constructive malice.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given in some detail and very accurately an idea of the pros and cons with regard to capital punishment.  It is a question which has been argued out in a number of countries over the years.  In this country also, it is a question which has from time to time been debated by different sections, different societies and different interests.  Conflicting views have been expressed and&mdash;I think the Minister indicated this also when he was speaking &mdash; they have been expressed with equal sincerity and equal force, both by the exponents and the opponents of the idea of capital punishment.</P>
    <P>A number of people will feel that the more or less accidental compromise which we have reached in this country, whereby capital punishment is retained but very seldom used, is in some ways an ideal arrangement to have come to.  There is a lot to be said for that point of view but it seems to me that once a Bill which proposes to abolish capital punishment, even in a limited way such as this Bill does, comes before us, then it is not sufficient to say that we should hold on to what I have described as the accidental compromise at which we have arrived. It is necessary for Deputies on all sides of the House to make up their minds in regard to the merits of this Bill and in regard to the question of keeping or abolishing capital punishment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, as I say, gone through the arguments advanced down through the years on both sides and it is no harm to mention them again as I see them.  Other Deputies will have their own points of view and some of the arguments mentioned on one side <Col N="1008" /> or the other may weigh more fully with individual Deputies.  Those who are in favour of the abolition of capital punishment have argued down through the years that it is not a necessary or an effective deterrent.  They point to the fact that murders are committed in countries which have capital punishment and they argue from that that the mere fact that murders do take place shows that capital punishment has not succeeded in acting as a deterrent.It is often argued that for many people life imprisonment would be a far more effective deterrent than capital punishment.  It is argued that where murder is committed impulsively or committed by an unbalanced person who might not, under the M'Naughten Rules to which the Minister referred, be found to be isane, it is unlikely that the question of the punishment, whether it is capital or otherwise, would be taken into consideration by the murderer and that consequently in those cases the value of capital punishment as a deterrent is at a minimum.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, a long list of countries can be quoted where capital punishment has either been entirely abolished by statutory enactment or has fallen into disuse.  As against that, those who favour the retention of capital punishment rely to my mind principally on its deterrent value and they claim that even though it may not be an absolute deterrent, at least it is a more effective deterrent than any other form of punishment.  It is true to say that the British Royal Commission which inquired into capital punishment some years ago&mdash;I think it was in the late 1940s or the early 1950s&mdash;did hold that capital punishment was likely to be a stronger deterrent than any other punishment for normal persons.  It is quite clear, and even those who wish to retain capital punishment for murder do concede, that in the cases of what I have described as impulsive murder or murder by unbalanced persons who might not be classed as insane, the deterrent value of capital punishment is reduced to the minimum.</P>
    <P>Those who favour the abolition of capital punishment frequently advance the argument that one of the duties of <Col N="1009" /> the State is to uphold the value of human life and that the operation of capital punishment tends to lower the value in which human life is held by the people in the State when it is put into operation.  There are of course arguments against that made by those who wish to maintain capital punishment.They point out that while it is true that the State must recognise the sanctity of human life, it is equally true in so far as the individuals in the State are concerned and that the person who has committed deliberate murder has straightaway failed to recognise the sanctity of human life and has offended in that respect.</P>
    <P>Another argument&mdash;and this is certainly the argument which weights most heavily with me&mdash;put forward by those who wish to see the end of capital punishment is that capital punishment is an irrevocable penalty, that once a man has been executed for a crime, if it subsequently is shown he was innocent, no redress can be made. It is an irrevocable penalty and a penalty which is irrevocable such as capital punishment should be imposed only by a tribunal which is in itself infallible and no matter what care might be taken in our courts to secure that there will be no miscarriage of justice, none of us, not excluding the judges on the bench nor the men sitting in the jury, is infallible.  That is a very strong argument and a very sound argument in favour of the abolition of capital punishment.  It is one that has always weighed with me, which more than any other has made up my mind for me in connection with this Bill and which makes me say to the Minister that as far as I am concerned I support the idea of the abolition of capital punishment contained in this Bill and that I would go a lot further than the Minister.</P>
    <P>Once the Minister has set his feet on this path, he should walk the whole way.  He should not do as he has indicated the Government intend doing, considering the matter further with a view to abolishing capital punishment in the categories for which it is retained at the moment.  My inclination, if I were in the Minister's shoes, would be to go the whole hog <Col N="1010" /> now, but to do that in the knowledge that if circumstances in our society were so to alter as to make it desirable that capital punishment should be reintroduced, that could be done by an Act of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already and the Minister also mentioned that capital punishment is being retained in this Bill for certain classes of murder.  I think that in addition to coming to a decision on the general question as to whether they favour capital punishment or its abolition, in relation to this Bill, Deputies are faced with two further questions.  The first is: is it justifiable to retain the death penalty in the various cases in which it is being retained; and secondly, is the Minister right in following the British practice in regard to the murder of a member of the police force or a prison officer, without taking any account of the question of motive?</P>
    <P>The cases for which the death penalty is being retained are treason, capital murder, political murder and certain offences against the Defence Forces Act, 1954.  I can see that in cases of treason, political murder or those coming within the Defence Forces Act there is a case and I think it is the case which the Minister relied on for placing them in a different category from what might be described as the individual murder.  A case can be made, and I think it is right to make it, that the safety and security of the State is involved in these murders which relate to treason, political murders, and so on.  I think that that is a fair argument and it does place such murders in a different and distinct category from the case of individual murder.  It is fair to say that once that distinction has been made here, that you can logically, and with reason, place such murders in a category separate from individual murders, it is not unreasonable to say that there should be a different approach to the punishment called for.  But, I think, at that stage, all the logic in this Bill seems to break down.</P>
    <P>The Minister or the Government seem to be accepting in principle in the Bill&mdash;and it seems to be running through it&mdash;that the retention of capital <Col N="1011" /> punishment is not an effective deterrent in cases of murder.  Once the right of the State to take human life by imposing capital punishment is accepted, and once the heinousness of deliberate murder is accepted, there is a logical reason for holding that the State should use its authority to impose for murder the punishment which is likely to prove most effective as a deterrent.  I think we then reach a stage where the question I have posed in relation to the Bill and to the retention of capital punishment for specific types of murder amounts to whether or not capital punishment is an effective deterrent.  It seems to me that what the Minister has done in introducing this Bill is to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that question.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to me to be saying that capital punishment is an effective deterrent for capital murder and political murder but that it is not an effective deterrent for non-capital murder.  I do not see the logic behind that and that is one of the reasons why I stated my own view.  My own personal inclination would be to go the whole hog and abolish capital punishment completely.</P>
    <P>The other question I asked was whether we were wise in following the British precedent so far as the question of murder of a member of the Garda or a prison officer is concerned, that is, murder of a Garda or prison officer in the course of his duty.  The Bill simply provides for the retention of capital murder in the case of a Garda or prison officer acting in the course of his duty.  The motive of the killer is not to be taken into account at all as a distinguishing factor between the murder of a policeman or anyone else. The only distinguishing factor, according to this Bill, will be the occupation of the murdered man.  It seems to me that is bound to give rise to all sorts of anomalies.</P>
    <P>One of the daily newspapers, the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, July 30th, 1963, in a leading article on the subject put the point that I have in mind extremely well when it asked why it should be more heinous for a burglar to cosh a policeman who surprises him, rather than a nightwatchman. <Col N="1012" /> That is exactly the type of anomaly which will be created under the Bill as it stands at the moment.  It seems to me that the Minister would do better if he were to go the whole way in the Bill at this time and abolish capital punishment completely. However, as far as the Bill goes, I support it and if the Minister were to bring in a more extensive measure, I would support it also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to make it clear, as the previous speaker did, that the views I put to the Minister are personal views because my Party have not had an opportunity of discussing the Bill.  We will do so to-night and then I assume the viewpoints they will put will possibly be the same as Deputy O'Higgins put or they may, as they have traditionally been opposed to capital punishment, decide to take the line which I intend to take here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I oppose completely any idea that capital punishment under any circumstances is right.  I think it is entirely wrong for this State under any guise, or for any excuse, because I believe there is no reason for it, to take away life.  I think it has been proved fairly effectively that it is not a deterrent. The man or woman who is going to commit a murder seldom, I suppose, worries about what is going to happen afterwards if he or she is caught.  For that reason I think it is not a reasonable thing at all to suggest that the question of what is going to happen them should be considered a deterrent. I know that many people in this country are prepared to say that it is right to hang people for various things.  I heard someone suggest the other day that people should be hanged over the turnover tax.  I would not agree to hang somebody even for that.  Let us pause for a minute to consider what actually happens when somebody is condemned to death.  He is kept in prison for a period and then executed.  It is on record that even at some of the more recent executions which took place in this country the unfortunate wretch was dragged screaming, praying or cursing to the scaffold.  While the Minister for Justice, who then was not Minister, or the judge who condemned <Col N="1013" /> the accused person, or the whole community or everybody who is responsible for the law in this country may have slept and eaten well on that particular day and night, I think, if they stopped to think what they were actually responsible for, they might not have slept or eaten so well.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe it is a debasing thing that the State should take unto itself the right to take away a life which it cannot give.  When you consider that other countries, which have not the reputation for being so Christian as we are, have already abolished capital punishment, I think that we have got to consider very deeply its complete abolition here. The Minister, in reply to a Parliamentary Question a few days ago, gave the number of people who were charged with and tried for murder, the number of people convicted and the number of executions carried out.  To all intents and purposes, with one exception in 1954, nobody has been executed here since 1948.  It would appear then that there is no capital punishment carried out, despite the fact that about eight people had been convicted of murder.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, following a general increase in wages, a proportionate increase (apart from Budget increases) should be granted immediately to all those in receipt of social welfare benefits, because a general increase in wages is usually followed by a general increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>I suppose that at any time the motion which has been tabled by Deputy Sherwin would be a motion of some significance and I have no doubt that Deputy Sherwin tabled his motion well aware of the problem which he felt to exist and much concerned for its solution.  However significant Deputy Sherwin's motion may <Col N="1014" /> have been when it was tabled, its significance has been enhanced enormously since the turnover tax went into operation last Friday.  It is true to say that the effect of this tax on living costs is now beyond the stage of argument and has become a matter of fact.</P>
      <P>In relation to this motion, Deputy Sherwin, I am sure, is now concerned at the effect on the living costs of the poor people, the sick, the unemployed, the aged, who are recipients of social welfare benefits.  In common with the better off sections of our community, they have since 1st November to pay a tax on every article of food they buy, on every article of clothing or footwear that they may feel they have to get and on the fuel that they have to provide for themselves in these autumn and winter months.</P>
      <P>Naturally, this motion, if passed by the House, with Deputy Sherwin leading, will be concerned to deal with the problem posed by the effect of the turnover tax and other costs on social welfare recipients.  Indeed, the effect of this tax has, as I have said, gone beyond the limits of argument and has now so clearly become a fact that last night we had evidence of panicky measures being taken by the Government to deal with a situation which they themselves created by having this tax passed by this House.  They have now to search around and find scapegoats in an effort to blame somebody else for the sharp spiral in the cost of living caused by the impact of this tax.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, as Deputy Sherwin on record appears to be concerned, with the position of social welfare recipients.  Deputy Sherwin is notable for his speeches in this House.  He always expresses clearly what he himself desires.  I suppose everyone is human.  On 1st May of this year, I think before he put down this motion, Deputy Sherwin prophesied with regard to the effect of the turnover tax on the living costs of the poor.  On 1st May, 1963&mdash;volume 202, column 817 &mdash;Deputy Sherwin, speaking on the Budget, said:</P>

    <P>In regard to the Budget proposals themselves I am satisfied this turnover tax is asking for money only <Col N="1015" /> from those who can afford it.  It does not create any burden for those who cannot afford it, workers with families.  If you analyse it carefully, it means that it is only the single worker or the worker with no family who will be asked to pay 2/-, 3/-, or 4/- a week.  The worker with children will have to pay little or nothing.  The people on social benefits are not only getting sufficient to cover this tax but they are, in addition, getting as much again.</P>
    <P>That was Deputy Sherwin's view on 1st May of this year.  He felt and I am sure, as a conscientious Deputy, sincerely felt, that the social welfare increases reposed in the Financial Statement of this year would mean that social welfare recipients not only would not be asked to pay any tax but, in fact, would be getting more than they had been getting.  So, Deputy Sherwin found himself constrained to support the Government and support the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it was subsequent to those important words that Deputy Sherwin tabled this motion but it is perhaps opportune that now after the turnover tax has gone into operation, after Deputy Sherwin's motion is debated by this Parliament, Deputy Sherwin, on 6th November, 1963, can have an opportunity in closing the debate of stating whether he still regards the position to be that social welfare recipients have made money out of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Sherwin is now as convinced as any Deputy can be that the views he expressed on 1st May of this year were views that in the event have turned out to be inaccurate and that, in this city and in Deputy Sherwin's constituency, old age pensioners who went out last Friday or last Saturday or Monday or Tuesday of this week to spend the pension money found that for everything they had to buy they, in common with everyone else, paid two and a half per cent on their purchases.</P>
    <P>It may have been the desire of Deputy Sherwin last May to achieve a situation whereby as a result of the <Col N="1016" /> turnover tax a benefit would have been conferred on those in receipt of social welfare payments.  The events have established that that hope has not been achieved and so we discuss this motion of Deputy Sherwin in different circumstances but in circumstances in which every Deputy in this House can vote now in full possession of the facts, vote, as I suggest, supporting Deputy Sherwin, vote in a sense that this Dáil should at last achieve a situation whereby there will be and should be a planned and definite approach towards social welfare payments and those in receipt of them.</P>
    <P>I know that many of us who come into this Dáil meet disappointment of one kind or another.  Ministers are no different in that regard from humble Deputies.  Deputy Sherwin may be disappointed that the prophecy he made on 1st May this year does not appear to have been borne out but I know that, earlier, Deputy Sherwin had some other words to say with regard to the cost of living.  I have here a speech which he made on 21st February, 1963, reported in volume 200, column 305, in which he states his position and, indeed, his future in relation to the cost of living.  I know he was baring his soul in the remarks he made regarding the impact of living costs on the poor and those who have limited means.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin was speaking on a motion dealing with the Government's White Paper on Incomes and Output and he said this:</P>
    <P>Let me say at once that I do not accept that this action of the Government stops the trade unions from demanding any increase they feel is necessary but I would ask the Government to try to ensure that there is no increase in prices while they are trying to prevent any further increase in wages.  I expected an increase in prices after the eighth round and I would expect an increase after the ninth, tenth or any future rounds.  That is to be expected, but we already have had the effects of the eighth round increase. All I am asking is that the Taoiseach should do something to ensure there are no further increases in prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> We can only assume that Deputy Sherwin must have been concerned and, perhaps, tantalised over the spring, summer and early autumn months but all his doubt and uncertainly must have disappeared last Friday when the turnover tax went into operation.  We know now that there is an increase in prices.  We know that the first step has been taken to start a new spiral in living costs in this country.  That was not done accidentally, fortuitously or because the cost of imported articles has risen.  It was done because of deliberate Government policy.  So Deputy Sherwin's appeal to the Taoiseach has fallen on deaf ears and the motion now proposed by him is one that I have endeavoured to describe as being of particular significance in that the turnover tax is now in operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin is probably doing a service to the Dáil by enabling a decision to be taken on this matter.  I listened with interest to what was said on behalf of the Government.  The Minister, in reply to Deputy Sherwin, said that his proposal created administrative problems and that it would be impracticable for a variety of reasons to carry it out.  Eventually the Minister declared that this motion would not be accepted by the Government.  I do not know what the Minister meant by that. Apparently, in his view, it is proper and right that social welfare recipients should depend on the political fortunes of a Government at each Budget time. He has said that once a year is sufficient.  Once a year may be sufficient but I do know that because of the political exigencies present at Budget time, the purse strings are loose or tight, depending on the way the political wind may be blowing.</P>
    <P>If a Government, particularly a Fianna Fáil Government, found themselves in a strong position in this House and in the country, then the social welfare recipients could soldier on for another year but the nearer an election comes, the more attuned will the ear of the Minister for Finance be to the possible injustices being suffered by social welfare recipients.  So far as Deputy Sherwin is concerned, he will have none of that.  He wants this Dáil to lay down a definite and planned <Col N="1018" /> approach to social welfare justice for the poor, aged and sick.  More power to Deputy Sherwin.  It is a pity that he was not as vigorous in his approach to this matter when he spoke in February and made his appeal to the Taoiseach, when he spoke in May and declared that the turnover tax would not affect social welfare recipients.  He has been disappointed.  I have no doubt that Deputy Sherwin will not be disappointed a third time and that this time he will make sure that what he states is supported by the vote of this house and not by a back-door agreement with anyone.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Carroll speak on this important matter last night.  Deputy Carroll did not believe with Deputy Sherwin in the month of May that the turnover tax would affect no one except single workers and workers without dependants.Deputy Carroll at that time did not believe, as Deputy Sherwin did, that social welfare recipients would make money on the turnover tax. Deputy Carroll was strongly of the view then that Deputy Sherwin's hopes were not soundly based.  Deputy Carroll not only believed that the turnover tax would inflict hardship on social welfare recipients and the general body of the poor people but he went into the division lobby and did his best as one man to prevent this tax being inflicted on the poor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carroll has always been consistent in this House.  He has left no one in any doubt as to where he stands.  It was a matter of surprise, and I think it was a surprise to Deputy Carroll himself, that he found himself voting in a particular way last Wednesday night.  But he came to his senses apparently when he came into this House last night to have us believe he now realises he made a mistake, as we do, and went on to explain how he made a mistake.  He declared yesterday evening that, so far as the old age pensioners and the social welfare recipients are concerned, what has taken place since last Friday is not an increase of a small percentage, 2½ per cent or anything else, on what they have to buy, but an increase of as much as ten per cent or 20 per cent.  Deputy Carroll <Col N="1019" /> is now, as apparently also are the Government, appalled by what has been done.</P>
    <P>We all have to face this.  The people outside, when they get an opportunity of apportioning responsibility, can be fair to Deputy Sherwin, fair to Deputy Carroll, fair to the Government Party, and fair to all of us.  Equal justice for all is proper and sound.  But in the process an omelette will have been made; and the eggs that will be broken in making this Government omelette unfortunately will be the hearts of so many old age pensioners and social welfare recipients.  Those outside not knowing why and how, not knowing the finesse of the minds of Deputy Sherwin and Deputy Carroll, not knowing how Deputy Sherwin's deep felt wishes have been frustrated, now knowing how Deputy Carroll may make mistakes&mdash;these people are being called on to pay increased prices out of the miserable pittances they have.  They do not know the why or the how, because Government policy is approved apparently accidentally by this House.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Well, is not once a year time enough to review them? Is it not good enough if we do something for them at Budget time?&rdquo; He is not making a commitment that something will be done for them at Budget time. If the Minister for Finance is mellow at the time, if the political fortunes of the Government do not happen to be particularly favourable, then hold up your heads, you poor people and you sick people, you will get something if you live long enough for the next Budget.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sherwin says&mdash;and we in this Party support him in this regard &mdash;that is a wrong approach in 1963.  It is particularly so in view of the precedent established by this Government that the necessaries of life of the poor people, the food, fuel, and clothing they have to buy, are no longer sacrosanct from the grasping hand of the Minister for Finance.  Once that stage has been reached it is time for individual Deputies &mdash; Independent Deputies like Deputy Sherwin and Deputy Carroll&mdash;to build some little bulwark, some little defence, for social <Col N="1020" /> welfare recipients, to provide for them so that, whatever way living costs go, whatever way taxation impacts on the real value of their allowances and payments, they will be at least guaranteed some fair play, some measure of social justice in a planned approach.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason we in the Fine Gael Party gladly and fully support the enterprise of Deputy Sherwin in moving this motion.  It is a pity the motion did not come on earlier.  But at least it has come on now, when every Deputy can vote for or against it and not be swayed by arguments in this house but in the full knowledge of the facts.  It is well that should be so.  I have no doubt but that this motion will be passed by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the spirit of this motion, but I do not think the implication contained in the last part of it is correct&mdash;that a general increase in wages is usually followed by a general increase in the cost of living. If that is true, it is an indictment of the Government.  I hold the Government are responsible for regulating the cost of living.  However, I agree entirely with the motive behind this motion.  I accept it as an effort to try to bring about immediate relief to the helpless people faced with the circumstances caused by the increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>The organised trade union movement can take care of its members by seeking increases in wages, but it is powerless to look after the interests of the unemployed members of the trade union movement.  That is a job for the Government.  It is ironical to find changes being brought about by way of negotiation between employers and organised labour and to see the Government, particularly the Minister for Social Welfare, sitting idly by knowing full well that the increases being brought about will in a great many cases result in an increase in the cost of living.  The people who are helpless because of their lack of representation have to sit back and take it.  These people are members of the working class, and many of them played no small part in building up what we have here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this motion we should not concentrate <Col N="1021" /> on chastising members of the House for the manner in which they voted previously.  In fairness to Deputy Sherwin, it should be noted that this motion has been on the Order Paper for 12 months, and he was not, therefore, aware of the effects of the turnover tax when he tabled it.  Now that he has become aware of them, perhaps it is an act of God that he is being given an opportunity of putting things in order now.  An opportunity is now being afforded to each and every one of us to take our stand and to indicate, clearly and distinctly, what we mean when we say we have an interest in the social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The time has come now to finish with lip service in this matter.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say he agrees with this in principle.  Many people express principles and talk about them, but to give effect to them is another matter.  In this case we want immediate effect because of the happenings of the past few days and the little sop being handed out to the people to give a semblance of consolation.The Minister for Social Welfare should either accept this motion or not.  There is no use in his saying that he agrees with it in principle if he will not give effect to it. If he does not accept this motion, the matter will be left in abeyance and we are only codding the people.  This requires a forthright statement from the Minister.  He should say clearly that he will immediately look after the interests of the social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I had occasion to ask the Minister to do something for these people.  He replied that he had them always in his heart, always in his mind.  What a horrible conscience! I often wonder does the Minister give, or do most Deputies give, any consideration to the problem of trying to exist on the handouts afforded to social welfare recipients.  I should very much like the Minister to produce a budget to show these people how they can live on what is being doled out to them.  They just eke out an existence.  Yet, these are the people who built up this State.  I refer, in particular, to the old age pensioners. We can talk about plans for this and <Col N="1022" /> that but if we forget the people who enabled us to make our plans, we shall never have good plans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carroll speaking last night made an interesting confession and confession is often said to be good for the soul.  I earnestly hope the Deputy will ponder on the confession he made.  I did not agree with him when he set out to join issue with Deputy Sherwin in regard to what he alleged Deputy Sherwin said.  Deputy Sherwin has said that he did not say this, that or the other thing.  I do not want to see this resulting in a question of whether Deputy Carroll and Deputy Sherwin agree with each other as regards what they said in the past but I sincerely hope both Deputies will insist on putting this motion through and will not be satisfied with a bland promise from the Minister that an increase will come.</P>
    <P>We all make promises which we hope to keep, particularly if we are sincere about them, but in my estimation this issue is knit now.  We now have an opportunity of indicating where we stand and I say as clearly as I can that I hope the social welfare recipients will not be made a political yo-yo.  I hope they will command the support of all those who stand for them and who believe they should get what they are entitled to get.  Now that we are in a position to put it up to the Minister for Social Welfare, no time was ever better than now.  Promises will not be sufficient.  I earnestly entreat everybody who is a party to the motion, particularly its mover and its supporters, not to be dissuaded by promises.  There must be something positive and definite in this matter; otherwise, they are codding us and codding social welfare recipients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has been on the agenda for at least 12 months and I did not expect it to come up at this time.  I should much prefer it to have come up at some other time, when the battle of the tax or the battle for power was not still alive.  While it is, there are such considerations as power politics and a motion of this sort will not be treated in the cool, calm manner that it deserves.  It will <Col N="1023" /> naturally be used as a political weapon.  I am satisfied with the lefthanded compliments from those who support the proposal but I am also aware that the motive is another matter.</P>
      <P>I do not doubt that many who have spoken are as interested in the social welfare recipients as I am but I am satisfied that this is a secondary consideration and that the primary consideration in this discussion was the political weapon, a sort of further round of the debate on power politics which we had in the past couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>What I had in mind in putting down the motion is that I wanted the State to commit itself in law by a decision of this House that those people would by right be entitled to an increase on all occasions when the remainder of the community got an increase, that they would not lag behind and that their increase would be in portion to the increase in wages, whether due to the cost of living or a higher standard.That is what I wanted to ensure, that it would not be left to individuals, to various governments or to fortune to decide whether they should get an increase or not.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that Fianna Fáil have granted increases during the past five years.  This is true, but I am not so much concerned about Fianna Fáil Governments; there will be other Governments, and I want to make sure that other Governments also will meet their obligations in this matter.  I want to tie them down to it because I have here the history of the increases paid to old age pensioners and it shows that for 28 years, they never got a shilling extra.  I do not want to see that happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1920, they had 10/- a week; in 1924, Fine Gael&mdash;then Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;did something they probably will never live down.  They reduced that 10/- to 9/-.  The pensioners got back that shilling in 1928. There was no increase until 1949; in other words, not a penny extra from 1920 to 1949.  That is a shame for both Parties.  It can be said that during that period Fianna Fáil did not <Col N="1024" /> give any increase and neither did Fine Gael.  I am not concerned about what Fianna Fáil have done in the past five years but about what Governments should do in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall press the motion, if that is what you want to know.  In 1949, the old age pensioners got 17/6d; in 1951, 20/-; in 1952, 21/6d; in 1955, 24/-; in 1957, 25/-; in 1959, 27/6d.; in 1960, 28/6d.; in 1961, 30/-; in 1962, 32/6d. and this year, 35/-.  For 28 years they got nothing. There were periods in between the years I have mentioned when they got nothing.</P>
      <P>It is possible that they might get in some year a shilling which would not be a proportionate increase in relation to the wage increase.  When I ask for a proportionate increase, I mean an increase in proportion to the increase secured by the wage earners.  I am asking for two things: that they should get an increase every time there is an increase in wages and that what they get should be in proportion to the wage increase.</P>
      <P>There is another class involved, disabled pensioners and those suffering from infirmities.  They come under the Department of Health.  They should not.  They ought to be under the Department of Social Welfare and I think the Minister for Health expressed the opinion last year that that should be the position.  I hope to see these disabled people coming under Social Welfare.  It was because they were not under that Department that they were absolutely forgotten in budgetary increases.  First of all, in 1954, they received £1.  Then they got nothing until 1961.  In that year they got an increase, again in 1962 and in this year, 1963, they get three halfcrowns. For six years they got nothing.  I do not want that to happen again.  I want them to be included under Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> I have another motion on the agenda, a specific motion in relation to which there can be no argument about drafting.It is quite clear.  I want those in receipt of disablement allowances to receive the same amount as the non-contributory classes; in other words, the 27/6 shall be jumped to 35/-.  I shall move that motion because I want to ensure that these people will not be forgotten again.  That is why I want the motion passed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the turnover tax, I make no apologies.  I speak for myself. I do not care what other Independents do.  We elect ourselves and we are entitled to do what we like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Ryan and myself for quite some time.  I think I am correct in saying that since the motion was placed on the Order Paper, the Minister has laid before the House his <i>Programme of Law Reform</i> which carries on the work initiated by the inter-party Government in relation to law reform.  I am glad to note that in that programme one of the matters which the Minister indicates it is the intention of the Government to deal with is the problem raised in this motion&mdash;the problem of persons who may, perfectly legitimately these days, leave all their property as they will by their will, without making any provision for their widows or other dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion in this motion is that legislation be introduced forthwith to provide that when a person is making his will, he must, either by his will or by the legislative provisions which will be passed, make provision for his dependants.  The <i>Programme of Law <Col N="1030" /> Reform</i> on page 9 refers to this problem and points out that it has been dealt with in different ways in different countries.  In some countries it is provided by legislation that a particular portion of an estate will automatically go to the widow or other dependants.</P>
    <P>I do not know, and I am not particularly concerned about it, what type of provision the Minister has in mind.  I hope he will tell us during the discussion on this motion, but I think he will agree&mdash;he has in fact indicated his agreement with the motion in principle &mdash;that provision of this sort is certainly very desirable, if not absolutely necessary.I do not think it necessary for me to say any more on the motion.  I should be glad to find out from the Minister what proposals are in existence.  I hope that if he accepts the motion, the implementation of its terms will not be too long delayed.  I know it is not possible in Bills of this sort to be too precipitate, but the matter has been obviously under consideration by the Government at least since January 1962, practically two years, so it is time that whatever legislative proposals the Minister has should see the light of day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's <i>Programme of Law Reform,</i> published in January, 1962, provides for the introduction of comprehensive legislation to deal with the devolution and administration of property on death, the distribution of property on intestacy and the problem of the inofficious will, that is, a will which disinherits or makes insufficient provision for the testator's dependants. I am happy to be able to inform the House that I have obtained Government approval for the preparation of a comprehensive Bill of this kind which will contain provisions effectively preventing people from making wills which completely disinherit their dependants.The drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage and I hope that it will be ready very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, have an opportunity of fully considering and debating these provisions when the <Col N="1031" /> Bill comes before the House.  I may say at this stage, however, that in framing the proposals, I have examined in detail the law of succession as it obtains at present in the North, in England, Scotland, France, Germany, Switzerland and in certain of the States of the American Union.  I have considered the appropriate legal provisions in continental countries, particularly those of the French, German and Swiss Civil Codes, and have also consulted some of the world's leading experts in this field of law.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the proposals in the Bill which I shall bring before the House will be those best adapted to our Irish circumstances.  It is certainly my aim&mdash;and I hope I shall succeed&mdash;to recommend a law of succession that will be among the most enlightened in the world.  I feel it would not be altogether appropriate for me at this stage to give an indication in advance of how exactly we propose to deal with this problem of inofficious wills, but I feel sure that, when the proposals come here, they will, by their excellence, have the undoubted approval of most Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is prepared to accept the motion but we hope there will not be as much delay now as there has been since he first promised to consider such a Bill three years ago, or perhaps longer. During those three years, there is no doubt there have been several inofficious wills and society is now maintaining widows and children of people who, if they had lived, would have been under a moral and statutory obligation to maintain those people. As long as we permit these people to make wills depriving widows and children of all property and all support, we are allowing people to do after death what we forbid them to do while living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We compel a living person to maintain his wife and children.  If he fails to maintain his wife and children, he will be prosecuted by the State for wife and child neglect and under the criminal code, will be compelled to <Col N="1032" /> pay a sum, which is all too small unfortunately, but a certain statutory amount week after week.  Even apart from the criminal code, such a person can be sued by a wife and compelled to contribute out of his own income for the maintenance of the wife and her children, if the children are left in her guardianship.  However, we have permitted a person by will to remove all that responsibility from his own shoulders and on to the shoulders of the State and local authorities and we do not think that is a situation which should be considered lightly or should be allowed to continue unduly long.</P>
    <P>We are also aware that there are many will disputes in Irish courts which would not come there if we introduced a comprehensive Bill dealing with the rights of succession to property.  Particularly from rural Ireland, there is plenty of speculative litigation relating to wills, and executors of wills or beneficiaries under wills, not infrequently, in order to avoid the unpleasantness and publicity of court proceedings, succumb to the pressures of people who have perhaps very questionable claims.  I believe that of all the will disputes, only a small percentage of them find their way into an actual court hearing.</P>
    <P>These considerations indicate the necessity of ensuring that there is no further delay about introducing a proper Bill to tidy up the law and to see to it that we do not allow people by their wills to fly in the face of the social obligations which are now accepted by our modern society, and so long as we permit the present unsatisfactory position to continue, that is what will happen.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to record too many particular instances but I am aware of one case where a husband and wife were separated, where under the separation agreement the husband was obliged to contribute to the support of his separated wife, and in this case I think there can be no doubt that the husband was the party to blame for the unhappy differences.  In that case, the husband made a will and died. That terminated his obligations towards his wife and the wife is now <Col N="1033" /> relaying as her sole source of income on what she is getting in home assistance.</P>
    <P>That lady came from a very comfortable family.  She married a wealthy husband who had ample property and who, no matter what unhappy differences might have arisen between them, was surely under some kind of obligation.He having taken unto himself a wife was not entitled to say: &ldquo;On my death, I will pass my money to my mistress and leave my wife on the shoulders of society.&rdquo;  That happened.I am also aware of another case in which the parties are still living but there is a serious possibility that a similar unsatisfactory situation might arise if the husband, who has obligations as long as he lives, were to go to his eternal reward before his wife.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or before the Bill is passed in the Dáil.  The Minister would probably agree with me that this is a Bill which has really to go to a Select Committee.  It is hardly one for a general discussion or exchange of views across the floor of the House. We might not get the best Bill in that way.  Along with Deputy O'Higgins, I do not make light of the difficulties the Department have to face in the drafting of this legislation.  We are glad to hear an exhaustive search has been made of the laws of succession throughout the world but we have our own peculiarly conservative outlook about property in this country and we appreciate it must be very difficult to try to dovetail the wisdom and experience of the rest of the world into our particular problems.  We would like to see a Bill introduced which did not go as far as some of us would want but at least would tidy up the situation and bring certain benefits immediately to the people who are most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an inclination, very properly, on the part of many of our people to leave a substantial amount of money to religious and other charities.  This is a very laudable thing and one with which we should not lightly interfere, but we feel, somehow <Col N="1034" /> or other, that you cannot buy your way into Heaven by leaving all your money to charity, if at the same time you disinherit your children or other close relatives.</P>
    <P>We frequently have a situation here where, for instance, apart from a wife or children, there are other relatives who have lived with a person for many years, who have kept home for him and who have been led, not unreasonably, to expect that they would be provided for in the will of that person.This happens particularly in rural Ireland where elderly people live for many years and expect, demand and get the support and comfort which can be given to them by nephews and nieces.  Members of this House from their experience must be aware of people of that nature finding themselves, having spent ten, 20 or 30 years looking after an aged relative completely deprived of all benefit from that person's estate, although by the support and comfort which they have given they have maintained that person and his property or estate for many years.</P>
    <P>These are obligations which this House must consider when this new Bill is introduced and we earnestly hope that the three years' delay which has taken place will not continue any longer but that a Bill dealing with the urgent problems of these people I have mentioned will be introduced into the House in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see this motion on the Order Paper and to see it being discussed because, as the Minister is aware, in recent weeks, I have had some experience of this problem in relation to estates and wills and the absence thereof.  It propounds <Col N="1035" /> a fundamental principle which all Parties in this House will support.  One can easily visualise the accidental circumstances which may arise out of family dissension or for any other reasons and which may work to deprive the families of deceased persons of the rights which should accrue to them on the death of parents who own property.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister is to be commended, as are the Government, when he says that legislation will be introduced at an early date to provide that a person may not dispose of his property without making adequate provision for a dependent wife and/or children.  If I have any fault to find with the motion, it is that it does not go sufficiently far to remedy what are very obvious grievances and difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should wait until he sees my proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to seeing them and I hope they will meet the many and varied problems which beset this whole matter.  It appears to me that the law as it relates to estates, that is, estates in the sense of property, be it small or great, left by deceased persons is defective and the trouble to which ordinary people are put by reason of legal requirements has to be experienced to be believed. While certainly in Dublin every co-operation is to be obtained in the courts and particularly in the Probate Office, from those charged with the responsibility of dealing with this matter as it relates to estates of people who did not have very much to leave, and while the co-operation and advice is excellent, at the same time, it has occurred to me repeatedly that the law makes for as much delay as even the bard himself did not visualise when he referred to the law's delay being one of the great barriers to human progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might expand the proposals to the maximum, with particular emphasis on the matter which has arisen in recent years in relation to the estates of persons who have died in poor circumstances.  This is a new development inasmuch as there now exists a Superannuation <Col N="1036" /> Act which applies to road workers in almost every county in Ireland.  It is not reasonable that the wife or family of such a person would suggest to such a person that he should make a will.  Many of us would be loath to make such a suggestion to anyone because it is not the most inviting subject one could bring up for discussion.</P>
    <P>The absence of a will raises very serious difficulties in relation to the claim which a widow has as a result of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act for a year's gratuity because the husband was employed by the local authority.  It means that the widow must take out what are called letters of administration.  To talk to ordinary simple people about letters of administration, and to arrange for taking out letters of administration, is a very difficult job and in some cases a frightening business when you are dealing with a widow.  The widow is perplexed enough as to how she is going to carry on without her husband and troubled enough by the ordinary troubles of life&mdash;which are multiplied now by the turnover tax&mdash;and in this confusion it is really impossible to explain the various aspects and nuances of the law and to explain why such and such needs to be done.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that the Minister and the Government in considering this whole question will take that into account.  I suppose it does not matter very much to people who are well provided for if they have to endure a long delay before wills are read and so on and before the processes of the law are gone through, because they can fend for themselves, but it does matter a great deal to, say, the mother of a young family whose husband has been a road worker and who is entitled to, as is the case in County Dublin, £450, as representing a year's wages.  It matters a great deal to her that there should be these delays and I would urge the Minister to do this utmost to speed up the processes of the law as it relates specifically to persons of that grouping.</P>
    <P>At the moment it is possible for such people, if the estate is very small, if it is less than £500, to have letters of administration taken out for 35/-.  If they go to a solicitor to do the job, <Col N="1037" /> that figure will be multiplied very much.  That figure of £500 has little relevance to present day circumstances because in a case such as I have mentioned, of a road worker who dies and whose widow becomes entitled to £450, when the few pieces of furniture in the house are valued and so on, it is found that the estate theoretically and in a very academic way amounts to £600 or £700.  This is completely unrealistic but it means that once it is over £500, the widow has to find a sum of £10, £11 or £12 even without the aid of a solicitor.</P>

      <P>I have no wish whatever to transgress the rules of the House but the Minister provoked me into making these comments.  I have tried to outline the principles to which I think the Minister should cling in his preparation of these proposals.The Minister mentioned that he will be introducing legislation&mdash; that is very welcome news&mdash;the primary purpose of which will be to protect wives and children.  I am submitting, with the greatest possible civility to the Minister, that the proposals should be extended to the maximum.  I am quite certain that the Minister will be the last to suggest that the Bill should be confined to the terms of the motion in the names of Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Ryan which simply states that legislation should be introduced at an early date to provide that a person may not dispose by will of his property without making adequate provision for a dependent wife and her children.</P>

      <P>It was proposed by Deputy O'Higgins and seconded by Deputy Ryan.  Was the Minister not here?  The point I want to make is that the Minister intervened and said proposals were being introduced in relation to this matter.  In the interests of my constituents and in the interests of many thousands of people in the country I want to suggest to him that in his consideration of these vital matters he should go to the extent I have indicated.  I hope that when he does bring the proposals before the House they will be of such a nature that we can give the Minister a complete vote of confidence and can support him to the limit in putting them through the House.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the two members of the House who have sponsored this motion are also lawyers because, in my opinion, as lawyers they are throwing something away that was of very great benefit to them.  Inevitably, a lawsuit arose where a man made a will disinheriting his wife or family.  It was claimed that he was mad or had lost his memory, and so on.  I am glad, therefore, that members of the legal profession who are Deputies put their duty as Deputies before their legal advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the motion and would suggest that the Minister could introduce a short Bill covering the principles enshrined in the motion without waiting for his comprehensive Bill.  We all know that since the State was established a comprehensive Bill has been under consideration in the Department of Justice under every Government.  When it does see the light of day and is introduced in this House it will be of such a comprehensive nature that it will have to go to a committee and it will be years before it is enacted.  There are cases arising every year&mdash;I will not say everyday&mdash;in which very grave injustice is done to the widows of persons who have property and who by will, deliberately and with intent, try to inflict some hardship or punishment on those whom they were pledged to defend and support through life.  At their death they attempt to do what <Col N="1040" /> they could not legally do during life. Therefore, the Minister having agreed to accept the motion in principle, should give practical effect to that agreement by introducing a short Bill. There was a Bill introduced here some time ago providing protection for the widows and families of persons who died intestate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister may say that Parliament is cluttered up with work.  There is no member of the House who would not be prepared to give time for such a measure so that at least some of the hardships which arise could be eliminated.  The Minister has told us that he has made a survey of the law of other countries relating to this matter.  I do not know what the law may be in other countries.  I do know that in this country there is the simple straight rule that morally and legally a husband is bound to support his wife and family during his lifetime and that responsibility should continue after his death.</P>

      <P>One never knows.  I would apply the simple rule <Col N="1041" /> of justice that we all know.  How critical we can be of the person who is guilty of the offence of disinheriting his wife.  I do regard it as an offence for a man to disinherit his wife.  I am sorry for such a poor unfortunate creature meeting his Judge.  One can only pray for him.  Such cases arise. It is a simple matter to draft a short Bill.  Even though it might not be adequate, at least it would be an indication and a warning to those who may be thinking of disinheriting their wives or their children.  I do not know that there are so many cases of children being disinherited as there are of wives being disinherited.  I know of cases where the wife has been disinherited, and that very deliberately.  In the case of a motion such as this, when the Minister expresses agreement in principle, it is taken for granted that when that motion is accepted, changes will be made at an early date.  The Minister cannot give effect to any such changes unless he introduces a short Bill.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night, I was making a few brief remarks on the road programme.We all note with satisfaction the Minister's intention of carrying out a further survey of the flow of traffic with the intention of promoting a comprehensive road programme.  There is no doubt that to date, and especially during the Minister's period of office, the road programme has progressed considerably.  We can now say that the standard of our roads has been raised in all parts of the country.  That trend is to be welcomed and it is only in conformity with the increased flow of traffic on the roads.  If cars continue to multiply in the next decade as in the past decade, then we shall need this imaginative road programme.</P>
      <P>I was also referring to housing when the debate adjourned.  Seeing that we have the very important Estimate for the Department of Local Government to consider and two motions amounting to censure on the Dublin Corporation, it might be no harm if I dealt briefly with the housing problem. There, again, I think the Minister can show a good record.  Dublin Corporation have been the subject of criticism for delays in dealing with the housing problem in the city but there is something to be said for the rate of building that is going on.  Figures indicate that without the aid of industrialised building methods used elsewhere, Dublin Corporation are continuing to pursue a steady rate of building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to note that the Minister is in favour of inviting consultants and others engaged in building to submit plans, new methods and new techniques to help out bodies such as Dublin Corporation, techniques which are used in other countries.  Those methods, if adopted, will surely mean an increased rate in the building of blocks of flats.  Concomitant with that, there will be a general increase in the rate of building.  We all know that the increased prosperity in this country is bringing visible changes in all things and will continue to do so. That fact is apparent in the new office <Col N="1043" /> buildings, the new hotels, the new schools and other new commercial buildings that are going up.</P>
    <P>The rate of development in this direction is on the increase and it is likely that we shall see a much more expanded housing drive in the next decade.  Therefore, the Planning and Development Act under which house building in every city and town in the country will be supervised is to be welcomed.  However our towns and cities may grow in the future, much will depend on the energy, initiative and ability of our young engineers and architects.  It would be fair to say that future generations will judge us on the standards laid down in the coming two or three years.</P>
    <P>Examining this aspect of the matter, we may remember that some of the buildings started eight or ten years back were subject to some criticism at that time.  Some were declared to be freakish and out of harmony with their surroundings.  It is almost certain that this type of tall building will be the choice of architects and engineers in the future. Yet this type of building was decried when introduced in this city.  I suppose that arose from the fact that up to the middle of this century, we had no experience or tradition here of erecting tall buildings.  Nevertheless, this type of design is the coming one and the trend has already started in Dublin.  Whether we like it or not, it is likely to continue, not merely in Dublin but in our provincial towns and cities.  It is coming in with the Common Market idea and, for good or ill, it will be a feature of future buildings.</P>
    <P>I said last night that the Georgian squares of Dublin are passing into history.  I also said it was rather late now to start an argument on the merits or demerits of the Georgian design.  In present circumstances, that would be of no assistance in our drive to secure better housing standards. The time to talk about the Georgian design was 40 or 50 years ago when those houses first started to fall into decay.  We know from experience of our limited resources that those <Col N="1044" /> houses could not be restored except at public expense.  We should keep in step with the times and not merely encourage our young architects but also our young engineers, draughtsmen and designers.  We should lend them a helping hand in the task of planning the future housing of the country.</P>
    <P>The House should welcome the Minister's idea of inviting outside building promoters to submit proposals for building which can be fitted into the general plan of our housing campaign.  It may help to bring something new here, to lower the cost of houses and, in addition, to speed up the provision of accommodation for people who need it.  The increase of £35,000 in the estimate of contributions towards local housing loan charges, together with the £100,000 towards loan charges of sanitary authorities, has made possible a good rate of development in the provision of better water supplies and sewerage facilities.  Those increases, coupled with the £250,000 for private housing, clearly indicate that the Government have taken an active interest in this matter by devoting £2,750,000 to the housing campaign.</P>
    <P>I noted that the Minister said in his opening statement that most local authorities have taken an active part in promoting the repair and replacement of houses by paying supplementary grants.  He also said that some urban authorities were slow and did not display the same enthusiasm in adopting the scheme of supplementary grants.  That may arise from the fact that some urban authorities fear putting what they term a burden on the rates.  But in the long run, it would be better that urban councils should adopt the supplementary grants scheme.  As the Minister pointed out, if we tackle this matter in determined fashion, private housebuilding should balance out public effort.  The two should go hand in hand.  In the long run, the fact that urban councils encourage private building might save them from having to undertake a larger scheme of public housebuilding. Urban councils should not therefore be backward in adopting the supplementary grants scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> The question of sites was referred to in the course of the debate.  The Minister encouraged local authorities to try to get them to purchase sites for houses around the country towns. It is not always easy for urban authorities to procure suitable land.  If they can procure suitable land, it is not always easy for them to arrange the price.  We all know that good land surrounding a provincial town is at present making a fairly high price.  Here also the question of going up or out present itself.  Is it not time that some of the bigger local authorities at least considered building blocks of flats rather than spreading out sometimes in all ill-ordered fashion around country towns?  That is why one can welcome the Minister's intention to promote industrial methods in building because those methods might be an aid in this matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, I was glad that the Minister referred to the rate of vesting of houses by local authorities.  At present some county managers are drawing up schemes for the sale of local authority houses to the tenants.  It might be well if the managers could embody in those schemes terms which would make the purchase as attractive as possible to the tenants.  In the past I have known of schemes rejected by tenants on the grounds of cost.  It may well be that costs in general are great but I make a plea to the Minister to have the county managers consider the problem seriously because it is a rather baffling one at present for public representatives.</P>
    <P>The fact that tenants are slow to purchase sometimes means that the houses are not kept in the state of repair in which they should be kept. We know from experience that it is not always possible for local authorities to keep those houses in first-class repair.  Then, when the tenant considers the matter, he often decides to remain as a weekly tenant and that is bad from our point of view.  We subscribe to private enterprise and private ownership and in that regard I suggest the Minister should give every possible encouragement to local authorities and county managers and others responsible for drawing up these schemes to make them as attractive as <Col N="1046" /> possible so that we shall see an end to this difficulty in our time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing his Estimate, like all Ministers who have made speeches lately, was very high-sounding but I find his speech studded with inaccuracies and the people will not accept a lot of what has been said.</P>
      <P>On several occasions here, I referred to the need for co-ordination between different services, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the ESB, Bord Fáilte and so on.  These bodies should co-ordinate in order to avoid having the unnecessary poles that we see giving directions on the streets.  It is time the Minister gave a lead in attempting to eliminate that forest of unnecessary poles.  Why not put some of the signs on the ESB poles?  It is a regrettable situation when you just cannot walk between these poles. We talk of tidy towns; let us have a lead from the top in tidying up unnecessary posts and poles.</P>
      <P>We have a fairly high standard of fire brigades and I think the insurance companies that are drawing big and increasing premiums should do something further to raise that standard by presenting prizes for competition between different units.  These companies seem to have a free hand because, when the Minister for Finance floats a loan, these are the people who subscribe to it and the Minister is afraid to tread on their corns.  I take it the country is in the hollow of their hands and the Minister is not prepared to put pressure on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, the Minister at the Municipal Authorities' Conference in Skibbereen, exhorted delegates to complete water schemes in the different towns.  He said about three or four per cent were outstanding.  I should like the Minister to search among the papers on his desk and see if he could find a request&mdash;if it is not already pigeon-holed&mdash;from Galway Corporation to put at least two of their schemes through.  I refer especially to the Rahoon and Ballyfoyle schemes, which have much merit because they would service a dairying area and it is in the interests of health and hygiene that these people should have water.  If the <Col N="1047" /> Minister is sincere, I ask him to sanction these schemes.</P>
    <P>In regard to delay in sanctioning schemes, the Minister should cut much of the red tape and expedite house building applications that are lying on his desk.  There is great suspicion about the delay, that it may be designed to bring the buildings under the 2½ per cent turnover tax.  That is most unfair to those people who had their applications in for months.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been sticking his chest out speaking about the rate of housebuilding throughout the country. I do not find myself in agreement with the Minister as far as Galway is concerned, either as a member of Galway Corporation or Galway County Council.  My colleague on the opposite benches will bear me out when I say we are finding it increasingly difficult to get contractors to accept a contract for the building of single houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister should interest himself in finding out where the bottleneck is.  It is not enough consolation for applicants for houses to proclaim that everything in the garden is lovely. I refute the Minister's claim in relation to the big number of houses built as far as Galway is concerned.  I have here a letter from Galway Corporation giving statistics of house building.  From 3rd March, 1956, to 1958, we built 263 houses.  That was the famous period of inter-Party Government about which we hear so much. The Minister might say that houses in 1958 were built in the Fianna Fáil period of Government.  I will not let the Minister get away with that because the foundations had been laid a year before and 1958 was merely a continuation of the schemes started by the inter-Party Government.  From 1959 to 1963&mdash;this is the period the Minister has been boasting about&mdash;the figures show a big change; in 1959, nil; in 1960, nil; in 1961, 20 houses; in 1962, nil; in 1963, 20 houses. These figures show some of the inaccuracies in the Minister's opening statement.</P>
    <P>Since Fianna Fáil came into Government in 1959, we have a grand total of 40 houses built in the city of Galway. <Col N="1048" /> During the period of inter-Party Government we had 263 houses built. Is that what the Minister is boasting about?  The Minister is fast becoming known as the Minister for Caravans and Prefabs.  It is sad to see young married couples in my town, the husband living at home with his own people, and the wife living at home with her people.  We boast of being a Christian country: &ldquo;Whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.&rdquo;  I could give many instances and, if Deputy Geoghegan likes to come into Galway, I will open his eyes.  He will not have the smile on his face then that is there now.  It is poor consolation to these people to hear the Minister's boasts.  Who is the Minister trying to fool?</P>
    <P>A matter which shocks the public conscience is the increasing number of road deaths.  The public cry aloud for stronger measures.  It is regrettable that that increase should follow on the enactment of a new Road Traffic Act.  Something more will obviously have to be done.  A number of these accidents occur at night.  Many of them may be caused by fatigued drivers dozing at the wheel momentarily, but I have a grave suspicion that a great number of them occur after closing hours.  An odd check as to fitness would be no harm.  Possibly this is a matter for the Department of Justice.</P>

If we do not make a start the hooligans will be completely out of hand.  It is an odd thing that we never hear of any <Col N="1049" /> of them being caught.  Possibly they make sure they will not be caught.  It is a comment that a great many of our insurance companies are getting away with murder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to malicious injury claims.  The figure is a formidable one.  The ratepayers have to pay for the damage.  If property is insured, I do not see why the ratepayers should be called on.  As I have said, these companies have got the country in the hollow of their hands.</P>
      <P>Good work has been done in the matter of clearing derelict sites through the grants now available. Much still remains to be done and in this connection I would ask the Minister to have a look at the vicinities of railways and see if they could not be improved.  They constitute a serious eyesore at the moment.  While still on the problem of derelict sites, I would draw the Minister's attention to the many badly-kept graveyards throughout the country.  I will probably be told these are the responsibility of the families who have people buried there, but there are many graveyards in respect of which the families who would normally be responsible for maintenance have died out.  Many of them are in a disgraceful condition and we should feel a great sense of shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter of grave national importance is the level of our preparedness for emergencies.  I would refer particularly to the situation in Wicklow last year.  God grant we never see the like again, but the Department, and the Government as a whole, fell down completely there.  It was Wicklow yesterday; it could be Cork, Galway, Donegal tomorrow.  In view of his great failure in respect of Wicklow, I now ask the Minister what <Col N="1050" /> preparations he has made to deal with such emergencies in future, whether they be storms, floods or snow.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of being one of those who forced the Minister into giving storm damage grants.  I had the privilege of being Mayor of Galway and I invited officials of his Department to come to the city when we were devastated by hurricane Debbie.  The officials were so impressed by the damage there that shortly after they went back, the storm damage grants were introduced.  Before I leave this subject, I would again ask the Minister to let the House know what steps he proposes to take in the event, God forbid, of another emergency like that in Wicklow.  It is all very well to sit back now and sing that there is sunshine on the Wicklow hills but the Minister should see to it that emergency relief of that sort is not left to the meagre financial resources of the Red Cross and other such societies who proved in Wicklow that they were unable to face up to the situation.As we say in the west: &ldquo;Ní hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn to the Department's policy on road repairs. One can see in the midlands miles of road torn up and left there for months. Apparently the engineers bite off more than they can chew, showing complete disregard for the people who must pay in the long run.  In our programme of road repairs, we should show more consideration for pedestrians.  We proceed to build autobahns but forget all about the provision of footpaths for pedestrians.  In all our road planning, we should ensure that there are footpaths laid down for two or three miles on all sides of our towns.  At the moment pedestrians are being driven up the walls by our road hogs.</P>
    <P>In the matter of road improvements, the question of widening is giving some trouble at the moment. Much grand work has been done in this respect but many of our main roadsides are nothing but parking grounds for tinkers in the vicinity of our towns, an encouragement to these people to come in there and pester us.  Something should be done to fence these roadside areas which <Col N="1051" /> at the moment are jumping off grounds for these ne'er-do-wells.  I am interested to know what the Miniister proposes to do in the matter of relief of rates consequent on the turnover tax.</P>

      <P>Why not?  Local authorities will be demanding increased rates to pay for the increased maintenance costs in hospitals, county homes and other local institutions and I submit the Minister should enlighten us as to what he proposes to do to relieve the overburdened ratepayers. Part of the Fine Gael policy is to reduce the burden of rates by the reorganisation of health services, by giving local authorities wider discretion in the matter of road grants, by providing grants for the repair of roads which would become the responsibility of the local authorities. Fine Gael policy also is to provide exemption from rates for seven years where there are increases in rateable valuation consequent on the improvement of premises.  The Minister and his Party have been copying a lot of Fine Gael policy and if he is prepared to adopt these few little points from Fine Gael, we shall not object. Of course, there is no guarantee the Minister will be there long enough to do it.  The people will not support a Government who are not prepared to vote on an issue or are not prepared even to let the people vote on an issue, as we have seen here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to be big enough to reintroduce the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The Minister has a request from the Galway County Council in this regard and I do not have to remind him that the majority of that council are members of his Party.  I take that as a tribute to the inter-Party Government's first having introduced this Act, an Act that did a lot for the improvement of land and an Act that gave power to the local councils, power they have not got at the moment which possibly is the reason why the Department removed <Col N="1052" /> this legislation.  There is too much autocracy in this country.  It is about time that some of these powers were passed back to the people, to the elected representatives, who are not like the Independent representatives who think they have all the power in this House.</P>

      <P>I wonder, when the Minister was framing his Estimate for this year, if he took into consideration in regard to housing the extra charges that will be imposed by the Budget proposals brought in by this Government.  It is reasonable to assume that the building of a house will cost a considerable amount more than it has heretofore cost and that corporations and other public bodies who are largely responsible for housing will find themselves faced with excessive obligations in respect of corporation profits tax.  Was there any preparation for that eventually in the framing of this Estimate?  If not, will we be faced with a situation with which we have been faced annually in relation to practically every Estimate introduced by this Government?  That information would be helpful to the House in view of the somewhat uncertain situation that prevails in regard to housing and the tremendous demand that exists for houses, not only in the city of Dublin, as has been evidenced by the speeches by Deputies who represent the regions around Dublin, but throughout the country as a whole.  There must be a tremendous building drive and, as against that, there will be a tremendous extra charge thrown back on the people who are to live in the houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister any plan to deal with that situation, or, like everything else, is it one of those glorious paper schemes, the difficulties and troubles in regard to which do not appear until it is sought to make the schemes effective?I estimate that a house which is built as from 1st November last will be subject to this percentage charge on all building material.  It will also be subject to corporation profits tax and to increased charges which will arise from the demands which it is recognised will come from all manual <Col N="1053" /> workers, in fact, from all types of workers, throughout the country, and which in turn will result in increased costs of administration for local authorities in respect of engineers, administrative staff, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to estimate even roughly what these extra charges will be but I could not find anything in the Minister's address when introducing this Estimate to show that that matter had been given even a passing survey by him and those who advise him in the Department.  Perhaps when he is replying at the end of this debate, which has extended over a considerable period, he will intimate to the House what the plans are for the future and also if he is going to safeguard those who are already in corporation houses against an increase in rent or if they are to pay this extra charge, not once but possibly three or four times over.</P>
    <P>Whatever way it may be glossed over, Deputies are not offering their opinions here for nothing and it is obvious from the speeches made from every side of the House that there is a backlog in housing.  It is also obvious that the surveys the Minister has made in regard to the requirements here do not in any way meet the current situation.  I recently asked the Minister a question in relation to housing problems in my constituency and the reply I received was that the survey which had been made dealt only with unfit and unsound houses and did not relate to the increased demand for houses.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised&mdash;and this position obtains in every country in the world&mdash;there is a flight from the land. There are not as many people requiring to live in the rural areas and there are not as many people employed on the land.  That situation is not peculiar to this country.  Therefore, there must be a movement to the towns and a movement towards industrial development and that means more houses. When a town in any part of Ireland has an opportunity of having a factory established, the first question that is always asked is: &ldquo;Have you the housing <Col N="1054" /> accommodation available?  Have you any plans for housing accommodation?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister that if he were the most active Minister in the world, if he were the most enthusiastic Minister for Local Government this State has ever had, under the present administration, under the present schemes and the present plans laid before this House, there is not the slightest chance of overtaking the housing problem in the foreseeable future.  As regards Dublin alone, there has been evidence here in the speeches made by Dublin Deputies that there is a tremendous backlog in housing, a tremendous increase in the demand for houses.</P>
    <P>Occasionally I get letters from people who originally came from my own county and who are living in Dublin.  Unless they have a five-years' residential qualification and unless they have a family of at least four children, they have no chance whatever of getting a house in Dublin.  That may well be for the purpose of protecting those who live in Dublin but it shows an appalling state of affairs.  It shows that the housing situation in this city is in chaos.</P>
    <P>It puzzles me, therefore, when people buy houses here in the city and wish to construct them into flats, that they come up against the town planning section of the Dublin Corporation who very often deny them the right to convert the houses.  Again I say I am a country Deputy but there are people from my own county who come to live in Dublin and who write to me in this regard.  I recently had a case of a person, a widow, who bought a house with the idea of converting it into flats for the purpose of getting some remuneration in return.  She was promptly told by the town planning authority that she could not do that.  The case was then appealed to the Minister.  There was some urgency about the matter as this lady did not want to be held up for two or three months.</P>
    <P>I made representations to the Department and I discovered that there were 600 appeals on the same question sitting on the Minister's table.  I do not say that the Minister is holding these <Col N="1055" /> up&mdash;I gather they reached him only quite recently&mdash;but the point I want to make is that if there is a shortage of houses in Dublin, what is the sense in preventing people converting houses into flats?  What is the point of the Town Planning Committee&mdash;whoever they are; I gather they are officials of the Dublin Corporation&mdash;denying these people the right to turn houses into flats when they are at least helping to offset this very serious situation which exists in Dublin?  I call it blatant bureaucracy.  It is not getting anybody anywhere.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give favourable hearing to these appeals.  Only the other day, I heard of a case of a woman in Dublin who converted a house into flats and every one of those flats was let to tenants or potential tenants and then the Town Planning Committee said: &ldquo;You cannot do that.&rdquo;  I do not know what the relations are between the officials of the Corporation and the officials in the Custom House but I hope the people in the Custom House will give a sympathetic hearing to such people and enable them to convert, if they so wish, houses into flats so that people will have the opportunity of getting accommodation with their own kitchens rather than being dumped into houses with three or four other families.  I should have thought that anyone who is contributing in any way towards the housing problem in Dublin would have received the most sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>The main trouble in this apparently lies with the officials of Dublin Corporation.  I hope the Minister will take those 600 applications, if he has not already done so, and deal with them expeditiously.  As far as I know, the case I had was a reasonable one and as far as I know, the others are. We also have in my county a Town and Planning Committee and it appears that it is necessary to get the permission of the local authority to do anything now.  I know of cases where people have been waiting for a considerable time to reconstruct their houses.  Something which perhaps is not always as evident to officials as it is to elected representatives is that it <Col N="1056" /> is difficult to get contractors.  It is also very often difficult to get a scheme&mdash; a private enterprise scheme, if you like&mdash;started.  When you have made arrangements to get it started, it is a bit hard if you are held up by officials for a considerable period.  If your scheme is rejected by the officials, your redress is to appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Our problems in Wexford do not appear to be any different from those elsewhere.  In four towns in my constituency, they are waiting for houses. Every time a house becomes vacant, there are at least 12 to 15 applications for it.  We have a housing scheme in Gorey which has been &ldquo;simmering&rdquo; for about 15 or 16 months.  I gather that the delay is nearly over and that it will be started eventually but it has been a source of disappointment to everyone concerned that it could not be commenced this summer.  That may not have been the fault of the Department; perhaps the local authority were somewhat slow in sending up the plans.  We also have a housing scheme in Enniscorthy, where there is a big demand for houses, and in New Ross and in Wexford.</P>
    <P>I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to appoint somebody in his office to act as a liaison officer with the local authorities so that when these schemes come up from the local authorities, they may be dealt with expeditiously?  It often happens that they are sent to Dublin and may be in the office from three to six months before being sent back.  All the blame may not be attributable to the Department.It often happens that the Department send back queries to the local authority and the local authority takes a considerable time to reply and then the Department have to reply again. Would it not be possible to set up a small section to deal with relations between local authorities and the Department and if necessary, send an official, an engineer, from the Department to discuss the matter with the body concerned?  By doing that, months of delay could be swept away. It should not be very difficult to send a man from the Department to the local authority to discuss these matters.</P>
    <P>Although I am not a member of the local authority, I get many requests to <Col N="1057" /> expedite the building of labourers' cottages.  The plain fact is that there has been no building of labourers' cottages in Wexford for the past few years.  Schemes have been sanctioned and have recommenced again but in nearly all cases, it is almost impossible to get contractors.  In the few years in which the hiatus in building existed, these people went to England.  If a statement could be made that it was definitely intended to carry on with public housing&mdash;which obviously all sides of the House and all shades of political opinion are agreed on&mdash;in continuity for four or five years, it is likely that many of the contractors who have emigrated would return and we might not be faced again with the situation we are faced with now.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of further expediting housing.  Is it not possible&mdash;I think I am pushing an open door here&mdash;to turn over to a prefabricated design?  Recently I was reading a German newspaper and I saw a photograph of the Minister discussing prefabrication in southern Germany.  There have been great advances in prefabricated designs in most continental countries, where hospitals, schools and houses are being built to such designs.  The modern prefabricated building is entirely different from the type of prefabricated house we saw in England in the bombed areas and in other places.  It is a modern, up-to-date house with every possible contrivance.I gather they are being modernised and brought up-to-date so that now these houses are almost the same price as ordinary brick and mortar houses.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by those who are supposed to know something about it that these houses in the not too distant future will be even cheaper than the existing type of houses being built here.  As the Minister has not disclosed it to the House, I do not know whether we are to have a prefabrication drive or not.  It is quite obvious that it is very desirable that we should and also quite obvious that it will not in any way affect the building trade and those employed in it because I do not think, by the wildest stretch of the imagination, <Col N="1058" /> the Minister believes he can draw level with a situation which has fallen into arrears, coupled with the increasing demand for houses.  When the Minister is replying, he might give the House some indication of what he discovered in Ulm, or Munchen, or wherever it was in Germany he was photographed with his counterpart in the West German Government.</P>
    <P>The traffic regulations have been the subject of many expressions of opinion here and there.  I think there is one inescapable fact, that is, that the speed limits in built-up areas have not been responsible for cutting down the number of accidents.  Somehow I feel that the speed limit of 30 miles an hour, unless it is actually within the confines or the centre of the city, is inadvisable. Coming into Dublin by the Dún Laoghaire route, one is not confined to 30 miles an hour.  In many cases it is 40 miles an hour, which is a more reasonable rate of speed.  Coming into Dublin by other routes, one finds it is 30 miles an hour all the time.  There are many long, straight stretches of road there.  One of the things really responsible for accidents is that if you get a lot of traffic in a built-up area like that, although it is fairly straight and you are allowed to travel only 30 miles an hour, you may find one car doing 20 miles an hour, and not capable of doing more than that, and other cars have to pass it at 30 miles an hour.  That does not give latitude to pass expeditiously and fast.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I think the whole question of the built-up areas and the speed limits should be brought under review.  I fully appreciate the fact that it is at its experimental stage now. Of course, that is what they have largely done in the United Kingdom and what they do there today we always seem to do tomorrow.  Perhaps the Minister would consider replacing some of these 30 mile an hour speed limits, where he sees it possible to do so, by 40 mile an hour limits.  Perhaps we will get a better result therefrom.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister or his Department intend to do with regard to the parking situation in Dublin. The Minister in his opening address <Col N="1059" /> told us that we were to have 13 new parking places in Dublin.  He did not give us any indication where these parking places were to be, when they would be available, or the number of cars they will accommodate.  The only thing he told us was that underneath Corporation flats somewhere or another we would have accommodation for cars.  This is something which should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.In Dublin at the moment the streets, which I think could at the present time take the traffic, are entirely prevented from doing so because every street is cluttered up with cars.  The streets are so cluttered up because there is nowhere else to park.  It is perfectly true to say that every available parking place in Dublin is taken up by the people who live in the city. They get into town in time and use up all the parking space.  When people come up from the country, they are obliged to park in Rathmines and Donnybrook.  Very often it is hard to get a place out there and they find their way into the city.  That may be desirable from the point of view of utilisation of public transport and the financing of CIE.  It is bad luck on someone who comes up to do a day's shopping in the city to find he has to spend half an hour in a bus or perhaps ten minutes looking for a parking place in Dublin and a great deal more than half an hour trying to get out.  At the rush time, it may take even an hour.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that anyone who comes up from rural Ireland to do business in Dublin is considerably impeded by the total lack of organisation in regard to the traffic parking regulations.I think the Minister should give the matter his earnest consideration. He may have been influenced by the fact that the parking arrangements made in London were not a success. There were, I believe, big parking places made underneath Marble Arch and Hyde Park in London which are practically empty.  As against that, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that these are not shopping centres in the accepted sense of the word.  They are not within <Col N="1060" /> reach of the majority of the shops there.  What the people in Dublin want&mdash;I am speaking for rural Ireland largely&mdash;is to be accommodated somewhere in the centre of the city near the shopping centres where they can park their cars.  I cannot understand why the Dublin merchants have not revolted long ago because they must be losing money due to the fact that the people cannot get to the shops.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister has given consideration to the closing of railways and to the potential closing of railways and the greater load of traffic which will be thrown on our Irish roads.  Nobody knows from day to day what the latest move with regard to the rail traffic will be.  Of course, it is not a matter for the Minister for Local Government but it is a serious matter for him when he finds himself faced with roads on which the cars will be bumper to bumper and hampered by lorries and slow traffic.  It means that if the railways go a great deal of heavy traffic will be put on the roads.  On the continent of Europe where there has been a great deal of closure of railway lines and a great deal of transference of traffic from the rail to the road, where the double type lorry is very prevalent now, they have moved to meet that situation.  The first move necessary to meet that situation is to widen the roads.</P>
    <P>For that reason I should like to put this to the Minister.  I take it that everything that takes place on the Irish roads has ultimately to be sanctioned by him.  I think it would be more advantageous if we widened our roads rather than do what we are doing at the moment&mdash;trying to make all the roads straight.  In my own county literally thousands have been spent on the reconstruction of straight roads as against bends.  Actually, the roads themselves have been left aside and new roads burrowed through fields and farms.  I do not think that is a good policy.  It is probably all right from the tourist point of view if you want to have a road where the tourist can do 50 to 60 miles an hour and shoot through the country quickly from one place to another.</P>
    <P>If we are to face the future, we <Col N="1061" /> must keep abreast of the revolution that is taking place in traffic all over the world.  We want to widen our roads.  One can always put a foot or two on each side at a comparatively small cost.  The roads on which I travel from my home to Dáil Éireann could be widened by two feet on each side for comparatively less than the present expenditure on these extravagant schemes.  I do not know who is responsible for them.  I do not know if they are the idea of the geniuses and engineers within the local authorities or are conceived in the brain of somebody in the Custom House.  It is a matter the Minister should review in the near future.</P>
    <P>If I may be topical for a moment and refer to my own constituency, I may say that more motorcars come into Ireland from the United Kingdom through Rosslare Harbour than through any other port.  That situation will obtain until they get the ferry in Dún Laoghaire, if they ever get it. The cars then have to come north to Wexford.  They come on a narrow road that is not particularly good.  No attempt seems to be made to widen that road.  I have asked questions about it frequently in Dáil Éireann and am told that it is a matter for the local authority.  Again I say that everything that comes under the heading of road construction, housing, and so on is subject to the sanction of the Minister for Local Government.  It is his job, in the final analysis, to see that it is done properly.</P>
    <P>I have given the Minister some idea of the many problems that a rural Deputy faces in relation to matters concerned with his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some comments on the question of road safety, with particular reference to the present speed limits.  This is a matter for which the whole House must take responsibility to some extent because the House passed the legislation which enforced a 30 miles an hour limit in built-up areas and merely gave permission to the Minister in certain circumstances to impose a higher limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Right from the start, I have made it clear that I was not in favour of that <Col N="1062" /> policy, for two reasons.  A speed limit of 30 miles per hour is far too low. With modern motor vehicles and modern road conditions, a speed limit of 30 miles per hour is entirely unrealistic, especially in view of the fact that a speed limit of 30 miles per hour in fact reduces the speed of a line of traffic to somewhere between 20 and 25 miles per hour.  It is completely illusory to imagine that because you are in a 30 miles per hour area, you can do 30 miles per hour.  In most cases this is a physical impossibility.</P>
    <P>I have made the point before and would like to make it again that varying speed limits are a source of confusion to the motorist.  I was very glad that Deputy Briscoe made that point in the Dublin Corporation a couple of nights ago.  I thoroughly agree with him in that.  What happens is that people are constantly making mistakes as to the speed limit in the area in which they are driving.  I very often suffer extreme frustration on the road to Dún Laoghaire, due to people hugging the crown of the road at 25 miles per hour in a 40 mile an hour zone.</P>
    <P>In a recent article in the <i>Irish Times,</i> the motoring correspondent gave it as his opinion that one of the main causes of accidents was frustration on the part of drivers.  I absolutely agree with him in that.  It is because a motorist so often finds himself blocked by slow-moving traffic that he is tempted to take risks in an effort to get ahead of it.  That is precisely what is happening.  Instead of speed limits resulting in a lower rate of accidents, the number of accidents taking place in the city to-day is appalling.  I know it in the course of my own business.  Cars are coming in in wrecked condition. Only in very rare instances are these accidents caused by excessive speed.  A much more common cause is that a man has been held up for what he feels is an unconscionable length of time&mdash;probably only a matter of three or four minutes&mdash;behind a big, slow-moving lorry or private car, the driver of which is just dawdling along and getting in everybody's way.  The driver who is anxious to get somewhere suddenly finds his patience exhausted, swings out blindly on to his wrong side <Col N="1063" /> of the road in an effort to pass, finds himself blocked in getting into his own line again and then goes head on into a car coming from the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>A crash of two vehicles at anything over 20 miles an hour is almost invariably fatal.  People do not realise that.  The speed of the impact is 40, 50 or 60 miles per hour.  Statistics have shown that in the United Kingdom the majority of fatal accidents occur in 30 mile per hour zones where the vehicles are not in fact exceeding the limit.  I know it is unpopular in some quarters to suggest it but I do solemnly and sincerely suggest that there should be a uniform speed limit of 40 miles per hour in built-up areas.  The immediate reaction to such a suggestion is to inquire as to who would seriously advocate doing 40 miles per hour in Moore Street or, for that matter, Grafton Street.  The curious thing is that before speed limits were imposed at all, it was quite clear that nobody could do 40 miles per hour in Moore Street or in Grafton Street.  It is a physical impossibility.  In places where 40 miles per hour would be excessive, it is also unattainable.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it is a misconception that such a concession would lead to increased danger.  I would say the reverse would be the case because after driving for a considerable period through the city at 20 to 25 miles per hour a driver tends to become dozy and lazy and to feel that he has not got to keep a sharp look out.  He gets bored and frustrated and if confronted with some emergency, such as a pedestrian stepping out in front of him, is not nearly so quick to realise the danger and to take avoiding action.  If a driver is occasionally able to go at a higher rate, he is obviously more on his guard.</P>
    <P>If the policy of having varying speed limits is pursued, we will get ourselves into the situation which exists at present on the continent.  I have driven to a considerable extent on the continent.The position in Germany is, in my opinion, about the worst, for the simple reason that the number of road signs is so great that a driver if he is <Col N="1064" /> to drive properly, would nearly need to have a navigator with him to keep him fully briefed as to what all the signs are telling him.  There are varying speed limit signs.  There are other signs showing the gradient of the hill ahead, signs showing the radius of the curve the driver will next encounter, advance information as to road junctions and as to the angle at which they will meet the road upon which the driver is travelling.</P>
    <P>The more you encourage a driver to look for signs, the more you encourage him to take his eye off the road, and that is fatal.  I mean that literally. The only thing a driver should be looking at is the road ahead of him. A multiplicity of signs represents a distraction and must be avoided at all costs.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that he should go for a uniform speed limit in built-up areas and I would seriously suggest that it be 40 rather than 30 miles per hour; but if the Minister is not prepared to go so far, I would still prefer it to be a uniform 30 miles per hour in the rather more restricted areas.</P>
    <P>So far as road accidents are concerned, the solution quite clearly does not rest with reducing the speed of road traffic.  Current development in road transport makes it essential that we should regard the matter in an entirely different light, that is, by way of improving the road system. Emphasis has been laid on the widening of the roads but I would not regard that as a solution of the problem at all.  We have got to aim at a much higher proportion of dual carriageway roads in the main trunk system.</P>
    <P>When we see the appalling accident which took place recently at Gormanston, an accident which took place on a magnificent stretch of straight, wide road, we realise that the straightness and width of the road is no protection against such accidents.  Where a magnificent road is an invitation to very high speed and where the traffic moving fastest is also nearest to the oncoming fast traffic, the slightest error in overtaking can lead to the tremendous danger of a head-on <Col N="1065" /> collision such as was recently experienced.We have to regard this question of the road system as a national problem.  There is no use in widening short stretches of road.  It is no more reasonable to do that than to try to improve a river channel by deepening it in one place only.  By doing that, you will only give rise to flooding elsewhere.</P>
    <P>That has been experienced recently in London where a magnificent new road crossing was produced by bringing one street over another.  This was expected to ease the traffic situation tremendously but the only result was that traffic got past that crossing so quickly that it built up into an absolute bottleneck at each end of the tunnel. We must plan our trunk roads on a national basis so that there will be a first-rate dual carriageway road running directly from Dublin to the various provincial cities and towns and also join the provincial towns to one another by way of link roads.  Those are the roads which will be taking the heavy traffic and if they are dual carriageway roads, they will take that heavy traffic safely and fast.</P>
    <P>Roads are for traffic to move on.  At present we are getting to the stage of having roads and trying to prevent anything moving on them except at a snail's pace.  That is waste of time, money, fuel and life.  A system of national planning cannot be done as long as we leave our road planning to local authorities only.  Some have done a magnificent job but it is a tragedy when, coming up from Naas, you come along a magnificent road until you come to the Dublin county boundary where you have to travel over poor, narrow roads into the city.  You have the same difficulty in getting out of the city to the North.  Plans are being made to bypass Santry, but to get as far as Santry is half an hour's job.  That road is taking very heavy traffic indeed. Once you get outside the Dublin county boundary, you begin to make progress. Louth has done remarkably well and Meath has also done well but Dublin is lagging far behind.</P>
    <P>There is no use in having isolated stretches of excellent road.  That means <Col N="1066" /> that the traffic will go racing along the good road and will get into trouble when the road suddenly narrows.  I would suggest that a central road authority be set up to take over all the main trunk roads from the local authorities, draw funds from the Road Fund and construct a major road system before it is too late.  Every year we wait will mean additional expenditure and, as far as Dublin is concerned, the situation is critical.</P>
    <P>I know, in my movements around the city, that it is becoming almost impossible to get into the city unless you get in extremely early or extremely late.  If I set off from Sandycove later than 8.30 a.m., I am certainly in trouble.  In order to get to Island-bridge at almost any time of the day, I have to go almost up into the mountains if I want to make the journey in any sort of reasonable time. It puts five miles on to my journey and it means ten to 15 minutes in time. That is again a waste of fuel and money.  What we will have to do as far as Dublin is concerned is to build new trunk roads leading right into the city and cut out a tremendous number of the present road intersections.</P>
    <P>If we take the Bray Road as an example, it is a series of crossroads and very dangerous road junctions.  What we have to do there is to make sure that the traffic coming from the side roads to join the main road will not have to cross another line of traffic to do so.  The side roads will have to be joined to it by over-crossings or undercrossings so that traffic from these side roads will be gradually filtered into the main road system.  It means that crossroads must be abolished on all our major roads leading into and out of the city.  It means that we must have a major circular road bypassing the city altogether so that traffic can move from the north to south without having to smash its way through College Green, across O'Connell Bridge and through O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>We must plan ambitiously, and I am glad to note that Dublin Corporation is considering sympathetically, the provision of at least one tunnel under the Liffey to take traffic from the North Quays to the South Quays.  We <Col N="1067" /> should also have another tunnel to take other cross-city traffic.  There are those who say that this is a hopelessly ambitious scheme, but it will have to be put into operation sooner or later, and the longer we leave it, the more expensive it will be.  In order to construct these new roadways, the new road authority or the local authority will have to acquire premises which are of increasing value.  We are now right up against it, and we must act immediately and act fast.  We must act with imagination.  I do not believe we should put this matter off by saying we will put the matter in the hands of experts and ask them for their opinion and advice.  The very good advice I got from a leading European politician was: &ldquo;Never ask an expert. Tell him what you want.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is exactly what we should do in the case of the roads.  We should not ask anybody whether a tunnel is possible; we should tell an expert to plan and build a tunnel under the city.  We should say to the expert: &ldquo;Plan a road network for the north side of the city, then the west side and then the south side.  Plan it and put it into operation at once.&rdquo;  I know we cannot do it all at one fell swoop.  We would hope to clear the entrances to and exits from the city in three sections&mdash;north, west and south.  We should make sure that traffic can move from the centre of the city on to the main roads without causing hopeless confusion.</P>
    <P>I have one point on a different subject&mdash;the question of the overall housing situation.  I was greatly impressed by an article by Mr. Garret Fitzgerald in the <i>Irish Times</i> to-day where he pointed out that, contrary to the opinion of the Opposition, our population is now rising steadily.  He went on to point out that all the signs were that the population would continue to increase for probably ten years at least and that by the end of ten years from now a real housing crisis would have arisen.  At present the proportion of young people to old people in this country is low.  But in ten years' time, according to his statistics and analysis of the population trend, the proportion of young people will be very much <Col N="1068" /> higher.  This will mean that the number of young married couples will be greater which, in turn, will mean that the need for houses for these young married couples will be very much greater.</P>
    <P>The provision of houses on a large scale is something that must be planned well ahead.  To be quite frank, I think we have been caught by surprise by our success in reducing the rate of emigration.  While emigration was at a high rate, Corporation houses were becoming vacant fairly frequently.Now Corporation houses are not becoming vacant at all.  If the population increases, the need for new houses will go up.</P>
    <P>I would hope, therefore, that the Minister would follow the advice of Mr. Garret Fitzgerald and have what he calls a proper demographic survey made so that advance plans can be completed for dealing with the housing problem that will arise five years from now and will increase in the following five years.  It is only by doing this we will avoid overcrowding, bad housing and frustration amongst our younger people in the future.  I would hope therefore that the Minister would undertake such a survey or have it made so that a national housing plan can be drawn up at an early date and we will know where we are going.</P>
    <P>My contribution has been largely critical, but I do not want it to be regarded as not being constructive.  All I am trying to do is to point out some matters requiring attention.  I am confident that the Minister has the ability and enthusiasm to deal with these problems.  I only hope he has beaten me to it by starting his plans along the lines I have suggested without waiting for me to make the suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already done quite an amount of good work, and I wish to compliment him on the new grant scheme and the improved Housing Bill he is to introduce.As a representative of the Sligo-Leitrim constituency, I feel something should be done for the people of a constituency such as that with very little industry.  In fact, in my own <Col N="1069" /> county of Leitrim, we have no industry at all.  A through survey of the county was made by the health inspectors, and we discovered there were still hundreds of houses not fit for human occupation.  The Minister should endeavour by all means possible to provide money for those people who cannot avail of the grants and have no means of providing houses for themselves.A circular was sent down from the Department requesting that a survey be made and information supplied.  I have attended regional meetings during the period of office of three county secretaries in my county; yet I regret to say nothing has been done.  The county manager and county engineer are working very hard to have a start made.  After the experience we had last winter, the sooner that start is made and the sooner houses are provided for those unable to provide them for themselves, the better for everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>No houses have been erected in the county except by way of grant over the past few years.  That is very unfair.We are giving decent grants. Years ago, houses were always provided for people who could not provide them for themselves.  Delay is experienced in getting inspectors to come out and there is further delay in getting the grants paid.  I should like the Minister to take note of that and, as far as possible, to speed matters up.  We are the people who are approached about these things.  I had a case of a man who was waiting six months for his grant, even though the job had been inspected and a report made.  They should speed up the matter as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sligo town is anxiously awaiting the provision of houses for married couples because there is a good waiting list. Young married people who are brought in by the father or mother find that when the parent dies, an order is served on them to get out because they are not legal tenants.  It is very unfair that a young man and his wife, perhaps the daughter of the house and her husband, must leave the one home they have when the parent dies and look elsewhere for a house which may be hard to find.  I <Col N="1070" /> would like the Minister to speed up housing for the many people who approach me and my colleagues.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is of much importance in Sligo and Leitrim is the question of allowing a grant for a galvanised or asbestos roof.  For some years, those types of roof were eligible for a grant and I agree the Minister did not clamp down quickly on them but people in backward areas do not always see notices in the paper.  I am satisfied some went ahead and did really good jobs and discovered then they were not eligible.  In my own county, there would be 12 or 14 such cases and I should be very grateful if the Minister would consider giving them a grant because they are in their present position through no fault of their own.  They did a good job and are unable to bear the disappointment of having to do without a grant.</P>
    <P>Under a new scheme that is mooted, houses will be provided for deserving cases in County Sligo.  Some have already been put up and it is the intention of the Department and local authorities to erect them convenient to the road and not on the farm if the farm is in any way backward.  That is very disappointing to some of the farming community.  It may be a case of an aged brother and sister or an aged married couple and they do not like to leave their old surroundings for a more central place.  For that reason, if the local authority with a substantial grant from the Department can erect houses in a central position, I think it would be cheaper for the Minister to agree to a grant for both asbestos and galvanised roofs than to spend about £1,400 for a modern type house that might also be vacant when the aged people pass away.  The job could be done very cheaply if the people were given enticement to do it themselves.  Being a Donegal man, the Minister knows of these homes and knows when some of the people die out, the houses will never be occupied again.  I am sure he would agree, if he were speaking personally to them, that a galvanised or asbestos house would satisfy them and would be much cheaper than the £1,400 house which might become vacant at a later date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> We have many districts really parched for water when there is any drought.  At our last council meeting, the highest tributes were paid to two health inspectors who carried out a most thorough water survey of the area.  I suggest a water supply should first be provided for areas that are most in need.  The survey brought in areas that have a plentiful supply of water.  That was part of the scheme, to make a complete survey to ascertain the position but areas most in need should get priority and we could then proceed to the others.  About four years ago in my own area, we produced a scheme.  We believe it is sanctioned and has now only to come back to the county council.  We trust that will happen in the near future so that the work may begin.  It is known as the Five-Mile-Burn water scheme.</P>
    <P>Twice recently people from Carraroe, about two miles from Sligo, approached me.  They have been for years without water and are most anxious that a group of farmers there should be considered immediately and a water supply provided for them.</P>
    <P>I can only repeat what has already been said about roads because what applies elsewhere applies also to my county.  We have huge road schemes but the county roads are not getting the same amount of money as is spent on main roads.  By-roads are almost completely neglected.  The main road schemes are too elaborate.  This business of miles of concrete posts and netting wire and gates is, I think, not necessary.  Less would do and this would make it possible to carry out more work on the county roads.  When the county roads are done, then get on with the job and do a thorough job on the main roads.</P>
    <P>We still have groups of really good farmers&mdash;thanks be to God that we have&mdash;and they are living on roads to which very little attention is being given.  They are watching thousands upon thousands of pounds being spent on road schemes being carried out everywhere, on the schemes that have been mentioned here today, while their roads are neglected.  We have a number of people coming back from <Col N="1072" /> England, from Dublin, and elsewhere, and they are very disappointed when they discover no attempt is being made to do any work on the roads which lead to the home.  A tarred road leading to the door adds considerably to the value of the farm, be it a big or a small farm.  I would appeal to the Minister to give local authorities greater grants for a few years until the county roads are done.  When they are done, he can go ahead on the main roads.</P>
    <P>From Manorhamilton down into Blacklion, we have a road that was not always heavily taxed with traffic. The railway saved it.  Since the Sligo-Leitrim and Northern Counties railway closed down some years ago, that road has been carrying a huge volume of traffic, with the result that it is now in a most dangerous state of disrepair.  A bigger grant should be given to a road of that sort.  Work should be proceeded with immediately on that road because of the increased volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>By-roads need to be looked after, but before I deal with them, I should like to say that there should be some understanding between the Forestry Division and the county council from the point of view of keeping the roads used by the Forestry Division in a better condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the main roads really which are in an impossible condition because the Forestry Division are using them and are doing very little about keeping them in repair.  I shall not pursue the matter further, but that is the position. Complaints are being made to me about the condition of the roads, a condition caused by the heavy forestry machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, as I said, the huge machinery that is brought in results in manpower being thrown idle.  There is nothing left for that manpower except emigration to England, or elsewhere.If less machinery were used, more work would be available.  In a <Col N="1073" /> constituency like mine, small farmers hope to get some portion of the work on the road schemes during the winter to tide them over and supplement their incomes from the small farms.  Married or single, men need this employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the formation of this State, great credit is due to the various Ministers for Local Government, as well as to the Department, for the extraordinary improvements that have been carried out down through the years.  Returning emigrants are loud in praise of the large mileage of high-class roads and the large number of excellent houses that have been erected since they emigrated from this country many years ago.  Despite all the improvements, however, the work is still far from being finished but I pay tribute to the various Ministers for the part they have played and, in particular, the present Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>The three principal operations are housing, roads, water and sewerage.  I am pleased to note that the Minister and the Government intend to introduce new housing legislation which will make larger grants available for certain types of applicants.  Housing the small farmer is a particularly complex problem and the provisions embodied in the new Bill will be, from what we have been told, a step in the right direction towards solving that problem.</P>
      <P>I have little criticism to make in regard to applicants for houses in rural areas.  For a long number of years, I have been a member of a local authority in a rural district.  When it comes to formulating a housing scheme, a survey is taken.  I regret to say that very often the single men are turned down.  Only with great difficulty can one get the managers to accept these applicants, even in cases where there are other members of the family dependent on them.  I wish the Minister, through his Department, would drop a very strong hint to our managerial authorities to give even some hope to the single man who is inclined to settle down in this country and who, very often, because the local authority will not accept him for a housing scheme, has to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> As I said, large numbers of these houses have been built.  The work, of course, is not finished, but, as far as this world is concerned, I suppose the only real finish is when we are finished with life.  So long as mankind remains in the world, there is bound to be more work to do, no matter what effort is put into work.</P>
    <P>Criticism is made of road improvements.I think the Minister and his Department are making a good attempt to grapple with the problem. I do not agree that we should slacken our work on the improvement of our main roads.  They are daily becoming our chief arteries of transport and cannot be built up in a few weeks or a few years.  It will be a long time before we have the country adequately covered in this respect.  There are, of course, in my county still minor roads not rolled or tarred but everybody in the county is satisfied with the present progress and realises it is only a matter of time until the problem is solved in County Cork.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of water supplies, a most essential amenity in town and country.  I had the humiliation of seeing men parading in protest against the provision of a water supply.  I pitied those whose standard of intelligence was so low.  Water supply and sewerage schemes have contributed to a large degree to the elimination of a good many diseases, particularly the fevers.  I can still remember, though a bit old in years, the time when certain villages and towns in my county were hotbeds and breeding grounds of fevers.  We had fever hospitals throughout the county but now, as far as I know, thank God, we have no patients for those hospitals.  I attribute that to the fact that our people have a very good water supply, proper sanitary accommodation, better housing and better food.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his efforts to see that water will be on tap in every house in the country.  Apart altogether from human considerations, a water supply is very essential in our dairying districts because it is necessary to keep our cattle as well as our human beings free from disease.  The <Col N="1075" /> Department, as well, are now interesting themselves in group schemes.  I welcome that, but I am not quite satisfied with the co-operation and co-ordination between the local authorities and these groups.  This is a matter that deserves special consideration, which should be examined minutely by the Minister's officials so that encouragement can be given to those who are inclined, from their own resources, to provide themselves with water supplies.</P>
    <P>In the North Cork housing and sanitary district, we have a big drive at the moment for a water supply to cover the entire area.  It has been a planned drive over a number of years.  It will be some time before every district can have its supply but I must compliment the local authority engineers on the way they have drafted the regional schemes, without which there would be thousands of people in the area without a decent water supply.  I have no more to say, having dealt with the principal items that came to my mind, but as far as the Department's work is concerned on housing, roads, water and sewerage schemes, I wish them God speed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has dragged out over many days and I do not want to protract it further.  Primarily, as a Dublin Deputy, I wish to add my protest to the others made from these benches in respect of the appalling state of affairs which has developed in regard to housing in Dublin city, a state of affairs in which there are 10,000 people on the waiting list, people who have been evacuated from houses falling down around them; a state of affairs which, by deliberate action of Fianna Fáil, has been allowed to develop; a state of affairs which is primarily due to the financial policy laid down in the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which postulated that we already had an ample infra-structure of housing and social amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of that economic doctrine, we have had over the past five years a considerable decline in expenditure of State moneys on housing in Dublin and an appalling failure to <Col N="1076" /> meet the housing needs of the citizens; we have had a tremendous tapering off in housebuilding between 1957 and 1962.  The assumption in that programme that we have an adequate infra-structure of housing, hospitals and other social amenities established a completely false scale of priorities. There is little money for housebuilding in Dublin but plenty of money for intercontinental hotels and for palatial offices for State companies.  There is plenty of money for all sorts of extravagant schemes.  There is plenty of money for Mr. Verolme and Mr. Flatley but very little money for housebuilding in the city of Dublin.  That is the state of affairs which the Minister has deliberately allowed to develop by the policy which he has applied.</P>
    <P>If we had listened to the economists 40 years ago, we would never even have commenced the slum clearance programme.  Housing and social expenditure, they said, is deadweight debt, the concept laid down in the report of the Banking Commission in 1938 which has been the keystone of Fianna Fáil financial policy: housing does not yield a short-term cash profit; therefore it is not as desirable a form of investment as are grants to industry and agriculture, grants in too many cases to persons like Mr. Flatley and Mr. Verolme.</P>
    <P>The same concept is represented quite recently in the latest report of the Central Bank.  As Deputy Booth said here it is for the Minister to tell the experts what to do.  It is not for them to lay down what State policy should be in this respect.  What a shocking tragedy it is that we have allowed so much time to pass, that we have allowed building costs to increase at such a tremendous rate without providing ourselves with adequate housing at a time when costs were so much lower.  The same can be applied to the school building programme though I do not wish to go into that at this stage.</P>
    <P>However, I do wish to impress upon the Minister that building costs are skyrocketing monthly, that it costs twice as much money to erect a block of flats to-day as it did ten years ago. That, to my mind, is a major tragedy, <Col N="1077" /> that so many opportunities have been missed because the economists told us not to proceed with social investments, that it is not productive expenditure, that it does not yield a short-term cash profit.  This concept of deadweight debt so called should be cast aside once and for all.</P>
    <P>There is an appalling position in regard to housing in Dublin city at present.  So much has been said about it here in the past few weeks that I do not wish to detain the House unduly by repeating the sorry story at length. There are 10,000 people on the waiting list.  There are very many people in condemned dwellings who cannot be housed because of the position which has developed in regard to houses which deliberately have been permitted to deteriorate to such an extent that they are falling down around the people and we have had the tragic deaths of four persons.</P>
    <P>The aspect of the housing problem which, to my mind, was the most serious before the development of the position which arose last year was the plight of the young married people who are sub-tenants of their parents in Corporation houses.  In that connection I think it worthwhile to draw the attention of the House to the very obvious paradox to be seen in regard to the slum clearance scheme.  Twenty years ago when a young working man was getting married, he could usually find himself a tenement room.  It may have been inadequate and unpleasant but a young man who spent a few nights walking around the tenement quarters of Dublin could easily find himself a room at 7/6d. or 5/- a week which at least provided a roof over his head and enabled him to get married and to provide his bride with that privacy which young married people value so very much.</P>
    <P>In our housing policy we have not taken account of the absence of those abodes for young people wishing to get married.  The pattern which has developed over the past 20 years is that if a working man's son is getting married he usually fails in his attempt to find housing for himself and is compelled to bring his bride into his parents' home or, conversely, in many <Col N="1078" /> cases the bride brings her husband into her family home.  Everything is plain sailing for a year or so until the first baby arrives or perhaps the second baby, and it becomes apparent after two or three years that what was intended to be a temporary arrangement has become a semi-permanent one. Then perhaps another member of the same family wants to get married and feels he is entitled to the same chance as was offered to his older brother or sister.  In too many cases the sorry position develops where the wife has to return to her mother, perhaps bringing the children with her, and the husband, because of the overcrowding position which has developed in both family homes, remains with his parents.</P>
    <P>I have always understood&mdash;and I would like the Minister to correct me if I am wrong because housing finance is a rather complex matter&mdash;that the reason why the Dublin Corporation were so reluctant to house these young married people with one or two or perhaps three children, no longer newly-weds and no longer eligible for the lottery held by the Dublin Corporation every year which houses a small percentage of those deserving to be housed, is that subtenants of Corporation houses, even if they are sons or daughters, do not qualify for the full rate of State subsidy, and I believe that state of affairs still applies.  I believe that the full subsidy of two-thirds is available in such cases only if the income of the applicant is £5 10s. per week with an addition of 10/- for each child.  Until such time as the Minister changes his policy in regard to this question of subtenants, the problem will continue to exist.  It is a very serious problem and one which has serious social and indeed moral aspects.  It is a problem which leads to much frustration and unrest, a problem which should not exist at this stage of our development and I would urge the Minister to address himself to it.</P>
    <P>I undertook not to detain the House at length and while there is much I should like to say on the housing problem, most of it has been said already by other speakers and I do not wish to <Col N="1079" /> repeat it.  Deputy Booth had a lot to say about traffic problems in Dublin city and elsewhere.  In last night's <i>Evening Herald,</i> it was reported that at present there are being carried out in Dublin city ten major schemes of road works.  I have personal knowledge and daily experience of one of those schemes which has been going on in Fitzwilliam Street for some weeks past and going on at a gloriously leisurely pace.  If the Corporation are not prepared to speed up these road schemes in the central city area, the Minister should take them to task.  In the summertime work stops at 5 o'clock when you have still six hours of the long summer evenings left to do the work.  In most English cities, and I believe even in Belfast, major road schemes are proceeded with over the weekends.  I am not saying that that should or should not be done. Perhaps in certain circumstances it should but it is clear that Dublin Corporation are quite unconcerned about the problems of traffic congestion which their road schemes cause.</P>
    <P>Again, as Deputy Booth and other speakers said, much improvement in the traffic congestion situation could be effected if there were a tunnel under the Liffey or a bridge over the river to the east of O'Connell Bridge.  Such a bridge was mooted as far back as 15 or 20 years and there was squabbling between Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Port and Docks Board as to who should make the first move. I do not know if the Minister has been able to resolve the <i>impasse</i> but I feel he should step in.  We must not blame the Corporation entirely for inactivity because again we are up against a financial problem.  Dublin contributes very considerable sums to the Road Fund and because the Road Fund is administered on a mileage basis, calculated with reference mostly to main roads, the contribution paid by the Department to the Corporation for road schemes is entirely out of proportion to the city's needs.  It is time that the basis on which that contribution is distributed was revised.  A position of serious inequity exists in that respect.</P>
    <P>Talking of a bridge over the Liffey <Col N="1080" /> leads me to the question which has been mentioned during the course of the debate of the future of the Grand Canal which serves to create a bottleneck on the southern boundaries of the central city area.  The outward movement of traffic from the city on the southern side is confined to half a dozen bridges over the canal.  At least this much can be said in favour of closing the canal, that it would open up many new outlets and considerably ease the traffic problem.  At present traffic proceeding southwards from the city centre is confined to four major arteries over the Grand Canal.  That is not to say that it is necessarily the right thing to close the Grand Canal.</P>
    <P>I must confess I take a very narrow view of the problem, the view of the Dublin ratepayer.  The Grand Canal is not being maintained by CIE and if it is to be foisted on to the Dublin Corporation, who do not want it and certainly do not want the responsibility of maintaining it at considerable expense to the Dublin ratepayers, I for one will object.  The Dublin ratepayers are already loaded with enough charges which should be levied on the Exchequer at large.  Perhaps the Minister will avail of this opportunity to tell us what are his intentions in regard to the Grand Canal for it is perfectly clear that CIE have no intentions whatever in regard to it.  They are not maintaining it; they are not even railing it off in those parts where children have fallen in and have been drowned. It would be gravely wrong if the citizens of Dublin who contribute so much to the subsidisation of CIE losses were to be compelled, willynilly, to accept responsibility for the maintenance of the canal in the city area.</P>
    <P>One further point I want to mention is in relation to Small Dwellings Act loans.  In my constituency where a lot of housing has been going on, much of it under the Small Dwellings Acts, I have had several complaints about defects appearing in houses after they have been occupied.  I would urge the Minister to see to it that builders who benefit from the operation of these Acts are subjected to scrutiny and that they are informed that as high a standard of building is expected of <Col N="1081" /> them as the Dublin Corporation apply to their own schemes, and that is a high standard.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it seems to me to be the case that, in respect of some of the private schemes financed under the Small Dwellings Act, the high standard of material and of workmanship normally adhered to by the Corporation, in its own schemes, has not been implemented by private builders.  The Minister's security for the loans and the Corporation's security is, to that extent, diminished and I think it is time the Minister checked up on the methods of scrutiny which are applied in these cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, at the outset, like to compliment the Minister on the great work he and his Department are doing at the moment, and particularly himself, for the progressive and modern outlook he has generated in the Department and particularly throughout the country.  I think the demand for a modern standard of housing which exists throughout rural areas today is indeed a compliment to the work he is doing.</P>
      <P>In County Kerry, our people are looking for the fully-serviced houses, modern to the maximum detail, a position which did not exist even five years ago.  The housing of our people is fairly well in hand.  A greater number of our smallholders and farmers have taken up their own housing programme, both in new houses and reconstructed houses.  We have, however, at the moment, 520 condemned houses which have to be replaced within the next two years, and I am asking the Minister's help particularly in certain aspects of these cases.  At a housing meeting of the Kerry County Council on Monday we were trying to devise a programme whereby we could write off those 520 houses in two years but we have been informed that there is a shortage of engineering staff and it is next to impossible to get extra staff.  Some of our engineers have even left the county during the week to take up better positions and this is affecting our road building, our water schemes and particularly our housing programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> We think the Minister's Department could short circuit a lot of the regulations which are hampering us.  We find, for instance, first of all, our medical staff have to examine a site for a rural house or cottage.  It then has to be inspected by our engineers and eventually submitted to the Department.  In some cases his engineers have to inspect the site.  This entails two or three visits of our engineering staff to some of those sites.  It is particularly obvious that all this is not necessary where a small farmer or a person building his own house is concerned.  One visit by the Minister's inspector could deal with the whole problem and we would like to have something on those lines developed to help us to get the maximum number of sites available in County Kerry at present.</P>
    <P>We hope to reconstruct some of the 520 houses but we must build over 400 new houses and it is urgently necessary to get rid of the condemned dwellings in two years.  We think with the housing development programme which is taking place in County Kerry we are likely to have a lot of younger people, who will find industrial employment, looking for re-housing from two years onwards.  We are trying to get rid of the back-log in order to keep our programme going forward. As stated, the Minister can be of tremendous help to us if he can get some of the regulations, which are hampering us, slashed to enable us to get at those sites the simplest way possible.</P>
    <P>Our ordinary housing programme is proceeding according to plan and we have not any terrific difficulties where individual applications are concerned.They seem to be coming out of the Department quickly and we have nothing to complain about.</P>
    <P>Turning to the road programme, we have immense road construction work going on in the county at the moment but I think the position which seemed to develop about three or four years back should be reversed.  That was where the tourist grant was devoted to the construction of our main roads. That grant, some years back, was responsible for immensely, valuable work in the mountainy regions for the <Col N="1083" /> progress of our tourist industry in County Kerry.  Several new roads could be constructed through the most scenic parts of Kerry, in particular the road from Brandon Point to Brandon Creek, which would open up the north side of the Dingle Peninsula and bring tourists to one of the most beautiful scenes on the west coast.  We have, in addition, the sea coast from Portmagee to the Glen which would open up a further scenic vista.  We have the Black Valley over the site of Carrantuohill into Glencar opening up a vast mountain range there.  Lastly, we have Valentia Bridge, which would open up Valentia Island to our tourists.  This would be of immense value to our tourists and certainly to our economic position in County Kerry.  We believe we have a big influx of people who are interested in building houses or holiday chalets along our scenic coast. Possibly some of them may come to live permanently with us.  This would be of immense help in regard to the valuation position in the county and would help the rates particularly.  In addition, such people would use up local materials and, in certain cases, give much needed employment.  I think the tourist road grant should be channelled into those mountain areas as they were applied in the very early stages.  I would ask the Minister to do his best, in the coming year, to make a start in that direction in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>There is a strong feeling throughout the country that the new traffic signs, which in many cases are hundreds of yards outside the nearest built-up part of towns or villages, should be located nearer the towns or villages.  In the town of Killorglin&mdash;my own town&mdash;there are two signs practically up against the built-up part of the town and they seem to do a very good job.  This would cut out a lot of the dissatisfaction which motorists find coming in on straight stretches into towns where they have to cut down speed at a time when it is not really necesary. I think the Minister should have the position re-examined for the purpose of getting the traffic signs brought closer into the towns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> The water schemes in my county seem to be making progress in a very big way.  We have a big part of the county supplied at the moment, particularly the poorer area from Dingle Peninsula to Rathlin Point.  We have already supplied an extensive part of North Kerry and a good part of East Kerry.  We hope inside five years to have the county completely supplied.  We are grateful for the introduction of this scheme which has played such an important part in developing a progressive outlook in Kerry.  We hope to see a new type of tourism developing there, that tourists will be taken into the ordinary rural houses.  The installation of water and sewerage, which has been carried out in a very big way in the coastal areas, is helping in that direction.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to one particular type of people who are affected by the position in regard to rateable valuation in many small towns and villages.  I refer to the small shopkeepers whose valuations may be anything from £10 to £20.  In Kerry, where the rate is over £3 in the £, such a person is faced with an exorbitant rate which he is finding it very difficult to meet.  Many such people come to me seeking time to pay or a reduction of the rates, which in some cases has to be given. A scheme should be brought in to deal with this matter.  These people are really up against it.  People purchase goods from the chain shops and selfservice stores, where they can buy them cheaper than from the ordinary wholesale channels.  This is an indication of what the ordinary shopkeeper has to put up with in trying to sell the little he does sell.  He can sell only the odd article which it does not pay the customer to go a long distance to the larger shops to buy.</P>
    <P>Many small shopkeepers are not earning £3 or £4 a week for themselves.The rates represent a very big burden on them.  The Government should consider giving them some relief of rates in future.  They are the hardest hit section of the community. They do not qualify for the full house reconstruction grant; they get only one-third.In many cases they have big old <Col N="1085" /> houses which are practically incapable of repair.  They are trying to keep going from day to day.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, in the near future, to bring in regulations whereby such persons would be helped to meet the obligations which are a crushing burden on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly, this is a very important Estimate.  Every aspect of local government has been referred to and more Deputies have contributed to the debate this year than ever before.</P>
      <P>Deputies on all sides of the House welcome the speed limits imposed in towns and cities.  There are built-up areas where speed limit signs have not been erected.  I have been unable to discover the reason far that.  There are certain built-up areas in my constituency where no speed limit sign has been erected.  I understand that it is a matter for the inspectors of the Department of Local Government in consultation with the Garda Síochána and the local authority engineers to select the cities for speed limit signs.  I trust that when the matter comes up for review at the end of twelve months speed limit signs will be erected in villages and towns where they have been recommended to the local authorities in order to protect pedestrians and children attending national, secondary and vocational schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice when travelling to Dublin, that either in Kilbeggan or Moate&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;the speed limit signs are hidden by branches of trees. The Minister should ask local authorities <Col N="1086" /> to ensure that the signs will be clearly visible to drivers on the road.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that there should be a 12 inch-wide line painted across the road where a speed limit sign is erected. It is very easy to pass a speed limit sign without noticing it.  A yellow line across the road would warn motorists of the fact that they were approaching a speed limit zone.</P>
    <P>I listened to a Deputy from the Fine Gael benches from my own constituency referring to derelict graveyards. I am sorry he is not here now to listen to me but I am sure my words will be conveyed to him.  It is a pity that he would not cast his mind back to the last estimates meeting of the local authority of which he and I are members.  He would recall that a certain sum of money was agreed to by the local authority for the purpose of cleaning up graveyards and that a start has been made.  I regret that the Deputy thought fit to raise the matter in this House.</P>
    <P>The clearing of derelict sites is a matter of urgency.  The Minister is to be congratulated for making grants available.  There are many derelict sites in large cities the owners of which are not known.  They represent a danger to the public.  The Minister should recommend to local authorities that they should be cleared.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7th November, 1963.</P>
