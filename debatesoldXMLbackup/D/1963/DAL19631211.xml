      <P>On the Order of Business, with the permission of the Chair, I should like to raise the following matter in view of the fact that the Minister for Local Government refused to accept responsibility for it yesterday. I refer to the grave unemployment and serious hardship to many farmers brought about by the closing down of quarries and the use of up-to-date machinery on road works in County Roscommon and the urgent necessity to provide alternative employment for these workers and small farmers who are being deprived of what hitherto represented an essential and substantial part of their income.</P>

      <P>a copy of which Order in draft has been laid before the House.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Justice explained to the House on the Second Stage of the Funds of Suitors Bill, the aid proposed towards the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House is being made available in two ways, by a grant from the Funds of Suitors and by a guaranteed loan.  I presume there was a full discussion on the Cork Opera House on that occasion and for that reason I do not think it is essential for me to give any great detail.  The Funds of Suitors Bill has been passed by the Dáil and it has now gone on to the Seanad for discussion.  The first is covered by the Funds of Suitors Bill which has already come before the House.  It is proposed to provide the second by adding the Cork Opera House Company, Limited, to the bodies scheduled to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, with a maximum amount of £50,000 to be guaranteed and the draft order before you for approval will implement that intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any other Stock Exchange at present registered under the third definition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no other Irish Stock Exchange registered but it will probably be necessary to add stock exchanges to the list where further transactions will take place.  I do not know whether it will be necessary, for instance, to register the London Stock Exchange if a transfer is taking place from here.  It probably will be necessary here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the point because of the double taxation arrangements.  However, as it is at present, I think a form of transfer executed in this country could be stamped here even though it referred to an English company but would it be in order to operate it here unless any stock exchange, wheresoever situate, was named?  Is it not the execution of the transfer rather than the place at which the dealing is made which would bind the form of transfer?  We obviously want to get as many transfers as possible stamped in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is right that the point is where the exchange is executed.  Therefore, I think it will be necessary to add many Stock Exchanges to the list.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that subsection (4) of section 2 has a different form of wording from the wording used in the Act across the water.  There they decided to list the various securities involved.  Here it is done by a general method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite clear about the part of this section which says &ldquo;Registered securities of any description&rdquo;.  Is it permissible for a person to register, apart from inscribing, National Loan? Is it a registered security when National Loan is transferable by deed rather than by normal letter of attorney?  The Minister will note that he has expressly <Col N="938" /> excluded guarantee companies and I would like to know does the word &ldquo;securities&rdquo; cover Government loan and local loans or is it merely restricted to securities of one sort or another issued by a company?  If it covers Government loan there is another point which I shall deal with later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that this section is wider in its application than the corresponding clause in the British Act.  This section provides for a general list, not a specified list as they have done it.  It applies to any registered stock or security and would cover National Loan and local issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there something in the appropriate Acts setting up National Loans expressly to exclude inscribed stocks from the definition of registered stocks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are inscribed in the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought and if they are registered, the effect of this Bill is that they cannot be transferred by letter of attorney as they are at present.  I admit that I deliberately put my questions in that manner because I wanted to be quite clear on the whole thing.  If inscribed stocks are also registered stocks, the existing practice of transferring inscribed stocks by letter of attorney will not be operative.  If registered stocks also cover inscribed stocks, an exception will have to be put in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is permissive.  It probably would not apply to inscribed stocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, line 11, to insert &ldquo;(including the Companies Act, 1963)&rdquo; after &ldquo;enactment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had some little discussion on this matter yesterday but we find it necessary to take action in the form of this amendment because of the trouble that arose through these two Bill going through the House at the same time.  If the Companies Bill had become law before this Bill then this amendment would not have been necessary because the appropriate section says that it will apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment or instrument.  The Companies Bill is not an enactment at the moment and there might be some doubt as to whether this would apply retrospectively.  For this reason it was considered by my legal advisers that this amendment was necessary.  If the Companies Bill had become an Act, then this Bill would apply without amendment.  It would mean that the provision in the Companies Bill would be overridden but this amendment should go some way to cover the objections raised by Deputy Sweetman yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it will not go any way at all.  The enactment of this measure, which is desirable as such, and the enactment yesterday of the Companies Bill was indicative of very bad administrative machinery. The Companies Bill was supposed to be a consolidated measure which was supposed to be the Bible of Company law from the date of its passing and the ink was not even dry on it when it has had to be amended in a very slipshod fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real difficulty in dealing with the matter now is that any amendment we may introduce in this Bill is not the amendment that is required. <Col N="940" /> What was required was that there should have been an amendment in the Companies Bill because it was in that Bill that we wanted to enshrine the law in relation to stock transfers. The Minister will find that in the Companies Bill, in page 94, it states that the instrument of transfer is to be signed by the transferee as well as the transferor.  This Bill amends that as it provides that the instrument of transfer need not be accepted by the transferee. This is doing things in an extremely slipshod way and in a manner which is quite unnecessary.  With the exception of subsection (4) of section 2 this Bill is an exact copy of the Bill that was enacted on 28th October last on the other side.</P>
    <P>It is being done now because the Companies Bill finished in this House yesterday and was in the Seanad before this Bill was circulated.  It is a great pity that because the means of communication between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance broke down, this slipshod method was adopted and what was intended to be a first-class consolidation measure is not a consolidation measure any more.</P>
    <P>One of the faults attributed to me is not that of not speaking sufficiently loudly, but I notice in at least two newspapers this morning, I am quoted as having said that it is desirable to have different systems working side by side here and on the other side of the water.  What I said, of course, was that it is not desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes a big difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  Three little letters make quite a substantial difference. But it could happen to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No great tribute to the noise box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The noise box is just a noise.  It is not a method of loudspeaking.  The only person I can ever hear out of the noise box is the Ceann Comhairle.  The Minister is not noted certainly for speaking as loudly as I do, except when he is making a political reply to a debate, <Col N="941" /> but the Minister is far less intelligible from the noise box than he is in his normal voice.  While we are up for Christmas, I hope someone will ensure that this yoke, as I have described it before, will operate more kindly to the Minister and to certain other people.</P>
      <P>It is just within the bounds of possibility that this method of stock transfers, having started only very recently elsewhere, may require some amendment in the future.  If it is to be amended in the future, I would urge the Minister to introduce any such amendment not by means of a separate Stock Transfer Bill <i>per se,</i> which is being taken over by him, because of the obvious revenue needs in relation to it, but rather that it should be done by a proper amendment of the Companies Bill.  In that way, the consolation that was effected in relation to company legislation would be kept moving on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly consider that, though I am not so sure that company legislation covers everything. There are stocks&mdash;the Deputy has the advantage of me here because he is a legal man&mdash;that do not come from a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Definitely.  I would rather see it done by two Bills then, one stock company Bill and one transfer Bill, so that companies legislation would be a code in itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Section 3, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us a little more clearly why this is necessary as a revenue safeguard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fairly obvious, I <Col N="942" /> think, that if a form is sent to a person with a transfer order signature on it and the transferee holds it, and subsequently decides to make a further sale before filling in the transfer, then the new transferee may be put in and the Revenue are deprived, of course, of at least one stamp duty on the transfer.  They get only one instead of two.  It is designed entirely to safeguard the Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but a difficulty does arise.  The Minister may or may not be aware&mdash;his advisers will be because it is entirely a technical matter&mdash;that one of the methods adopted for cheap security is that a person borrows something on the security of shares; it is only going to be a very temporary borrowing and the person concerned does not, therefore, want the shares registered in the name of the nominee.  The share certificate is delivered, plus a blank transfer duly executed by the stockholder. I am afraid this will be illegal now and, if it will be illegal, I should like to know where the safeguard is because I think the Minister will agree with me it would be undesirable to abolish that cheap form of security.  It is a regular system adopted.  The share certificate is handed over.  The transfer is handed over.  The transfer itself is not dated.  If the loan is paid off in a matter of months, then the blank transfer is just torn up and the share certificate handed back.</P>
      <P>It may be that there is a difference between the phraseology where a transfer in blank has been delivered and a blank transfer.  I do not know. Section 2 says transfer in blank means a transfer on which the name of the transferee has not been inserted.  The name is never inserted in these cases and it is quite undesirable, I think the Minister will agree readily, that the form of equitable mortgage of share-holding should be destroyed and that the cheap method available at present should not be left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point raised by the Deputy but, first of all, it starts off by referring to a delivery pursuant to a sale of these securities. That is in the second line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as that, if the bank holds the blank transfer, and does not make any attempt to issue it, there is, I think, no offence.</P>

      <P>Another way of dealing with it might be to use the existing forms.  This prohibition may apply only to this particular type of form and if we can go on using the old forms for the blank transfer, that may get over any difficulty.</P>

      <P>On the Final Stage, in connection with the point raised by Deputy Sweetman that this Bill operates in effect to amend the Consolidation Bill sponsored by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, namely, the Companies Act, I attach great importance to Deputy Sweetman's point.  The House will remember I was responsible for the first Consolidation Act introduced here under the special consolidation machinery we evolved for that purpose.  I refer to the Fisheries Consolidation Act.  The Minister will agree, I think, that where we seek to consolidate a branch of law in one consolidating Act, rightly seeking in doing so to create the impression generally that all the law relating to, say, companies is to be found in one instrument of this House, it would be a pity if, having passed a Consolidation Act, it subsequently transpired that, in fact, important details were subsequently enacted in another Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Companies Bill runs to 282 pages.  Under our procedure we must now get that Bill translated and, having done so, it must be published in the white form as an Act of the Oireachtas.  I wonder is there any procedure we could devise to ensure that, before the whole laborious procedure of translating and printing the Bill in its white form is gone through, we could not incorporate in it by way of amendment whatever material of the Stock Transfer Bill is relevant to it and rapidly put the whole thing through the consolidation procedure; and, before taking all the trouble of translating and printing it in permanent form, present a new consolidated Companies Bill which would include the amendments envisaged in the Stock Transfer Bill?  The Minister will recall there is a special procedure about it. You do not go through the whole process of re-enacting the new Bill section by section.  It goes before a special committee with a certificate from the Attorney General that this Bill does not operate to change the existing law; it sails through a joint committee of Dáil and Seanad and emerges as a consolidated Bill. Perhaps the Minister would consider <Col N="945" /> that suggestion with a view to avoiding duplication, delay and expense.  It may not be practicable; but if it is, it might be worth considering before we proceed to translate and publish the Companies Bill in its final text as an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall bring that matter before the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see what he might think about it.  I am sure he would very much like to maintain his consolidated Bill and that, <i>a priori,</i> he would be anxious to do something like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,757 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for certain Miscellaneous Expenses, including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>As this is the first occasion on which a Supplementary Estimate for this purpose is being introduced, I feel I should give some details of what I consider to be the necessity for this Estimate.  It is required to enable a grant-in-aid of £1,757 to be paid to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  It is the first time that State aid is being given directly to the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The society has, since its inception, been doing social work of considerable value to the community.  Its inspectors &mdash;18 in number&mdash;secure in appropriate <Col N="946" /> circumstances the committal to suitable institutions of children who have been ill-treated, deserted or abandoned and of the children of unmarried mothers. Not only does the society seek to prevent cruelty and neglect and to afford relief when they occur, it also&mdash;and it is on this that the society itself lays greatest weight&mdash;tries to achieve greater harmony and stability in families threatened with a break-up.  Its work involves helping the whole family, not only the children, and through well-timed and tactful intervention its inspectors are often able to help in effecting reconciliation even in cases where all hope would seem lost. Material assistance is also provided on occasion to families in need.  Much of the society's work is of a type which could not be carried out by the Gardaí without court proceedings and the consequent undesirable publicity which would have the effect of prejudicing the re-establishment of harmonious relations within the home.</P>
    <P>The society is a voluntary organisation dependent to a large degree on the unpaid efforts of its members and relying for its funds on the charity of the public.  In the last two years, its financial position has deteriorated to the point where the society may be forced to curtail its activities.  This would be a regrettable matter for the community, especially as the society itself is anxious to extend its beneficial work, not hitherto served by its inspectors.</P>
    <P>It can be reasonably urged, therefore, that the State should make a direct contribution to the society's work.  Hitherto the health authorities have made small contributions&mdash; amounting in all to about £700 to £800 &mdash;one-half of which is recouped by the Exchequer.  As the health element of the society's work is considerably less than the general social content, it would not be appropriate to increase these grants.</P>
    <P>It has been decided, therefore, to make an annual State grant on the basis of £1 for every £1 of current yearly income, net, received by the society, subject to a maximum of £5,000.  From discussions with the society, I understand that gives them <Col N="947" /> the amount they require at the moment.  In reckoning net current income, donations, legacies and the State grant itself would not be taken into account.  As well as having an incentive to develop its activities and add to its subscribers, the society will, with the help of the State grant, be enabled to put its finances on a better foundation and to expand its activities to the advantage of the community, especially those weakest members&mdash; the neglected or abandoned children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in the House&mdash;and certainly we in this Party &mdash;will accept and endorse wholeheartedly any tribute that can be paid anywhere to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  The work they have done has been quite invaluable and has meant that many children have been enabled to grow to maturity in circumstances and in an atmosphere which otherwise would have been quite impossible.  Anything that can possibly be done to assist them is well worth while.  The method of providing means by which societies of this sort, which it is desirable to support, are encouraged to help themselves by a system of giving grants commensurate with what they collect themselves is a good one&mdash;the £1 for £1 approach, as it is commonly known.  Certainly, no taxpayer or no one in this House would begrudge anything given to this Society to enable them to carry on and even to extend the quite invaluable work they have done for many of our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse entirely what Deputy Sweetman has said.  I am happy to think that the precedent which has made this procedure possible was established by us in the first instance when we persuaded the Department of Finance, over which Deputy Sweetman was then Minister&mdash;not without a fight, I admit&mdash;to permit the Department of Agriculture to give the Irish Countrywomen's Association a grant from State funds for their admirable work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a word about this whole problem.  I know a great many people who are engaged in the voluntary service of the Irish Society for <Col N="948" /> the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, as I have no doubt the Minister does also, and I am often awe-struck by the amount of voluntary work and anxiety they undertake in the maintenance and administration of a very valuable social service of this kind.  It is peculiarly true that the State, with the best will in the world, cannot provide the same kind of service as a voluntary organisation of this kind does in fact provide. Difficulty always arises in collecting sufficient funds to enable them to carry out their work but with the steadily rising costs of everything at the present time it becomes frightfully difficult for a voluntary body to collect enough to keep their operations going because, as we all know, if we get into the habit of subscribing a certain annual sum to a society like this or to any other beneficial organisation, the reluctance to change all your subscriptions every year is pretty strong.  Therefore, societies find it very difficult to expand their income.  On the other hand, it is unfortunately true that if they become wholly dependent on State grants, something seems to be lost in the character and quality of their work.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand the provision that the society must first raise £18,000 and that then we will make this grant at the rate of £ for each £ collected up to a limit of £5,000 over and above £18,000.  I suppose that is the result of discussions between the Minister and the society?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pretty formidable sum to collect before they can hope to get anything out of this grant at all.  I think the procedure I adopted with the Irish Countrywomen's Association was that we segregated one branch of their activity, namely, organisation.  They had a number of ladies who went around and explained the aims and objects of the Irish Countrywomen's Association to groups who sought the advice.  Their difficulty was that they had only two or three organisers because they could not afford to pay any more.  They felt, and rightly felt, that if they could explain the character of their activities more generally, the society would <Col N="949" /> spread and generate its own income. So I suggested to them that we would segregate that part of their expenses, the organisational expenses, and that the Government would give them a grant which would be sufficient to increase the number of their organisers from three to five, or some basis of that kind.  I think that worked very well and the additional publicity they were able to engage in and the dissemination of information begot a great number of new branches from which revenue flowed into headquarters which enabled them to carry on their general activities.</P>
      <P>I do not quarrel with this arrangement the Minister has entered into but I think he could assume that if this arrangement operated to deprive the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children of as much as he would wish to see them get, if he comes back to the House, or if his successor comes back to the House, and says: &ldquo;We wish to supplement the funds of this society and are prepared to adopt a different basis&rdquo;, if the basis now proposed does not operate to supplement the funds of the Society sufficiently, such approach will be very sympathetically received.  I trust the Minister will feel himself free to say that, whatever side of the House he is sitting on, he will sympathise with that approach if others submit it to the House in regard to an Estimate of this character in any future year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the basic line was fixed at a level which at the time I was discussing the matter with them would give them as much as they required at that time.  I do not remember the figures exactly.  Supposing they were taking in £20,000 at that time and wanted £22,000.  I said that for every £ they received in excess of £18,000, we would give £1 and that that would give them more, if they could get more.  They were very pleased with that type of arrangement because they felt they could try to induce their subscribers to give a little more and that every £ they would give would mean £2, which is an encouragement to subscribers also.  I quite agree with the Deputy that if <Col N="950" /> this system does not work as we thought it would, we would have to revise it, of course.  That would be always possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Wexford Gas Order, 1963, proposed to be made by the Minister for Transport and Power and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 20th day of November, 1963, under Subsection 4 of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
      <P>Gas undertakings generally operate under Special Acts which authorise them to manufacture and distribute gas in certain specified areas.  Modifications in these Special Acts required by the undertakings from time to time are made under Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920 which enables me to make by Order the required modifications.  Before an Order of this kind is made it has to be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, approve the draft Order in the form submitted or may approve it with modifications or additions.  When such approval is given I may make the Order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
      <P>The Wexford Gas Consumers Co., Ltd., have applied to me for a Special Order.  The object of the proposed Order is to enable the company to extend the present limit on their borrowing powers from £20,000 to £60,000 to facilitate the purchase of up-to-date gas manufacturing plant, to extend the limits within which the company can supply town gas and to allow the company to deal in bottled gas.</P>
      <P>Notice of the proposed Order was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a local newspaper.  Copies of the draft Order were sent to the Wexford Corporation and to the Wexford County Council and to other public bodies who might be concerned.  No objections to the proposed Order were received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers requested by the company <Col N="951" /> are no more than are necessary in order to make improvements in their gas manufacturing and distributing processes which will be required if the gas undertaking is to survive against growing competition from suppliers of other fuels.  I am satisfied as to the need for the Order and that there is nothing in it repugnant to the public interest.  I, therefore, recommend the Order for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We offer no objection to this Order and I avail of the occasion to comment on the fact that this Order is laid before the House under a relatively old procedure which requires positive endorsement by the House.  It does not seem to impose any unreasonable burden on anybody and it has the advantage that the Order is made the subject of a short explanatory statement by the Minister which is on record for anybody who wishes hereafter to inform himself.</P>
      <P>The more modern procedure of placing these Orders on the Table of Dáil Éireann so that unless they are raised in this House, they become operative is a very much less desirable procedure because many of those Orders never receive any adequate exposition at all.  I do not know whether I should commend the Minister or the old legislation which requires him to adopt this procedure but I suggest to the House that this affirmative procedure is a very much better one than that only too frequently used now, putting the Order on the Table and, unless it is raised by way of motion within 21 days, making it operative automatically.  We have no objection to this Order and so far as we are concerned, it may pass without further ado.</P>

    <P>This amendment, agreed at conciliation, to the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme brings the position of the married secondary teacher into line with that of the married woman national teacher.

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. 3), Regulations, 1963, and</P>
      <P>Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporter's Licences) Fees Regulations, 1963,</P>
      <P>copies of which were laid in draft before the Dáil on the 4th day of December, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> In requesting the approval of the House for these Regulations, copies of which, in draft, have been laid before the House, I wish to make it clear that the object of the regulations is to give effect to a request made to my Department by the trade organisations representing the meat-export industry, namely, the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters Society, the Irish Bacon Curers Society and the Beef Canners Advisory Association.  No revenue will accrue to the State by reason of the increased fees proposed, and my Department will pay over to the trade's own meat Research Institute an amount equivalent to the proceeds of the increases in the fees, plus the additional contribution being made by the State.</P>
    <P>The meat trade is setting up a research unit, whose function will be to carry out applied research into technical requirements of the meat industry here&mdash;for example, methods of processing, canning and packaging meat for export.  The arrangements are the outcome of discussions between the trade organisations, my Department and An Foras Talúntais.  Operation of the meat research unit will be under the control of an institute which the trade is establishing for that purpose, namely the Irish Meat Research Institute Limited.  Advice in regard to the research programme will be provided by a consultative council comprising six representatives of the meat trade&mdash;two each from the carcase meat, canned meat and bacon trades&mdash;together with two technical officers of my Department and two officers of An Foras Talúntais.  State grants will be provided towards meeting part of the costs of setting up and operating the unit.</P>
    <P>The balance of the costs will be met by the trade and the trade organisations have stated that they would experience difficulty in making a satisfactory arrangement, on a voluntary basis, for collection of the funds needed from their members to meet the costs of the unit.  They, therefore, asked that the trade contributions should be collected by means of a special additional levy on animals slaughtered at all registered meat-export premises and bacon factories&mdash; at the rates of fourpence per head of <Col N="954" /> cattle, a penny per pig and a halfpenny per sheep.</P>
    <P>The only way at present open to me to meet that request is to amend the regulations governing the payment of statutory slaughtering fees to my Department so as to increase, by the amounts proposed by the trade, the prescribed rates of the existing statutory slaughtering fees and to pay over in due course to the Irish Meat Research Institute Limited, an amount equivalent to the receipts derived from the increase in the rates of fee.  My powers of amendment of the regulations are, however, qualified by the relevant statutes, which provide that a draft of any regulations altering the rates of fee shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.  In the circumstances, a resolution approving the draft regulations now before the House is required to enable me to collect, on behalf of the meat industry, the moneys they have agreed to provide as the industry's contribution to the costs of setting up and operating the meat research unit.</P>
    <P>Considering the importance of our meat trade in the national economy&mdash; our exports of meat and meat products in 1962 were valued at more than £31 million and accounted for 30 per cent of our total agricultural exports&mdash;I need not dwell upon the desirability of our having an organised service in operation here for the carrying out of research at trade level directed towards technical progress in the processing and treatment of meat and meat products.  In the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in 1958, reference was made to the benefit which the meat industry would undoubtedly derive from research into technical problems, and it was indicated that State aid would be made available to help finance such research.</P>
    <P>Thereafter, my Department conducted a lengthy series of discussions with the trade interests with a view to arriving at a suitable arrangement for the setting up and financing of a meat research unit.  An Foras Talúntais participated in these discussions and <Col N="955" /> there will be appropriate co-ordination of activities between An Foras and the meat trade's research unit.  Now that agreement has been reached in the matter, I propose to facilitate the trade organisations by amending the regulations regarding fees, in order to give effect to their request.  By arrangement with the trade, the increased rates of fee will be applicable as from 1st July, 1963.</P>
    <P>The trade research unit is being started on a modest scale.  The extra levies now proposed are estimated to yield about £12,000 per annum and the further contribution by the State will be about £6,500 per annum towards operating expenses and about £5,000 in each of the first two years towards initial capital expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have no objection to this motion since it does not seek to implement the recent suggestion that there should be a levy on pigs from which redundant bacon factory owners should be compensated for the closing down of their factories.  We feel the step the Minister is now taking is a good one, since it is to be organised jointly by the trade, Foras Talúntais and the Department.  It will definitely bring about the type of review so absolutely necessary to the extension and expansion of our exports of meat products.</P>
      <P>It is pleasing to note that the Minister and his Party are now aware of the fact that this is our most important export and it is noteworthy that the levy proposed is small by comparison with the advantage it will bring to all farmers, big and small.  It could mean increased exports and therefore we have no objection to it.</P>

    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a levy in existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to tell us this operated to provide an additional penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A penny or a penny-halfpenny&mdash;I am not sure which.  The existing levy is fivepence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is it.  When we speak of sixpence, it represents an additional penny.  In so far as we have a proposal before us to provide a penny from pigs, a halfpenny from sheep and fourpence from cattle, for research, I think that proposal can be justified, but we ought to bear in mind that these levies accumulate.  There is a levy already of something like 15s. per pig, to help exports.  There is a levy of 1/4 per pig to meet the administrative expenses of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, and now there is sixpence, a penny of which is going to the purposes of this motion and fivepence to other purposes about which I am not clear.  Can the Minister recall what the fivepence is going to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>For veterinary inspections entirely, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When you add them all up, there is now a levy of, I think, 16/10 per pig to meet part of the cost of subsidising exports, the administrative expenses of the Pigs and Bacon Commission and veterinary expenses in bacon factories.  We want to watch these several charges even when the new one is very small.  A total of 16/10 per pig must amount to substantially more than £1 million a year on the pig producers, and that is no small total charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we are now dealing with the penny a pig for research purposes, and the broader question of a levy on pigs for the purpose of financing the rationalisation of the bacon curing industry and the invitation to certain smaller factories to drop out of the trade does not arise on this motion, in <Col N="957" /> view of what the Minister has said. Therefore, we do not propose to drag it into the discussion because if that issue did arise on this motion, we would be bound to resist this motion with all the resources at our disposal.</P>
    <P>Dealing with this purely from the research point of view, the Minister has told us very little of what he contemplates will be set up as a result of this motion.  There is to be a controlling body, representative of the trade&mdash; two from the freshmeat and two from the canned meat trade, and two from the bacon factories, with two officials of the Minister's Department and two representatives of An Foras Talúntais, all of whom will constitute a governing body of this new institute.  Is this institute to have premises and laboratories of its own?</P>
    <P>I wonder is this multiplication of institutions wise?  Could it have been satisfactorily done by the Agricultural Institute?  I know that when I first envisaged the Agricultural Institute, I had hoped to gather into it all research, and indeed all higher education in agriculture. The higher education in agriculture had to be dropped as a result of an ignorant hullabaloo by the vested interests, but there remained the hope that we would gather in under one representative body all research activities.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not apprehend the development of duplication if we have a separate controlling body built up to do all research for meat processing? I think we have to keep in mind the danger of Parkinson's Law developing here where you might get a kind of rivalry between two research bodies of this kind, one wanting to indicate it is more significant than the other.  I should have thought it would have been possible under An Foras Talúntais to set up a governing body of that organisation, specially charged with that work and that they would co-opt to their numbers representatives of the various trades the Minister has mentioned.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not apprehend that if there is to be an entirely separate institute, it may start growing just for the sake of growing?  It will have its own laboratories, I presume; <Col N="958" /> it will have its own experimental stations for trying out a variety of meat-packing procedures and seeking to detect defects in existing procedures. It could grow into a considerable institution, with consequent demands for more and more money which would ultimately fall on the pigs.  For that reason, I am a little uneasy about the proposal to set up an entirely new and separate organisation and I should be glad to hear the Minister's view of that aspect of the proposal.  I should prefer this research work to be done either under the general supervision of An Foras Talúntais or the Department itself.  We already have the Veterinary Research Institute which is still under the Department of Agriculture&mdash;am I right in that?</P>

      <P>On balance, I think I should favour putting this under An Foras Talúntais, on the ground that we generally determine to delegate all research functions to An Foras Talúntais and not to add extra research functions to the Department itself.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on the danger of creating an entirely new and separate body with the risk of development of overlapping between An Foras Talúntais and the new body, and the additional expense.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy when he says that however small these levies may appear, they all tend to add up and I think he will concede that, in the full knowledge of the effect of these levies, no Minister is likely to come very heartily into the House to propose an increase for that very reason and will only do so when the case for taking that step is a strong one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the extent of the levies for all the different purposes but it is not as bad in regard to pigs as he says because in the case of pigs the producer is guaranteed a minimum price and has to get it.  I suppose that the levy has to come; it is the trade that will provide it, but the one thing which the pig producer can be sure of is that he gets the minimum price&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Coming to this institution, I am certainly not in this case thirsting to create an opportunity to increase and multiply.  As might be gathered from the speech I made, the discussions that have taken place in regard to the proposals now before us go back for years.  It was a most complicated matter.  There was a great deal of discussion.  I felt, and I think my officials felt, that the trade should be brought into this as actively as possible by giving them the fullest share of responsibility for directing the activities of this unit.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to cite the veterinary laboratory as being under our Department but it is an entirely different thing, according to my reasoning. From the beginning, I felt the trade should have intimate contact.  The intention is that the premises will be provided by An Foras Talúntais on a rental basis and the fact that they, with ourselves and the technical people of our Department, will be on this council will constitute&mdash;the decision has not yet been reached&mdash;the best arrangement.  Men who are in the business are keen; they know what is required.  They see things happen about them and I think they are quicker to get technical and trained personnel off the mark to see what can be done to cope with the competition which they meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say that since we have had these discussions over such a long period there is no aspect that has not been debated and we arrived at the stage when, it is true to say, there was agreement on what is proposed here on the part of all interested parties, that is, An Foras Talúntais and the three trades or businesses I have mentioned and ourselves.  Perhaps I have not given all the reasons that could be <Col N="960" /> given to support my line of thought but I had the belief from the beginning that the trade should have the most intimate contact possible with the actual work to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe from the Minister's statement that he made a particular effort at the outset to carry on the battle going on between himself and the various farmers' organisations. He tried to point out to them that they had no right to demonstrate and protest, organise or complain when they found that various aspects of Government policy were affecting their economy and their standard of living. It is a wrong attitude for a Minister for Agriculture to adopt towards the section of the community for which he is responsible as Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people have grievances, and instead of abusing them and taking them to task for complaining about various aspects of policy which are affecting them one way or another, the Minister should meet them in a proper atmosphere and discuss on a fair basis the matters about which they are complaining. <Col N="961" /> The huge gatherings of farmers which have taken place at various centres in the form of peaceful protests are a clear indication that there is considerable dissatisfaction amongst the farming community and that they feel they are not getting a fair share of the national wealth, that the policy operated by the Minister is neither favourable to them nor in their interests.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to heed what these organisations have to say in regard to matters affecting their interests.</P>
    <P>These are well-organised bodies.  In fact, it is a welcome development to see amongst the farming community a great measure of co-operation and co-ordination. In years gone by, it was not possible to get a nationwide organisation representing the various sections of the farming community. The result was that there was not the same awareness of the value of scientific knowledge and organised marketing methods amongst this community as there is at present.  These are organisations which the farmers have voluntarily formed and joined. They are non-political organisations, although they have been accused of being political just because they complained about one aspect or another of the agricultural policy of the Government. These organisations are a wonderful assistance to any Government because they represent the various interests of their members who are able to make known at first hand the problems affecting their particular aspect of the economy.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I would advocate greater contact and a much greater measure of goodwill between the Minister for Agriculture and these organisations.  They have something to offer and if the Minister is prepared to meet them on a proper basis and discuss their various problems with them, they are reasonable people and if the Minister is able to convince them that they are making an unreasonable demand, I do not believe they would persist in it.  However, the signs are there and when these people make statements about various aspects of policy, they are able to put up facts <Col N="962" /> and figures to the Minister and his Department, and on that basis I feel discussions should take place.  All other sections of the community have organised representation of one kind or another and nobody disputes the rights of the representative body of these sections to speak for them, to negotiate, to protest, and even to strike, if necessary.  We have that situation now in the farming community and we must face it.  The farmers are behind these organisations. They are ready to co-operate with their leaders in those groups.</P>
    <P>What I wanted to deal with was the situation existing among the dairy farmers.  The creamery milk suppliers have one problem and the suppliers of liquid milk have another and they are quite different.  It seems to me that the suppliers of loose milk are getting the worst end of the stick.  The creamery milk suppliers have an organised body and although they have been confronted with difficulties, such as the milk levy, in relation to the small increase for milk, they have a different type of economy to operate. It is significant, particularly in Dublin city and county, that almost 500 dairy cows have been sold from herds in recent weeks because the herd owners found it uneconomic to continue with the production of loose milk.</P>
    <P>This situation has been developing and it is a strange fact that in spite of this, we see other people going into the dairying business for a couple of years and then leaving it.  At the outset they seem to think that there is a living to be made from milk production and the keeping of dairy herds, but our experience in County Dublin has been that many of them are getting out as quickly as possible because the price of something around threepence a pint to the farmer will not pay.  The consumers pay more than double that amount for their milk.  It is clear from the figures that the milk producers are not getting a fair share of the money paid by the consumers of loose milk.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture seems to be doing nothing about an increase in the price to those engaged in the production of milk for consumption mainly in Dublin city and county, <Col N="963" /> apart from other towns and cities.  It is important that the dairy industry should be protected as far as possible and be in a position to prosper, because it is from the dairy herds that we get our foundation stock which enables us to derive a good income from the export of store cattle and fat cattle, and, of course, our dairy herd replacements. But I feel it is unfair for the Minister to watch the dairy farmers of Leinster and particularly County Dublin going out of business. There are various reasons why they have to go out of business but basically it is for economic reasons.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister will have to take steps to meet the Leinster Milk Producers' Association with a view to coming to an arrangement which will ensure a higher price for milk to the producers.  The argument may be put up that the consumer cannot pay any more for milk but I think it will be agreed that 3d per pint to the basic producers of milk is too low in relation to existing costs.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that at the moment it costs the best part of £100 to get a good milch cow and even then one is taking a chance.  That cow may cease for one reason or another to continue to give an average supply of milk and the producer then finds it necessary to sell that cow for beef and to replace it with another expensive cow. Then there is the question of mortality. Added on to all that are the wages of those in charge of the cows and the cost of the ordinary machinery and gear associated with the industry. When all these costs are added up, particularly the losses in relation to unsatisfactory cows, mortality and so on, the producers are finding that it is not a paying proposition.  That is one good reason why herds, amounting almost to 500 cows, have been sold over the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister that it is true that other extensive owners of dairy herds in County Dublin contemplate selling out at an early date.  That means a considerable loss of income to the areas in which these dairy cows are located because there is an income there, even if it is not giving a profit <Col N="964" /> to the dairy farmer himself.  The wages are being spent in the parish and the locality.  When the herd is sold out, all that type of income coming in from the milk is lost to the area.</P>
    <P>Another matter affecting the farming community is the continuous increase in rates.  These farmers are paying increased rates one year after another.  They are the one section of the community who benefit least from these rates.  Their contribution in the form of rates is used for providing street lights, footpaths, water and sewerage and all kinds of amenities which are available to the community in general but which they cannot enjoy if they live down boreens and lanes away from all these amenities. Still, the community in general receive further contributions in the form of increased rates from the farming community.</P>
    <P>Farmers' rates have gone up nearly £5 million in the past few years.  On the other side of the scale, the farmers' income did not rise in the same proportion. Similarly with this turnover tax which is now coming in.  About one-third of that turnover tax, or more, will be contributed by people engaged mainly in agriculture.  If we take it that the turnover tax will bring in £12 million, the people engaged in agriculture will contribute between £4 million and £5 million in the form of turnover tax annually&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has no responsibility for the turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, but the point I was making is that, in addition to the ordinary rates on agricultural land, this new measure will put a further burden on the farming community which is causing them to go out of business and to disemploy their labourers.  It is a significant fact that 20,000 people left the land last year. That means that the labour which those people put into agricultural production in one way or another is no longer available from the point of view of any income that can be got from agricultural exports or indeed from production for home consumption.  The trend is there still and the numbers engaged in agriculture are falling as <Col N="965" /> rapidly as ever.  It seems to me that when the figures are examined this year, we shall see that a further 20,000 or 25,000 people have left the land.  In every paper we take up, we see more farms offered for sale.  Farmers are selling out and availing of the inflated prices offered for land at present.  They are obtaining prices which certainly could not be won back from the land by the average farmer.</P>
      <P>The wheat policy operated by the Government at present is nothing short of a disgrace.  At one time, we had a campaign and every newspaper was covered with the advertisement &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo;.  Indeed, the Fianna Fáil Party made a political issue of wheat-growing for years and took the opportunities of making a political issue of it. When they found there was no longer any political advantage to be gained from a wheat-growing policy, they immediately dropped the wheat producers and left them to fight it out with the huge miller combines from whom they have no chance of getting better terms than the millers wish to give them.  The result is that there has been a considerable drop in wheat production and there will be a further drop during the coming year.</P>
      <P>The barley price is unsatisfactory. The Minister has persisted in refusing to improve the arrangements for the payment of a better price for barley. These major departments in the agricultural economy have now been abandoned.  While we have a situation where the wheat growers now try to sell their wheat, against the odds, to these millers and have it accepted at the best price they can get, the Government are importing Russian feeding stuffs and the rest, while the wheat that was bought for feeding is actually being used by the millers for bread production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position as between the millers and the wheat growers is so bad at the moment that the wheat growers are no longer prepared to take the chance of growing wheat, facing the weather, harvesting the crop and then finding that there is no Government there to ensure that they will get a fair price for it or that they will be fairly treated in relation to the quality <Col N="966" /> of the wheat submitted.  Recently a grower sent in 32 loads of wheat and only one load was accepted as being millable.  He was paid the feeding price for the remainder of the crop.  He felt that if the Government took their proper place as referee between the miller and himself, possibly all of his wheat might have passed as millable. As the Government have now left the position between the growers and the millers, the millers are getting the best of it and the growers have no redress.</P>
    <P>The farmers are finding it increasingly difficult to sell their produce. There seems to be a surplus of produce, possibly because of the mass emigration still taking place in spite of what Government speakers say.  Only last week the farmers had to take home most of their cattle from the market as they were unable to obtain a reasonable price.  The bottom fell out of the trade a fortnight ago.  Something will have to be done in relation to the marketing of farm products. Fortunately, we have a frame of mind growing up among the producers with regard to the setting up of processing co-operatives which will facilitate the marketing of produce but the Government will have to take an interest in the setting up of organised marketing machinery.  There is an allocation in the Budget which can be used for the purpose of market research.</P>
    <P>I notice from the figures supplied that farmers' incomes are up by something less than two per cent while their costs have gone up over 25 per cent and, in many cases, by more than that in the past couple of years.  For this reason, farmers are finding it more and more difficult to make ends meet.  This explains the reason for the number of peaceful protest marches which have been organised by the farmers in an effort to draw the attention of the Government and the community to their plight, to show that they are not getting a fair share of the national wealth and that Government policy is not operating to ensure that they do.</P>
    <P>We also notice the flight from the land due to the low wages which are being paid.  The farmers cannot afford to pay higher wages to their farmhands and cannot afford to compete <Col N="967" /> with manufacturers and building contractors. They are losing their farm labourers to these other aspects of our economy.  They are then driven to further mechanisation and other labour-saving devices.  The cost of farm machinery is very high and the depreciation is very great.  Take any farm implements, combine harvesters, tractors and so on, and you will find that the depreciation is so high that if the farmer put the figures together, he would be shocked to see how much it is in relation to his income and the measure of production brought about by the use of that machinery.  Something should be done by the Government to ensure that the price of farm machinery will be kept down to an economic level.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that world population is increasing by 20 million a year, we still find surpluses of farm produce. Farmers producing vegetables particularly find it uneconomic to take them out of the ground.  They have to leave them there and plough them back when the time comes to plant another crop.  In north County Dublin, this practice can be observed almost every year with one crop or another.  The price for those vegetables is so much below the cost of production that the growers cannot afford to take them out of the ground.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, not alone is the cost of production of vegetables very much above the prices available to the growers but the same situation applies in the case of milk. The cost of producing a gallon of milk for many farmers at the present time, taking into consideration the various expenses and losses they must face, is not economic and they are eventually driven into a situation in which they have to sell out their herds.  It is not good for the country to have a position in which those who have a tradition and, if you like, a particular set-up, are driven overnight into just going out of business.  The people on the land&mdash; the Minister knows this quite well&mdash; are earning very much less per head than the people engaged in industry and building.  For that reason, it is desirable that a policy should be <Col N="968" /> operated to strike a balance and create on the land a measure of prosperity which will encourage people to stay on the land instead of forcing them to emigrate or move away from the land into industry, building, or other activities.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a large farm was purchased near Straffan.  It will be operated as a model farm in lieu of the model farm, the Albert College, at Glasnevin.  That is a very good move. I hope that model farm will demonstrate various aspects of agricultural production and make the results available to various farming organisations and farmers in general.  A visit to the Netherlands in particular would certainly open the eyes of most producers here.  There they appear to be at least 20 years ahead of this country from the point of view of scientific methods of production and handling and the technical knowledge associated with plant life and methods of production. If we are to hope that our agricultural surplus may be sold in the Common Market countries, if we gain admission to the Common Market, we cannot hope to compete against the high standard of efficiency and marketing methods in the Netherlands and possibly in some other continental countries too.</P>
    <P>This model farm near Straffan could examine into the various aspects of agricultural production in the Netherlands, particularly in relation to fruit and vegetables, and a section of the farm at Straffan could be allocated to such production, using the highly efficient methods common in the Netherlands.  Demonstrations could be given to farmers and farm organisations and I have no doubt similar methods of production could be adopted quickly here.  The result would be a better market for produce off the land.  Indeed, I have no doubt that these methods will have to be adopted by the farming community if they wish to sell fruit and vegetables on the continent.</P>
    <P>It is worthy of notice that our total exports have fallen.  In 1961, we exported to Germany nearly £5.5 millions.  In 1962, the figure is just <Col N="969" /> over £5 millions.  We exported to Belgium in 1961 £1,300,000 and in 1962, £900,000, a drop of almost 33? per cent.  Exports to the Netherlands have dropped from over £2 millions to £1,680,000.  Exports to Norway have dropped from £309,000 to £162,000.  Portugal is an exception; exports to Portugal have gone up. Exports to Sweden have dropped from £802,000 to £59,000.  A substantial proportion of these figures represents agricultural produce of one kind or another.  There must be some reason for these substantial drops.  This is the kind of problem we may have to face in the event of our getting into the Common Market.  We shall certainly be faced with a number of difficulties emanating from sources outside this country, even in relation to agriculture, which we all hope will bring us great advantages.</P>
    <P>With regard to the farm building scheme, I should like the Minister to examine whether even greater assistance could, if possible, be given towards farm buildings.  Too long the farmers and the Government have failed to realise the value of at least one large building on every farmstead. Such a building would enable farming activities to be carried on indoors.  It would enable farmers to continue working under cover and render them immune to inclement weather conditions. Even the Land Commission have failed to provide one good large building.  Buildings are a real asset on any farm.  They should be well designed and spacious so that they can be adapted to various farming activities. While the present type of shed may serve a purpose, in the long run it does not offer the same advantages as a large adaptable building.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious from the Minister's statement that the British market for our agricultural produce and livestock is still the main market for us and the one on which we should concentrate. In relation to the pig and bacon industry, I see some encouraging trends.  It is a far cry from the days before Fianna Fáil took office when millions of pigs were exported, even on the hoof.  Then in 1946 we had the ridiculous position of having bacon <Col N="970" /> under the counter.  The shopkeepers would only give one or two slices to their best and favoured customers.  In 1948 the inter-Party Government set about changing the position.  As far as the pig population and pig production are concerned, there is a welcome movement towards the situation which existed in 1931 before Fianna Fáil took office.  I hope the farmers will be further encouraged to go into the production of pigs and bacon.  There will always be a ready market, even if the terms are difficult.  I have the impression that the competition from the Danes is falling off and that we will not have such great competition from them in the future.  It seems the producers there are finding it difficult to make ends meet in their economy. That will give us an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is a big change from the days when Deputy Corry and his colleagues made little of the establishment of the sugar beet factory here.  They are now rushing around trying to get farmers to grow beet and expand sugar production. I suppose Deputy Corry will remember the days when we had millions of pigs.</P>

      <P>It is a welcome change on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is still a good future for the production of sugar, because I believe the demand for sugar and sugar products will continue to increase. Whatever can be done to increase our sugar production and take advantage of the ready export market should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo; campaign of Fianna Fáil, which they used to make a political issue, I notice now that corn crops have declined by 100,000 acres since 1956&mdash;that was supposed to be a bad year&mdash;and that root and green crops have fallen by 87,000 acres in that time.  In fact, there are nearly a quarter of a million acres less tillage now than there was in 1956. <Col N="972" /> The Fianna Fáil Party apparently are adopting a different attitude towards tillage.  Now they do not want to recognise the tillage farmer.  We see that the number of turkeys here is less than half the number there was in 1956.  The number of fowl has dropped by three million since 1956.</P>
    <P>Those are some aspects of the agricultural economy with which the Minister has been associated since 1956.  I feel he should change his attitude in relation to tillage and milk production. Both of them have been on the decline while the present Minister has been in office.  Apparently he is determined to let the trend continue.  Apparently he will not make any attempt to create prosperity among the tillage farmers. Certainly, he is not going to touch wheat any more.  He is going to leave Deputy Corry and the rest of them at the mercy of the millers in relation to the sale of wheat.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I do not think the Minister has much to be proud of. He has a lot to do still.  He will have to take an active interest in arresting the flight from the land.  Nobody will deny that thousands are leaving the land every year.  The land will be abandoned if the people engaged in agriculture cannot make ends meet. The farm labourers, although apparently they are earning more, if you like, than the farmers, are down on a subsistence level, finding it nearly impossible to make ends meet.  When we examine the figures, we find that, in fact, the earnings per head of the population engaged in agriculture is even lower than the wages fixed for farm labourers.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would appeal to the Minister to do something for the milk producers of Leinster who are engaged in the production of liquid milk for consumption in Dublin city and county.  Many of them are compelled to accept surplus prices for large quantities of milk which is being used for industrial purposes and for the remainder, they are getting something around only 3d. per gallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Fine Gael Party, he has a leader.  Did he ever look back on the highlights of his leader's statements in regard to some of the matters he has been discussing here, particularly beet?  Did he ever hear his leader's opinion on beet and sugar?  I quote from Volume 106 of the Official Report, column 2041, where Deputy Dillon said:</P>
      <P>There remains beet&mdash;the blessings of beet!  Some day, and in the not far distant time, our people will have to ask themselves whether it is in the best interests of the community as a whole to continue the production of sugar from beet in this country at an annual cost to the community of £3,000,000 sterling.  That is what it costs in normal times to keep the beet industry going in this country. If, instead of growing beet and converting it into sugar, we import refined sugar into this country there will be £3,000,000 sterling more for the national exchequer and that £3,000,000 can be used to increase children's allowances in every home in Ireland from the 2/6 per child to 5/- per child, and the land vacated by that crop can be used for the production of profitable agricultural produce which will help to finance essential imports and to enrich the farmers who live upon the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was Deputy Dillon's opinion at that time of the crop that Deputy <Col N="974" /> Rooney has spent half an hour speaking about.</P>
    <P>For fear that would not be enough, at Column 1513 of Volume 101, Deputy Dillon, again on that line, said:</P>
    <P>Give me that money and tomorrow morning we can increase the family allowance going into every house from 2/6d. to 7/- per child.  Is there any Deputy who would argue with me that our community is getting better value in the maintenance of that daft scheme at a cost of £3,000,000 per annum than it would get if we were in a position to raise the family allowance in every poor house from 2/6d. to 7/-?  Every farmer in this country who had four children in his house could receive for the benefit of these children 14/- per week in lieu of the 5/- he is now getting; 14/- per week every week in every year, until those children had passed the age of 16, with the money we propose to squander on maintaining the beet sugar crop.</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Rooney's leader's opinion of beet in this country and sugar beet.  Is it any wonder that when he did get the power afterwards, he chipped in and in a discussion in Britain in relation to fixing prices in Britain, allowed a levy of £16 a ton to be put on every ton of sugar exported to Britain from this country?  I challenged him with that here in this House and on 12th July, 1960, Volume 183, Column 1411, Deputy Dillon said:</P>
    <P>I want to raise a specific matter which affects the problems of beet farmers who are supplying beet to the sugar factories, and also other products which are produced from Irish sugar, which is raw material produced in this country.  In 1948, we negotiated a Trade Agreement, Article V of which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government of the United Kingdom undertake that where goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland, are dutiable at preferential rates of duty, they will not vary the existing preferential treatment of these goods in such a way as to put any class of goods, the growth, produce <Col N="975" /> or manufacture of Ireland, at a disadvantage in relation to goods of that class from other sources enjoying preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>Now, that is a pretty comprehensive Article and yet with that article in existence, I understand that goods containing Irish sugar are being subjected to a very formidable levy, the proceeds of which are devoted to the subsidisation of goods of similar quality containing sugar derived from crown colonies of the British Crown.  I am told, I think, by some of the Minister's colleagues, that when Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce, this matter arose and that he did not consider it desirable to press the interpretation of Article V which would give us the right to claim exemption from that levy.</P>
    <P>At that period Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, charged with looking after the agricultural community in this country.  He said:</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position is in regard to that.  I have no recollection of hearing the matter discussed when I was a member of the inter-Party Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>he was not even consulted, I suppose, and he had not enough interest in the matter to bother with it</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;although it could have happened and has passed out of my memory but I do not remember it and I have not discussed the matter with Deputy Norton.  Whatever attitude was taken up, I should like to be told now because frankly I confess that as I see it now, it appears that that Article is wide enough and comprehensive enough to cover the present procedure under which I believe that goods which are the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland are being put at a disadvantage in relation to goods of that class from other sources enjoying preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>That action was taken in the last days of an inter-Party Government in 1956, and when we wanted to increase <Col N="976" /> production we had to face that condition of affairs.  Thank goodness, some improvement has since been made in the situation by this Government.  We had Deputy Rooney looking for more beet and more sugar and Deputy Dillon talking about the daft scheme and allowing the British to put £16 a ton levy on it but despite the condition of affairs that existed, in which in 1959 we had to prevent farmers from growing beet, we survived.  Beet then had to be rationed.  In 1960 there was the announcement: &ldquo;No new contracts are being issued this year nor are applicants for increased acreage being considered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can speak here as the chairman of an association of some 80,000 tillage farmers and as one who encouraged the idea that the price of beet would be based on costings.  It is the only agricultural crop produced in this country today based on costings.  In those four years, despite that penalty, we can proudly say we have increased the production of beet from 1960 to this year, 1963/64, by 25 per cent.  The acreage of beet has gone up from 67,000 acres to 88,000 acres despite rationing, despite everything that could be done to stop us.  We beet growers had to make sacrifices.  When we were entitled to an increase of half a crown a ton on costings on our beet we let that go by in order to have 12,000 more acres of beet grown and to smash the rationing ring.  This year the amount of beet produced is over 1,056,000 tons; the value of that in sugar is over £17,000,000&mdash;for that daft scheme. This year the 20,000 extra acres of beet grown represents 240,000 tons of beet and about 37,000 tons of sugar.  If the Irish people carried out the advice of Deputy Dillon the housekeepers of this country, the housewives who are howling at the door here every day would be paying 2/6 a lb. for their sugar, whether they liked it or not, with the price of sugar in the world market.</P>
    <P>We are the only body who have got any increase in the price of agricultural produce this year.  We have got an increase of 11/1 a ton in the price of beet for the coming year, and the acreage of beet grown is limited only by the capacity of the four factories <Col N="977" /> to handle it.  That is what co-operation between the manufacturing side of the industry and the producers of the industry have succeeded in getting.</P>
    <P>In 1951, the then Minister for Agriculture first put his palsied hand on the beet industry in a letter to the Sugar Company &ldquo;that the previous Government had been far too generous with the farming community and the Government could not agree to any increase in the price of beet for the coming year&rdquo;.  Those are the handicaps under which we had to fix prices and work.  The result of that was clearly displayed the following year when there had to be imported into this country 75,000 tons of foreign sugar costing on the quayside £12 a ton more than the best Irish sugar from any Irish factory.</P>
    <P>The position in the beet industry now is that there has been an increase of 25 per cent in production in four years.  This year as a result of all the work that has been done we are in the happy position that, when sugar is going at £100 a ton in the foreign market, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have 40,000 tons of sugar more to sell than they had in 1960.  Then we are told we cannot expand production. The expansion in production was due solely to the fact that the price of that crop is based on costings.  I am very happy to say that yesterday evening I concluded with the Sugar Company the agreement of the coming year.  Those are the conditions of it: 11/1d. a ton increase in price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NicholasEgan" hpid="Mr. N. Egan Mr. N. Egan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We are entitled to everything we can get and it will not be half enough because it must be remembered that the price of that beet is made up on costings at a wage of £6 16s. to the agricultural labourer and the farmer producing it.  The meanest charwoman in an industry would not work for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those conditions, we have managed an extra income of £17½ million from agricultural produce. Still, I am not happy about that income.  None looking at the position <Col N="978" /> of the agricultural labourer could be happy about it.  He is supposed to be entitled to an increase of only 5s. a week while the white collar, eight-hour-a-day man turns down an increase of £2 14s. a week.  There is something wrong in a country where these conditions are allowed to exist.  Where will it lead to?  Then we have the fellow with the £3,000 a year standing up and talking about the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if we are to get ahead with agriculture, the Minister should take his courage in his hands and fix a wage of £10 a week for agricultural labourers.  There is not a man working on a farm today who does not require to be far more skilled than any worker in any industry, no matter who he may be.  Take one of those fellows in industry, hand him a milking machine and tell him to go out and milk 25 or 30 cows, and see what he will do.  Shove him up on a tractor and tell him to open 15 or 20 drills, and see what he will do.</P>
    <P>It is the agricultural labourer who is expected to work at £6 10s. a week to feed the £20 a week fellow.  There is only one remedy for that, and had we not got the increase in price for sugar beet, I would have taken it.  If we left those fellows without sugar for a year, we would see how sweet they would be at the end of it.  In spite of that, 90 per cent of the time of this House is taken up discussing non-agricultural activities, and every hour of that time is piling up an extra load on the farmers' backs, either in increased rates for social services or some other blown-up activity.  Let us look things in the face.</P>
    <P>It is no good talking here about wheat.  I heard Deputy Rooney talking about wheat, and in the name of heavens, did he consult his leader before he got up to speak about it? What is his leader's opinion on wheat? Somebody might like to hear it.  At Column 2050 of Volume 106 of the Official Report, this is what he had to say about wheat:</P>
    <P>For the first time since the emergency, we had the enthralling, stimulating and surprising experience of eating bread made out of Irish wheat.  Before you ate it you had to <Col N="979" /> hold it out in your hands, squeeze the water out of it, then tease it out and make up your mind whether it was a handful of boot polish or a handful of bread.  If it was boot polish you put it on your boots or shoes and if it was bread you tried to masticate it if you were fit.</P>
    <P>It is that gentleman, with all that knowledge, who comes in here and raises Cain with the Minister about the price of wheat.  The Leader of the main Opposition, with that viewpoint enunciated in this House, gives us the good advice.  You get the most amazing advice if you go and have a look at some of the extraordinary things said here.  We are all interested in milk. I heard Deputy Rooney on that, too. Would he like to know his leader's opinion on milk?  Here it is, reported at Column 2048 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>We are subsidising butter production to the tune of £2,000,000 per annum.  How long will that go on? Do we expect butter to get dearer in the markets of the world?  Do we expect a time in the early future when the price of milk will become so adjusted that it will be possible to suspend this subsidy, or do we intend to continue producing milk for conversion into butter in creameries at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £2,000,000 per annum? I want to go on record most emphatically that I think such a policy is sheer insanity and is purely pursued for the purpose of maintaining the prestige of incompetents in the offices of the Minister for Agriculture since Fianna Fáil came into power.</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Dillon's opinion of converting milk into butter.  What else can we do with it?  His shadow Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Donegan, is of the opinion that 75 per cent of our milk is too dirty to be processed into anything else but butter.  He was, of course, following the good lead of his leader.</P>
    <P>He states that 75 per cent of the milk is too dirty.  I gave the figures for our cheese factories at Mitchelstown, Rathduff, Mallow and I can say that <Col N="980" /> none of those dirty people handling milk comes from County Cork.  Deputy T. O'Donnell gave the figures from his county and he says none of those dirty milkers comes from County Limerick.  They must all be above with Deputy Donegan in County Louth.  I suggest that now in his leisure during the holidays he goes and has a chat with the farmers' wives and daughters up there whom he has labelled as dirty.</P>
    <P>If we are to keep the people of this country on the land, working it, our whole outlook on agriculture will have to be changed.  We will not do that by having some hero taking 1,000 or 2,000 acres of conacre here and there and growing wheat on it.  We have got to make it possible for agricultural producers to get at least £100 gross per acre from the land.  If we can do that, we will not have to go further at the moment to persuade our farmers to produce sufficient to swell the revenue of the country.  The first thing to be done, if we are to be successful, is to remove the malignant hand that exists in practically every Department of the State and prevents things being done.</P>
    <P>I advised some of my new constituents in the Mallow area, who live in pretty poor country around New-market, to go into growing vegetables for manufacturing.  Some did so and the average quantity of cabbage delivered by five of them to Mallow factory this year was 26½ tons to the acre.  That represents something over £140 per acre for cabbage and the farmer who cannot grow cabbage should not have land.</P>
    <P>Last week, under our special arrangement with General Costello in regard to those crops, those farmers got, in addition to the price, a bonus of 23/- per ton, or £30 per acre.</P>
    <P>Five of these factories were scheduled for manufacturing in 1964 and building was to begin in June of this year.  It is now December and we are only starting to move after getting out from under the mantle of the Departments.  We still have another Department to face, the biggest of them all, the one with the money. <Col N="981" /> What is wrong?  If a foreigner comes into the country guaranteeing that he will employ 20 or 30 men, he can get grants from the Department or from the Industrial Development Authority but the very minute you mention agriculture, there is a sniff and a sneeze and a twist and a turn from every overpaid, underworked gentleman in the State.  Poor Fr. McDyer has been for the past two years in Donegal with his little factory trying to give employment and keep people at home on the land.  He did not get his grant yet. Why?</P>

I want to keep 700 of my East Cork boys and girls at home working: I want to have the farmers of East Cork producing crops that will give them a return of £100 to £150 per acre and I am not going to be held up by any civil servant.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the difference between what is in this letter and the Minister's statement.  That is one thing I must get without doubt.  If we are to advance, get industries going and do what our comrades died for&mdash;keep our young people employed at home; if we are to raise the living standards of those who are flying from the land so that they will remain here to produce crops that will give them a decent return instead of the miserable prices attached to grain, nothing should stand in the way of it.</P>
      <P>I enjoy listening to Paddy Crosbie in &ldquo;School Around the Corner.&rdquo; When Crosbie puts his arm around one of the children and asks him: &ldquo;What are you going to be?&rdquo;  I have never yet heard one of them say: &ldquo;I am going to be a farmer or an agricultural labourer,&rdquo; and I have been a long time listening now.</P>
      <P>A fortnight ago, an increase of 5/- per week for agricultural labourers was announced.  It meant 4/2 per ton increase in the price of my beet&mdash;that is how I know it.  On Monday night when I opened the evening newspaper, I saw that another section of the community had refused an increase of £2 14s. a week.  What hope have you of holding men on the land with a 5/- a week increase on the one hand, when on the other, you have gentlemen who are able to refuse an increase of £2 14s.? There can be only one end to that sort of thing and the sooner we realise it the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to malting barley, the price <Col N="983" /> negotiated last year was 53/- a barrel as against 57/6 in 1948.  When I turn to the other side of the picture, I see in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of December 6th this year that even after allowing £2,473,000 for depreciation the Guinness company's profits rose from £7,700,000 to £8,413,000 and extra shares and extra moneys were distributed to everyone.  Even the employees on the staff of the Dublin and Park Royal concerns shared in the group's record and received a bonus of one month's salary or wage.  I was very happy to read that but I notice that while they thought of the shareholders and the employees there was not one penny for the man producing the barley. There was not one word about him.</P>
    <P>That is just an indication of the outlook there is towards agriculture.  It is about time the people realised what is happening.  Only yesterday I was in Carlow and we were discussing the threshing operations of ten and 15 years ago when you would have had 30 or 35 young men gathered in to do the work.  You could travel the parish today and you would not get them. They would be fools if they were there working for £6 odd a week while if they go into an industry, they will earn from £12 to £25.</P>
    <P>As I said, the whole outlook on agriculture must be changed and changed immediately, if it is not too late already.  You will find difficulty today getting skilled men who ten years ago were available.  It is impossible to get skilled men.  Then you see an item here &ldquo;Subsidy on artificial manures&rdquo; but you find that one firm is swallowing all the small fellows in preparation for gobbling up the subsidy in an increased price for the artificial manures produced.  That is where the subsidy is going and it is a joke and a fraud to put down these subsidies as subsidies to agriculture, because they are not.  They are subsidies to the monopolies.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House further.  I have given the facts as I know them and as I have studied them. The whole body of this House, whatever political beliefs they profess, <Col N="984" /> should band together and decide that we are going to change the position of agriculture, in the matter of subsidies and everything else.  The biggest bogey we have to face in regard to beet, for example, is incompetent and inefficient transport.  It is time that state of affairs were changed and as far as we farmers are concerned, it is high time CIE were thrown off their perch and full rights accorded to private enterprise in the field of transport.  Any change would be better than what we have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NicholasEgan" hpid="Mr. N. Egan Mr. N. Egan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been dragged out a good deal and, therefore, I do not propose to speak for very long. I should like to refer to what I consider the most important matter in the Minister's statement, that is, the heifer bounty scheme.  It is an excellent scheme and I congratulate the Minister and his Department on it.  It has been very well received by the farmers.  The bounty of £15 a head is a generous one and I believe the scheme will achieve the aims set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> as far as the increase in cattle output is concerned, that is, an increase from 1,046,000 in 1960 to 1,500,000 by 1970. Of course Deputy Dillon tried to ridicule the scheme when it was announced and he brought into play his peculiar brand of arithmetic.  He said that every cow and heifer would have to have triplets every year to produce the target aimed at by 1970. That was another way he had of saying that the whole idea was preposterous, or to use his own favourite phrase, &ldquo;all cod&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get down to the simple arithmetic of the scheme.  It is estimated that approximately 320,000 heifers go into the fat and store market every year, that is, that we lose approximately 320,000 potential cows, as far as having calves is concerned, each year.  If that number were sent to the bull, we would have an increase of 320,000 in the first year.  Assuming, in the natural course of events, that they would have one calf each&mdash;not to talk of Deputy Dillon's triplets&mdash;we would have an increase in the first year alone of 320,000.  Assuming that approximately half the calves were heifers, they alone&mdash;say, by 1967&mdash;<Col N="985" /> would produce approximately 150,000 or 160,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Donegan thinks when I said 20,000 in 1964; 30,000 in 1965; 40,000 in 1966; and 60,000 in 1967, I jumped too high from 1966 to 1967, but of the 20,000 in 1964, in the natural course, half of the calves would be heifer calves and would all be having calves in 1967.  I wound up at 120,000 by 1970.  Any farmer who knows anything about cows, calves and cattle production will find my figures very reasonable.  The whole thing, added up over those seven years up to 1970, give a figure of 450,000 extra.  That brings it up to a grand total as between what we had in 1960 of 1,046,000 to 1,496,000&mdash;not very far off the target.</P>
      <P>If we take as a base year 1962, we had 1,062,000 or an increase of 16,000 over 1960.  If we take that year as a base, we would be well over the target by approximately 12,000.</P>

      <P>It was very noticeable in this debate that the Fine Gael backbenchers were gradually and very definitely losing faith in the arithmetic of Deputy Dillon and others and they took up a different line altogether. Instead of stressing that the idea was preposterous and the figures were unattainable, they said that nobody would get anything out of it except the big fellow and that it would not benefit the small farmers at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme will benefit every farmer who is able to increase his herd.  We all know that the great majority of farmers will be able to increase their herds substantially.  A very large number, indeed&mdash;through intelligent fertilising, and so on&mdash;will be able to double their herds.  Indeed, not a few will be able to treble their herds.  The stock-carrying capacity of the land of this country has increased enormously in the past ten, 15 or 20 years and <Col N="987" /> there is still tremendous room for improvement in that regard.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a lot of farmers since this scheme was introduced.  They had a tremendous and enthusiastic welcome for it and most of them were small farmers.  They were not troubled about what the big fellow would get out of it but considered what the scheme would mean to themselves.  They were all convinced it would mean a big lot to them.  I believe they will avail of the scheme vigorously and use it intelligently. I do not believe they will be distracted by the muddled mathematics of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Donegan or by the other line taken by Fine Gael speakers who, when they lost faith in the figures of their two agricultural experts, turned to the time-worn and hackneyed comparison of the big fellow and the little fellow.</P>
    <P>I hope the small struggling farmer as we know him will be helped in so far as it is possible to help him to avail of this scheme.  I should also like to see every agricultural labourer with a cottage and a plot who has not already a cow helped to avail of the scheme. I believe every cottager with a plot should have a cow.  I believe there are very few localities where such a man could not get grass and conacre hay at a reasonable cost for a cow.  Apart from providing milk and butter for himself and his family for the greater part of the year, the manure from the cow and the calf would be of tremendous value to that man's plot.  Every cottager with a plot of land should have a cow and a calf, so that, apart from helping his own economy, he would also be helping the national economy.  Many people would not agree with that but I never saw a cottager with a plot yet who had a badly fed cow or calf.  It would give them an added stake in the country by having a cow and calf and that in itself would be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>This scheme was well timed.  This is a favourable time to embark on a big step to increase our cattle population, our output, or whatever fine distinction Deputy Donegan likes to put on it.  We are in sight of the completion of the <Col N="988" /> eradication of bovine tuberculosis, thanks to the tremendous efforts of the Minister and his Department.  We have lost in the process something like half a million cows and the remarkable capability of the farmers to replace them is another indication that this scheme can be worked well.  The productivity of our land has increased enormously and will increase still further with generous and intensive manuring.  Time will prove that this scheme was well conceived.  We have better prospects in the continental and world markets and entry to the Common Market looms before us, offering still further prospects for our cattle exports.</P>
    <P>I had intended to speak at some length on grain crops generally, on their sowing, growing, harvesting and final disposition but I would have to cover a great deal of ground and take up a lot of time to deal adequately with that subject.  I shall content myself by saying a few words in favour of an early harvest.  Many of our ills as far as grain and other crops are concerned are due to a too late harvest. Our harvest could be pushed forward by at least one month.  Ploughing does not begin soon enough after the harvest and not nearly enough work is done before Christmas.  Very often you have bad weather in the new year and tillage operations are held up. Then you have a late spring, late sowing, late growing and late harvesting. It is the same vicious circle all over again.  It all adds up to badly damaged crops, with terrific losses in time, money and material.</P>
    <P>If harvesting could be pushed forward that one month, we would have much better harvesting conditions and consequently improved farming conditions generally.  I would urge the Minister very strongly to consult with his officials in an effort to devise some sound means of carrying out a campaign to encourage the farmers to push the harvest a month forward.  It can be done and if the Minister can do it, he will have done the biggest thing in 40 years for Irish agriculture.  The results would be difficult to estimate in terms of increased output, better crops and more efficiency in agricultural <Col N="989" /> output generally.  I strongly urge the Minister to take up that suggestion.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about interest-free loans for farmers by Deputies Dillon and Donegan.  I have no particular set on Deputy Donegan but he happens to be in the firing line at the moment.  They submitted interest-free loans as an ideal solution for the farmers' ills and took the Minister to task because he was not sufficiently enthusiastic about their proposals.  It is extraordinary to see how Deputy Dillon has become converted to the idea of interest-free loans. At one time he was the deadly enemy of such proposals and his conversion to it is almost as striking as his conversion to wheat growing.</P>
    <P>In 1947, when interest-free loans were being discussed on the Estimate for Agriculture on 17th June, he said, in volume 106, column 2036 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I doubt very much if this scheme of scattering loans all over the country, interest-free, has anything to commend it.</P>
    <P>On the same day in Column 2037, he said:</P>
    <P>I solemnly warn this House with regard to these interest-free loans that 50 per cent of the recipients will live to curse the day they got them.</P>
    <P>Now he comes in to attack the present Minister for Agriculture because he does not become enthusiastic over his grandiose scheme of giving an interest-free loan of £1,000 to each of almost 300,000 farmers.  So much for the consistency of Deputy Dillon and his interest-free loans, to say nothing of wheat and beet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon concluded his remarks with certain recommendations to the Minister for his personal comfort. Deputy Dillon seems to be in the mood lately for recommending rest cures for certain people.  Having said that the present Minister for Agriculture must be the worst Minister for Agriculture in Western Europe, he went on to recommend that he should take a rest cure&mdash;go down to the green pastures of Cavan and take a rest there for the remainder of his days.  It is strange that <Col N="990" /> it did not occur to Deputy Dillon that he could more appropriately take a rest cure himself than most people in this House.  Surely he is not unaware of the very grave anxiety that many of his Party have about his need for a rest; I do not think they would consider it necessary for him to go down to the green pastures around Ballaghaderreen and spend the rest of his life there in splendid isolation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is always pleasant when a Minister can get in to conclude on his Estimate, but it is even more pleasant for him when he has concluded.  This debate has extended over many weeks and the break in the debate for the past two weeks has, of course, taken some of the warmth out of the discussion and one finds it a little difficult now to recapture the first enthusiasm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the matters raised during the course of the debate were also raised at Question Time.  Politics are, of course, politics; nevertheless, I could not quite see the necessity for the tendency that seemed to develop here to misrepresent publicly what was really intended when Survey Teams were established to report on certain aspects of agriculture, such as the pigs and bacon industry, the dairying industry, and so on.  Before these Survey Teams were established, there was a certain anxiety on the part of many Deputies; they seemed to fear that industry was taking steps and making preparations and carrying out investigations while agriculture appeared to be neglecting its duty.  Such fears, even if they were genuine, were groundless. <Col N="991" /> There was no justification for them.</P>
    <P>These Survey Teams were set up. They made reports.  There is not a Deputy in this House unintelligent enough not to know that the making of these reports did not mean that the Government were committed to the reports.  These reports were furnished by people qualified to examine into particular aspects of the agricultural industry&mdash;economists, technical experts, and so on.  It was known that these reports would be referred to those most concerned, the people whose circumstances and conditions were being investigated and the rural organisations affected.  It was also known that, after all that process had taken place, the Government would have to arrive at a decision.  Yet, a very fine effort was made to put over on the public that, immediately the Survey Team reports appeared, they represented Government policy, in the hope that the people would be stampeded into something.</P>
    <P>One of the survey reports concerned the bacon industry.  A number of recommendations were made in that report.  These were submitted to the study group.  I refer in particular to the one of which Deputies have been critical, namely, the proposed levy for the purchase of what might be described as excess factory capacity.  That idea has been discussed over the past 30 years.  I could not count the number of times I have heard it mentioned.  The fact that the survey team recommended this course does not, however, mean that the industry itself would be satisfied or that the producers would be satisfied.  Neither did it mean, nor could it mean, that the Minister would be satisfied.  Naturally I would have a view and that view would be as sound as any view coming from any other source.  It was apparently good tactics to try to give the impression that this was Government policy.  The proposal was made by a survey team of three individuals.  It was submitted to the study group, and all the interests there expressed hostility to it.  Even if they never expressed hostility to the proposal, I would feel not only uncertain <Col N="992" /> about its wisdom but hostile to it, if I had to make up my mind about it.</P>
    <P>The next item on the programme was the attempt by the Pigs and Bacon Commission to investigate this recommendation for the centralised purchasing of pigs.  Immediately the Commission proceeded to do this, the word went round that this was going to be Government policy.  All the speeches made and the parliamentary questions directed to me on this subject were designed to cultivate that notion in the public mind.</P>
    <P>I have listened to much criticism of the past and present method of collecting pigs.  People are entitled to be critical and may be justified in being so, but it is not easy to find a better method.  When this recommendation was made by the survey team, it was only natural for the Pigs and Bacon Commission to ask if there was anything in it.  The Commission knew there were a number of weaknesses in the present system which, if they could either be eliminated or tightened up, would have a beneficial effect on the producers, the curers and, indeed, on every section of the community.</P>
    <P>We all know there are a good many factories in the country and that they are not taxed to capacity.  They have to keep staff on hands and try to provide them with continuity of employment. Otherwise, their staffs would move to other centres.  Many of these factories cannot say from week to week what the intake of pigs will be.  Unless they make some plans of their own with dealers, the supply position might be uncertain.  In such circumstances, their overheads would be tremendously high.</P>
    <P>These are not all the difficulties of the present system.  A further formidable problem arises in this way.  One week you may have a small supply of pigs and the butchers can be careful because they have plenty of time to do a good job.  Maybe next week the supply is doubled.  Then the work is more or less rushed, and, I feel, cannot be done with the same degree of care. When we got complaints in the Department from British customers about the butchering of the pig, I often wondered <Col N="993" /> why that should be so.  I was certain that our people here are just as capable as the people of any other country when it comes to doing a neat job.  But when you look at it from this aspect, you see it is possible, where men are rushed, that the job might not be done as well as it otherwise might be.  All these matters were present in the minds of the members of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission included representatives of the producers.  They would not be likely to take kindly to suddenly making a decision whereby the whole pattern of the purchasing of pigs would be altered.  There was no need to give the impression that, because the Commission decided, as they were bound to, to sift every one of these recommendations, this scheme was going to be operated.  Even if they agree to it, which would be most unlikely having regard to the composition of the Commission, it would have to come to me; and I could see the tremendous confusion and difficulty that would arise in the operation of any such scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not know, in fact, how any suitable or workable scheme could be devised.  However, there is a further reason for a different approach to the methods followed by bacon factories up to now.  Under the present methods, a very high percentage of the pigs going into the factories are not graded at all.  They are not graded in the ordinary way as they go in, because they do not come direct from the producer but are bought on some other basis from dealers.  They might be graded after they are cured, but if they go in through dealers, there would not be any need for grading at the admission stage if there were an arrangement that they were being bought on a level per cwt. basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>He can grade the sides afterwards.  The difficulty is that no producer knows how his pigs will fare under such circumstances.  That is the objection to that system&mdash;it is of no importance from the point of view of giving a lesson to the producer as to what grade his pigs will make.  He simply sells them by hand.  They are sold, if you like, by hand from the dealer to the curer and all the other processes mean nothing to the producer from an educational point of view.  I think it will be admitted that that is not a desirable state of affairs if a suitable alternative fair method could be found but I know the difficulties that exist in that respect and to get such alternative method would be a tremendously tough proposition.</P>
      <P>There was no need, therefore, to get excited about this thing because it was not likely to get through.  Even though a recommendation was made to that effect by the survey team, there were a lot of obstacles to be contended with before anybody should get it into his head that a central purchasing scheme would be operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt in my opening remarks with the recent discussions with the British in regard to the sharing of the market for bacon and pork and I have told the House that the arrangements were reasonably satisfactory from our point of view.  I often hear Deputies talking about all the advantages that would arise from rationalisation of markets, the introduction of quotas, and so on.  Of course they are all right to the extent that they are aimed at securing more uniform marketing conditions and more even prices in the markets but at the same time I dread the mention of the introduction of a quota system against the products of agriculture because very often mention of the quota system conveys the imsio <Col N="995" /> pression that it will tie one down to a level of production that would leave the industry in a straitjacket, so to speak.  Where the arrangement does not have that limiting effect, it is not objectionable and in that regard we have fared reasonably well in this arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is no quota, is there, on fresh pork going into Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Only on bacon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  As Deputies are aware, questions were put to me yesterday in regard to pig fattening farms, as they were called.  A number have been established, most of them associated with a creamery society but some of them independently.  They have been supported both by grant and by loan facilities.  A question addressed to me yesterday concerned the availability of loans to these societies and whether or not the Government were prepared to guarantee these loans.  I explained that I consider that this development is all right, is something that is coming and will be useful and it was because we in the Department realised that some years ago that we introduced the grants system.  Up to this the maximum building grant any person engaging in the finishing of pigs could receive was £50.  I saw one of these centres being constructed and decided that the grant system should be extended to such centres on a much more generous basis.</P>
      <P>While that is all right in its own way, there are certain dangers also.  I have always been afraid that if there was very extensive development of such centres, it might involve the elimination of the traditional method of keeping and finishing pigs.  That method may have its drawbacks but it was a source of income to many people and I would be hesitant about taking any step that I thought would result in weakening the position of those who look to the finishing of pigs as a source of income for themselves and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> There is also the other point that when some change like this is taking place, there are all sorts of groups coming together and deciding that they will establish a pig-finishing unit.  It may be a co-operative or it might even be a company.  Some of these cases have come to our notice.  As I said at Question Time yesterday, it is necessary that those who co-operate in a matter of this nature should have some reasonable stake in the concern, especially in the case where a pig-finishing centre is established independently of any other activity, such as a creamery society.</P>
    <P>In the case of a centre that is established in connection with a creamery society, there are a manager and assistants and there is supervision of everything going on within that limited space.  In the case where the piggery is out on its own&mdash;and I have seen some of them&mdash;it is not easy to be sure that the supervision and the management are adequate to the job.  If the persons establishing a centre for such a purpose have not some financial interest in it, it is very easy for them to slip out. Neither the Department of Agriculture nor the Agricultural Credit Corporation could run these places.</P>
    <P>I have expressed my view to persons whom I met and who had these intentions. When they told me what their proposals were and what the commitment on their side would be, I said: &ldquo;That is not reasonable.&rdquo;  It is the job of the Credit Corporation to decide these matters, and so they do, but if they are not satisfied because the amount of the commitment on the part of the promoters is not enough, they come to us and say: &ldquo;We would be prepared to give a loan if they made a reasonable effort but if they do not, we cannot give a loan without a guarantee.&rdquo;  It is not good business to consider a proposal like that.  The line we have taken in the Department and the line that has been taken by the Credit Corporation is that where some reasonable minimum contribution is made by the promoter there will be no difficulty about obtaining accommodation by way of loans.</P>
    <P>The remarks I have made about <Col N="997" /> the survey team's report in regard to bacon apply also in the matter of the dairying report.  This report was received from the team and we put it in the hands of the public.  After the study group had been called together and the different organisations represented there had shown they were not likely to give any sort of firm judgment on any of the recommendations, our anxiety was to get it into the hands of the public.  I do not know what exact words were used but we said something to the effect that the fact that the report was being circulated involved no commitment either on the part of the study group or the Government in regard to the recommendations.</P>
    <P>In regard to all these study groups, especially in the case of farming organisations, there is naturally a fair share of fencing.  I hope the House will understand what I mean by &ldquo;fencing.&rdquo;  One organisation is watching the other as to what course it will take on a recommendation.  Sometimes &mdash;not always&mdash;I suppose, the attitude of one organisation is influenced, however slightly, by the expression of opinion of its rival.  Anyhow we have found some study groups very hesitant about giving firm opinions in regard to these questions.</P>
    <P>As I say, there was no justification whatever for the creation of a feeling that we were just going out with the sledgehammer to batter down small units and to force creamery organisations into larger units, and so on. Nothing was further from our minds because, just as in other matters other men will have opinions on the wisdom of different courses which will differ from those of the people who make the recommendations.</P>
    <P>May I say that the report of the survey team was a very good and interesting report and it had that liveliness about it that even if you did not feel like accepting the recommendations&mdash;and I am only expressing my personal attitude when I say this&mdash;you were stimulated by it.  Some reports are tiresome and heavy to read but this survey team's report could not be so described.  However, there was no effort made&mdash;nor is there often an effort made in respect of recommendations <Col N="998" /> of an important and far-reaching nature&mdash;to prove that what is recommended would be more economic than what is there.  It is all right to be critical of seeing a man with a horse and cart down in Limerick going with four or five cans or maybe less, apparently losing his morning, and coming back with the skim but while that may appear to be wasteful, some effort would have to be made to calculate what the result of another system would be.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to get everybody's opinion on the report.  No decision has been made yet by the Government but decisions will have to be made on a number of these recommendations and we want to get the widest possible criticisms, be they favourable or hostile, of the recommendations that are in that document.</P>
    <P>Dealing with milk in general, I find it very encouraging to see the tendency to increased milk production that has been showing itself consistently now over a number of years.  I remember when the bovine tuberculosis effort was being intensified, the case was being made by some Deputies and by people outside the House, too, for a substantial increase in the price of milk because of the number of cows that would be lost as a result of the incidence of the disease in certain parts of the dairying districts.  All kinds of fears were expressed about the inability to find replacements for all these cows and there were doleful stories told and doleful prophecies made as to the effect this scheme would have on the creamery industry, on milk production and on the income of those farmers who depend on the creamery cheque. It is pleasant then to see that steadily, year after year, the volume of milk has been increasing, notwithstanding the fact that since 1958 we have removed from those six counties that are still to be completed more than 500,000 cows.</P>
    <P>It is not so depressing to find that in the same period, after removing that number of cows plus the number that would normally go out of herds because of mastitis, the number of cows has increased since 1958 by 40,000.  It is not a big increase, but for as long as I have been watching the <Col N="999" /> cow population figures, they were always a source of disappointment because they never seemed to move. The figure was always around the million mark or the 1,200,000 mark. That is what has been happening in the past four or five years when all the prophets had said cow numbers would decline, that replacements were not there and that milk production would be reduced.  It is encouraging to see this development.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased with the developments in the west of Ireland.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I know you may not be interested in hearing this from me.  I am a very modest man and I want to say to you that when people do not praise me, and very seldom is the Minister for Agriculture praised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am always joking some of the people I meet&mdash;public men, members of county committees of agriculture and delegates to their General Council, members of farming bodies.  Sometimes we meet at functions when the relationship is not strained and I always warn them not to praise the Minister for Agriculture, not to say nice things about him.  They barely take the risk of praising Departmental officials or of complimenting them for their courtesy.  Of course the Minister is very often much more courteous than the officials, though I have nothing but good to say of officials in all Departments.</P>
      <P>However, be that as it may, I feel inclined to praise myself because of this development in the west of Ireland in the past few years.  I shall take credit for the development of the creamery business in the west.  I must say I really did not think at the beginning it would achieve this degree of success in such a short space of time.  I remember an occasion when the Secretary of my Department and I talked about things in general and about the west and the small farms there in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On occasions when I motored though parts of the west of Ireland <Col N="1000" /> where the land is reasonably good, I could never understand why there had not been there some development along the lines of the co-operative movement, that people had not been brought around to try to make some better use of the land than they appeared to be making of it.  I thought there should be more cows and different breeds of cows, that real improvement could not come there without the introduction of the co-operative movement, of the creamery organisation.  I thought if you had such a movement there, you could build around it some additions that would be helpful to the economy of that place.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I talked it over with the Secretary of my Department and we agreed the position was as I have said.  From that point we moved on and Deputies are aware of the progress that has been made.  Of course it was not easy to face an expansion programme there.  It would not only be costly from the point of view of the taxpayer but it would face difficulties from the marketing point of view.  I claim a good deal of credit for the development there, for the way in which business there is moving.  The House is aware that the Dairy Disposal Company made an offer to start there and develop the west.  After some time, the IAOS came to me and said: &ldquo;We will do this.&rdquo;  I was not so certain at the time, but after discussions I said to them: &ldquo;All right; we do not want to go in there ourselves at all but I should like to see somebody do it.&rdquo;  They have gone in there and though it is only a matter of a couple of years, the results are very promising.</P>
    <P>People are very often inclined to ask what has been the outcome of this or that recommendation.  I would point out that in these matters it takes time to get results.  Not only in the west but throughout the country in general, the development of the creamery business, in areas where it was unknown or where it was known only to a limited extent, has been going on.  The Mullingar Central Creamery opened in 1962; the Tullamore separating station opened in 1963; the Mount Temple separating station is to open in 1963.</P>

      <P>Killimor is in County Galway and I think that is in the west. <Col N="1002" /> There is a place called Belmullet also in the west which is to get a separating station in 1964.  Killimor is scheduled for 1964.  Castlebar, County Mayo&mdash; that was in 1962.  We have applications for Rathscanlon Co-op, Ballina; Ballymahon, County Longford; Edgeworthstown; Shinrone, Offaly; Ballinrobe, County Mayo.  New factories for the processing of milk include Rathduff cheese factory, which is manufacturing an English type of cheese for the British market.  That was established in 1962.  There is the Condensed Milk Company, Limerick which began large-scale production of Cheddar cheese for the British market in 1960; Wexford Creameries Ltd., operated now by Unigate; McCormick Brothers, Killeshandra, making calf-feed and ice-cream powder based on milk powder; Golden Vale, Charleville, commenced making milk powder in 1962 and another company at Mallow in 1961&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some Labour Deputies mentioned McCormick's and made the case that the firm could use much more skim milk at present than was usual heretofore.  Some southern Deputies seem to think that we had not sufficient skim milk in that area. Taking not only Killeshandra and all separating stations attached to that society, but also others convenient, Lough Egish, Ballyhaise, Monaghan town, Bailieborough, Kilnaleck and so on, the availability of milk there would be about 35 million gallons per year at present.  The southern Deputies, apparently, were making the complaint that the industry was established in a place where the availability of skim was limited.  There is nothing further from the truth: there is no question of limitation in that sense.</P>
      <P>So far as I am told by the concern itself and other sources, the firm is getting all the skim milk it could use. The factory was not fully completed and it was not in a position to take the maximum amount of skim at first. Suddenly, at the end of the season, the position arose that McCormick's could handle more skim milk.  But this occurred at the wrong time of the year. When a concern wants to get skim, it must make contact with different creameries whose managers must make contact with suppliers because some suppliers will be glad to dispose of skim and some, unless the price is very attractive, will prefer to use it for pigfeeding, calf-rearing and so on.  I shall not deal with this in any detail: I just want it on record since the other story, which is entirely incorrect, is also on record.  I want to demonstrate that there is no question of a shortage of milk and that Killeshandra itself without considering any other centres, could handle about ten million gallons in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are developments in which I have taken a good deal of interest and in which the Department and I feel a sort of pride.  We are only at the beginning of this type of development and, while anybody with <Col N="1004" /> a fair knowledge of the world will not suggest that the way is all clear for the disposal of milk products yet, it is the kind of development that will mean a lot to these areas.  It is a development which can provide other opportunities to enable people to get a better income and a better living.</P>
    <P>I referred in my opening speech to the credit policy announced by Deputy Dillon here on a few occasions.  I suspected things were not what they appeared to be in regard to that policy but I was anxious to have it on record that they were not what the ordinary man, reading the statements in the newspapers, would be inclined to believe.  I knew this interest-free loan business was bound to have snags. Otherwise it would be complete madness to think you could announce interest-free loans of £1,000 to farmers. It just could not be done.  Who would not take one of these interest-free loans?  Therefore there had to be conditions.  What were they?  They were not made very clear.</P>

They devoted their time to a few individuals here and there and their time was taken up, first, in preparing and, then, in supervising these grandiose schemes, while people who were prepared to do their own work and take advantage of the assistance that was rightly available to them for doing that work could not get any plans at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I could foresee, of course, that you would have one approach with a prepared scheme, by one of the agricultural advisers, and that would result in each agricultural adviser just planning for ten or 12 people in his district.  He would prepare the scheme for the ten or 12 and concentrate on supervising it and there would be 700 or 800 farmers who would have a claim on his time also but he would have no time to give them.</P>

I know of county committees of agriculture who have devoted the funds available for demonstrations to a few farms in their counties. Perhaps that appeared attractive to some people but it did not appear attractive from the point of view of the general public.  I want to say that if a political Party or a Government feel like making a contribution towards a section of the community such as the farmers, it should be done clearly and the full implications should be made known.</P>

      <P>Let me recount this experience.  I went to the Department to do some simple work on behalf of the late Tom Walsh, signing documents of one sort or another and I saw there were there a few parliamentary questions, one of which concerned the B Section.  This was the first one I handled.  It was an inquiry by a Deputy about when a man would have his scheme vetted and when the work could be undertaken.  I also saw the reply.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not as stated.  The Deputy has apparently misread the statistics recently published by the British Oversea Migration Board; those statistics do not purport to be statistics of Irish emigration to Britain&mdash;they are figures of <Col N="1009" /> persons from this country who have registered or re-registered for National Insurance in Britain.  For a comment on similar statistics, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question in this House on the 4th May, 1961.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to compile completely reliable net emigration statistics for other than intercensal periods.  The best available indication of the trend of emigration from year to year is to be found in the statistics of passenger movements in and out of the country by sea and air.  These statistics are available monthly up to and including October, 1963, but, in view of the seasonal nature of the traffic, it would be misleading to give figures for periods of less than a year.  For the year ended the 31st October, 1963, the net outward passenger balances by sea and air to all destinations came to 14,520, as compared with 18,720 for the year ended 31st October, 1962.</P>

      <P>The information collected monthly in respect of the residence of registrants at the Local Offices of the Department of Social Welfare only distinguishes between those living in administrative towns and in the remainder of each county.  It is not, therefore, possible to identify from these records those exchanges which serve (a) the Dublin County Constituency or (b) the Ballyfermot area.  It can, however, be stated that on 30th November, 1963 registrants living in Dublin County Borough were recorded in the following offices: Gardiner Street, Werburgh Street, Victoria Street and Northumberland House.  Registrants living in Dublin County were on the same date recorded in the following offices: Gardiner Street, Werburgh Street, Victoria Street, Northumberland House, Dún Laoghaire, Bray and Balbriggan.</P>

      <P>The period in which the provisions of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956 came into operation in relation to the remission of taxation on profits from exports of any Company depends on the first year of claim selected by that Company.  Since this varies from Company to Company it is not possible to select definitively any single appropriate year for the information which the Deputy requires.  On the whole, however, it appears appropriate to give the data asked for for the calendar year 1956.  In that year the value of total exports was £108,126,933.  No information is available regarding the number of exporters.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving (a) the national average retail prices of certain items of food at mid-November, 1961 and mid-August, 1963 and the actual change in each case and (b) the percentage change over the period in the prices of all the items entering into the Consumer Price Index numbers. In the case of some food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful.  The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive enquiries.  Price quotations in respect of some items of food are not available from all centres at each enquiry and the figures for the percentage changes in these prices, computed in such a way as to eliminate the effect of differences in coverage, may differ slightly from the percentage calculated from the actual changes.</P>
      <P>In comparing prices at mid-November and mid-August, it must be remembered that prices of certain food items fluctuate seasonally and that allowance must be made for this factor.</P>
      <P>The compilation of the data for mid-November, 1963 is not yet completed but it is hoped to have the results available next week.</P>

      <P>In general, qualifications for nurses in local authority institutions and in the Central Mental Hospital, which is the only hospital under my jurisdiction, provide that any person holding a nursing office must be registered in the appropriate division of the Register of Nurses kept by An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>Under their Rules, An Bord Altranais recognise for purposes of registration qualifications of nurses trained in institutions in Great Britain and Northern Ireland approved by the registration authorities there.  In the cases of nurses trained in other countries I understand that it is the practice of the Board to consider each case on its merits.  When the Board admit to registration, the persons concerned are eligible for appointment to the same extent as nurses trained in Irish hospitals but subject, of course, where appropriate to the requirements of the Immigration Acts.</P>

      <P>I understand that the main reason for this is the heavy incidence of pneumonia and bronchial infections.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that, in a political advertisement appearing in the public press of 4th December, a reference is made to the Government's plans for better health services; and whether he will state what their plans are; and if they have been brought to the notice of the Select Committee on the Health Services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen this advertisement and I am glad that the Deputy has taken heed of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> The Government consider that the present system of health services provides a satisfactory basis for developments and improvements, such as are envisaged by the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and by a recent statement of the Taoiseach. That the health services, like any human institution, can be improved is not, however, questioned, and that the Government are alive to this will be evident from their decisions to establish, in special fields, the Commissions on Mental Illness and Mental Handicap and, on the general plane, by their sponsoring the motion to establish the Select Committee on the Health Services.</P>
    <P>In May, 1962, there was presented to the Select Committee a 100-page document entitled <i>Memorandum from the Department of Health describing the Irish Health Services.</i>  This describes how the present services have evolved, how they are financed and administered and what general principles have been behind their development.  This book describes each of the present services and itemises the matters which the Select Committee might consider in relation to it.  For example, on the General Medical Service, it lists for consideration:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The limit for eligibility for the service;</P>
    <P>(2)  The arrangements for determining eligibility;</P>
    <P>(3)  The practicability of a choice of doctor and the consequential arrangements which would be required to be made with existing and additional personnel;</P>
    <P>(4)  The estimation of the cost of any extension or modification;</P>
    <P>(5)  Any changes needed in the system for supplying drugs, appliances and medicines under the service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have considered myself to be uninhibited in quoting from this document as, with the consent of the Select Committee, I have already circulated copies of it to all members of this House and of An Seanad.  There are numerous other Committee documents and statistical tables submitted by myself and my Department which I cannot yet quote from in this House but <Col N="1022" /> which, the Deputy will know, have put before the Committee as much as we could give it of the facts on the present system and, without commitment, the possible lines of its development. &ldquo;Without commitment&rdquo;, I say, because it was inherent in my approach to the Committee's work that I and other members from this side of the House should not endeavour to bulldoze a preconceived plan through it, but that we should approach our work with open minds.</P>
    <P>When the Committee reports and its documents are published, it will be obvious that the Government had a clear, co-ordinated and responsible approach to the Committee's work and assisted it greatly by explaining and clarifying where necessary its policies. One wonders will it ever be possible to say the same of the nebulous scheme of which the Deputy has recently spoken but of which his colleagues in the Committee have heard only the haziest outline.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the Deputy, in reply to a question yesterday, that the Dublin Health Authority provides shelter and maintenance in several of their hospitals and homes for persons who are unable to provide those services for themselves or their dependants.  I have assumed that the information which the Deputy now seeks relates to the Island Street premises and Griffith Barracks.</P>
      <P>On 5th instant, there were eight families, eight husbands with their wives and 17 children, in the Island Street premises and there were 19 women and 12 children in Griffith Barracks.</P>
      <P>There is an implication, which the Deputy may not have intended, in the phraseology of the question that the type of accommodation provided for these persons who are without permanent homes at present is grossly inferior.  Any such inference would be incorrect and unfair to the health authority.  The health authority discharges its statutory obligations when it ensures that no person who is homeless is left without a bed in clean and reasonably comfortable surroundings; but it has not the function to provide, at the public expense, superior family accommodation for all who may seek it and cannot reasonably be expected to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The information at my disposal does not indicate the existence of any special difficulties in the provision of general hospital accommodation for persons in the Dublin North-East area.</P>
      <P>The provision of a hospital to meet the needs of this area would represent a very heavy financial commitment and as it would probably have to be met by the Health Authority, the expenses associated with the construction and maintenance of such an institution would bear heavily on the citizens of Dublin mainly as ratepayers. Owing to the heavy commitments on the Hospitals Trust Fund, assistance from that source could not be counted upon for such a purpose. The Fund is already providing grants for the building of a new St. Vincent's Hospital at Elm Park and for a new Coombe Hospital.</P>
      <P>In Dublin City and County there are already 30 separate public hospitals, including fifteen general hospitals, and in my view there would be no justification, in the absence of demonstrated need, for imposing on the ratepayers the added burden of providing still another institution.</P>

Employees on this Estate, with the exception of tradesmen who are paid the local trade union rates, are agricultural workers whose wages are determined by reference to rates prescribed by the Agricultural Wages Board.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The discharge by the Dublin Corporation of its functions under the dangerous buildings code must be governed primarily by consideration for the lives and safety of the occupants and the public.

Is he aware that notwithstanding those solemn assurances, the Corporation has failed to honour that undertaking and the premises have not yet been demolished in whole or in part?  Is he further aware that a threat is now being issued this very day that the work will commence tomorrow, thereby compelling the shopkeeper in question to close down at the very time in respect of which the undertaking was given in court that he would be left open?

Acquisition proceedings in respect of two properties aggregating 275 acres, at Balscadden and other townlands in the Balbriggan district, are in the final stages: in fact, possession arrangements have been made for today.  In addition, two small areas, namely, 36 acres in the Tallaght district and eight acres in Rush are pending for allotment following exchanges.  There will be no avoidable delay in the disposal of these lands which will be allocated, as far as practicable by next spring.</P>

      <P>The member in question was on annual <Col N="1057" /> training in Gormanston Camp from 17th to 30th June, 1961.  He was, therefore, on training for nine days before he reported sick on 26th June, 1961. He has never given any indication as to how he incurred the disabilities&mdash; cracked ribs and slipped disc&mdash;for which he claimed compensation.  As I said in my reply on 27th November, 1963, compensation is payable to members of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil only if they are injured in the course of training.  As I have no evidence that he was injured in such circumstances, I regret that I cannot reconsider his claim for compensation.</P>

He, among others, went to a dance in Drogheda.  I assume that something happened at the dance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might consult one of his colleagues on this matter.  The position is, as the Deputy is aware, that in all these cases I take all the relative and surrounding circumstances into consideration in arriving at a decision.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not also equally desirable that where there has been a remission of sentence in respect of a peculiarly obnoxious type of crime in a fishery area, the Minister should take the precaution of saying that in this particular situation very exceptional circumstances obtained to which he had regard? Surely people should be put on notice that in a fishery area the user of cymag for poisoning rivers <Col N="1063" /> for profit is looked upon by the Oireachtas, the judiciary, and authority generally, as a grave offence which ordinarily would not be regarded as one suitable for remission of sentence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of Order, so far as I am concerned, nothing ever passed between me and the officials of the Department of Agriculture that I would not be very pleased to have posted on Nelson Pillar.  I do not believe that the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture adversely criticised my administration to the present Minister, or to the late Deputy Tom Walsh, but whether he did or not, I want to submit that the administration of Government will become wholly impossible if the permanent head of the Department cannot freely and frankly discuss the business of <Col N="1066" /> the Department with the political head of the Department, the Minister, without apprehending that such private conversations will subsequently be used in this House to denigrate the Minister's successor or predecessor.  I suggest to the Minister that this practice of purporting to quote private conversations with official advisers is obnoxious and gravely detrimental to decent administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy really understood what I was trying to convey.  It was not intended at all as a criticism of any of my predecessors but to illustrate a practice that was to my mind misleading inasmuch as a certain stock reply was being given to a certain type of question.  When I came into the Department to act in a temporary capacity for a colleague, I saw this reply.  I had good knowledge of the subject to which it referred and I merely made an inquiry about its full meaning.  When I got the explanation, I at once dictated an alternative reply on the telephone to the official concerned which I thought represented the situation from the point of view of the Deputy seeking information on behalf of a constituent and was far more accurate than the one that had been in use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly would not depart from any standards or make use of conversations that take place between officials or attempt to attribute any such behaviour to any predecessor of mine. This is an entirely legitimate matter. When I left the House after giving the reply which I had designed, the <Col N="1067" /> individual concerned said: &ldquo;I am very glad that that reply has been given.  It is far more accurate than the replies we have been giving in the past to the same question&rdquo;.</P>

The Minister must know that every Parliamentary question to which a draft answer is prepared passes from the Section to the Secretary's office and it is vetted by the Secretary's office and suggested to the Minister as a suitable reply.  The Minister comes in and gives that answer on his own authority and answers for it.  The clear implication of what the Minister is purporting to say is that on a particular day he left the House and met the Secretary of the Department who said that he rejoiced that the Minister had changed the form of an answer that had habitually been given by his predecessor in office because the previous form of answer was calculated to deceive and now a new form had been worked out which told the truth.  I do not believe the Secretary ever said any such thing but if he did, he was entitled to say it in confidence to the Minister and not have it repeated in Dáil Éireann.  Otherwise the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture can discuss nothing with the Minister lest he walk in and repeat it in my presence or anybody else's.</P>

I have the right to change it and I have changed thousands in my time because I did not think they were the type of replies that should be given.  In this case, a certain reply became standard.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very well what my responsibilities are and I will observe the code as well as any other individual in this House or outside it. What I am attempting to explain was why I did not leave in the standard type of reply when I knew that there might be thousands of applications under a particular scheme and the one concerned in the question might not be reached for three, four or five years.  When the type of reply which indicated that this applicant would be dealt with in the order of priority came to me, I considered that it was not enough in a case of that kind.  I think a Minister is bound not only to say that but also to say that the case may not be reached for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was because I changed the reply <Col N="1070" /> so that it indicated clearly the position in this case that the gentleman in question made the remark that he was glad that that form of reply was put in because the other form of reply was not really accurate.  The first form was accurate for the reason that the application would be dealt with in the order of priority but it did not say when it would be reached.  It was better to convey the information that it might not be reached for a long time.  It is nonsense to suggest that in relating that story, I was departing from the decent standards and practices that are well known.  If a Minister points to an incident like that, it cannot and should not be taken as criticism of any kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Schemes decided on by Government Departments, and the Department of Agriculture in particular, should be as simple as possible. My criticism of the interest-free loans scheme expounded by Deputy Dillon is that it has that defect.  That is why, in fact, I told the story that I did tell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister sorry he told it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is not easy to make all schemes simple.  Indeed, that would be impossible because one has to try to provide against all sorts of possibilities.  If one looks, however, at the availability of credit and how credit facilities have been expanding, the farmer has been fairly well served in that regard in recent years both through the banks and through the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  One of the best schemes introduced was the <Col N="1071" /> unsecured loans made available by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, loans of £200 where the farmer applies direct and loans of £400 where the farmer is supported by a co-operative society.</P>
      <P>Although that scheme has been in operation only 12 months the Corporation are now expanding it and they will in future make unsecured loans of £400 available direct on application from a farmer or a loan of £500 where the application is supported by a local Co-operative Society. I do not think there are many farmers &mdash;I am thinking now of comparatively small farmers&mdash;who will not find that sum adequate for their needs.  Special types of development might require more capital but I believe the amended scheme will make a tremendous difference in making available credit in all cases and under the simplest conditions. That is what farmers in general like.</P>
      <P>Interest-free loans as abumbrated by Deputy Dillon are another matter. Deputy N. Egan pointed out that it is not so long ago&mdash;ten or 12 years&mdash; that I introduced interest-free loans for farmers after the disastrous losses in sheep during the snow storms of 1947.  Deputy Dillon was quoted here by Deputy Egan; he spoke in very uncertain terms about the wisdom of these interest-free moneys.  A man is, of course, entitled to change his mind. I merely make the reference.  I had forgotten the matter until I heard Deputy Egan give the quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see the quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the records. There was some discussion on the heifer scheme.  I was not present for all of it, but Deputy Egan dealt with the scheme in great detail today.  The main criticism of the scheme was that it would be of no use to the small farmer; that he had not the carrying capacity; that most of them who were creamery milk suppliers probably had a herd equal to the amount of land available, and so on.  The one thing those who criticise the scheme forgot is that the scheme is designed to increase the cattle population over a <Col N="1072" /> stated number of years up to 1970. Deputy Dillon made a forecast, a justifiable forecast.  He said he did not believe the objectives set out could be attained.  I agree the objectives are fairly ambitious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives are fairly ambitious.  While I have no doubt the means are there to achieve them, naturally I cannot swear that they will be achieved, but I certainly believe the introduction of this scheme will have a considerable influence on increasing the cattle stocks in the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied about the quality of the stock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme was not designed for the small farmer or the large farmer.  It was designed to increase cattle stocks by a certain number by a certain time.  No matter what scheme is introduced, whether it be for farm buildings, land reclamation, the installation of water, the fertilisation of land, one will always find a number of people who have already made progress to the extent outlined in the scheme under their own steam.  They have a new house.  They have good outoffices.  They have improved their land.  They have the land in good condition.  One might just as well say a scheme should not be introduced because every land owner will not benefit from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this scheme I was quite conscious of the fact that it would probably induce farmers who do not now keep cows to do so.  I was furthermore conscious of the fact that, if we could not induce people who had no cows to come in, then we could not reach the objectives set out.  Every objective will be attained provided we get the response.  Deputies know we are spending a great deal of money to encourage farmers to use more fertilisers, to improve their land, increase its carrying capacity, and so on.  Surely it is a sensible course to encourage them to increase their livestock numbers in order to take full advantage of the progress that is being <Col N="1073" /> made and that will continue to be made in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I have read discussions by different committees of agriculture and statements by different people who seem to misunderstand the scheme entirely. It is not designed for any particular class of farmer.  It is designed for everybody.  It is designed to improve the economy.  The small farmer, even if he has the number of cows already that he is capable of handling, will benefit through the availability of customers for his heifers.  One may not benefit to the same extent as another, but benefits of some degree will certainly accrue to all.  It is the overall position we are aiming at; it is that position we are seeking to improve so that, instead of exporting 1,000,000 or 1,150,000 cattle we will export 1,500,000.  That is the goal to aim at and, if we achieve it, our economy will improve to that extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry and other speakers referred to a matter which is scarcely relevant to this debate, but I should like to make a few comments.  They were speaking in connection with the development by the Sugar Company of vegetables and fruit processing.  The Sugar Company have taken on this task.  It is a tremendously interesting effort.  If it is successful, it will be of great importance to the country.  The future development should be largely left to the company that has taken the initiative.  The question of the availability of grants was raised here.  The State has given generous support in the way of guaranteed credit for this development work.  When you consider the various projects mooted all over the country, that is not an easy matter for a body like An Foras Tionscal to handle.  They would not be the best judges in the world as to the line of development that should be followed, the locality and all the rest of it.  An effort is being made at present to find means by which the shifting of these applications would be left to a body such as the Sugar Company or Erin Foods themselves rather than being handled through an organisation like An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>We are all interested deeply in this <Col N="1074" /> venture.  There is plenty of competition to be met.  I am sure that not everything will be as successful as we would like it to be.  But it is better, while giving all the encouragement we can, that we should be hesitant about being critical of this or that approach. After all, they are merely looking around for the proper approach so that the effort will be successful.</P>
    <P>Deputies on this Estimate each year are inclined to be depressing in their comments on the state of affairs in the country.  I enjoyed listening to a Deputy who said I had been very subdued when presenting the Estimate. It is not often I get the headings, but on the <i>Farmer's Journal</i> the following day I read: &ldquo;Minister's Fighting Speech&rdquo;.  I asked myself whether they or the Deputy who described my speech as subdued was correct.</P>
    <P>Without being boastful, I think there are many indications to show the tremendous progress made in agriculture over the years.  We hear of the difficulty of purchasing land or even renting land; the cost and the demand for it; the price land makes.  Apart altogether from this talk about the few foreigners who bought up a bit of land, we know the price land makes purchased by our own people.  Surely all these things are indicative of progress? The young fellows coming on to the land now perhaps have a different approach from those who went before them.  When you think of them, when you think of all the provisions being made to help and encourage them, do not all these things point in the right direction? If we could get the majority of our farmers to do better the things they do by tradition, we would make great strides in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>You only have to look at the country in which you were reared to see what progress has been made, for example, in housing, farm buildings, drainage.  In a short time I will be announcing an improved scheme of farm building grants.  I do not know of any other policy one can pursue. If we could get our agricultural advisers and the people of the land to row together along the lines I have indicated, I see no reason why the <Col N="1075" /> progress that undoubtedly has been made should not continue and be greatly accelerated in the future.</P>
    <P>As I said before, agriculture is not spectacular.  You cannot assemble results in one place and say: &ldquo;That is what we have achieved.&rdquo;  The results are scattered all over the country&mdash; the results of what the Department have been trying to do for agriculture in the past and of what, I hope, they will continue to do in the future.  I do not see any reason to be pessimistic.  I do not believe half the stories I hear about farmers either here or elsewhere. I know farmers have to work hard while other sections of the community, because of the way they are organised, can extract advantages which cannot be obtained by farmers. But, notwithstanding that, notwithstanding views firmly held, such as those we have heard from Deputy Corry, there is no reason to be as depressing as some Deputies are.</P>
    <P>I was being asked, for example, about beet and the best acreage and what could be done for those who would not be permitted to grow the acreage they were willing to grow. However, I am informed by the Sugar Company that there is one factory that cannot get an adequate supply of beet. That seems a very strange thing because the area in which it is located should have labour sufficient and land sufficient to meet the requirements.  A lot of harm can be done by public men speaking in that depressing way to those who I know have difficulties. Small farmers anywhere, whether it is in the west, the north, or the south, have a tough struggle but if public men depress them by telling them they have no living, that there is no future for them, such an approach is not designed to give us the results we all wish for and towards the achievement of which we all, I hope, try to make some contribution.</P>
    <P>I do not feel at all like that.  In the areas I know best&mdash;and they are no different from areas in most other parts of the country&mdash;tremendous advances have been made over the years.  I can sense in the atmosphere around a far <Col N="1076" /> keener awareness of the importance of taking advantage of all the schemes designed to help farmers.  I look to the future with confidence that progress at an accelerated rate will be made in this important industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister two questions? First, is he prepared to say anything on the subject of milk prices or the matter of the continued collection of the levy to which I referred when speaking on his Estimate? Secondly the Minister may remember I directed his attention to the problem of the new quarantine proposal and I asked him whether it is unchanged in international quarantine agreements. My recollection is that when I was in office, I was advised that if you had a quarantine station on your territory, even situated on an island, and an outbreak of a notifiable disease occurred in the quarantine station, you would lose your international reputation for being free of that disease; whereas if your quarantine station were in Great Britain, the Isle of Man, or some territory not immediately under Irish jurisdiction, you could just as effectively operate quarantine without putting the country's reputation in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, there never was an international agreement or acceptance of the point Deputy Dillon made in the course of his remarks in the Estimate.  I said in my speech that we consulted the veterinary people in America and not only that but they actually came over here and inspected the place, and we took all the precautions that could possibly be taken before arriving at this decision. That is really all I can tell the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second matter, milk prices seem to be always a political question.  I cannot prevent that and I do not want to, as far as that goes. Let Deputies rip away and make the question as political as they like. However, I have repeatedly explained the position and I explained it here the other day in reply to a parliamentary question in which I said that the idea of the levy was recommended by the advisory body on agricultural marketing. <Col N="1077" /> Dr. Greene, the President of the NFA was chairman of that committee. Mr. Feely, who is now President of the ICMSA, was also a member of it.  Mr. Mooney of the NFA was also a member and there was another farmer representative whose name I cannot now remember, as well as Mr. Barry who is Secretary of the Creamery Managers Association.</P>
    <P>This committee made this recommendation before Bord Bainne was established.  It was on the basis of this recommendation that An Bord Bainne was founded.  I thought that recommendation was a sound one and I still think it.  The idea of establishing a board composed largely of producers' representatives and saying to that Board: &ldquo;You have the responsibility of marketing any surplus milk products there are&rdquo;, and at the same time saying to this body: &ldquo;The Exchequer will carry the cost fully of all you spend in doing that&rdquo;&mdash;I do not think that is a reasonable approach nor do this committee, because they recommended to me, without any dissentient, this proposal.  I am not sheltering behind that proposal because it was made in that form but I am mentioning the fact that it was made by such a committee and that I personally agree with that principle.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is a levy does not at any time deter a Government from examining and reviewing the price of milk if they can make financial provision for increasing the price.  However, it is not fair or frank to say that milk prices should be increased because, say, the butter market and the milk products market are better now and the amount of subsidy is not as large as it was.  That may be a condition existing for only a few months.  Who knows what the market will be in future? As far as Europe is concerned, outside Britain, since the market was regulated by this new quota system, the prices obtainable for milk products are very low indeed and there is no justification for anybody saying&mdash; I do not care who he is or where he speaks&mdash;that we can look forward with complete freedom and ease as regards these products.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to say that these fears <Col N="1078" /> should influence us unduly or prevent our taking a course here such as the course I have been pursuing as a matter of policy, trying to increase supplies, trying to develop creameries in areas where there were no creameries.  I would not accept, as has been suggested by some people, that there will be no problem in the marketing of these products in future, that we can abandon everything because things are not so bad over the last few months.  The principle of the levy is enshrined in the Act which set up An Bord Bainne and it is no hindrance whatever.  The Board strikes the levy, having regard to what they think will be their resources.  If the prices go up, then the one-third that has to be borne will be smaller than in the past.  That principle is a sound one, and if the Government have the money and feel there is justice in the demand and feel there can be an increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tá ins na seacht Vótaí go bhfuil mise freagrach iontu £22,165,410.  Is méadú é sin de £1,742,490 ar an soláthar don bhliain airgeadais roimhe seo.  Tá £1,900,000 á chur ar fáil faoi Vóta 9&mdash;Oibreacha Poiblí agus Foirgintí &mdash; le haghaidh tithe scoile náisiúnta a thógáil, a mhéadú is a chóiriú.  Dá réir sin tá £24,065,410 á sholáthar sa bhliain airgeadais reatha i gcomhair na seirbhísí oideachais.  Is ionann é sin is 14.4 per cent den iomlán le haghaidh na seirbhísí soláthair ar fad.</P>
      <P>Tabharfar faoi deara go bhfuil líon na Vótaí do mo Roinn-se laghdaithe ó naoi gcinn go seacht gcinn.  Deineadh é sin d'fhonn méid na hoibre cuntaisíochta do ghearradh anuas agus dá réir sin tuilleadh costaisí foirne do sheachaint.  Is amhlaidh a deineadh an laghdú ar líon na Vótaí trén Vóta i gcomhair Eolaíochta agus Ealaíon do chomhneascadh le Vóta an Aire agus tré na hIolscoileanna agus an Institiúd Ard-Léinn do thabhairt fén aon Vóta amháin.</P>
      <P>Tabharfaidh mé anois don Teach roint fíricí agus figiúirí i leith na Vótaí éagsúla.</P>
      <P Just="Center">OIFIG AN AIRE OIDEACHAIS&mdash;VÓTA 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Séard atá sa Vóta so ná costaisí riaracháin na Roinne agus soláthar i gcomhair na seirbhísí a bhí roimhe seo faoin Vóta Eolaíochta agus Ealaíon. £894,140 atá á lorg chuige sin.  Is méadú é sin de £90,370 ar an tsuim don bhliain roimhe seo.  De na nithe <Col N="1080" /> go bhfuil tuilleadh costais ag gabháil leo siad na Scoláireachtaí Iolscoile go mbaineann an tsuim bhreise is mó leo. Síolraíonn sé sin ó oibriú Acht na Scoláireachtaí, 1961.  Seirbhísí nua go bhfuil soláthar á dhéanamh ina gcomhair is ea (1) an caiteachas ar an Suirbhé faoi OECD (2) deontas i gcabhair le haghaidh taighde i gcúrsaí teanga (3) deontas i gcabhair don chlub do dhaoine as tíortha thar lear (4) scoláireachtaí cómalairte agus (5) deontas i gcomhair turasanna múinteoirí thar lear.</P>
    <P>Is eol do bhaill an Tí cheana féin na sonraí mar gheall ar an suirbhé faoi OECD a bhaineann le hairgead a chur san oideachas.  Is leor dom a rá gur mheabhraigh na hionadaithe a bhí i láthair ag an gcruinniú idirnáisiúnta i mBaile Átha Cliath le déanaí go raibh siad an-shásta leis na modhanna atá á gcleachtadh agus an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh ag an bhfoirinn atá ag gabháil don bheartas anso in Éirinn. Tá deireadh le bheith leis an suirbhé sa bhfómhar, 1964.</P>
    <P>Do réir mar a fógraíodh anuraidh tá an Dr. Oirmhinneach Colmán Ó hUallacháin, Ord na bProinsiasach, fostaithe agam chun suirbhé teangeolaíoch a dhéanamh d'fhonn cúrsaí grádaithe sa Ghaeilge a bhéadh bunaithe ar eolaíocht teangacha do chur ar fáil. Mar chuid den suirbhé tá ceistneoirí á gcur amach go dtí daoine éagsúla gurab í an Ghaeilge a ngnáth-theanga agus go dtí an líon céanna daoine gurab é an Béarla a ngnáth-theanga. Déanfar comhaireamh tré mheaisíní ar chéad míle focal ar a laghad a chruinneofar ag an dá dhream san. Uaidh sin ullmhófar liostaí minimum d'ainmneacha agus d'aidíochtaí.  Is é toradh a bheidh ar na cúrsaí a bheidh pleanáilte ar bhun na teangeolaíochta ná gur mó de Ghaeilge a fhoghlaimeoidh na scoláirí agus gur lú an t-am a chaithfidh siad lena linn.</P>
    <P>Mar leathnú ar an obair sin tá socrú déanta agam chun deontas a thabhairt i leith saotharlann teanga do bhunú i gColáiste na bProinsiasach i Rinn Mhic Gormain.  Beidh an tsaotharlann san ar fáil chun cúrsaí do thabhairt do mhúinteoirí nuatheangacha in ár scoileanna.  Sa tslí sin tabharfar deis <Col N="1081" /> dóibh chun eolas do chur ar na modhanna is nua-aimsearaí ó thaobh mhúineadh teangan.  Déanfaidh mé tagairt fén Vóta don Mheán-Oideachas don chabhair atá ar fáil againn ó údaráis na Fraince ina leith seo agus ar bhealaí eile chun múineadh na Fraincise do chur ar aghaidh ins na scoileanna anso.</P>
    <P>An club do na daoine ó thíortha thar lear, bunaíodh é sa bhliain 1940 fé scáth Léigiúin Mhuire d'fhonn seirbhísí comhairleacha agus caitheamh aimsire do chur ar fáil do na mic léinn ón Afraic agus ón Áise atá i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Tá ar cheann de na himeachtaí go bhfuil gach tír in iarthar na hEorpa ag gabháil dóibh slithe a cheapadh chun cabhrú leis na tíortha nua san Afraic agus san Áise. I leith an oideachais is mó is féidir linn cabhair dá leithéid sin a thabhairt. Tá na mílte fear agus ban ó Éirinn ag teagasc sa dhá mhór-roinn sin.  Tá os cionn míle mac-léinn ó thíortha thar lear in Éirinn agus a bhfurmhór san i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Is mór an pléisiúr a thugann sé dom iarraidh ar an dTeach deontas do thabhairt i leith na hoibre ionmholta atá á dhéanamh ag lucht stiúrtha an Club.</P>
    <P>Tá an t-airgead i gcomhair scoláireachtaí Cómalairte á chur ar fáil d'fhonn a chur ar chumas mac-léinn ó thíortha áirithe san Eoraip tréimhse bliana do chaitheamh ag déanamh staidéir in Iolscoil nó in institiúd eile ardléinn anso.  Na tíortha atá i gceist: An Fhionnlainn, An Fhrainc, An Ghearmáin, An Iodáil, An Norbhua agus an Éilbhéis.  Tugann gach ceann de na tíortha sin scoláireacht amháin ar a laghad do mhac-léinn Éireannach.</P>
    <P>Le roinnt bhlian anuas is gnáthach le scata múinteoirí ón dtír seo dul ar thuras oideachais go dtí na Stáit Aontaithe. Tá sé de nós ag Rialtas na tíre sin deontas i leith turasanna dá leithéid do thabhairt.  Ina ainneoin sin, ámh, bhí suim airgid nach beag le híoc ag gach múinteoir a chuaigh ar an turas. Tá an buntáiste ó thaobh oideachais atá le baint as na turasanna san chomh mór san go bhfuil socair agam, faoi réir aontú an Tí, deontas do thabhairt i leith an chostais.</P>
    <P>De bhrí gur faoin Vóta so atá an <Col N="1082" /> soláthar don Choláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíon ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh arís do bhrainse amháin den Ealaín, sé sin, an Córmhaisiú. Tamall ó shoin d'fhógair mé go raibh Comhairle i leith Córmhaisithe bunaithe agam.  Agus an Chomhairle sin a bheith á bhunú agam, chuir mé romham daoine do cheapadh ina mbaill di go mbeadh ar a gcumas moladh agus comhairle a thabhairt i dtaobh oiliúint córmhaisitheoirí, an oiliúint a bheadh faite acur do shur i ngníomh go praiticiúil agus an chaoi ina bhféadfadh lucht tionscail tairbhe a bhaint as oiliúint agus scil na gcórmhaisitheoirí. Tá socrú á dhéanamh agam freisin chun Ollamh agus Ollamh Cúnta a cheapadh go mbeidh eolas speisialta acu ar chúrsaí córmhaisithe.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BUNOIDEACHAS&mdash;VÓTA 31.</P>
    <P>£12,659,500 méid glan an Vóta so. Is ionann sin agus méadú £248,500 ar shuim na bliana 1962-63, má chuirtear £60,000 de Mheastachán Breise san áireamh.  Tuilleadh earcaíocht oidí agus arduithe i bpinsin is cúis leis an chuid is mó den méadú sa Vóta.</P>
    <P>Sa scoil-bhliain dar chríoch 30 Meitheamh, 1962, bhí ceithre mhíle dhéag nócha is a haon d'oidí ar fostó i scoileanna náisiúnta.  Ar 30 Meitheamh, 1962, bhí 500,794 daltaí ar na rollaí&mdash;2,424 daltaí níos lú ná mar a bhí ar na rollaí an lá céanna i 1961. Luaigh mé fáth an laghdaithe sin anso anuraidh&mdash;an borradh a tháinig faoi na breitheanna sa tréimhse iarchogaidh, tá a rian san imithe den inrollaíocht i scoileanna náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Is maith an dul-chun-cinn a rinneadh anuraidh maidir le tógáil scoileanna, a n-athchóiriú agus a bhfeabhsú.  Rinneadh sin in ainneoin gur chuir an drochaimsir isteach go mór ar obair thógála anuraidh, go háirithe sa ráithe dheireannach den bhliain.  I rith na bliana ceadaíodh £2,136,000 de dheontas i leith 87 scoileanna nua agus 125 mórscéimeanna méadaithe agus feabhsaithe. Mar a cuireadh in iúl don Teach le linn na vótaí i leith Oibreacha agus Foirgnimh Poiblí, tá roinnt seifteanna ceapaithe ag an Rúnaí Párlaiminte don Aire Airgeadais faoina <Col N="1083" /> gcuirfear breis dlúis le tógáil agus athchóiriú scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Tháinig scéim i bhfeidhm i 1962 faoina gcuirtear deontais ar fáil do bhainisteoirí scoileanna náisiúnta le haghaidh costas péinteála na bhfoirgneamh scoile.  Tá deontais le fáil anois le haghaidh péinteála gach ceathrú bliain lasmuigh agus gach ochtú bliain laistigh.  I rith na bliana, roghnaíodh tuairim is 1,100 scoileanna i gcomhair péinteála lasmuigh agus tuairim is 600 scoileanna i gcomhair péinteála laistigh. Nuair a bhéas an scéim faoi iomlán córach, ba cheart go gcuirfí go mór le caoi agus cosúlacht ár gcuid scoileanna náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>In Acht na nÚdarás Áitiúil (Scoláireachtaí Oideachais) (Leasú), 1961, rinneadh soláthar, don chéad uair, go n-íocfaí deontas Stáit i leith costais na scoláireachtaí a bhronann comhairlí contae agus borg.  Dá bharr sin, d'imigh méadú mór ar líon agus ar luach na scoláireachtaí a tairgeadh i scéimeanna na gcomhairlí i 1962.  De bharr na bhfeabhsú seo, mealladh níos mó iarrthóir chun scrúdaithe: rinne 5,622 iarrthóirí an scrúdú i gcómhair scoláireachtaí iarbhunoideachais i 1962, i gcomórtas le 3,122 iarrthóirí i 1961.  Bronnadh 620 de na scoláireachtaí seo i 1961; bronnadh 1,729 acu i 1962.</P>
    <P>Sílim nár mhiste dom a rá gur mór an sásamh an tslí ar bhain na comhairlí contae agus borg leas as an gcabhair Stáit a sholáthraítear faoin Acht.  Is fianaise air sin na figiúirí atá aithriste agam.  Níor bhain na comhairlí uile, áfach, leas iomlán as soláthar an Stáit ach tá dóchas agam, ó thárla a gcosa ar an mbóthar ceart acu, go leanfar den fheabhsú acu, ionnas, nuair a bheidh an scéim fé lán tseoil, go mbeidh tuairim is £600,000 ar fáil gach bliain le haghaidh scoláireachtaí iar-bhunoideachais faoi scéimeanna na gcomhairlí contae agus borg.  Soláthróidh an Stát níos mó ná leath an airgid seo.</P>
    <P>Ábhar imní le tamall maith anuas dom féin agus do Ghobharnóirí an Choláiste cúinge an áitribh i gColáiste Oiliúna Eaglais na hÉireann.  Níl na foirgnimh i bPlás Chill Dara in oiriúint do riachtanais an lae inniu agus tá na deiseanna le haghaidh <Col N="1084" /> caitheamh aimsire agus eile aneaspach. Chinn na Gobharnóirí anuraidh Plás Chill Dara a dhíol agus suíomh níos oiriúnaí a lorg i gcomhair Coláiste nua.  Tá suíomh nua faighte acu agus tá pleananna an Choláiste nua dá n-ullmhú faoi láthair.  Beidh cóir le haghaidh seasca daltaí sa Choláiste nua.  De thairbhe an chostais de, cúiteoidh an Stát, trí na deontais a mhéadú, pé difríocht a bheidh idir luach díolta áitreabh Phlás Chill Dara agus costas an áitribh nua.  Tá curtha in iúl ag Gobharnóirí an Choláiste Oiliúna go bhfuil siad lánsásta leis an socrú seo.</P>
    <P>Idir an dá linn, tá méadú agus athchóiriú Choláiste Phádraig, Drumconnrach, dá chur i gcrích go sciobtha agus meastar go mbeifear in ann tuilleadh mac léinn a thabhairt isteach ann sa bhliain choláisteach 1964-5.</P>
    <P>Is rún dom leanúint liom leis an bpolasaí atá foilsithe agam maidir leis an gcoibhneas idir oidí agus daltaí sna bun-scoileanna a fheabhsú.  Ábhar pléisiúir dom anois eolas ar an gcúigiú ceann sa tsraith seo feabhsúcháin a thabhairt don Tigh.  Níl deireadh fós le fadhb na rangannaí plódaithe sna scoileanna móra faoi na bailte móra agus cé gur éirigh liom faoiseamh éigin a cheadú anseo anuraidh, tá mé go daingean den tuairim gurbé an fhadhb seo an gad is giorra don scórnaigh i rith an ama.  Shocraíos mar sin de, fanacht i mbun na scoileanna móra le linn dom an feabhsú sa choibhneas oide/dalta don bhliain seo a chur i bhfeidhm.  Bheartaíos dá bhrí sin, le héifeacht ón 1 Deireadh Fómhair go mbainfí cúig aonaid den inrollaíocht a fhostódh an t-ochtú cúntóir, deich n-aonaid den inrollaíocht a fhostódh an naoú cúntóir, cúig aonaid déag a bhaint de i gcás an deichiú cúntóra agus dá réir sin go dtí go mbainfí cúig aonaid is daichead den inrollaíocht i leith an séú cúntóir déag.  As sin suas, bainfear cúig aonaid is daichead ag gach pointe.</P>
    <P>Tá mé muiníneach go rachaidh an feabhsú seo atá léirithe agam i gcion go mór ar an bhfadhb achrannach seo, na rangannaí móra.</P>
    <P>Fadhb eile fóirne is ea na postanna i scoileanna náisiúnta ar na hoileáin bheaga.  Is deacair oidí oilte a fháil a <Col N="1085" /> ghlacfaidh na postanna seo agus a fhanfaidh i bhfad iontu.  Cúis áthais dom a rá anois gur socraíodh le héifeacht ón chéad lá Iúil seasca púnt de liúntas speisialta sa bhliain a íoc, le cois a ngnáth-thuarastail, le hoidí oilte a ghlacfaidh postanna ar oileáin bheaga, ar mhaithe lena mealladh chun fanúint sna háiteanna sin.</P>
    <P>Tá, ní foláir, baill an Tigh tar éis tagairtí d'fheiscint ins na nuachtáin phoiblí do nithe a bhaineann le tuarastail na Múinteoir Náisiúnta.  De bhrí go bhfuil na nithe sin faoi bhreithniú faoin gCóras Idir-Réitigh faoi láthair tá coscaithe orm aon tagairt a dhéanamh dóibh.</P>
    <P Just="Center">MEÁNOIDEACHAS&mdash;VÓTA 32.</P>
    <P>£3,745,000 an meastachán iomlán don Mheánoideachas.  Is ionann é sin agus beagnach £250,000 de mhéadú ar an méid a vótáladh anuraidh don mheánoideachas sa phríomh-mheastachán agus sna meastacháin bhreise. Le tuarastail mhúinteoirí, deontais do scoileanna agus scoláireachtaí iarbhunscoile a bhaineann an chuid is mó den mhéadú sin.</P>
    <P>An méadú bliantúil i líon na ndaltaí meánscoile atá chomh suntasach sin le blianta beaga anuas, ní hamháin go bhfuil an méadú sin ann go fóill ach é ag fás i gcónaí.  I rith na gcúig bliain atá caite bhí beagán thar 3,500 de mheánmhéadú ann in aghaidh na bliana.  An 85,000 de pháistí atá ar na rollaí i mbliana is mó é de bhreis is 4,500 ná an líon a bhíann anuraidh. Comhartha dóchais ésin an aigne thuisceanach atá ann i gcoitinne i leith feidhm iomlán a bhaint as na saoráidí oideachais.  Ach ní abrann sin gur ceart dúinn éirí ró-shásta ionainn féin. Ní mór leanacht de shíor den iarracht chun na saoráidí sin a leathnú.</P>
    <P>Ba ina láthair sin a rinneadh foráil, don chéad uair, in Acht na n-Údarás Áitiúil (Scoláireachtaí Oideachais) (Leasú), 1961, le cabhair a thabhairt ó Chiste an Stáit i leith costas scoláireachtaí iar-bhunscoile agus scoláireachtaí ollscoile.  Tabharfaidh an Stát tuairim is £60,000 sa tslí sin sa bhliain airgeadais reatha agus ar an mbun sin i gcionn chúig bliain déanfar <Col N="1086" /> £200,000 ar a laghad de ranníocaíocht bhliantúil ó Chiste an Stáit i leith scoláireachtaí iarbhunscoile agus £100,000 i leith scoláireachtaí ollscoile. Is é mo dhóchas, áfach, go mbainfidh na hudarais aitiula feidhm ar ball as forálacha an Achta, 1961, sa tslí go sroisfidh an tsuim sin, mar a dúras roimhe, £300,000 i leith scoláireachtaí iarbhunscoile.  £150,000 a bheadh dá chur ar fáil dá réir sin ag leibhéal na hollscoile.  Ina theannta sin, tá £35,000 i leith scoláireachtaí iarbhunscoile agus £25,000 i leith scoláireachtaí ollscoile, go príomha i dtaca le teanga na Gaeilge, dá soláthar faoi scéimeanna atá dá riaradh go díreach ag mo Roinn.  Gnénua de na deontais sin i mbliana is ea an soláthar atá dádhéanamh chun fiche scoláireacht a bhronnadh ar pháistí ó oileáin an chósta. Cuirfidh na scoláireachtaí nua sin oideachas meánscoile ar fáil saor in aisce dá sealbhóirí i scoil chónaithe maraon le deontas le haghaidh feisteas scoile, costas taistil agus mar sin de. Meastar go gcosnóidh an scéim £2,500 sa chéad bhliain iomlán agus é ag dul suas go dtí beagnach £12,000 sa bhliain tar éis cúig bhliain.</P>
    <P>Ag trácht dom ar shaoráidí oideachais a bheith dá leathnú ní miste a rá go bhfuil riachtanas le leathnú dá réir ar líon na múinteoirí cáilithe. D'éirigh go maith linn ón dtaobh sin de le tríocha bliain anuas.  I mbliana tá 3,600 múinteoir lánchláraithe ag gabháil do theagasc meánscoile&mdash;is é sin múinteoirí a bhfuil na cáilíochtaí acadúla cuí acu agus a bhfuil a dtréimhse promhacháin curtha isteach acu&mdash;agus 255 de mhúinteoirí promhacháin eile ag a bhfuil na cáilíochtaí acadúla atá riachtanach.  Tá na múinteoirí sin go léir beagnach ag fáil tuarastail ón Roinn agus fágann sin go bhfuil ós cionn 3,800 meánmhúinteoirí ag fáil tuarastail ón Roinn sa scoil-bhliain reatha, sé sin, 250 thar líon na bliana seo caite.  Ba lú ná an tríú cuid de sin an líon a bhí ann i 1930-31&mdash; 1,209 múinteoirí.  Tá an méadú sin ar líon na múinteoirí ionchurtha agus níos fearr ná bheith ionchurtha leis an médú a tháinig idir an dá am ar líon na ndaltaí.</P>
    <P>Ag caint dom ar na múinteoirí tá ní eile gur mhian liom tagairt dó.  Beidh cuimhne ag na Teachtí gur dhúirt mé <Col N="1087" /> anseo tamall ó shoin maidir le aitheantas i leith seirbhíse go mb'fhéidir go bhféadfaí ceist creidiúint i leith seirbhíse sna Sé Chontae a mheas go speisialta. Is áthas liom a rá go dtabharfar creidiúint incriminteach suas go dtí maximum chúig incrimint i leith seirbhís mhúinteoireachta molta sna Sé Chontae sa scoilbhliain 1962-63 nó ina dhiaidh sin.</P>
    <P>Ionas go mbeadh ar chumas múinteoirí eolas a chur ar mhodhanna nua-aimseartha i leith ábhair éagsúla scoile, cuireadh tús le sreath nua de athchúrsaí Samhraidh do mheánmhúinteoirí i 1959.  Méadaíodh ar líon na gcúrsaí sin gach bliain de réir mar bhí an riachtanas leo.  £1,500 an soláthar do na cúrsaí sin i mbliana i gcomparáid le £600 an bhliain seo caite.  Deich gcúrsa den saghas sin atá daite, trí cinn sa bhfisic, trí cinn sa cheimic agus ceann amháin i ngach ceann do na hábhair matamaitic, Fraincis, Gearmáinis, agus tíreolaíocht.</P>
    <P>Thagair mé roimhe seo do ghluaiseachtaí nua-aimseartha i dtaca leis na h-ábhair a mhúintear ins na meánscoileanna. Le blianta beaga anuas is léir dearcadh nua ar fud an domhain go háirithe i leith mhúineadh na matamaitice agus na n-ábhar eolaíochta agus tháinig de sin gur ghá na cúrsaí atá ann a athscrúdú.  Tá cúrsaí na hArdteistiméireachta sa bhfisic agus sa cheimic curtha in oiriúint cheana féin don dearcadh nua agus tá na cúrsaí leasaithe i bhfeidhm sna scoileanna ó thosach na scoilbhliana seo caite.  Tá dréacht-chúrsaí nua atá ceapaithe d'ábhair eile eolaíochta fógraithe cheana féin agus na cinn don matamaitic faoi bhreithniú i láthair na huaire agus tá súil agam go mbeidh na cúrsaí nua ar fad faoi réir don scoil-bhliain 1964-65.</P>
    <P>Ó rinneadh roinnt plé go poiblí i dtaobh na tairiscinte chun na cúrsaí Ardteistiméireachta sa mhatamaitic a thabhairt i gcuid cothrom leis an lá a bhfuilimíd ann is mian liom a lua go bhfuil breithniú cúramach déanta ag an Roinn ar na deacrachtaí speisialta a éireodh i leith mhúineadh na gcúrsaí sin.  I gcás na heolaíochta agus na matamaitice, do thréimhse threialach de chúig bliana atá na cúrsaí dá mbeartú <Col N="1088" /> agus iad faoi réir aithbhreithniú a dhéanamh orthu roimh dheireadh na tréimhse sin.  Idir an dá am tabharfar rogha cheisteanna réasúnta leathan sna scrúduithe agus tabharfar caoi do mhúinteoirí iad féin a chur in oiriúint do na siollabais nua.  Tá socraithe agam, freisin, go gcuirfear scrúdpháipéir shamplacha ar fáil in ábhair áirithe agus, i gcás na matamaitice, liosta de théscsleabhair oiriúnacha a dhéanfadh riar d'aon ábhar nua.  Ba cheart go gcabhródh na socruithe sin go mór leis na múinteoirí; ach tá beartaithe agam dul níos faide fós ná sin.</P>
    <P>Tá socrú déanta agam le lucht ceannais na gColáistí Ollscoile sreath leathan de chúrsaí tráthnóna do mhúinteoirí do chur ar fáil sa mhatamaitic agus san eolaíocht ó thosach na bliana acadúla seo.  Leanfaidh gach cúrsa díobh ar feadh bliana acadúla amháin agus beidh cáilíocht le fáil de thoradh scrúdaithe ag deireadh an chúrsa.  Tá dóchas ann go mbeifear in ann freastal ins na cúrsaí sin ar líon mór múinteoirí sa tslí go mbeidh ar a gcumas aghaidh a thabhairt go neamheaglach ar na fadhbanna nua a bhaineann leis na nua-smaointe atá ann sa mhatamaitic agus san eolaíocht.  Ba mhaith liom mo fhíorbhuíochas a gabháil le lucht ceannais na gColáistí as ucht iad do chomhoibrú chomh fonnmhar is a rinne siad chun na cúrsaí atá i gceist a bhunú.  Níl aon amhras orm ná go dtuigfidh na meánscoileanna agus a gcuid múinteoirí an deis iontach atá dá thabhairt dóibh dá bharr seo agus gur leo nach leisc an deis sin a thapú.</P>
    <P>I dtaca le stáid na heolaíochta a bhreithnuiú, is mór an tábhacht an fhoireann a bheith cáilithe agus saotharlanna atá feistithe i gceart bheith acu.  Déantar soláthar gach bliain faoi Mhírcheann A.2 den Vóta Meánoideachais le haghaidh cabhair airgid do scoileanna chun saotharlanna eolaíochta a fheistiú.  Is chun na críche sin atá £88,000 den £138,000 atá ar soláthar ansin i mbliana.  Is i leith ranganna eolaíochta, eolaíocht tís agus lámhoiliúna sna meánscoileanna an £88,000 sin, suim a bhaineann le costas an chaiteachais a thiteann ar scoileanna gach bliain ar ghléasra do na hábhair sin.</P>
    <P>Tháinig méadú suntasach ar líon na <Col N="1089" /> ranganna eolaíochta den sórt sin i 457 anois, sé sin, níos mó nádhá oiread an méid acu a bhí ann i 1950-51.  Tá ranganna eolaíochta den sórt sin i 457 scoil i gcomparáid le 314 scoil i 1950-51.  Comharta é sin go bhfuil ag méadú san spéis atá á chur san eolaíocht agus go bhfuil tuilleadh mór scoileanna ag iarraidh soláthar a dhéanamh do mhúineadh an ábhair sin.  Toisc an chostais a bhaineann le soláthar níos fairsinge a dhéanamh do mhúineadh na heolaíochta, thug mé isteach ó 1 Lúnasa, 1961, scéim de dheontais chaipitiúil i leith feistiú agus gléasadh saotharlanna eolaíochta.  I leith cóiríocht saotharlainne breise bheith á dur ar fáil nó soláthar á dhéanamh le haghaidh ábhair eolaíochta bhreise a íoctar na deontais seo. Tá cead na Roinne tugtha go dtí seo i leith seachtó is cúig iarratas faoin Scéim agus tuairim is £70,000 a íocfar de bharr na n-iarratas sin.  Íocadh £16,000 den tsuim sin sa bhliain airgeadais 1962-63 agus tá méag déanamh soláthair do £50,000 de chaiteachas sa bhreis ina leith sin i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tá beartaithe agam anois a dul céim eile ar aghaidh sna cúrsaí seo agus cabhair airgid breise a sholáthar do scoileanna i leith an chostais a leanann múineadh ábhar eolaíochta.  Is é an costas a bhaineann le múinteoirí ardcháilithe eolaíochta a fháil is mó atá im'aigne leis seo.  Tá socair agam go n-íocfar deontas eolaíochta breise dá ngairfear &ldquo;deontas teagaisc&rdquo; le scoileanna amhail ón scoilbhliain 1963-64. Faoin scéim seo beidh £150 de dheontas sa bhliain iníoctha le lucht ceannais na scoile i leith gach múinteora aitheanta nó i leith gach múinteora promhacháin a bhfuil céim aige san eolaíochta, atá ag múineadh na heolaíochta ar feadh líon ordaithe uaireanta an chloig sa tseachtain agus, i gcás múinteoirí tuata, atá ag fáil £350 ar a laghad de bhuntuarastal.  Meastar gur £35,000 costas na scéime sa chéad bhliain, agus é sin ag dul suas go dtí £70,000 in aghaidh na bliana sa deireadh thiar.  Os rud é nach mbeidh an deontas iníoctha go dtí deireadh na scoilbhliana ní gá aon soláthar airgid a dhéanamh dó sa bhliain airgeadais seo.</P>
    <P>Céim eile atá le teacht ó thaobh <Col N="1090" /> mhúineadh na heolaíochta&mdash;céim gur mór an pléisúr dom é a fhógairt&mdash;is ea cabhair airgid bheith á chur ar fáil do mhúinteoirí ar mian leo céim Ollscoile a bhaint amach san eolaíocht. Ba mhaith liom an chéad uair, áfach, ómós a thabhairt anseo don Ollamh Wheeler nach maireann, a bhí ina Dhéan ar Dháimh na hEolaíochta i gColáiste na hOllscoile, Baile Átha Cliath.  Is eisean a chuir tús le comhráití ar an gnó idir Arthur Guinness Son and Co. Ltd. agus an Roinn.  Is é toradh na gcomhráití sin gur aontaigh Muintir Guinness lena íoca i gcomhpáirt leis an Roinn Oideachais as chostas scéime chun triúr múinteoirí a chur ar aghaidh chun gabháil le cúrsa céime Ollscoile san eolaíocht.  Faoin socrú sin na múinteoirí a roghnófar, fhad is a bheidh siad ag gabháil dá gcúrsa Ollscoile, leanfaidh siad de bheith ag fáil breistuarastail agus sochair eile ón Roinn freising breistuarastal leis na Múinteoirí is ionaidaithe acu ach iad sin a bheith i dteideal an tuarastail ar shlite eile.  As ciste speisialta a bhunóidh Muintir Guinness a íocfar buntuarastal na scoile agus na táillí ollscoile. Ba mhaith liom anseo dá bhrí sin mo bhuíochas a ghabháil go poiblí le Arthur Guinness Son and Co. Táthar chomh heolach sin cheana féin ar a bhflaithiúlacht i gcúrsaí den sórt seo nach gá aon tagairt ar leith di uaimse.  Ach sé an tábhacht ar leith atá leis an bhfial-thairiscint seo uathu, dar liom, ná gur mór an dea-shampla do chomhlachtaí eile é.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart dom moladh a thabhairt freisin do Choláiste na hOllscoile, Baile Átha Cliath, Coláist na hOllscoile, Corcaigh agus Coláiste na hOllscoile, Gaillimh, as ucht gach uile chúnamh dár thug siad go dtí seo agus atá á thabhairt acu fós ag cur cúrsaí speisialta samhraidh agus cursai eile ar fáil do mhúinteoirí matamatice agus do mhúinteoirí eolaíochta.</P>
    <P>Thagair mé anuraidh do chomharthaí dóchais a thaispeáin go raibh borradh faoi mhúineadh na Fraincise sna meánscoileanna.  B'fhéidir nach dtuigtear go ginearálta go bhfuil an Fhraincis dá múineadh i ochtó faoin gcéad beagnach de na meán-scoileanna go léir.  Tá méadú ag teacht i ndiaidh a <Col N="1091" /> dhéile ar an líon daltaí atá ag foghlaim an ábhair sin.  Tá comharthaí ann, freisin, go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh i múineadh teangacha eile Eorpacha.  Múintear Gearmáinis anois i 58 scoil, Spáinnis i 43 agus Iodáilis i 26.  Tá gach dóchas agam go dtiocfaidh méadú suntasach ar an líon atá ag gabháil do na hábhair sin i gceann roinnt bheag bliain.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag cuimhneamh ar shlite éagsúla chun an spreagadh is gá a thabhairt don leathnú sin agus ag an am céanna na modhanna chun múineadh teangacha i gcoitinne a fheabhsú. Ina thaobh sin rinne mé tagairt roimhe seo don saotharlann teangeolaíochta atá lena bunú i gColáiste na bProinsiasach i Rinn Mhic Ghormain.  Beidh an tsaortharlann sin an-úsáideach chun cúrsaí speisialtóirí a chur ar fáil dár muinteoiri Gaeilge chomh maith leis na múinteoirí Fraincise agus teangacha Eorpacha eile.</P>
    <P>Beidh an tsaotharlann críochnaithe agus ullamh do shamhradh 1964. Maidir leis sin, is mór an pléisiúr dom a rá go bhfuil Rialtas na Fraince tar éis a thairgsint beirt shaineolaí ar na modhanna is nua-aimsearaí i múineadh teangacha a chur ar fáil do mo Roinn ar feadh tréimhse ionas go gcuirfear tús ceart leis na cúrsaí úd.  Is fial an mhaise dóibh é.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé seo ina thús ar scéim fhairsing de chúrsaí oiliúna de mhúinteoirí na dteangacha Eorpacha.</P>
    <P>Ní miste dhom a rá, leis, gur thug Aireacht Oideachais na Fraince, dream ag a bhfuil dul chun cinn speisialta déanta ó thaobh mhúineadh teangacha agus go bhfuil dlúthcheangal idir iad agus mo Roinn, gur thug siad cabhair an-mhór le dhá bhliain anuas, freisin, tré ionaid a chur in áirithe dár múinteoirí ag a gcúrsaí speisialtóirí do mhúinteoirí teangacha i mBesancon agus in áiteanna eile.  Tá mé buíoch díobh as a ucht sin, leis.</P>
    <P>Fillfidh mé ar ball beag ar cheist an mheánoideachais i dtaca leis an gcóras oideachas iarbhunscoile i gcoitinne, córas gur comhchuid de é.</P>
    <P>Is é suim ghlan atá á hiarraidh i leith na seirbhíse gairmoideachais £2,255,200 suim is mó de £253,810 ná an tsuim a soláthraíodh anuiridh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> An chuid is mó ar fad den mhéadú sin is ar dheontais do Choisti Gairmoideachais atá sé.  Ní call dom dul agus scéal fada a dhéanamh d'obair ilchineálach na gCoistí sin, arae is eol go binn iad cheana féin don té a bhfuil radharc na súl aige agus cluas le héisteacht air.  Síorfhás na hoibre sin ba chúis dom Bille a thabhairt faoi bhráid an Tí seo sa bhliain seo caite chun tuilleadh méaduithe a dhéanamh sna deontais a íocann an Stát agus na húdaráis áitiúla leis na Coisti.  Cúis áthais dom a mheabhrú gur thug na páirtithe uile sa Teach a n-aontú i bprionsabal don Bhille gan aon ró-cheist.  An méadú atá anois á iarraidh, is go bunúsach de thoradh téarmaí an leasaithe úd a éiríonn sé.</P>
    <P>Cuid áirithe den tsuim airgid atá riachtanach, £64,900, go baileach, baineann sé le deontais i gcomhair oiliúint ghairm-mhúinteoirí.  £54,050 figiúr na bliana seo caite chun na críche sin.  An £10,000 éigin de bhreis, tá sé riachtanach le deontais bhreise a íoc leis na Coláistí Oiliúna atá freagrach i múinteoirí tís a sholáthar dúinn.</P>
    <P>Faoin gceannteideal &ldquo;Oiliúint Mhúinteoirí&rdquo; tá freisin soláthar do chúrsaí oiliúna do mhúinteoirí adhmadóireachta agus miotalóireachta agus foirgneolaíochta.  Maireann na cúrsaí oiliúna do mhúinteoirí adhmadóireachta agus miotalóireachta dhá bhliain agus toisc go bhfuil tóir mhór ar na cineáil sin múinteoirí tá sé éirithe riachtanach líon na gcúrsaí oiliúna sin a mhéadú.</P>
    <P>Aithnítear gur gá bheith san áirdeall agus san aireachas faoi chláracha agus mhodhanna oiliúna i láthair na riachtanais sna hábhair praiticiúla bheith ag athrú de shíor, go háirithe i leith printísigh a oiliúint agus i leith scoileanna teicniúla i gcoitinne.  Dá réir sin, tá an Roinn ag déanamh breithnithe faoi láthair ar na cúrsaí oiliúna, na cláracha teagaisc agus na modhanna atá in úsáid d'fhonn iad a thabhairt níos fearr fós chun oiriúnachta do riachtanais na linne seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Dála na múinteoirí foirgneolaíochta, is é an seanfhocal &ldquo;Molann an saothar an fear&rdquo; an teist is fearr ar na torthaí atá á dtaispeéint acu.  Tá leithchéad <Col N="1093" /> múinteoir foirgneolaíochta ag fónamh faoi láthair agus iad ag tabhairt cabhair agus comhairle do na daoine ina limistéir atá ag leathnú a dtithe cónaithe nó ag tógáil tithe cónaithe nua. Tá tuilleadh thairis sin mar chúram orthu, leis.  Is iontach an cúnamh atá tugtha acu freisin i bpleanáil agus i dtógáil tithe feirme agus cróite.  Thug beirt de na múinteoirí sin agus cigire ón Roinn cuairt i mbliana ar an Ghearmáin Thiar agus na Tíortha Ísle, áit a ndéarna siad staidéar ar na modhanna tógála is nua-aimsirí do thithe conaithe feirme agus do chróite.  Ina dhiaidh sin chuaigh an triúr acu i mbun cúrsa speisialta a thabhairt do na múinteoirí foirgneolaíochta eile faoi na modhanna is déanaí atá in úsáid sna tíortha sin.</P>
    <P>Faoin ceannteideal &ldquo;Seirbhísí Gairmoideachais Ilchineálacha&rdquo; tá cabhair airgid le haghaidh cúrsaí teagaisc do phrintísigh i dtionscail na foirgníochta, na hiascaireachta agus na muirinnealtóireachta. Bhí an cúrsa iascaireachta agus muir-innealtóireachta faoi stiúradh Choiste Gairmoideachais Chontae na Gaillimhe i nGairmscoil Chill Rónáin in Árainn.  Is d'iascairí óga ón nGaeltacht go speisialta a tionáladh an cúrsa. Isé an beartas is tábhachtaí bfhéidir, a cuireadh i gcrích i mbliana faoin gceannteideal seo ná na Comórtaisí Idirnáisiúnta do Phrintísigh a tionóladh i mBaile Átha Cliath i Mí Iúil. I mblianta roimhe seo thagair mé don chaoi ar éirigh go rathúil lenár bprintísigh óga sna comórtais seo sa Spáinn, sa Bheilg, sa Ghearmáin agus i dtíortha eile.  I mbliana, is i bhfos againn féin a tionóladh an comórtas, ar chostas mheasta ar £30,000 d'áirgead an Stáit.  Bhíomar lán mhuiníneach i bhfianaise a bhinne is a d'éirigh lenár bprintísigh roimhe seo, gur díol onóra don tír a bheadh iontu an babhta seo, leis, ag iomaíocht anseo ina dtír dhúchais dóibh.  An chaoi ar éirigh leo nuair a bhuadar 7 gcinn de bhoinn óir, 7 gcinn de bhoinn airegid agus 5 cinn de bhoinn cré-umha sháraigh sé go mór aon rud a d'fhéadfaimís bheith ag súil leis.</P>
    <P>Ag labhairt ar mo shon féin go pearsanta dom, agus mé ag caint thar cheann mo Roinne san am céanna, is mian liom moladh a thabhairt dá raibh d'obair déanta ag gach aoinne <Col N="1094" /> len a mbain gnó an ullmhúcháin don chomórtas anseo&mdash;Coiste Gairmoideachais Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath agus an Comhchoiste Náisiúnta speisialta, ar a raibh oifigigh de chuid mo Roinne féin, oifigigh de Choiste Gairmoideachais Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, de na Ceárdchumainn, den Cheardchomhairle agus de lucht tionscail. Tig liom a rá gur thug líon mór tionscal cabhair airgid uathu go fonnmhar fial, flaithiúil.  Fianaise é sin ann féin ar an suim phraiticiúil a chuireann siad in oiliúint printíseach.  Ag deireadh,&mdash;ach más deireadh, chan díoghadh, is mian liom moladh a thabhairt do na printísigh óga iad féin agus dá múinteoirí a rinne a seacht ndíchill i gcónaí sna comórtais.</P>
    <P>Tá an oiread sin gnéithe den ghairmoideachas ann nach féidir ach an beagán díobh a lua ar leithligh gach bliain.  I gcoitinne, ámh, is feasach an Teach agus an tír go bhfuil pleananna nuacheaptha agam chun an dá roint dár gcuid oideachais iarbhunscoile a thabhairt i gcomhcheangal níos dlúithe lena chéile, chun a mbuntáistí a chur ar fáil dóibh siúd nach bhfuil ar a gcomhgar faoi láthair, chun caighdeán na hoibre iarbhunscoile i gcoitinne a árdú agus go speisialta chun caighdeán ár gcuid oibre teicniúla&mdash;isé sin obair iar-ghairmoideachais&mdash;a árdú. Laige amháin a bhí go speisialta in aigne agam, agus mé ag ceapadh an phlean nua, an dá roint neamhspleácha ina raibh ár gcórais mheánoideachais agus gairmoideachais deighilte go diongbháilte óna chéile.  Is é rud a thabharfadh sé i gceann duine an fear úd adeirtear a léim ar mhuin a chapaill gur rop roimhe i dhá dtreo éagsúla in aon am! Pé rud a thuitfidh amach san am le teacht, feictear dom nach dtig a leithéid sin a bheith arís choíche mar a bhí roimhe seo; an fháilte a chuir idir nuachtáin agus pobal tré chéile ar an toirt roimh an gcuid áirithe seo den nua-phlean, is léir air go raibh gach aoinne ag tnúth le creata agus comhcheangal a fheiceáil á chur ar ár gcóras oideachais, ach b'fhéidir gan croiceann curtha acu ina gcuid smaointe ar an tslí lena dhéanamh.  Tá mé féin ag tnúth le tuairimí na dTeachtaí a chloisint ar an scéal ar fad.</P>

      <Col N="1095" /> £229,550 an tsuim airgid atá á hiarraidh faoin Vóta seo, is é sin £7,890 níos lú ná meastachán na bliana seo caite.  Isé fáth an laghduithe an dóchas atá ann, i bhfianaise an chaoi ar laghdaigh an líon a bhí faoi choimiteáil le blianta beaga anuas, go dtarlóidh a chothrom de laghdú i 1963-64.  Mar shampla, 1,753 cailíní agus 1,608 buachaillí a bhí sna 48 scoileanna saothair ag deireadh 1962 i gcomparáid le 1,873 cailíní agus 1,638 buachaillí ag deireadh 1961. Mar an gcéanna, 127 buachaillí a bhí sa scoil cheartúcháin ag deireadh 1962 i gcomparáid le 165 ag deireadh 1961. Sa dhá scoil cheartúcháin do chailíní bhí ar an 31 Nollaig, 1962, beirt is fiche san iomlán i gcomórtas le beirt is triocha ar an 31 Nollaig, 1961.  Tá a scoileanna náisiúnta féin i 19 de na scoileanna saothair agus an 29 eile tá socrú ann lena líon páistí bheith ag freastal ar scoileanna náisiúnta taobh leo.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar ann sna scoileanna saothair do shaoire a chaitheamh ag baile nó, an uair nach n-oirfeadh an socrú sin, do chuairteanna ar áiteanna cois trá nó a leithéid.</P>
    <P>Beidh áthas ar an Teach a chloisteáil go bhfuil na pleananna don Scoil Toirmeascach nua i bhFionnghlaise críochnaithe agus go bhfuiltear i mbun billí cainníochtaí a ullmhú. Táthar ag súil le tairiscintí bheith á n-iarraidh don fhoirgneamh nua go luath.</P>

      <P>Cúpla scór bliain ó shoin ní raibh dhá labhairt sa tír ach Gaeilge Chonnachta agus Gaeilge na Mumhan.  Tá lucht labhartha na teanga ó dhuchas imithe nó ar tí imeachta agus tá na daoine a labhrann Gaeilge de shaghas nua ag éirí níos láidre in aghaidh an lae, agus is mór an trua é sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to compliment the Minister, first of all, on the way he read his introductory speech and, secondly, for the courtesy which he has extended to Deputies at all times when he has been approached on any subject.  He has treated us with nothing but <Col N="1097" /> respect, and that goes for the great majority of the officials in his Department from the Secretary down.</P>
    <P>Our discussion of this Estimate is purely academic.  The greater portion of the money voted in this Estimate has already been spent and, therefore, there is nothing we can do other than discuss the matter generally.  The Minister, if he is still there, will be introducing another Estimate within the next few months.  However, we do not know what will happen after the people of Cork and possibly some other constituencies have had an opportunity of having their say.</P>
    <P>One thing that strikes one forcibly in the Minister's speech is that in the year 1962 there were 2,424 fewer children attending primary schools than there were in the year 1961.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am afraid of.  There has been a considerable decline in the birth rate. Let me at the outset state the policy of the Fine Gael Party in regard to education.  Our attitude towards education is that no person must go without <Col N="1098" /> primary, secondary, vocational or university education, through lack of means.  That is our primary objective but before going into education, there is one subject with which I should like to deal, that is, the Irish language. Since I entered this House, I think this is the first year I have heard a Minister introduce an Estimate without even one paragraph dealing with the Irish language.  That is a very good thing indeed because the day we handed the revival of the Irish language over to the Department of Education was the day we put the nail in its coffin.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Fine Gael Party that there will be no compulsory teaching of subjects through the medium of the Irish language.  I often wonder are the people on both sides of the House <i>ad idem</i> with the Department of Education on this policy of revival.  The language I want to see revived is the language spoken in Gweedore, Rannafast, Cloghaneely, Connemara and down in West Kerry and Ballyferriter.  That is the language I want to see spoken but if we are to have the language spoken by these Irish speakers replaced by some new brand of Irish, then I am completely against it.  If we are not prepared to foster the language of the native Irish speakers, we may throw our hats at it.</P>

      <P>We are not referring to English.  We are not trying to revive it either.  I am anxious to see revived the spoken language which the Irish people have kept on for years. Let me quote a book recently issued <Col N="1099" /> on the Welsh language.  This book was prepared for the Minister for Welsh Affairs by those people interested in the revival of the Welsh language.  One of the comments in this report which has been submitted to the Minister for Welsh Affairs, is:</P>
      <P>A language cannot be imposed on people.  It must be embraced voluntarily.  If the general attitude is one of apathy, the language will be lost.</P>
      <P>I subscribe to that view.  A language cannot be imposed upon people.  How true it is.  What a tragedy that we some 40 years ago should have handed over to the Department of Education the task of reviving the Irish language. What a tragedy that the Department of the Gaeltacht was not then set up and continued down through the years, when we had a substantial Gaeltacht, when we had a substantial number of native Irish speakers who could pass on to their successors a spoken knowledge of the language.  I do not want to see the Irish language becoming like Latin or Greek, that there would be an academic approach to it.  Language is the badge of our tribe.  It is something which has been fought for and something we do not want to see destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in Israel today a number of various dialects of the Hebrew language have been mustered together and some unified Hebrew has come out of it.  We do not want that in this country.  We want to see the dialects which have been spoken in the Gaeltacht of various parts of the country revived and it is on that which we wish to concentrate.  Needless to say, the Department of Education can do a considerable amount in that respect.  This can be done first of all by holding classes in oral Irish.  That is most essential. Magnificent work has been done by a number of voluntary associations such as Comhaltas Uladh, Gael Linn and the Gaelic League. They have done much more in bringing about the early revival of Irish than have the Government.  It is a great pity there is not better liaison between the Government and these organisations. The Government do some work; they <Col N="1100" /> give grants; but it is too bad that at this stage in our history we have to rely on pools and raffles to help send enthusiastic students to the Gaeltacht areas. I deplore that, and submit that we must have a new look at the methods through which we hope to revive the language.  Deputy Dr. Browne suggested some time ago that a committee of the House be set up to examine the question.  The Government set up a Commission some time ago and we had all hoped the findings would be published: in fact I was under the impression that it was for that reason the Estimate was held up.  I know now it was not, and I am obliged to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of Dáil Éireann the Government should increase the pensions of resigned and dismissed members of the RIC and thus give them &ldquo;not less generous treatment&rdquo; as promised and grant them parity with their comrades who continued in the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know this motion has the support of many Deputies.  I regret that it should be necessary to introduce such a motion, because the promise was made specifically by an Irish Government, and given with the consent of every member of the Dáil of that day, that these men would not be treated any less generously.  The members of the RIC who acted on the appeal then made feel they have a very great grievance because the promise then given to them was not observed at any time since.  Due to the increased cost <Col N="1101" /> of living, and other reasons, the pensions they are now getting are totally inadequate to meet their requirements. Certainly these pensions do not come up to the standard enjoyed by the people who continued to serve on in that force.</P>
    <P>It is a long time since that promise was made, since the appeal was issued to the members of that force to refuse to serve&mdash;to resign.  We know there were members of that force who were dismissed because they refused to obey the orders given to them to carry out brutal activities.  They are still suffering from that loyalty to the Irish people.  I personally sent the appeal to the members of the force through their relatives&mdash;brothers, fathers and mothers.  I made it quite clear when talking to them that if they resigned, they would not be treated less generously than those who served on.</P>
    <P>Why did we do that at the time? It was because we recognised that the RIC were the eyes and ears of the British administration, that they knew every blade of grass, and therefore were aware of all the activities in their respective areas.  They were a very efficient force, well sheltered, well paid.  Being the eyes and ears of the British administration, the Irish Government of the day started out to break up the efficiency of the force and to lower the morale of the members who carried on.  This was secured by the efforts of the comrades of those who continued to serve on.</P>
    <P>The morale of the RIC did in fact break up, and by our action then, we compelled the British and the RIC, in a few months in 1919, to vacate more than 400 barracks throughout the country.  That left the job of administration practically impossible for the British and made our activities all the easier.  As I have said, the promise was at that time given that those who resigned would not be treated any less generously.  I shall not compare the pensions these people now have with the pensions others who served with them now enjoy from the British Government. I know our pensions are a very poor comparison.  The Government should honour the bond.</P>
    <P>There are dismissed RIC: there are <Col N="1102" /> some members of the force who, for various reasons, were unable to resign and some of these became members of our Forces.  When the State was established, they were recognised and given appointments to compensate them because they carried out the orders they received.  But I consider the old member of the RIC who had a year or two to serve and was called on to resign and surrender everything made a big sacrifice.  I regret to say it was a sacrifice because we never honoured the bond.  Some of these, even some officers and one in particular whom I know said: &ldquo;I have only one year to serve and surely I can punch my ticket for that year?  I shall not do this, that or the other.&rdquo;  He was dismissed because he was caught out although he was an innocent man in many ways. I am glad that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government gave him his pension.  I visited him in Dungarvan and I was in uniform at the time.  He said the visit meant more to him than the pension because he and his family could hold up their heads when I had paid him that tribute.  It would show that he was an Irishman before anything else.  He richly deserved that little tribute which was resented by certain people&mdash;why, I do not know.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why people are jealous because these dismissed and resigned RIC men have mediocre pensions in view of the fact that a promise was made to them that they would not be less generously treated. I feel it is not necessary to labour the case and that the Government will recognise the justice of the claim. Practically every Deputy recognises their claim and there was only one argument made against it&mdash;the financial stringency.  According to all the reports, that no longer holds.  Therefore, I hope the Government propose to accept this motion and put it into effect at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>I should like some more definite information before speaking in this debate.  I <Col N="1103" /> had hoped the proposer would have had some information.  As the House knows, the Minister is now trying to compile a brief on the motion, having been taken by surprise, as I had to make a final arrangement at the time and it was not possible to take the other motion.  For that reason, he has to prepare the brief now.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept all the mover of the motion has said in regard to the way these men were treated. Subject to correction, I believe that they got increases as time went on pretty much in line with increases given to other sections.  I would not say these took the form of the various rounds of increases given periodically and systematically to various groups of public servants.  I think it is true that at different times their position was taken into account and they got an increase in accordance with the increases given to other pensioners.  It is fair to say that they may always rest assured that their position will be examined in conjunction with that of other similarly placed retired public servants as time goes on and any justifiable increase given.</P>
      <P>I agree with what the proposer has said regarding the important part played by these men at a very difficult time.  The RIC were undoubtedly the eyes and ears of the British forces here and the strong appeal made to them was possibly one of the most effective actions taken and contributed to what was ultimately achieved more than any other action at that time.  They should not be looked upon any less favourably than those who took an active part or had active service in the movement at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion, I remember that a Deputy put down a motion or introduced a Private Bill to deal with another category of the same Force. While it may not be quite relevant to the present motion, I thought it was one that called for some sympathy and re-examination.  It was in respect of that section of the same body of men who applied to the Government of Saorstát Éireann, as it was then known, and failed to get pensions.  They did not qualify for pensions from the <Col N="1104" /> British Government: they fell between two stools.  They had some organisation which was protesting and advocating further consideration of their case. I do not know if Deputy MacEoin actually had that marginal section who did not benefit in mind.</P>
    <P>The qualification necessary then was that the applicant had to prove that he left the force in sympathy with the movement here and that he was actuated by no other motive and as a result failed to qualify for a pension from his original employer, the British Government. Some of these were very much borderline cases.  They were not accepted by the British as qualifying on the ground that they did not remain and give loyal service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I thought at first when I saw the motion on the Order Paper that it related to that particular category.  Even if there were only a few who might not have got the benefit of the doubt in the right direction at the time, it would be a pity if they were left without some consideration.  Perhaps Deputy MacEoin knows the numbers involved. No doubt the Minister will tell us when he speaks.  The number must be small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers must be rather negligible and like most small bodies, they are not in a position to make their voices heard as loudly as would large organised pressure groups who usually assert themselves and bring pressure to bear in the right direction.  I would be all the more sympathetic on that account.  Where small organised bodies are not in a position to assert their claims as bigger, organised bodies can, they should be given certain consideration because of that and receive more sympathetic consideration. I would not go the whole way with the proposer of the motion, until I know the full facts of the case, and say that they were badly treated. There is a commitment or anyhow they were given an implied undertaking that <Col N="1105" /> they would not be treated in a worse manner than any other similar category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that an undertaking was implied or given perhaps definitely that they would be considered when categories of the same type were being considered.  It is correct to say that they have received increases from time to time.  Some people with whom I have come in contact seem to think that they are just getting the exact figure as on the day the pension was first granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure most people would be agreeable that they should be dealt with again.  Whether present circumstances demand that they are now entitled to immediate consideration is another point.  The Minister, as Deputies are aware, has legislation before the House in relation to pensions generally.  I suppose nowadays when all sections of retired people realise that the general position in the country has improved, they all want more than their just slice of the cake.  Human nature being what it is, we are all inclined to exaggerate our own case and to give the impression that we are the one victimised section in the community.  Every section of pensioners is prone to make the same type of case; whether it is the pre-1950 national school teachers or some other section, they have the feeling they are the worst treated section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a natural desire to take part in the general clamour for better pensions, wages or salaries.  It has to be approached with a responsible attitude towards the whole overall position.  I think the Minister would not be opposed to this section more than any other.  I am speaking for myself but <Col N="1106" /> I feel I am expressing the views of everybody in the House when I say nobody would like it to be felt that there is any particular grudge against, or reason for victimising, this particular section.  Certainly I would say that that is not the case.  Any promises made should be honoured and I am sure they will be in this case, so far as they are justified.  Whether the circumstances are such that they would call for any immediate or panic action now is another matter.  I do not think such is the case.  When we get the figures and examine them I think we will find that the amount these people are receiving is not too bad at all.  They may be due to take part in another increase but I feel most of them have reached the stage when their responsibilities have virtually ceased and they all belong to an age group for whom dependants would hardly be a source of worry.</P>
    <P>There was a time when they would have had dependants but this category has moved beyond that stage, like many other pensioners, and the same urgency is not involved or the same desperation as Deputy MacEoin tried to imply in moving the motion.  Our attitude should be to make it known that we are not looking on these in any way as being stepchildren of the State's responsibility and that we wish to be as fair to them as to any other retired section of the community, whether they are retired members of our own police forces or any other retired section.</P>
    <P>As I said, it would be interesting to know the numbers involved, the average pension paid in these cases and what increases they got at the various stages since they were first granted pensions.  That would be a great help to us in making up our minds but off the cuff we can assure them that they are not being blackballed.  They are looked upon as responsible citizens who played an important part at a critical time in the nation's history and they will not be left out when the occasion justifies giving an increase commensurate with increases given to similar categories.</P>

      <P>It has been known for some time in this House that Private Members' motions are taken from 6 to 7.30 p.m.  It appears somewhat surprising then that the motion we are discussing now, No. 27, standing in the name of Deputy MacEoin, should have necessitated for its debate from the Government side of the House the urgent reading of a brief by the Minister for Finance.  The Parliamentary Secretary who has just spoken has obviously done his best but neither he, nor I, nor you, Sir, now knows what stand he is taking and indeed if any of the few people affected by this motion were up in the Gallery, they would be no wiser now, having listened to the Parliamentary Secretary, than before this debate started.</P>

It is moved by a Deputy <Col N="1109" /> who has not to depend on hearsay or on what he might be told, but who was part and parcel of the fight at the time.  Deputy MacEoin's motion refers to a situation in which the ordinary people of this country were fighting for their freedom and he was one of those who, in those days, were prepared to put their lives and fortunes at hazard in the interests of this country. If he moves a motion of this kind, he is doing it out of regard for an undertaking given at the time and which it was expected would be fully honoured.</P>
    <P>The RIC at the time were the residential police force of the British occupation.  They functioned as the eyes and ears of the British Crown. Each one of them was an Irishman with his kith and kin in this country and of the majority of them it could be said that their hearts were in the right place.  It was for that reason that the appeal was made to them on behalf of the Volunteers to leave the service of the Crown.  The majority did not but many of them did, many who have since gone to their reward. It is true to say that those who resigned because they would no longer serve and those who were dismissed by the British authorities because their services were regarded as not satisfactory to the British Crown were promised that they would receive no less generous treatment than those who continued to serve.</P>
    <P>That is the point at issue in this motion, if there is anything at issue at all.  An undertaking was given at that time that those who left or were dismissed from the RIC would receive treatment which would be no less generous than that given to those who continued to serve.  There are a few of them left.  Deputy MacEoin did not mention figures and I do not want to hazard guesses.  Apparently we will get some figures eventually from the Minister but there can be very few of them left.  They were small in number when they resigned or were dismissed 41 years ago.</P>
    <P>This motion directs the attention of this Parliament, which now operates as a result of the actions of Michael Collins, Seán MacEoin and others like <Col N="1110" /> them 41 years ago, to the fact that those who continued to serve with the RIC today enjoy from the British Crown a level of pension which is considerably higher than the pittance by way of pension paid to those who answered the call to resign or who were dismissed.  I do not understand why, in the brief instructions given to the Parliamentary Secretary, he was not told to accept this motion.  There can be very little in it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that this motion does not have any urgency.  There is no reason for immediate or panic action.  That is always said in relation to those who cannot, by reason of their numbers or importance, qualify for the political description of being a pressure group.  On small and dwindling pittances, these old men, small in numbers, may not have any influence in the political spectrum and, therefore, in relation to them, it can apparently be said that there is no urgency, no need for immediate or panic action.  I do not know that that is fair.  Many of these men are now living on borrowed time. They have long passed their three score years and ten and, however long is left to them, it cannot be so very long really.  While the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance may say there is no urgency in regard to them, to them there is burning urgency.  Each week and each month and each year brings them nearer to the end.  For many of them, the desideratum now is to be able to die leaving some little pittance behind them.  Surely it is not too much to ask the Government to regard a motion of this kind as meriting some measure of urgency?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to the general clamour now arising for better conditions, better pay, and so on.  For whatever reasons such general clamour may exist, it is true to say that a demand for better conditions is felt more vividly and more urgently by those who have to exist on pensions, whether they be RIC pensions or other pensions; they are generally the groups that are ground between the upper and the nether millstone.  They have to exist on <Col N="1111" /> a measure of money payment that was organised and defined many years before.  They have to carry that pension into a situation in which real money values are dropping.  For a pensioner&mdash;an RIC pensioner or any other pensioner&mdash;a time of rising prices and rising costs is a very fearful period, There, again, is the measure of urgency.  There is urgency in relation to those few people not only because they may not have so long more to survive but also because there is at the moment a steep drop in the real value of the money they are receiving.</P>
    <P>I would suggest sincerely to the Government, to the Minister for Finance, to all associated with this motion, that in this month and at this time of the year, it would be a magnificent gesture to the Deputy who proposed this motion, to those affected by the motion, if now, 41 years after, on behalf of General Michael Collins and the men who fought the War of Independence, we were to recognise the debt we owe to those who reacted to the appeal made amongst the forces of the Crown at that time and accord to them such an increase in their pensions that, in the autumn and winter of their lives, they can feel they have not been less generously treated than those who preferred to continue to serve the British forces until eventually the power of Britain was broken in the land.</P>

      <P>I was quite impressed by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins in his plea.  We, on this side of the House, are of course most anxious to increase pensions.  I endorse everything the Deputy said about those members of the RIC who co-operated with the Irish Republican Army.  I am at a loss for words to pay these men the compliment they deserve.  They were real soldiers and they contributed in no small measure towards achieving the freedom of this country.  It was pleasant to listen to Deputy O'Higgins making his plea on behalf of these men.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion.  On my rounds I meet many of these people.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, they are few and are becoming fewer every day.  Those of them who are left are disappointed men.  They played an important part in the War of Independence.  Promises were made to them.  Some of them came out and were living on small <Col N="1115" /> holdings.  Since then all down the years, they have been looking for an increase.</P>
      <P>As Deputy MacEoin pointed out, they were asked to resign.  It was not an easy thing for married men to decide to give up what was regarded in those days as a good job.  They were asked to resign by men like Deputy MacEoin and General Michael Collins.  They were also asked to resign by their own people at home. In order to prove themselves genuine Irishmen many of them came out in favour of the IRA.  Others remained on and played an even more important part in doing so.  Had it not been for those men, I fail to see how the War of Independence could have been brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>Only last week I wrote to the Minister about a man from Sligo town. This man is one of three brothers who resigned in support of the IRA.  I think he got a very small allowance.  He worked while he was able and raised his family.  Now he is unable to work any longer, he asked the Minister on a few occasions for an increase, but the reply has not been very satisfactory.  I would ask the Minister to avail of this opportunity to make a note of that case.  What a difference it would have made to our nearest and dearest if those people had not co-operated in those dark and evil days.  What a difference there would have been if the leaders were not in a position to get the information these people gave.  It is hard to see how otherwise the leaders could have hoped to win that great fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people should get every consideration. The majority of them have now grown old, but let us not forget that some of them are still active men, hoping to benefit from the increases everybody is getting.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach mentioned that they felt they should be entitled to ask for a round the same as everybody else.  The time has come when these people are forced to ask for a rise.  Prices are soaring every day and their petty allowances cannot keep up with them and give any measure of comfort.  In many cases their families have now married and <Col N="1116" /> they find themselves living on their own in rural areas.  After a hard life, they are living in retirement.  They contributed generously to the cause by resigning, and they merit our consideration. For that reason I sincerely ask the Minister to give as quickly as possible something worth while to these men and their dependants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why this motion should have occupied so much of the time of the House.  There is a story told that in 1923 when the representatives of the Revenue Commissioners here were over in London to discuss a double taxation agreement with the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Winston Churchill, he appeared to take very little interest in the protracted and complicated discussions going on in his presence between his advisers and the Irish representatives.  Various difficulties were put up against the Irish arguments by the British counterparts. In a state of some desperation, one of the Irish representatives turned to the Chancellor and said: &ldquo;Well, sir, what do you think about our scheme?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I think you have made an unanswerable case&rdquo; and forthwith directed the meeting to end and the agreement be drawn up on the lines suggested by the representatives of this country.  One can go further and say that that double taxation agreement, in essence, still stands and worked very well in its lifetime.</P>
      <P>I think the case here is equally unanswerable and, of course, while we enjoyed the asides from various parts of the House during Deputy Burke's speech, he made it clear that he fully supported the motion.  I remember some ten or 11 years ago making what I very shortly afterwards realised was an uncharitable and unfair speech in regard to the claims of the pre-1950 retired teachers.  It is a speech I regretted afterwards and I do not mind saying that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It occurs to me that at that time and even now there is general reluctance on the part of Governments to yield to the claims of smaller groups of pensioners.  Certainly in recent years, there has been more charity <Col N="1117" /> shown in that direction but I hope there will be further evidence of that charity in the acceptance of this motion.  Whether the Minister can go as far as the motion suggests, which is that the retired and dismissed members of the RIC here should be given parity with those who continued in the service and who are paid by the British, is something I do not know because I have not the figures available. What is plain is that on the basis of their present pensions they are bound to find it difficult to live and, therefore, they are entitled to a substantial improvement in their pensions. The general level of pensions here is undoubtedly lower than it is across the Channel.  The reasons for that, I suppose, are that our economy has fewer people to sustain the demands of the various pension groups than theirs has.  Nevertheless, we should in this instance make whatever increase we can available to those now very few people.</P>
    <P>It do not think it necessary to go back over the history of what happened 41 years ago except that it is relevant that the outlook of those who retired, or by their activity had themselves dismissed, was a patriotic one, and that should be remembered.  In the light of that, I do not see why the debate should be prolonged, other than that we seem to have done a lot of work today and some people feel we should not go home too early.  That appears to me to be the only reason why Deputies introduced extraneous subjects into what is after all a very simple, a very narrow issue.  For the reasons that have been stated by others as well as by myself and, particularly, for the reason that these people cannot exert pressure, like others in the pensioner class who cannot exercise pressure, they should be treated with as much charity as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in no different position from the Minister and the two Parliamentary Secretaries who did not expect this motion to come up tonight.  I do not think it is entirely true to say that much of the talk that has gone on here over the past hour or so is to kill time.  Even if the motion <Col N="1118" /> were finished, we would still have to continue until halfpast ten.  Furthermore, we are in Private Members' Time and some other motion would come up to be dealt with until 7.30 p.m.  However, there must be hope for those people who are mentioned in this motion in view of the calm and objective way in which it has been treated, particularly by Deputy Seán Flanagan whose approach was objective and who intervenes in most discussions in this House in an objective and honest way.</P>
      <P>This question of better treatment of resigned and dismissed members is one that has been raised in the House ever since I became a member.  There still does not seem to be any real move to grant to these people parity in their pensions, that is, parity with their comrades who continued in the service and who received far better pensions. They resigned or were dismissed because of their association with the new Irish State.  It is a fact, as far as I know, that they were promised they would be treated not less generously than those who continued on in the force.  Because they are declining in numbers, the time is now opportune to give them parity as was promised to them by the then leaders, including General Collins.</P>
      <P>We seem to be playing Hamlet without the prince on this motion.  The Minister for Finance is not here and only he can give us figures to indicate the extent of this problem, what it would cost to give these men the parity they were promised.  I have supported this proposal for many years.  Deputy P.J. Burke's argument as to where we are to get the money for this will, of course, arise once more on the Adjournment Debate tomorrow.  It is not an aspect that we can discuss fully during the time allowed us for private Members' Business.  I do not think anybody wants to make political capital out of this; in fact there is none in it.  I am sure, therefore, that when the Minister becomes aware of the atmosphere in which this motion has been discussed, he will treat the matter sympathetically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not altogether in agreement with some of the statements <Col N="1119" /> made.  Somebody said the IRA would not have succeeded unless the RIC men had resigned.  I would not like to go quite so far.  I have no doubt the Irish Republican Army would have won anyway.  We appreciated what those men did after 1916, after 1917 and again after 1918 when Dáil Éireann was established.  They had patriotic motives and they resigned out of sympathy for our cause.  They resigned from that infernal machine created here by the British and known as the RIC.  I give all credit to them but I shall not give them credit to the extent of saying that it was they who won the War of Independence and not the soldiers of the Irish Republican Army.</P>
      <P>This has been a very vexed question during the past 40 years.  We have had men who served up to the day when the RIC was disbanded but who gave unstinted support and sympathy to the struggle for independence.  They are very often forgotten.  Many of them were in the invidious position of being between two fires, so to speak.  Many of those men have gone and I have the greatest respect for them.  I am afraid they have got very little gratitude. Some of them were given testimonials certifying they had given service to the nation but that is all they ever got. Many of them were decried as &ldquo;peelers&rdquo; and so on and they had to bear that brand, though they were in fact very good Irishmen.</P>
      <P>I know that many of the men who resigned from the RIC did so for patriotic reasons.  I also know that had they continued to serve at the time, their remuneration would have been substantially higher.  I should like to say that I do not for a moment begrudge them anything the State can give them.  They answered the call at a very critical period in our history. A large number of them were never given recognition for that.  We lost touch with many of them and were therefore unable to give them even a certificate of recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to talk about that struggle now.  I can tell Deputies it was not any bed of feathers.  Many <Col N="1120" /> of the RIC men who resigned in sympathy with the fight for independence are not now known and may go to their graves without the recognition they so richly deserved.  I should, therefore, like to suggest that the Government set up some sort of bureau, attached either to the Army or the Garda Síochána, in an effort to get in touch with those people and afford them some sort of recognition for their service to the nation.  I can give an example of a sergeant, a native of Kerry, who offered us his barracks on more than one occasion but our superior at GHQ said that a barracks attacked was better than a barracks taken.  I think myself we should have taken that barracks.  We could have done so at the time.  That sergeant knew the game was up; he knew the Black and Tans were on to him and he made it a condition of handing over the barracks that he would be accepted for active service.  Unfortunately, he did not get the opportunity. He was bundled into a lorry and I have never heard of him since, although I have tried my best to find out his whereabouts.</P>
    <P>I come from a constituency where there are very few former members of the RIC who resigned at that time. We never had many men in that police force in County Tipperary, but we are making up for it now in the Garda Síochána.  If the money can be made available, I agree these men should be given the recognition the motion seeks to give them.  If we want to give them this parity and if that means extra taxation, we should not shirk that duty.  We should be prepared to stand up here and say these men should be given parity even if it means imposing extra taxation.</P>
    <P>I should like, however, to point out that there are many IRA men who are in an even worse position, who did not get even a small pension in recognition of their service, which was of a military nature.  I hope we should be able to do something for those men during the lifetime of the present Dáil.  I do not know what is in the Minister's mind regarding this motion.  There are many demands at present and it is scarcely an opportune time to seek increases. <Col N="1121" /> Yet, it will not cost a lot and in his wisdom, I should like the Minister to give full consideration to this motion and when doing so, also to consider many of the old IRA men who have not been treated as well as they should, for the same reason as in the case of the old RIC people who resigned, because they had not sufficient certification.</P>
    <P>Personally, I hope the Minister will see his way to do all he can for them and give them some extra comfort to brighten the winter of their lives.  They would appreciate it, I am sure.  As has been said, many who continued to serve have good pensions from the British Government and it can be very disconcerting to men such as those we are discussing now to see those who remained on and did their worst against us living in comfort while those who answered the call and gave up their service when perhaps their future was promising are finding it hard to make ends meet.  They made a sacrifice and if they do not apply for, or get, a penny I am certain they are happy that, having given their service to the country like many others, they have lived to see the results freedom has brought.</P>

      <P>I am not too clear as to what section of the resigned and dismissed RIC men Deputy MacEoin refers in this motion.  For a long time in this House, questions were raised and motions put down on this matter. I also note as a strange phenomenon that Deputy MacEoin when in Opposition is always very fond of advocating increases in pensions and pay for those in the public service.  Admittedly, he spends a good deal of his time in Opposition but he had a chance in this House as Minister for Defence and again as Minister for Justice and he did nothing whatever for the men for whom he now speaks.</P>
      <P>As far back as July 14, 1948, the late Deputy Cowan raised the matter here, as reported at column 268 of volume 112 of the Official Report. The Minister responsible then was Deputy McGilligan and the late Deputy had raised the question of these dismissed and resigned RIC men who, he said, had resigned in 1920 at the call of Dáil Éireann. Deputy McGilligan then said that the provisions of the Superannuation Act, 1923, applied to them and that the matter was under examination. That was some time ago.  Again, on 27th April, 1949, the matter was also raised and the query was: what was being done for these men?  In his reply, Deputy McGilligan coupled them with members of the public service in general and again said that the matter was under active consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £5,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for a Grant (Grant-in-Aid) to An Chomhairle Ealaoín.</P>
      <P>An Chomhairle Ealaoín were set up, as Deputies know, to promote a knowledge of, interest in, and higher standards in, the arts, and have in the past two years been in receipt of an annual grant of £30,000 from the Exchequer.  Within their functions as defined in the Act which set them up, An Chomhairle Ealaoín have full discretion in regard to what activities and ventures they support and they spread their resources among the visual arts, music, drama and literature.  The broad scope of these commitments limits the extent of the assistance they can give to any project and in particular makes it impossible to give any considerable sum to a new applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations have recently been made that the Dublin Grand Opera Society was in difficulties and An Chomhairle Ealaoín, unable from their resources to come to the Society's aid, have advised the Government of their formal decision that in the event of their being granted a further £5,000 from the Exchequer, the additional amount would be made available to the Society.  This Supplementary Estimate, if agreed, will enable them to give effect to that intention.  The Dublin Grand Opera Society has been in existence for over 30 years.  It is a voluntary body dependent, in the first instance, on the subscriptions of its members and on its receipts from performances.  These have always been inadequate to meet the expense <Col N="1124" /> involved in bringing singers of international status for a season in Dublin and have had to be supplemented in other ways, including limited guarantees from some private firms and individuals.  An Chomhairle Ealaoín have given various grants against losses in the past and last year they gave an exceptional £2,000.  Bord Fáilte have also made similar grants available but because the tourist appeal of the Society's activities is limited, these grants have not been large.  The Society's largest single source of income has been the substantial subvention given by the Italian Government towards the expenses of its Spring Season.  It is invidious that opera in Dublin should depend so heavily on outside goodwill and the Government have accordingly thought it proper to put An Chomhairle Ealaoín, who already aid musical ventures throughout the country&mdash;including the Wexford Festival and the Waterford Grand Opera Society&mdash;in a position to come to the aid of the Society, which is the mainstay of opera in Dublin, I accordingly commend the Supplementary Estimate to the favourable consideration of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <P>The purpose of the supplementary grant is an excellent one and I do not think the House will have any hesitation in approving of it because this is the kind of thing we want to see the Council doing and this is the kind of departure we want to see.  I hope that every year they will find their budget is not enough and that they will have to come to us for these funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this Supplementary Estimate with reference to the report of the Council which has just been published. What I have to say about the report deals rather with what is not in the report than what is in it.  The report is very attractively designed and turned out, but, in essence, it is a detailed list of all the activities of the Council during the period 1962-63 and is rather in the nature of a catalogue than what I would regard as a report of its activities.  What is not in <Col N="1125" /> the report seems to me to emerge quite clearly from that list because what appears to emerge at the end of the list is: &ldquo;What could we not have done if we had some more money?&rdquo; At the beginning of the year, the Council started with the rather surprising sum of £9,556 7s. 7d. and I am glad to see that they ended the year with only £1,500 odd.  Those two figures might possibly belie the remarks I have made about what the report leaves unsaid.  When you look at what has been done, it appears to be nothing but a rather long, wearisome list of various activities, giving no indication as to what the results of all the activities have been.  That is a notable omission from this report.</P>
      <P>There were hopes when the Act setting up the Arts Council was passed that this Council would have a very profound, widespread and far-reaching effect, particularly on the visual arts and on design in industry.  To me, at all events, being somewhat responsible for the Bill which subsequently became an Act, I had hoped that this Council would achieve striking results in industrial progress, in the application of art to industry and particularly to design.  I hope in some early report the Council will take a look at the past 12 years during which it has been in operation and give some indication of what progress it has made, where it has failed, and if it has failed, why it has failed.  I would have liked to have seen that done in the report.  After a dozen years, we are entitled to expect from the Council, and I think we would get from the present Director of the Council, a very comprehensive and a very useful and informative report in retrospect of the work of the Council for the past 12 years: where they have been going, where they have got to and what is their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got to the stage now where it would be very useful if the Director would give us that review and say what his hopes are and the prospect for his designs and plans for the future. We have, as I said, a list but apart from a general impression that the Council have been doing useful work, <Col N="1126" /> I can get no indication as to what real impact is being made on the artistic life of the country.  Are our artists being encouraged by the efforts of the Arts Council?  I commend those efforts to the Dáil and to the Council.  They did start a scheme, referred to in the report, for the purchase of works of art, pictures by Irish artists, with a view to their sale to various public bodies, hotels and other institutions of that kind.</P>
    <P>I notice from the report that during the year 63 paintings of Irish artists were purchased by the Council.  Those were available at half-price to public bodies and other institutions.  It is regrettable that of those 63 only 37 were purchased by the beneficiaries on whose behalf the money is being spent. That requires explanation.  Here is a scheme financed by the Council and the bodies who should give a lead, such as the hotels who advertise abroad to attract tourists here, should be in there first to give encouragement to our Irish artists.  We have the talent here&mdash;I have always held that&mdash;and perhaps sometimes we produce one or two geniuses.  We have the talent and it is our duty to give encouragement and hope to our young artists that there will be some living to be made out of one of the greatest gifts that can be given to man.  There is a comment to be made that so very few works were purchased by these particular bodies whose duty it is to give the lead and to give encouragement and hope.</P>
    <P>There are many matters in this report to which I should like to refer but I would concentrate on the final section under the heading &ldquo;Other Activities&rdquo;.  It is noticeable that in the year under review, 1962-63, the Council has been much more active, judging by the lists, than in the previous year, but again they merely give a sort of indication of what they have been doing instead of giving in some detail an account of each of the activities, the purpose of these activities, and what they think they have achieved, if any.</P>
    <P>The first part deals with the recommendation or advice which they gave to the Taoiseach in relation to the desirability of the immediate implementation <Col N="1127" /> of the Scandinavian design report.  That report was a very vital one from the point of view of the application of art to industry in this country.  I have repeated in this House my view, which I still hold very strongly, that it is good business for this country to get the best possible advice from anybody in the world at almost any price so that our design in industry can be bettered, so that the design for our output can be made so distinctive of this country, so different from the design and output of any other country in the world, that we would be able to sell in competition with every other country in the world at good prices.</P>
    <P>Until we produce something of outstanding design, something that will be regarded as of Irish culture and Irish art, we will go very little distance indeed.  It is well known that Waterford glass is in great demand in foreign markets but even there, there is great room for improvement in design.  I think that even they can learn that there is something to be achieved by good design.  I do not think they should be content with giving modern copies or replicas of old Waterford glass.  I think that Cork glass is now almost unprocurable and that we have almost gone out of the designs known to those people engaged in that industry.  If we get a distinctive design recognised as Irish, we will sell our goods abroad in a competitive market at good prices, not because they are Irish but because they are of good artistic design.  Added to that, the fact that they have come from Ireland will be better than any amount of money spent on advertising, promotion work or public relations officers.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that the Council should have published that advice given to the Taoiseach.  I think it is proper both from the point of view of those who gave the advice and the point of view of the public that the advice and recommendations given should be brought to the public notice, either immediately or after the lapse of a year or two.  It is desirable that the public should know the advice given by the Arts Council to the Taoiseach <Col N="1128" /> with reference to the desirability of the immediate implementation of the Scandinavian design report.</P>
    <P>It is to be noticed that in the previous year no such reference was made to that.  We may take it from that that this was the only advice or recommendation made to the Taoiseach.  It is a vital matter of public importance that we should know what is being done about that, whether what is being done is in accordance with the recommendation and, if not, what are the reasons why it is not.  I make this comment not by way of criticism of the Council's report but to put a suggestion to them for the future that instead of their report being in the form of a catalogue or list, they should give not merely some indication of what was done, but some short account of the purpose of such activity, what the result was, what was hoped to be achieved and what was achieved.</P>
    <P>The next item in the list is the recommendation by the Council to the Minister for Education in connection with the inadequacy of the teaching of art in the schools.  This is a matter of vital importance to the education authorities, to the children and generally to our hopes for the furtherance of artistic talent in reference to design in the country.  What is being done on that recommendation? What was the recommendation?  If it has not been attended to, what are the reasons?  It is not by way of criticism that I make these points but it is proper that we should know what the recommendations were.  If the authorities carried out the recommendations, it is all right: we will know something is being done.  If they do not, let us know the reason why.</P>
    <P>It would be proper in this report for the Council to say what recommendations they did make.  There is nothing privileged about it.  It is the duty and it is the function of the Arts Council to be completely independent of Government Departments.  If they have not got that independence, you will not get proper advice.  You will not get courageous advice.  You will not have that stirring of the waters so necessary to produce results.</P>
    <P>There is a small point of little importance <Col N="1129" /> perhaps except in so far as it impinges upon the tourists who come in here.  There is an item advice to Bord Fáilte Éireann in connection with the design of a poster for display at Glendalough and of plaques for erection at historical sites and monuments. That is a matter of some importance from the point of view of the tourist industry.  For many years, we were afflicted with the miserable trivialities of our tourist advertising. Sometimes it descended to the lowest depths, to the caubeen and the shillelagh, not to speak of the leprechaun.</P>
    <P>I should have hoped that the Arts Council would have long since exorcised that sort of spirit which appears to be still permeating some sections of the United States.  I should like to know what this advice was and what caused the Council to give the advice. Was it because they objected to some of the inartistic activities of Bord Fáilte Éireann, or what was the reason?  The very fact that we do not know what the reason was, what recommendation was made, or whether it was carried out, gives rise to suspicion that there was something wrong and that Bord Fáilte Éireann said: &ldquo;These fellows are too highfalutin' for us.  We know our job.  We have got to sell this country&rdquo;&mdash;to use the modern jargon&mdash;&ldquo;to the tourists abroad, particularly the Americans, and we know what is wanted.&rdquo;  I hope that is not the reason, but, until we know the reason, there are liable to be certain suspicions.</P>
    <P>Our old friend Córas Iompair Éireann also got a bit of advice.  The Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann is on the Arts Council so he was really advising himself about bus shelters. All I can say about the advice is that there is no apparent improvement in the design of the bus shelters either in the city of Dublin, or elsewhere, as a result of the advice by the Arts Council to Córas Iompair Éireann. There, again, we do not know what motivated it, but anybody who looks at these shelters just shudders when they pass them by; they are an indignity on our capital city.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council also gave advice <Col N="1130" /> to Nítrigin Éireann in connection with the proposed factory at Arklow.  What was that advice?  Did anybody take any notice of it?  I know one factory &mdash;I shall not mention any names&mdash; which was told the design of their goods was very bad.  They said it was good enough for them because, with the protection of the tariff, they were able to sell to the Irish people.  I hope that mental attitude does not still persist.</P>
    <P>Again, we have the Royal Dublin Society in relation to Art teaching and the inadequacy of the amounts of the Taylor Scholarship, and other awards administered by the Society, to attract competition among young artists.  The Royal Dublin Society are certainly a very progressive institution and I have no doubt they would be open to advice from the Arts Council and prepared to implement that advice.  I do not think they would be backward in asking the Arts Council for a grant if it were a question of money.  But we do not know why this was done.  We do not know the effect of it.  There should be a little more detail and information under each of these headings and under the heading of &ldquo;Other Activities&rdquo; in this report.</P>
    <P>In the last item, they refer to their efforts to get the Government to have something like a national art annuities fund to be administered by the council, for the purpose of providing annuities for creative workers of outstanding distinction in the arts, advanced in years and, by reason of ill-health, unable to fend properly for themselves.  An approach was made to the Government for financial aid in order to enable the fund to be established. What was done as a result of that?  I sincerely sympathise with the Taoiseach in connection with anything like a Civil List or the establishment of this new fund, of which I never heard before.  If that were founded, it would be outside the objections that could be made to an ordinary Civil List on the lines of the British Civil List.  If it were confined, as is apparently intended here, to providing annuities for creative workers of outstanding distinction in the arts, advanced in years and, by reason of ill-health, unable to fend properly for <Col N="1131" /> themselves, then it would be an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach is overwhelmed with applications for grants for this, that, and the other.  Consider what this Council has.  It has only £30,000 after 12 years in existence. That is the merest drop in the ocean. That is a fleabite compared with expenditure on public services.  It is the merest fleabite compared with the amount spent by France, Italy, Germany, the Scandinavian countries on the various arts, creating a feeling amongst artists that they are wanted, that they are needed, that they are a very useful and essential cog in the industrial machine.</P>
    <P>I recommend this matter to the sympathetic consideration of the Taoiseach. What is important is what has been left unsaid rather than what has been said.  What is pinpointed is the lack of the necessary funds to do the things that should be done.  The final comment in the report is &ldquo;Many proposals for artistic activities and applications for financial assistance, although sympathetically considered by the Council, could not be brought to a conclusion either because of lack of funds or for other reasons&rdquo;.  I appreciate the fact that there are all sorts of useful activities and all sorts of people doing artistic work in the country who are deserving of funds but who cannot get them at present.  I believe there are priorities in this as in everything else.  I believe there should be a fairly substantial addition to the amount of money given to the Arts Council and they should be encouraged to do everything they can to ameliorate the position in industry and bring about a position in which we can hope in the not too distant future that there will be a great concentration of effort to apply the principles of the visual and other arts to industry and, in particular, to get the very best designs for our products.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out the technical fact that what I moved here today was a Supplementary Estimate and not the Main Estimate for the year.  Because the Main Estimate was passed with a number of others, <Col N="1132" /> without discussion, earlier in the year we have not had an opportunity of discussing the Main Estimate.</P>

      <P>I raised no point of order when the Deputy was speaking. The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to enable An Chomhairle Ealaoín to give £5,000 to the Dublin Grand Opera Society.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few observations on Deputy Costello's remarks. The Deputy asked the question: &ldquo;Have the Arts Council failed?&rdquo;  I do not think it would be fair to suggest failure in connection with the Comhairle. They have a job to do with very limited resources.  In a field of this kind, where there are a number of artistic efforts one would like to support, it is not possible to provide funds on the scale that certain art lovers would like the Government to do or which the Arts Council themselves would like to have.  I want to make it quite clear, in case there is any misunderstanding about it, that I am not holding out any prospect of an increased grant-in-aid next year either.  I am quite certain that, when we come to the preparation of the Budget, all expenditure there will be pruned very drastically.  But, within the limit of the resources given to them, they have been able to give quite useful support to organisations and individuals concerned with the development of one or other of the Arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By my decision, the primary responsibility for the promotion, development, encouragement and improvement of industrial design was transferred from An Comhairle to Córas Tráchtála. When I came to examine the reason why so little progress had been made in this matter, I came to the conclusion it had been initially a mistake to have associated industrial design with art rather than with trade promotion. Indeed, the awakening of interest in industrial design and the tremendous improvement made in this regard in recent years must be largely attributive to the success of Córas Tráchtála in <Col N="1133" /> getting it understood that this was not so much a matter of art and national pride as a matter of sound business.</P>
    <P>The Scandinavian report, referred to by Deputy Costello, was commissioned by Córas Tráchtála.  On getting that report, the Government decided to give to the Minister for Education the specific function of considering the recommendations therein and acting upon such of these recommendations as were approved.  A number of measures were taken by the Minister in that regard, which were communicated to the House during the year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the list given in the Comhairle's report regarding the advice offered to the Government, to individual Ministers or to State boards in specific matters.  One of the functions of the Comhairle is to give advice in these matters, either on their own initiative or when requested.  In some of the cases mentioned in the report, the Comhairle gave advice because they were asked for it.  Bord Fáilte asked for advice regarding the design of commemorative plaques and posters; CIE asked for advice in the design for bus shelters; and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs asked for advice on the design of a stamp.  These were specific problems of artistic content in which an individual Minister or State board asked for the advice of the Comhairle, just as we have asked them to advise us on the form of a memorial to the late President Kennedy.  In other cases, the Comhairle gave advice on their own initiative.  They are entitled to do that, although I did not always agree with it.</P>

      <P>They are.  Sometimes I felt they were wandering a bit outside their particular field.  I hope some day it may be possible to increase the grant-in-aid to the Comhairle.  It was increased a couple of years ago from £20,000 to £30,000. This additional £5,000 can hardly count as an increase since it is already earmarked for a specific purpose.  In future, I hope it may be possible to add to it.  However, I am certain that, <Col N="1134" /> no matter what the amount is, there will always be some possibility for expenditure beyond that.  All we can say to the Comhairle is: &ldquo;Within the limit of the functions given to you in the Act, do the best you can with the money we are making available to you.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>We are also in favour of the teaching of Irish in all schools.  No school should be without a class in which Irish is taught.  However, I would rather see more emphasis on oral Irish as distinct from written Irish.  It is only in that way we can succeed in reviving the language as spoken.  I do not wish to repeat what I said in other years.  I hope I may have thrown out the suggestion adopted by Gael Linn of sending students throughout the 12 months of the year to the Gaeltacht, where they associate and converse with native Irish speakers.  That is a <Col N="1135" /> much better system than sending big numbers of students to the Gaeltacht during the summer months.  During those months, the visitors outnumber the local children and they find they have no one to converse with other than their fellow students.  That is a bad thing.</P>
    <P>There are a few things I wish to say about the standard of the language as laid down by the Department.  It was a very bad thing indeed to have closed down the preparatory colleges situated in the Gaeltacht.  Last year, when speaking on this Estimate, I deplored the closing of Coláiste Bríde in Donegal.  I was very glad then when the Minister assured me the college would be open for a certain portion of the year, during which time it would be occupied by the Army cadets.  In addition to their soldierly activities, they were to go to the Gaeltacht and acquire a spoken knowledge of the language.  Unfortunately, that did not occur this year.  Now we have Coláiste Bríde, one of the finest buildings in the country, closed down for the past two years and costing the taxpayers £1,000 per year.</P>
    <P>The preparatory colleges were ideal for the bilingual test but we have abolished bilingual tests and we now require teachers to become proficient in Irish after three, four or five years' teaching.  After that length of time, they may be told they have not sufficient Irish, that they are not suitable as teachers, and may be thrown on the labour market.  That is bad.  When we wanted to close the preparatory colleges, we should have taken them one at a time and seen what the effect would be.  Then there would be no necessity to abolish the bilingual test.</P>
    <P>In regard to the standardisation of Irish, where examination papers are set in the standardised Irish, there should be given, in brackets at least, the term most commonly used in the particular locality.  It would give a child who is a native Irish speaker an opportunity of knowing the purpose of the question.  May I refer to one question set last year for the primary scholarship examination?  A child was asked to write an essay on &ldquo;An <Col N="1136" /> scéal is deise dár léigh tú ariamh&rdquo;. The use of &ldquo;Scéal&rdquo; there gives rise to ambiguity.  Many pupils wondered did the examiner mean a novel.  If it was a novel, then he should have used the word &ldquo;úrscéal&rdquo;.  There would have been no ambiguity there if the question had been phrased: &ldquo;An Leabhar nó an Scéal úr is deise dar léigh tú ariamh.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Only last week a child asked me and a number of other Irish speakers who happened to be present the meaning of the word &ldquo;Seinic&rdquo;.  I could not make it out.  The Irish speakers present could not make it out.  Today in the Fine Gael Party room, I asked Irish speakers from Kerry, Connacht and Donegal what was the meaning of this word.  I found it in the dictionary and it means a fox.  In Donegal a fox is known as &ldquo;mada rua&rdquo;.  In Connacht it is the same and a similar word is used in Munster.  Where did they get this word?  It is a mystery to me.  Possibly I have not got the correct spelling of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to drag this matter out.  All I say is that the standardisation of the Irish language is doing more harm than good and I would recommend to the Minister to read the blue book presented by the people interested in the revival of the Welsh language to Mr. Keith Joseph, bearing in mind that a language cannot be imposed on people; it must be embraced voluntarily.  If that is borne in mind we shall really get somewhere with the revival of the language.</P>
      <P>I was very glad indeed to hear the Minister say that he has spent more on the building of national schools this year than has been spent in other years. However, I wonder are we going about it in the right way.  I see one-teacher national schools being built in my county and it is a very bad thing.  One can imagine the difficulty in a one-teacher school of teaching pupils all subjects, and those pupils have to compete with the pupils in schools where there are three, four, or five teachers.  We shall have to have another look at this method of primary teaching in rural Ireland.  I am particularly referring to rural Ireland and I would rather see a central school being built in the parish to which pupils could be transported free and where there would be a teacher for each class.  There would be a teacher for the infant class, one for first and second classes, one for third and fourth classes, and so on.  It is a much better system and gives the backward child a better chance than pushing him into a class presided over by a teacher who has to teach all classes from the infants' class up to sixth or eighth standard, as the case may be, and where he cannot give the attention he would wish to give to each pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where we find one-teacher primary <Col N="1138" /> schools and, for that matter, two-teacher primary schools a drawback is in the competition for scholarships to secondary and vocational schools. It is very unfair to ask pupils, say, from a school in some rural part of Mayo or Donegal to compete against students taught in a Christian Brothers' school where there are additional classes on a Saturday, where additional grinds are given and where there are teachers for each such class.  A certain number of post-primary scholarships should be reserved for one and two-teacher schools.  I know in my own county we have reserved a number for two-teacher schools.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see by the Minister's speech today that in regard to secondary education he has reserved a number of scholarships for island pupils.  That is a very good thing. There should be a condition laid down by the Department that a certain number of primary scholarships will be reserved for one-teacher and two-teacher schools as distinct from multiteacher schools.  In rural Ireland, there are some small pockets in which there are one-teacher, Church of Ireland schools.  In my county, there are a number of Catholic schools with only one teacher each, and if you examine the results, you will find that the multiteacher schools get many more scholarships in proportion to the number of pupils than do the one-teacher schools. It is something the Minister should look into if we are to give a fair crack of the whip to all students seeking post-primary education.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is right at this stage that I should refer to the attempt being made to lower the age at which children may compete for post-primary scholarships to 11 years. I hope that will never happen.  I hope 12 years will be the minimum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirteen years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very bad indeed if the age were to be lower than 12.  As the Minister told us today, in 1961 there were 2,112 more pupils in national schools than in 1962. If we continue to syphon off the pupils at a very early age into the vocational <Col N="1139" /> and secondary schools, it will be a very bad thing and I would not recommend or support it.  It is difficult enough in rural Ireland to cram the curriculum laid down by the Department into a period of seven years.  Usually in the country, owing to inclement weather, children do not go to school until they are five years of age.  That means they have to get through the curriculum set for primary scholarships in seven years.  If we are to lower that we would be doing it to the advantage of the multi-teacher schools.</P>
      <P>On the question of the curriculum in primary schools, I was very glad to read recently that the Minister proposes to appoint a physical culture inspector to organise the teaching of physical training in the national schools.  That is a very good thing.  It was done when I was in the national school and it was a pity it was ever dropped.  I sincerely hope the Minister is serious in suggesting it should be revived.</P>
      <P>In fact I suggest the Minister could go further.  His colleague, the Minister for Local Government, has initiated a campaign on road safety.  There is no place we can teach road safety better than in the national school. Therefore, the Minister might set up a liaison with the Department of Justice and arrange that a member of the Garda would give a lecture on road sense, say, once a month, in the national schools in his area.  It would go a long way towards eliminating road accidents.</P>
      <P>Quite recently, I was told of a case where a Garda attended a national school and pointed out to the children how they should best use the road as pedestrians.  At the same time, in a national school quite near at hand, the teacher taught the pupils the very opposite.  There was no standardisation of instruction.  The Garda had told the children they should walk facing the traffic, whereas the teacher told them they should always walk on the left hand side of the road, which is the incorrect thing.  If these lectures are to be given, there should be standardisation of instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on the subject, I should mention the teaching of civics in our <Col N="1140" /> primary schools.  We all know of the wanton damage caused by children coming and going to schools.  I do not believe the damage is either wanton or malicious: I believe it is due to thoughtlessness that the children are not taught the difference between what they should do and what they should not do.  It is all very fine to teach them the Commandments, but unless you bring that instruction down to practical level, you will get nowhere. We all know what a lovely cockshot the insulators on telegraph poles were to us when we were at school.  We were unaware of the fact that our parents had to pay for the damage we did to them and if that had been taught to us properly, I think we would have had much more respect for the property of both the State and the individual.</P>
    <P>Of course we can never have peace in our national schools until our teachers are satisfied.  With this object in view, there should be close liaison between the Minister and the INTO to ensure that teachers' grievances, their complaints, their needs, their suggestions, are dealt with, not in an aggressive manner but in a spirit of freedom and co-operation.  If that could be achieved, I have no doubt it would result in much more peace and harmony, much more satisfaction in our schools than we have at the moment.  I note that in his Estimate, the Minister provides for preferential scholarships for island pupils.  I think he should go a little further and show some preference towards island teachers.  We find great difficulty in getting teachers to stay in our islands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is sufficient to keep them in the islands.  They should get at least two years' increments.  The Minister for Health did it in certain cases when he found difficulty in getting doctors for isolated islands, and it has worked very satisfactorily.  I would recommend it now to the Minister for Education.  I know islands in my part of the country where the people have <Col N="1141" /> not seen a trained teacher in the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>If an inducement by way of increment were given, I do not believe we would have such great difficulty in getting teachers to reside in these islands.  I can think of one island, off Donegal coast&mdash; it is Rutland Island, of which I am sure the Minister saw a photograph recently&mdash;where there were 24 families 25 years ago.  The last resident left there the other day.  I was a pupil there and at that time there were 30 other pupils.  Now they have all gone to the mainland.  I am glad the Minister is giving some small concession to island teachers.  I advocated it last year and I trust it is not too much to hope that it was because of my advocacy he is giving this small concession.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to say very much further on the problem of post-primary education.  However, I suggest something should be done about official cramming in the national schools for post primary scholarships.  Sometimes the schools are used for it and I do not blame the enthusiastic teachers for doing this in their spare time.  It is very difficult for schools who depend on small pockets in rural Ireland for their pupils to compete against it.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, the Minister when talking about secondary education said 45 per cent of our primary students had secondary education made available to them as compared with 40 per cent across the water.  That is a very high standard compared with Britain. What would happen if we had jobs for all these pupils who got secondary education?  Unfortunately, we have not. We cannot hope to have jobs for them for many years to come.  That is the reason why I think they should be equipped to take up employment abroad if they cannot do so at home and why I should like to see something done about the Leaving Certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it right to refuse the Leaving Certificate to any student who fails to pass in English or Irish.  The Leaving Certificate should be given to every student who passes in any subject, even in one subject.  He should get a certificate as having passed in <Col N="1142" /> that subject.  The Minister may say he will get some sort of certificate, on payment of a fee, to the effect that his marks in certain subjects were such and such.  That is not sufficient. Leaving Certificates and Intermediate Certificates should be given to any person who has acquired a certain standard in any subject he wishes to sit for and they should specify the subjects in which he has reached the qualifying percentage.  It is unfair to refuse certificates to those who fail in the compulsory subjects the Department have laid down.  Suppose a certain student, having got the Leaving Certificate, wishes to take up post-secondary education abroad.  The Irish language will not be very useful to him unless he wants a degree in Celtic Studies or something like that, but if he had a certificate showing the subjects in which he had passed or got honours, it would help to get him admission to some post-secondary educational establishment abroad.</P>

      <P>Let me deal with secondary schools.  I was glad to note in the Minister's remarks that the number of pupils attending secondary schools has considerably increased.  I wonder to whom credit is due?  I believe it is due to the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools.  I do not believe we have given them the credit they deserve or that the Minister has taken them into his confidence as he should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago as a result of a Press conference given by the Minister, they produced very voluminous and enlightening information, including a statement on post-primary education, a map setting out the percentage of secondary schools in various localities and that very informative document <i>Investment in Education in the Republic of Ireland.</i>  These documents did not receive from the Department the <Col N="1144" /> recognition they deserved and I think if they had been presented to the delegation from OECD that visited here earlier in the year, they would have been most useful or, if those who produced the documents had been called into consultation with the delegation, they could have done a considerable amount of good.</P>
    <P>With the exception of one or two in the fíor-Ghaeltacht, these people have built their schools at their own expense and no grant was made available by the Minister.  Now, if they wish to enlarge their schools, they must do so out of capital.  If they want equipment to bring them up to date in physics or science, they must procure it out of their own resources. Some fund should be made available to voluntary secondary schools and they should get much more recognition than they are getting from the Department. Through the Minister or otherwise, there should be some liaison between the various branches, primary, vocational and secondary.</P>
    <P>I know a secondary school which was most anxious to procure a teacher of drawing.  The vocational education committee had an excellent teacher employed five nights a week.  The principal of the secondary school was anxious to procure this teacher for a Saturday, which is his free day, and for one other day in the week during which he is not working, but the vocational education committee said: &ldquo;You cannot do that; he is a whole time employee of ours&rdquo;.  That is something the Minister could look into and he could have some liaison between secondary and vocational schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He is trying to do that and he has failed.  He said they were like two horses galloping in different directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I said they used be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This happened within the past month and it is very bad.  It shows there is no liaison.  A national teacher can teach Irish or he can give grinds, and rightly so; secondary teachers and professors in the University can do likewise; but teachers in vocational schools, who are engaged <Col N="1145" /> only for five days, are debarred from taking up employment on the days they are not employed in a vocational school.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter and see if something can be done about it.</P>
      <P>We all know that a serious effort is being made to equip our secondary schools, voluntary and otherwise, in an up-to-date manner, particularly in regard to physics and chemistry, but funds will have to be made available. I want to see all secondary schools getting whatever funds are available divided equally between them and being given an equal opportunity of competing with each other.  If the Minister does that, he will be doing something good for education generally.</P>
      <P>With regard to vocational schools, we are doing a fairly good job.  We are building more schools, but, in my opinion, and I have always said it, a vocational school is the poor man's university.  However, it is no longer a school of carpentry, sewing or cooking. We must go beyond that in this technical age and if we are to go beyond it, we must make more money available for the procuring of teachers and the equipment necessary to give us the knowhow in industry.</P>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister informing the House that fishery and marine engineering courses are now given in Kilronan vocational school.  I cannot understand why Kilronan was selected.  If the Minister tells me that it is a start, I shall accept that, but Kilronan can cater only for the island and I would rather see these courses being established in the centre of the fishing industry where young men are available to attend them.  I hope this experiment in Kilronan, if it is an experiment will be extended and that it will do a considerable amount of good for this industry which has been badly neglected down the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to note that the Minister has now decided to give credit to secondary teachers for teaching service in the Six Counties on and after the year 1962-63.  This is something we advocated here last year but why is it post-1962-63?  The Minister should go <Col N="1146" /> back further.  We have done it in the case of secondary teachers who have taught abroad and we could follow that example in the case of secondary teachers teaching in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>While on this subject, may I mention that in national schools we employ married women; in secondary schools, we employ married women, but in the vocational schools, the one category in which we have a shortage of teachers, married women are debarred from taking up employment.  That is not right and I would appeal to the Minister to employ&mdash;or re-employ, if he has already suspended their employment on marriage&mdash;married women, not in a temporary capacity but as they are re-employed in national and secondary schools and if he is going to do that, to give teaching credit to those who went into the Six Counties when they were debarred here on their marriage from teaching.  If he does that, he will be doing something which is only fair and right for vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>If I might deal with the universities for the moment, may I say that recently we were all very proud of the part our Army cadets played at the funeral of the late lamented President Kennedy. The cadet has a very high standard of secondary education but immediately he joins the Army he is debarred from procuring university education.  That is not right.  Not alone should cadets be given the opportunity but they should be encouraged to study for university degrees.  The infantry or cavalry cadet, once his term of service in the Army expires, is thrown on to the labour market.  If these cadets are doctors or engineers, they are qualified to go into their professions, but the foot-slogger or the transport officer is immediately thrown on the labour market and has to seek employment in England or in manual labour in this country.</P>
    <P>I remember the time when we exported our graduates to teach and practise medicine in darkest Africa. We have now gone the full round of the clock and today citizens of darkest Africa are manning our hospitals.  I do not know the reason for that.  All the rural hospitals, the county and district <Col N="1147" /> hospitals, are manned by non-nationals at the moment.  Is it a fact that we are not paying our young graduates sufficient money?  It is something which concerns the Minister because he should not only be concerned with providing education for the young people but with their employment afterwards.  It is a sad reflection on our State that we have to man our hospitals by non-nationals. I shall say no more on that.  Those we have in Donegal certainly did not come from the Gaeltacht and have no knowledge of the Irish language, spoken or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Last year I said that post-graduate courses in all faculties are very essential. We know that modern medicine now requires one year's post-graduate course before the graduate gets his degree.  That is quite right.  The same thing should apply in the engineering faculty so that in addition to three years' university education, there would be one year of practical experience in the field before the conferring of a degree.  Post-graduate work is essential.  If a young engineer does not do it, he is thrown on to the labour market and finds himself merely a clerk of works for two or three years without very much money, with the result that we have a good deal of emigration from the ranks of those graduates.</P>
    <P>I have received a few complaints from individuals which I would like to mention to the Minister before concluding. Some time ago, the Minister promised increases in arrears of salaries to certain national school teachers.  They actually received the first instalment of these increases, but now, instead of getting the remainder, they are being surcharged and a refund of the advance is being sought.  I know one teacher who received notification from the Paymaster General in 1960 of an increase of £140 16s. 8d.  In December, 1962, he received a payable order for £10, representing an advance in respect of arrears from 1st August, 1962.  He wrote several times to the Department asking them when he would receive the remainder and, after <Col N="1148" /> a lengthy correspondence, he was told that he was wrongly informed by the Department in the first instance and that they would now like to get a refund of the £10.  I shall be pleased to give the Minister details of that case so that he can investigate it.</P>
    <P>One could talk for hours on the Estimate but we are now, as the Minister pointed out, about to make vocational, secondary and university education available to many more people.  At least we were told that he was going to do that but we have seen nothing done about it.  We are now dealing with the current year's Estimate and we could not expect to find anything about it in that but we shall look forward to hearing something about it on the Estimate for the coming year.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to the publication on Irish education issued by the Federation of Irish School Teachers. If he has not got a copy of it or if his officials have thrown their copy of it into the wastepaper basket, I shall be pleased to present him with another one.  I am assured that OECD were very anxious to get a copy of it and that they were much impressed by its contents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I must speak at some disadvantage on this Estimate because I have not with me some data which I had intended to use.  The Estimate came on rather quickly and so my remarks will have to be of a somewhat general nature.  Just as Deputy O'Donnell was struck by the absence of any reference to the Irish language in the Minister's statement, I was equally struck by the absence of any reference to agricultural education in that statement.  I sat through some of the discussions on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and we heard in that discussion of the importance of the role which agriculture is playing, and will be playing, in the economy of this country during the coming years.  It was therefore with some amazement and disappointment that I did not hear the Minister refer to agriculture or to any of its associated subjects in his speech here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He did make reference to the plans <Col N="1149" /> for the teaching of science in general, both as regards equipment and everything else.  I congratulate him for that but I wonder does he include in the proposed grant of £150 per teacher of science the agricultural science teachers. I hope he does, because agriculture has more bearing on our economy than our present industrial activities.</P>
    <P>The new plans for post-primary education announced by the Minister early in the year did not deal with all the problems which confront us but they may be regarded as a certain step forward.  These plans were more or less contained in the Labour Party's policy programme issued earlier this year. We do not begrudge the Minister taking some of our ideas.  We only hope that he will have another look at that policy and take some more of our plans.  I had expected a little more information in the Minister's statement this evening.  It is now eight months since he announced the plan and whilst he said that surveys were going on, I had hoped that he would have some indication from those surveys&mdash; he might not have conclusive data&mdash;of how things were going.  It might be difficult to say where the proposed schools will be placed or what kind of school will be provided but he could have told us the exact nature of the schools, the kind of teachers required for them and the number of these schools he intends to provide.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party issued a policy statement on education early this year and this is the only up-to-date policy of any Party in this country.  The main objective of that policy is to provide free post-primary education to every child who has the ability to avail of it.  There are two great barriers to that proposal at the moment, the financial and the geographical.  If parents cannot afford to provide post-primary education for their children, generally speaking, the children just have to go without, irrespective of ability.  There is, too, the haphazard distribution of our secondary schools.  In some areas, we have too many secondary schools; in others, too few.  That barrier must also be broken down.  Post-primary schools, secondary or comprehensive, must be <Col N="1150" /> provided in areas where such educational facilities are not available at the moment.</P>
    <P>We welcome the proposal to raise the school-leaving age ultimately to 16.  Coupled with that, we should like to see a revised curriculum in the primary schools.  It is far too narrow and entails pupils concentrating on English, Irish and arithmetic because those are the subjects they need in order to get the primary certificate, which is the Leaving Certificate of the national school.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell referred to instruction in road safety by the Garda Síochána.  I should prefer to see that instruction included in the curriculum of the national schools and given by the teacher.</P>

      <P>It might on some, but I think it would be far better if instruction in road safety were included in the curriculum as part of the instruction in civics.</P>
      <P>Last year I mentioned the need for proper facilities for school medical examination.  It is important that every school-going child, from the infant class upwards, should have a thorough medical examination at least every two years.  Most of our schools have not the facilities for such examination at the moment.  A provision in all school building in the future should be a separate room in which medical examinations can be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister dealt at length with the need for schools and teachers for the mentally and physically handicapped.  There has been no <Col N="1151" /> mention of that this year, but I know the Minister cannot mention everything. The problem is still a very big one in the country areas.  I know parents who have been waiting for years to get a place in a suitable school for mentally or physically handicapped children.  I urge the Minister to keep up the good work mentioned by him last year.</P>
    <P>With regard to secondary education, about one in four primary school leavers can avail of secondary education at the moment.  I know we cannot provide free secondary education for all overnight, even though this must be our eventual goal.  In the interim period, however, more scholarship provision could be made and other proposals could be entertained to improve the position.  I was impressed by a proposal by Cavan County Council to provide money on a loan basis so that children could avail of secondary and university education. The Minister indicated that he intends to have a look at this proposal.  I think the lead which has been given would be taken up by other counties, provided the Minister gave the necessary permission.  There are certain restrictions on the issue of these loans and I approve in general of these restrictions.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to private committees throughout the country which, by certain fund-raising methods, are providing scholarships for children who could not otherwise afford secondary education.  In my part of the country, past pupils have got together and started a competition &mdash;a &ldquo;Tops of the Town Competition&rdquo;&mdash;to provide scholarships in necessitous cases.  I should like to take this opportunity of complimenting that group and similar groups operating in other towns.  This is not the answer, of course, to the problem but it does help to relieve the situation in the interim period.</P>
    <P>With regard to vocational education, there should be an opportunity for all vocational school pupils to avail of higher technological and university education.  At the moment this facility is available in Bolton Street.  It would <Col N="1152" /> help to remove the image referred to by Deputy P. O'Donnell&mdash;the image of our vocational schools as the poor man's university.  If pupils in vocational schools had the same opportunity of proceeding further as the pupils of secondary schools have, that image would be completely removed.</P>
    <P>I should like to come back to primary and secondary education and refer to the question of physical instruction.  I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister of the appointment of physical instruction inspectors.  I would ask him to go a little further and recognise, for incremental purposes, the services of physical instructors at present engaged by schools and colleges.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the Minister to recognise teaching service abroad for incremental purposes.  We have in the Minister's statement reference to various means by which the Minister hopes to improve the method of teaching modern languages and science. Much of the expenditure on these proposals would be unnecessary if the Minister recognised teaching service abroad.  I know teachers abroad, well equipped for the teaching of modern languages and up-to-date science, who would be happy to come home.</P>
    <P>It is very important that a vocational guidance scheme be set up immediately. Dublin Vocational Committee have such a scheme and it has proved itself very useful.  With the introduction of comprehensive schools and free secondary education, it will be necessary to have some form of vocational guidance.  What I mean is guidance on a voluntary basis.  I do not mean a vocational guidance inspector telling a child what it should do.  It should not be compulsory.  It should be up to the parents, or the child itself, having got the advice, to do whatever they think fit.  A child should be advised whether it should take a secondary course or a vocational course, and advice should be available at the end of the course to guide the child further.  There should be research into various employments and into the various Faculties in the universities.  There should be up-to-date information in regard to opportunities <Col N="1153" /> available.  When it was found that we had too few doctors, too few dentists and too few vets in this country, there was a mad rush into these professions.  But when these people are qualified in seven or eight years, the position may be the reverse and we might not need all we think we need now.  A proper vocational guidance system would prevent that.</P>
    <P>I would also advocate an extension of adult education.  There are many adults who had not the money to avail of higher education when they were young.  Many of those people would be willing now, if the opportunity offered, to avail of further education. While there is in a limited degree some opportunity for adult education, I do not think it is as much as we would like it to be.</P>
    <P>A national planning branch in the Department of Education is most important. As the Minister realises in his statement, this would bring together the four water-tight compartments into which our educational system has developed over the years&mdash;primary, secondary, vocational and university. There is a high wall, as it were, between each branch.  The national planning branch would comprise officials of the Department, public representatives, teachers, representatives of the Churches and representatives of other interests.  Educational policy is not something we can decide today and say: &ldquo;That is that.&rdquo;  We must at all times be willing to change with changing times and to plan ahead.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the provision of regional colleges which, I understand, would provide a higher technological education.  Kilkenny would be an ideal centre for such a college.  It is within 30 miles of Waterford, Carlow and Clonmel. Coupled with the provision of these colleges, we would need to have a free transport system for pupils.  The fact that a regional college would be in, say, Kilkenny and not Carlow should not place Carlow at a disadvantage. That disadvantage should be counteracted by the provision of free transport services for pupils.</P>
    <P>One of the bad features I see about <Col N="1154" /> reformatory and industrial schools is that there is no distinction between the people committed there for lawbreaking and the children committed because of domestic circumstances, family neglect, loss of parents or some such reason.  Some definite distinction should be made.  Children coming out of those schools should not all be labelled more or less the same.  I also think our vocational schools system would be useful to these children because some of them who are in industrial schools through no fault of their own come out into the world and if statistics were available, one would find the girls usually take up domestic work and very hard work, and the boys usually become messengers and so on.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's speech on next year's Estimate early in the New Year and I hope he will have some definite information on the comprehensive schools.  This question has been left long enough and there is no more time to waste in providing these schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking forward like the last speaker to the Minister's next Estimate in a few months' time. In connection with this Estimate, there is an unreal situation.  We are trying to analyse proposals made by the Minister and to find out how the money he is asking for is to be spent, notwithstanding the fact that three-fourths of that money has been spent already, and the Minister's proposals and any of the brilliant proposals he gets from all sides of the House must be telescoped into a new period.</P>
      <P>It is a boring truism that the Minister's Department is the most important Department in the State.  The prospects we have of making this country a prosperous and progressive country, in which our children will grow up in security, really depend on what is done by the Minister and his successor, by the officers of his Department, and by those engaged in education, that is, accepting the proposition that we want every child to have full education to match his ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Department is subject to such <Col N="1155" /> great criticism as the Department of Education.  However, the Minister can be comforted by the fact that this happens everywhere in the world. Educational authorities everywhere are the subject of vociferous and sustained attack.  Everywhere in Ireland there is a preponderance of amateur educationists.  Even the Labour Party have decided they have proposals to make the like of which have never been made before.  I am sure that in the benches behind him, the Minister will find varied views about what should be done for education. Furthermore, I do not think I am speaking completely for my Party when I urge the things I think should be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister's job and that of his successor is to get a balanced view of education generally.  It is almost asking too much because in this country we all have our prejudices and we all ride hobbyhorses.  Nevertheless, the great variety of criticisms against which the system has to sustain itself leads me to think now, in my more advanced years, that probably the Irish system is not too bad, that it has served us pretty well.  Bearing in mind our history, the peculiar circumstances of the country, the difficulties of transition, and the problem of imposing new ideals on our people two generations ago, on the whole, we have not done badly.  That is the line we should take.  We should not always cry stinking fish.</P>
    <P>Some of the words the Minister has used in the past and even today show that he has tended to take a pretty long and steady look at the whole situation.  It is a very complex picture.  One thing we can all acknowledge is that an almost unpayable debt is owed by this country to the religious orders who have engaged in teaching here for 100 years.  I do not refer particularly to such things as technical ability or educational qualifications but idealism and nationalism and, of course, before all of these things, belief in the word of God.  What these men and women have done for this country will never be properly rewarded in this world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> Regarding the others, the great army of teachers who are non-religious, they too, have made a very considerable contribution and like teachers in most other parts of the world, they are rightly dissatisfied with the way in which society has rewarded them. Although the matter here can be said to be <i>sub judice,</i> may I say I think we should resolve it?  I hope we will not obey the world pattern but that we will pay our teachers a reasonable reward for the work they do and that we will not make them the unpaid servants of the people they are in most other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently expressed decisive views about the development of post-primary education.  What he envisages is that this will give a choice to the secondary school student to move into advanced technological or technical training, a vocational type of education, or to go to the university and to study the humanities.  There is evidence in his speech that there has been a very considerable public interest in this.  What the evidence is of that I am not as sure as the Minister seems to be, but those of us who have participated in the work of conducting vocational education are very interested in the Minister's proposals which, however, would seem to be in the realms of paper planning at the moment.</P>
    <P>Some much more concrete proposal will have to be devised before we can judge whether the Minister's plan will work or not.  What the Minister proposes to do can be reasonably well done in the areas of fair concentrations of population, but there are many areas in the country where those facilities will not be in existence.  I suppose it is the currently accepted version of education as we now understand it.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that what has happened is something like the man who jumped on a horse and rode away furiously in several directions.  I propose to get on the horse of vocational education and ride off steadily in one direction.  Of course vocational education is not now, and has not been for years, what Deputies described here as the poor man's education.  A completely different context has surrounded it: it is now akin, at lower level, to <Col N="1157" /> university education, particularly in the cities.</P>
    <P>It is very essential that we make sure that these systems of education are fitted properly for the problems that the country now has to face.  Our great lack has been advanced technical education.  Now, under developments in industry and agriculture, the great growth of new techniques requires us to have facilities ready to do this work, and the money we spend on this will be the most sensibly spent money of all the Minister's Department controls.</P>
    <P>The teaching of skills, and more than skills, is an essential part of the late 1960s.  My experience is of the scheme in Cork city where we have 4,000 pupils taking vocational education, 200 teachers and five schools, and we have not got enough.  The most important schools are those that teach technical subjects and commercial practices, but in a city like Cork, which is now attracting to a very large degree the main concentration of heavy industry in the country, it means a very considerable amount of extra work.  Almost every month new courses are being provided by the vocational education committee for the city and the surrounding areas, courses of the type that were unheard of even 15 years ago, most advanced courses.</P>
    <P>In the committee, we have to deal with this in a breathless manner.  We are always trying to catch up with the job, and great credit is due to the officers of that committee who have tried to do their best to keep abreast of current trends and demands with insufficient premises, with insufficient staffs to meet this great new development, this great new encroachment of students.  We have had to buy or hire new premises, to have them adjusted, in the most unsatisfactory manner, for want of a better phrase, and a lot of our training has been carried out in hole and corner circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious to us in Cork that this is a major and essential development, requiring a much larger school of technical education, a technical college, in fact.  The Minister's Department is aware of the demands and I believe if the impetus of this kind of education in a place like Cork <Col N="1158" /> is to go ahead, great investment will be needed to provide the young people of that area with a place wherein to compete efficiently with the present unsatisfactory methods of teaching, methods which have had to be adopted because of the unsatisfactory nature of the buildings in which the teaching is being conducted.</P>
    <P>We have another problem, that the demand is now greater than the supply of accommodation, and we are having trouble in recruiting the very advanced type of teachers we require for extremely advanced technological subjects. All this is something we cannot afford to talk about or look at: we have to get on and do it, and I would urge strongly on the Minister to ensure that this great burden being placed on this generation in the south is met at least to the extent of his proposals for Dublin.  It is only reasonable we should expect that would be done.  The teaching that is being done, the kind of students being turned out in very advanced subjects, will all add up to something of the utmost importance in the future.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister refer today to the success, which gratified us all, of the international apprentices' competition held in this country last July.  However, I think for the sake of kind public relations, the Minister might have referred to the efforts made in Cork during the three days of the competition.  I know one man who did not get to bed for 48 hours, he had so much to do during that period.</P>
    <P>I want to move on now to ordinary secondary teaching.  I wonder if there is enough consultation with those now involved in the educational machine, the teachers, to put it very simply? The decision of the Department last year to revise the Leaving Certificate mathematics course does seem to have taken the teaching profession by surprise. However desirable a development the decision itself was, I do not think it was good enough to make a decision of that kind on paper, without consultation with those who had to implement such a set of proposals.  The Department were compelled, by reason of the fact that the teaching establishment were not either of a mind or <Col N="1159" /> ready to proceed with this in the manner the Department wanted them to proceed, to postpone it.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable to announce in April proposals to introduce such a revision in September.  Most of the people in the teaching profession are reasonable, efficient and loyal, and I think consultation with them is quite important.  Obviously, the Department must have considered this matter for quite a long time and I do not see why the teachers were not consulted sooner.  There were certain difficulties in connection with the work proposed in regard to which consultation would appear to have been necessary.  None of that consultation took place and the notice was really unbelievable. Obviously, the Department would have to postpone the proposal.  Before substantial and probably very well worthwhile changes are made in curricula, the utmost consultation should take place with all involved in the teaching machine.</P>
    <P>I do not know what I can say about the language that has not been already said but this generation has no right to diminish the effort to restore the Irish language.  We may decide to change the emphasis or the method of teaching but we cannot diminish the energy being put into it.  I shall be quite interested in Doctor Ó Brolchain's survey.  It is quite a necessary investigation and the people will await the results of his examination of the state of the language with great interest. There is grave need to ensure that every one of our children, particularly those leaving secondary and vocational schools, will have at least one continental language.  We must keep on saying that.  The fact that English is rather overpowering in the world today does not prevent us recognising that a knowledge of French, German or Italian is an enormous asset for the future and the effort we must make to extend our influence and interests.</P>
    <P>I believe there should not be a means test for scholarships which should be an encouragement to the brilliant child.  If the child is good enough to obtain such recognition of exceptional <Col N="1160" /> merit, that recognition should not be withheld, no matter what the circumstances of its parents are.  There are no very rich or very poor in the country now and no barrier should exist to the recognition of brilliant children.</P>
    <P>The figures for the growth of secondary education given by the Minister are satisfactory but the provision of schools is a very great burden on those who conduct them.  Many of them are now decrepit and the task of restoration or replacement is almost too grievous to be undertaken generally by the bodies conducting them. One of the most remarkable schools in the country is conducted by the Christian Brothers in Cork city, North Monastery.  The Brothers are still teaching in the building where they taught in 1850 but it is now crumbling. These men came to Cork 150 years ago and did what I, for one, will always thank them for.  They raised the ordinary Irish from their knees in the gutter&mdash;that is where they were&mdash;and taught them the love of God and Ireland and the ordinary essentials of elementary teaching necessary for them to make their simple way in the world. They have progressed enormously, and from the particular school I mention, men have gone all over the world into exalted places.  They have manned the Irish Civil Service and the Front Bench where the Minister now sits.  We owe them a great deal.  But the Brothers who conduct this school are now trying to replace it because it is falling down.  In spite of their recognised service, it is impossible for them to get any subvention to carry on that work.  They must go out hat in hand, hold flag days, beg and borrow and they will not get a penny from the State.  We should consider that situation.</P>
    <P>Our universities have produced many brilliant and many less brilliant graduates, but, on the whole, they have been good.  These graduates have gone all over the world.  I think we send out three out of every five.  I suppose they do good work but universities should be more than factories for producing that kind of product.  I am old-fashioned enough to believe the university is a place where some thinking <Col N="1161" /> should be done.  Besides the absorbing problem of who will fill forthcoming vacancies in university posts, is any thinking being done regarding problems besetting the country now or in the future?  I think the universities have failed us.  We want more than colleges to grind out graduates whom we will export in the proportion of three out of five.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister knows more than I do about the work of the Institute of Advanced Studies.  He told us nothing about it: perhaps when replying he would repair the omission.  I was intrigued by Deputy O'Donnell's reference to the Gardaí giving instruction in our schools in such matters as traffic regulations.  I commend that.  No doubt children are impressed by uniforms and a pleasant young Garda who tells them of the dangers of the road will do more good than television broadcasts and advertisements in the paper.  It is an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>Each year of the ten years I have been here or in the Seanad, somebody has vaguely said that we should do something about teaching civics in school.  It is one of the pious things we say and believe in as being quite necessary. We should teach the children civics; tell them about public property, about how the country is run.  They should know how the county councils, urban councils, and corporations work. They should understand what takes place in the institutions of control here, and in the Dáil itself.  They should be made aware of how we tick.</P>
    <P>The Minister's obvious and displayed interest in design is very important.  I feel very strongly that we must begin in the schools.  Even for a very limited period&mdash;I know the educationists are worried about overloading the curriculum&mdash;we should try to have some weekly reference to the subject, 20 minutes or half an hour.  I see that the Arts Council gave advice to the Minister on this subject.  I do not know what the advice was; the Minister might refer to it in his reply because if he got advice from the Council, I feel sure it was advice along the lines I think necessary and right and we should have some result from that advice.  If <Col N="1162" /> that were so, it would have a considerable influence and would actually mean that future Ministers would not have to worry much about design problems or some of the deplorable things that happen in the country. Future corporations would not entertain such savage proposals as covering in the canal.  They would be taught that this sort of project is so frightful that they would not dare pronounce in favour of it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the National Gallery, I asked last year that we should get some catalogue of what they had.  I should like to find that out because I am not sure if anybody knows what is in the Gallery.  I should like to know precisely what is being done with the Shaw Bequest, what kind of proposals the Minister has received from the Director of the Gallery, whether the money is to be spent on new galleries or on new pictures? Pictures seem to me to be bad value at the moment because there is a highly inflationary period in the picture world.  In what way is the Gallery insured and in what way are the pictures insured?  Are they insured on a real basis?  If they are not, it seems fantastic to me to continue insuring them at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced legislation last year which permitted the National Gallery to lend portion of its collections to responsible authorities up and down the country.  How many loans took place and, if they did not, would I be right in saying that the requirement to insure in transit was a hindering factor?  Would the Minister tell us if any proposals are being made to replace that eminent public servant, Dr. McGreevey, when he leaves the Gallery?</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on what he has done since he became Minister and to thank him for the unfailing courtesy which he always extended to me.  When all the proposals are perfected, and I do not think they will ever be, I hope we are not going to produce only those who are proficient in technical subjects and science and in mathematics.  The humanities must not be overlooked. We can produce technical and literate <Col N="1163" /> human beings but we must strive to produce complete human beings, not examination-passers or job-getters, but thoughtful men who will be able to reflect life in Ireland far longer than they can live.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with my colleague, Deputy P. O'Donnell, in thanking the Minister for his courtesy especially at Question Time here in the House all through the year.  The Minister has set a headline for all members of his Party and his example is something that his colleagues might examine.  There was an interesting little discussion here about the Irish word for &ldquo;fox&rdquo;.  I do not claim to be an expert in the language but everybody behind the Minister said that &ldquo;sionnach&rdquo; was the word for &ldquo;fox&rdquo;.  Then Deputy Coogan, who is an Irish speaker, came into the House and I asked him what was the Irish word for &ldquo;fox&rdquo;.  He wrote back to me that it was &ldquo;maidrín rua&rdquo;.  God help the children from the Pale that got sionnach in their examination papers.  They would not know what it meant.</P>
      <P>I would not dismiss the question of the teaching of civics as lightly as my colleague, Deputy A. Barry.  Should the Minister's Department be called the Department of Education or just the Department of teaching, a Department which teaches children to pass examinations.  Many teachers spend their time trying to anticipate the coming examination papers.  They get all the old answers and try to work out a system of averages.  That is teaching of a sort but we are missing the education.  I think the Minister is interested in this matter.  It is not just the civics in which we are interested.  It has much more to do with the Minister, his Department, the teachers and the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have to do something like what was done by the Minister for Local Government.  He will have to send an appeal to the parents to endeavour to discipline the children before they come to the age of five.  If they do not do that, they will never be disciplined by anybody <Col N="1164" /> and God help the teachers who will try to discipline them.  We know what the Minister and his predecessors have had to suffer from the people who do not want to see punishment in the schools. None of us wants to see children beaten but if you take punishment from the schools, you also take away discipline.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on many of these Estimates and I have repeated from year to year that apart from the techniques of teaching we should also endeavour to teach them to use &ldquo;Please&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; more often. Then there is the gesture of all civilised people that when a grown-up person comes into our schools, we should all stand up.  If any clergyman came into my school, we all stood up and gave him the deference we would expect Irish children to give to such a personage.</P>
    <P>That rule is being lost in many of our schools and there is no use in trying to get it back once it is lost.  It would be just like chasing after the lost cause of the Irish language.  Everybody jumps on my head when I mention the Irish language.  I am not interested in compulsory Irish and I do not care if the Minister has compulsory Irish for an hour every day. I am interested in essential Irish.  The Minister mentioned&mdash;perhaps it was a slip of the tongue&mdash;&ldquo;our own university.&rdquo; We have two universities in Dublin and one in Cork and one in Galway but those that we call our own are only for boys with a knowledge of Irish, but if a boy is born and reared in the Pale and offers himself to the National University and has not got Irish, then the doors will be closed to him.  I hope I will live to see the day when that will be done away with and when Irish boys will leave Ireland with a certificate to say that they have passed mathematics or English, or even if they fail English, that they have passed other subjects.</P>
    <P>In regard to vocational education, there is now a school of thought that we should have colleges of technology, and I am sold on this idea.  I know the great work vocational schools have done all over the country and I will <Col N="1165" /> speak for my constituency and the city of Waterford.  It is the Minister's aim to educate boys and girls so that they will be able to get jobs.  That is one of the great things they are doing in the technical schools in Waterford. Boys with Leaving Certificates go to the technical school for specialised classes which will fit them to go into the glass factory, into Allied Iron Founders, into the chipboard factory or some of the other big factories, and that is all to the good.</P>
    <P>The demand seems to be for higher standards all the time.  It is in a way good that some of these classes are brought about.  Men are brought in to give lectures and preliminary training to boys.  One great man I have in mind is an English speaking Czechoslovakian. I am very glad that the Minister's Department is broadminded enough to say that such men can come in.  They cannot teach through the medium of Irish and if ever that should be made a necessary qualification, we will be missing the best types, those with higher technical education. The move is all for technology and this is going to be a great task for the Minister and his Department because the difficulty will not just be that of finding a building&mdash;that will be difficult enough&mdash;or extending existing technical schools, but to get people who have the highest qualifications.</P>
    <P>I am indebted to a rather distinguished Waterford man, a Master of Science who is now in Cork in an industry there, who was good enough to send me some information about the type of people the Minister will have to get, technologists educated to the standards of a professional institute in engineering, architecture, science, commerce or agriculture, with university qualifications in these faculties, plus some experience in the practical field.  That is very important.  Not only would you require a well qualified university man but a man who worked in heavy industry, in a great assembling industry, or in the manufacturing steel industry.  We have not enough of these people.</P>
    <P>I am not engaging in the usual thinking in which we sometimes indulge, <Col N="1166" /> that all our boys and girls are the greatest in the world.  I went to some of these very brilliant men who were preparing boys to go into the Waterford glass factory and asked: &ldquo;What do you think of these boys?&rdquo;  One of them told me: &ldquo;I often had to make technicians out of boys who had not even enough mathematics and it is very easy for me to face boys looking at me with micrometers in their hands, who know what micrometers are, and who know what decimals are.&rdquo;  I am giving the Minister credit for that, that we are turning out boys up to that stage. We must, however, turn to the next stage and the Minister must find technologists such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>He will also need technicians, people educated to a standard higher than tradesmen and approaching the technologist level.  A technician is likely to be a specialist with a particular facility in a certain industry rather than in a wider field of industry.  I am sure the Minister will understand what I mean.  You could have a specialist in a certain class of tool making, a certain class of precision tool making. This man might not have a university degree but might be a first-class man who could be put into one of the vocational schools to teach boys or into a college of technology.  I am sure if the Minister makes inquiries, he will find that there are many industrialists who are interested in this and who would be prepared to put money and technicians at the Minister's disposal. The Minister will come into this at the actual co-ordinating level.</P>
    <P>My information is that south of a line drawn from Limerick to Cahir, Clonmel and Waterford, excluding local government positions, some 80 to 125 technologists would be needed; some 25 to 35 Masters or Bachelors of Science; 35 to 60 engineers and architects; five to ten in commerce; 15 to 25 in agriculture and dairying; ten to 15 in chemistry, experimental physics, and in sub-grouping of science etc. and in sub-grouping of engineering, electrical, civil and so on, it would work out at about 40.  I recommend this to the Minister.  I recommend it to him more especially as I am aware <Col N="1167" /> of the work his Department has done in regard to the Dublin vocational schools.  They have brought those schools up to a very high standard. That is the way it should be.</P>
    <P>The Minister must now turn his eyes towards other centres of industry in the State.  Deputy A. Barry has mentioned Cork.  I mentioned Waterford.  I am sure Limerick will be mentioned before the debate concludes.  It is near enough to the Minister, and so is Galway. These areas need these colleges, or branches, in their vocational schools. When a new industry is set up, young people are sent to Britain, Germany, or elsewhere, to train.  They are the keymen.  Sometimes people come from Britain or Germany to establish a factory.  That is where the Minister's Department should enter into the picture. Arrangements should be made in local technical schools or colleges for technicians and technologists from these industries to give instruction to these boys and equip them for subsequent employment in the industries of their choice</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned his intention to set up a marine school at Kilronan.  I have been listening to this for the past ten years.  Every time there is anything to be done about fishing over to the west of Ireland it must go.  I have no objection to that but in the south-east we catch twice as much fish.</P>

      <P>I can justify that. Surely no one would ask the Minister to put a school where they catch no fish at all, or in some inland area?  I believe years ago they used to build piers in inland fields just to provide work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but it is something he might fall into; he might be a successor to General John Regan.  I say to the Minister put a school in Kilronan, but I draw his special attention to the south-east coast where there are enormous catches of fish, where there are armadas coming from countries before and behind the Iron Curtain and Mediterranean countries to catch this silver hoard of fish.  It is down there he should put the school.</P>
      <P>With regard to instruction in safety on the roads, the Garda have been lecturing in the schools for years.  Perhaps it would need to be speeded up. Perhaps it would be better if the Garda got the parents and told them something about road safety.</P>
      <P>On many occasions here reference has been made to the need for a proper catalogue for the National Gallery. I believe it is impossible to get out a catalogue because people cannot get at the pictures.  I believe there are numbers of pictures stored in rooms.  They are quite safe.  They are stored under proper conditions.  A proper inventory has not been made for years.  That is not the fault of the dedicated people in the Gallery.  They just cannot get the pictures out to catalogue them or make a proper inventory.  I appeal to the Minister to go to the Gallery and see the situation for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>God rest George Bernard Shaw, I believe we have over £500,000 out of <i>My Fair Lady.</i>  We are told that all that money is being spent on acquiring pictures.  I do not know if the terms of the Bequest confine the outlay to pictures. If the terms would allow some of that money to be used for an extension of the Gallery, that would be an excellent thing.  It would also be an <Col N="1169" /> excellent idea to arrange for selected groups of pictures to be sent down the country to various centres, as they were before, to give the people in the rural areas, especially young art students, an opportunity of seeing these pictures with time to look at them properly. The only way they have of seeing them now is when they come to Dublin on an excursion; they are rushed into the Gallery and rushed out again.</P>
    <P>The National Library is also crowded out.  I know there will be extensions there but the sooner we do something about the situation, the better it will be.  I believe there is an enormous store somewhere in the vicinity of this House in which the Board of Works keep ladders and so forth.  That should be turned over to the National Gallery or the National Library until such time as new buildings are put up.</P>
    <P>Shortly, I believe, we will have some news for the Minister about a museum in Waterford.  I hope that if representations are made to him for some museum pieces or treasures with a local value, he will deal sympathetically with them. There are things stored that people will never see and it would be an excellent idea if these were given on permanent loan, with the proper precautions, to local authorities, through the Tourist Board and the Arts Council, to enable worthwhile local museums to be set up.  That would be of benefit to our own people and an attraction from the point of view of tourists.</P>
    <P>Some time lately the Minister referred to the sad history taught in the schools.  What is really sad is the way history is written.  Some of our own writers were as biassed as their English counterparts.  The time has come when we should have a proper recapitulation of Irish history. I put it to the Minister that a new textbook of history as it really happened should be put into the schools. It is a good thing to write about our great leaders and great men, but this history should also contain something about the ordinary Irish citizen of those times.  When I first read my Irish history, I read all about great warriors and great warriors.  I had <Col N="1170" /> great difficulty finding out how the people lived, what they wore, what their agriculture was and how they smelted their iron.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say I am grateful to the Minister for the courtesy he has always shown me in the matter of parliamentary questions which I tabled.</P>

      <P>Nuair d'éirigh an Teachta Pádraig Ó Domhnaill aréir chun a thuairimí do nochtadh ar an Meastachán seo ba bhreágh liom a bheith ag éisteacht leis fad a bhí sé ag labhairt Gaeilge, ach, faraoir, d'iompaigh sé ar an mBéarla tar éis ábhairín beag Gaeilge do scaoileadh uaidh.  Cháin sé an t-arrachtach gránna ar a dtug sé Gaeilge oifigiúil. Thairg sé giota páipéir chuige agus léigh sé ábhar as a tugadh ag scrúdú éigin.  Seo mar do léigh sé é: &ldquo;Write an essay on `An Sgéal is deas a léigh tú'.&rdquo;  Léigh sé fé dhó é.  Shíl mé gur rith focail a bhí ann nuair do bhain sé feidhm as an mbun-chéim den aidiacht agus, dár ndó, d'imeodh rith focail ar shagart an pharóiste.</P>
      <P>Thairg sé giota eile páipéir chuige ansan agus léigh sé an focal &ldquo;sionnach&rdquo; as.  Dubhairt sé nach raibh a fhios aige cad ba bhrí leis an bhfocal &ldquo;sionnach&rdquo;.  Cheistigh sé Gaeilgeoirí a Phairte féin agus níor thuig éinne acu é.  Scrúdaigh sé foclóir Gaeilge ansan agus fuair sé amach gurab é an t-ainmhí beag sin an madra-rua a bhí i gceist.  Dubhairt sé linn go sollúnta nár cualathas an focal &ldquo;sionnach&rdquo; i dTír Chonaill, i gConamara, i gCiarraí, i gCorcaigh ná i nGaeltacht ar bith eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith a mheabhrú dó go bhfuil an focal &ldquo;sionnach&rdquo; fite fuaite i logainmneacha i ngach contae in Éirinn.  Tá sé le fáil i gContae Chabháin, i nGaillimh, i Muigheo, i gCorcaigh, i gCiarraí, i gContae an Chláir, i gContae Luimneach agus i ngach contae eile.  Tá sé le fáil sna dánta agus i bhfilíocht na Gaeilge. Mar shompla: &ldquo;An sionnach rua ar an gcarraigh, míle liú ag marcaigh, is bean go dubhach san mbealach ag áireamh a cuid gé.&rdquo;  Ní dócha gur airigh an Teachta Ó Domhnaill trácht riamh ar Lios an tSionnaigh, Béal <Col N="1171" /> Átha an tSionnaigh, Caol an tSionnaigh, Poll an tSionnaigh agus na céadta logainmneacha eile go bhfuil an focal &ldquo;sionnach&rdquo; ina eireaball.  Ní dócha gur léigh sé dánta an Raiftearaigh nó Cholm de Bhailís.  Dá léadh, chífeadh sé tagairt don tsionnach sna dánta sin agus cé déarfadh liom nach Connachtaigh iad?  Táim cinnte dhe go bhfuil an focal &ldquo;sionnach&rdquo; le fáil i leabhair na n-údar gcáiliúil ó Thír Chonaill, in Annálacha na hÉireann agus i leabhra nach iad.</P>
    <P>Mholfainn dó an sraith-leabhar a scríobh an Seoigheach, an hÓgánach agus daoine nach iad i dtaobh logainmneacha áiteann.  Tá cuid acu le fáil thíos sa Leabharlann agus má dhearcann sé orthu chífidh sé nach é amháin go bhfuil ainm an tsionnaigh ann ach go bhfuil an broc, an bréach, an laogh, an bho, an tarbh, an capall agus an láir ann, ainm gach ainmhí agus éin dá raibh riamh againn in Éirinn tráth&mdash;fiú amháin an dreancaid! Bíodh an méid sin mar méar-ar-eolas don Teachta Ó Domhnaill agus tá muinín agam ná déanfaidh sé iontas den fhocal &ldquo;sionnach&rdquo; feasta.</P>
    <P>Dubhairt an Teachta Ó Domhnaill linn go raibh sé mar chuspóir ag Fine Gael an Ghaeilge d'aithbheochain mar theanga labhartha.  Rinne an Teachta Tadhg Ó Loingsigh tagairt dona h-éisc a bhíonn ar chósta Phortláirge.  Is dócha go bhfuil aithne aige ar an éinín beag ar a dtugtar seabhaicín na h-aille. Nuair a thagann bile iasc bíonn na faoilleáin ar thóir na mion-éisc ach ní achfuinn don seabhaicín bocht teacht anuas ar an bhfairrge.  Cad a dheineann sé?  Téann sé ar thóir faoilleáin agus ní stopann sé den tóiraíocht go scaoileann an faoilleán a mbíonn fé chrá aige trina chorp siar. Beireann an seabhac ar an gcreach agus is mar sin a gheibheann sé greim a bhéil.  Tá an chaint seo ag Fine Gael i dtaobh Gaeilge éigeantach ins na scoileanna ionchurtha le gnóthaí an tseabhaic.  Ní acfuinn dóibh dua na hoibre do thógaint ar lámhaibh ach ba gheal leo an creach do thógaint uathu siúd a shaothraíonn é.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom traoslú don Aire de bhárr an breis airgid a cuireadh ar <Col N="1172" /> fáil don bhun-oideachais sa Mheastachán. Tá geall le £250,000 breise ann thar mar a bhí san mbliain a ghabh romhainn.  Ba mhaith liom traoslú dó agus do Roinn na nOibreacha Poiblí freisin mar gheall ar an obair íontach atá déanta acu i dtógáil agus i bhfeabhsú scol le bliain anuas.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Ó Domhnaill roint cainte i dtaobh an laghdú atá ar líon na scoláirí ins na bun-scoileanna ach níor chuimnigh sé riamh go mbfhéidir gurb é cúis a bhí leis ná an méadú mór atá ar líon na scoláirí atá ag freastal ar na méanscoileanna agus ar na ceard-scoileanna. Roimhe seo, níor bhéas le tuismitheoirí a gclainn do chur go dtí na meán-scoileanna go dtí go mbéidís 13 nó 14 bliain d'aois.  I láthair na huaire téann cuid acu isteach ins na meanscoileanna nuair a bhíonn 11 bhliain sroichte acu.  Tá a chruthú sin le fáil in óráid an Aire.  Dubhairt sé linn go raibh geall le 5,000 sa mbreis ionrollta ins na meán-scoileanna thar an bliain seo caite.  Mara dtánadar san as na bun-scoileanna, cad as a thánadar?</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - County Roscommon Employment Schemes.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a great deal of regret I ask the House to bear with me for a while here tonight while I explain the position in my constituency in connection with employment. I know it has been a long day here and it is a strain on many people, both officials and Deputies, to have the time prolonged by reason of a discussion on the Adjournment.  I would not have raised this matter, were it not for the fact that many families in my county are in a very serious position through lack of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question which you, Sir, have given me permission to raise is connected with the grave unemployment and serious hardship caused to many families by the closing down of quarries and the use of up-to-date machinery on road works by the Roscommon County Council and the <Col N="1173" /> urgent necessity for providing alternative employment for those workers and small farmers who are being deprived of what hitherto constituted a substantial part of their income.</P>
    <P>An almost similar suggestion as contained in that statement was put to the Minister for Local Government here yesterday and the Minister's reply was to the effect that he had no responsibility and that he was referring the problem to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. He went on to state that grants for the specific purpose of providing employment are dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and: &ldquo;I am forwarding representations already made to me by the council in this matter to the Parliamentary Secretary for consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the details of ministerial responsibility on this but there is no doubt that the man who is really responsible and who should be put in the dock is the Minister for Local Government.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is here and there is such a thing as Cabinet responsibility. Therefore, what I would have liked to say to the Minister for Local Government I propose to say now to the representative of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is an air of gloom and depression in many houses in County Roscommon tonight.  Hundreds of homes in that county will be without the normal Christmas fare, due to the fact that the breadwinners are out of work.  Unless the Government are prepared to step in and help them, they will be out of work from now until perhaps next spring.  That is a serious situation and one that deserves sympathetic consideration by the Government. It is not the responsibility of the Roscommon County Council, although last Monday that county council unanimously supported a resolution directing the county manager and the county surveyor to re-open quarries, which have recently been closed, in order to give some relief in the form of employment to the people who normally received work from the county council on quarries and road <Col N="1174" /> making.  I do not know whether that direction from the county council will be obeyed because the county manager and the county engineer have stated they are only carrying out the policy of the Government as pronounced by the Minister for Local Government. The Minister for Local Government has washed his hands of the matter and the only hope at this stage is that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance will step in and offer some help.</P>
    <P>Deputies from other parts of the country may say: Is it not putting the clock back to criticise the use of machinery and to re-open quarries which have been described as uneconomic, or is it not nonsensical for Deputy McQuillan or other people to suggest that workers should be looked after instead of letting machinery in?  None of the workers in my constituency object to machinery or to efficiency in roadmaking but they do object, and rightly so, to being displaced by machinery unless alternative employment is given to them.  My view is&mdash;and it is supported by members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the county council as well as other members&mdash;that wherever mechanisation or modern techniques are being used for whatever purpose it may be and labour is displaced, alternative employment should be given to such displaced labour.  That is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>When the question of the Common Market and of modernisation of industry was raised, we in the Opposition pressed on the Government the necessity for adaptation grants so that the workers who might be displaced as a result of automation would be given alternative employment so that hardship would be kept away from their families' doors.  Why is it right to look after redundant workers in industry and wrong to look after redundant workers in the rural areas who are employed by local authorities? Why should not the same treatment be given to both sections of the community or is it another example of looking at rural Ireland through the Dublin &ldquo;specs&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Last Monday at a meeting of the <Col N="1175" /> county council a deputation was received from workers who have been working in a local quarry, the Garvinstown quarry.  Twenty-three men who were working in that quarry were laid off.  All of those men have families. Some of the 23 are small farmers with a valuation between £5 and £8 and the remainder of them are cottiers living in county council cottages with a half-acre plot and depending on the county council for work.  They have not even got stamp money now.  What are they to do for Christmas?  Is it not in order to suggest that the quarry should be kept open and work given to as many of these men as possible&mdash;and they are willing to work hard&mdash;until such time as alternative employment is found for them?  The same situation applies in Frenchpark, Gortagarry and several other areas of the county.</P>
    <P>I shall not bore the House with details of each, but I can here give an example in regard to machinery.  A stretch of road last year employed 30 men when it was being edged.  They worked it with shovels and got employment for a limited period.  Deputies may say this was a poor way of doing the job, but I would ask them to cast their minds back to the not too distant past when they could have seen on any road in the country gangs of men with hammers sitting on sacks on top of heaps of stones breaking them by hand for roadworks.</P>
    <P>As I have said, on this stretch of road, these men got work for a limited period each year.  What has happened this year?  One machine and four men are taking the place of the 30 men employed heretofore.  The 26 men thus disemployed are looking on, drawing unemployment assistance.  All have wives and families.  There is no alternative work for them.  Will any Deputy tell me it is a fair or sound economic policy to save money by the introduction of machinery and allow all these men to go idle?</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that these men are most reasonable&mdash;too reasonable from my point of view, too cowed altogether.  They are prepared to say: &ldquo;We do not mind about the machinery; all we want is work.&rdquo;  I ask the Government: why not make work <Col N="1176" /> available for these men?  It is no use expecting the local authority, with limited funds, to do it.  With the single exception of Mayo, County Roscommon has the highest rate for road expenditure in the country, a rate of 15s. in the £.  On the average, many counties are 3s. in the £ lower.  In Roscommon, where we have so many small farmers, the income from the land is only £8 18s. per acre.  In Munster, it is £12 14s. and in Leinster, £11 4s.  We have no industries worth talking about in Roscommon.  The percentage of the county's wealth from industry is only 13 per cent.  In Munster, it is 26 and in Leinster, 34.</P>
    <P>From these figures, anybody can see the disadvantage Roscommon suffers by comparison with other areas in the matter of openings for industrial employment. In the past 20 years, 20,000 people have left that county, a rate of 1,000 people each year.  And now we bring in machinery overnight; we close down the quarries in the name of modernisation; and we drive out many more of our people.  Is that sound economics?</P>
    <P>I should say here that I have never looked on road work as productive.  I am not suggesting that for all time we should have our men engaged working on the roads, that forever the quarries there should be kept open. What I am suggesting is that we make the change over as easy as possible for those people so that it will not mean immediate disemployment for many of them and consequent immediate hardship for their wives and families. Even if we adopt modern methods, we must ensure that the welfare of the workers and their families is protected. The Minister must produce alternative schemes to absorb the labour there. Until he does so, the county council must be given authority to keep the men at work in the way they have been doing over the years.</P>
    <P>We have the hope there that in the future vegetable growing for the Sugar Company, with allied employment, will benefit many people.  That, however, will be limited to certain areas and will not arise for some time.  Meanwhile, we are losing our people.  That is why I now urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to prevail on the appropriate <Col N="1177" /> Minister to make funds available to the local authority there to have work carried out on roads that have not been touched for years, and which need repair &mdash; cul-de-sac roads and other small roads.  There are many of them throughout the county and if funds were made available for this work, it would solve the employment problem over the winter.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Parliamentary Secretary might convey to his Minister the desirability of restoring the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That, in Roscommon, would be of tremendous help to many people. Apart from its benefits by way of making the land more productive, it would give employment to many people who are now only waiting to leave the country.  I wish some members of the Government would take a trip down to some of the villages in Roscommon, which Deputy Lenihan, the Parliamentary Secretary, and others know about, to see the conditions there, to see how the people there are expected to live during the winter months, to hear the woman with five or six children being told: &ldquo;Your husband's stamp money is gone; you are now on the dole until spring when the council will be able to help out again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What logic is there in building labourers' cottages for people who will be unable to pay the rent because no work is being provided for them?  I was very glad of the opportunity to raise this matter because even though the Minister for Local Government, who should be present, has evaded his responsibility, I know the Parliamentary Secretary is a man with the energy and the drive necessary.  He is also a man who knows and likes rural Ireland.  I hope that in his reply he will give some indication of how work will be made available for the people to whom I refer.</P>

      <P>Surely it must be apparent to even Deputy McQuillan that it is only natural on the approach to Christmas no one would like to see unemployment, particularly affecting people with <Col N="1178" /> large families.  The position as set out by Deputy McQuillan does not give the entire story behind the closing of the quarries in Roscommon and I should like to quote an extract from the auditor's report on the matter. Before I do so, I should like in passing to give a further example to the House of the injustice of the attitude of members of the Opposition Parties right down along the line.</P>
      <P>Here we have another outcry for increased funds from the Government and I would point out that whenever we do look for increased funds, as we have had to do quite often recently, we are immediately bombarded and held up to odium by Opposition speakers throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall now read the extract from the auditor's report for 31st March, 1961, which gives a fair view of the serious state of things in Roscommon:</P>
      <P>During the years audited, the practice was adopted of charging a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; rate for the whole county for each grade of material, in preference to separate rates for each quarry based on production costs in the quarry.  In both years, the rates charged compare unfavourably with those at which outside contractors were prepared to sell these materials to the Council, especially when it is borne in mind that in the prices charged by the Council there is no provision for profit.  As an example, the following were the prices for half-inch chippings on the floor of the quarry: in 1959-60, 23/- per ton; contractor's price, 11/6d; in 1960-61, it was 20/6d per ton compared with the contractor's price of 11/6d per ton.  That had been going on for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from this comparison and from other figures which were available at audit that most of the Council's quarries were operating on a basis which, by modern standards, can only be described as inefficient, <Col N="1179" /> a situation which entailed considerable loss for both the ratepayer and the State.  The Council, by rationalising its production methods, could produce quarry materials in competition with the private contractors and certain steps have already been taken in this direction.  I recommend that they be continued and intensified until competitive prices are achieved and that accurate accounts be kept for each quarry so that uneconomic quarries can be identified and either brought up to a standard or eliminated.</P>
    <P>The auditor went on to criticise the practice in Roscommon of charging a standard price for chips to works, no matter whether they were produced by the council or bought from outside contractors.  Under that system, he pointed out, the savings on the contractors' prices were used to subsidise the council's uneconomic operation. The number of quarries being used in Roscommon has now been reduced to five, of which only two are in whole-time operation.  As a result of this centralisation and improved organisation, the costs of stone produced by the council have been reduced by up to two-thirds.  The council's chief quarry is at Knockagonnell.  It is a private quarry operated by the council on hired machinery and it is at present producing stone at very low prices such as chips at 8/6d. per ton.  The two outside contractors with whom the county council have dealings, supplied in 1962-63 less than 20 per cent of the council's needs for ordinary stone. Now, regarding the effect of the use of gravel, the Deputy will recall that he came on a deputation to the Minister for Local Government at one time objecting to the use of gravel in lieu of stone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the use of gravel instead of stone in County Roscommon has been a spectacular fall in the cost per mile improved which fell from £2,119 per mile in 1959-60 <Col N="1180" /> to £1,010 per mile in 1962-63.  As a result of this, the mileage improved each year increased from 1959-60 with 38 miles to 1962-63 with 102 miles.  A council as keen as Roscommon on county roads should appreciate those figures, which were achieved in spite of rising wages and other costs. Despite the great increase in the rate of progress, there were still over 1,300 miles of unimproved county roads in Roscommon on 31st March, 1963, due largely to the practice, of which Deputy McQuillan is an advocate, of taking over a large mileage of accommodation roads each year.</P>

      <P>The fall in the mileage improved would have been considerably greater, had it not been for the Fianna Fáil Government's increase in the Road Fund grants.  In the period from 1959-60 to 1962-63, the roads expenditure over all in County Roscommon rose by 25 per cent.  I should also remind the Deputy that there has been a marked shift in the pattern of employment on the roads and that the numbers are not indicative of the true position.  The Deputy must admit from the statistics that while there may be fewer working on the roads, they are working for a longer time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
