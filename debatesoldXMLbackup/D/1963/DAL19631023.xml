      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the latest position with regard to this country's application for membership of the European Economic Community; and whether there have been any discussions with the British Government with regard to the possibility of the resumption of negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos.  1 to 3 together.</P>
      <P>There have been no developments during the recess which would indicate any likelihood that negotiations on Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community will be resumed in the near future. Nor have I any reason to think that the British Government anticipate an early resumption of negotiations.</P>
      <P>The position still is that we intend to reopen our application as soon as it is possible for us to do so and that, while we cannot predict when that will be, we are proceeding on the assumption that Ireland will acquire membership before the end of the decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, therefore, concerned to ensure that we shall be kept as closely <Col N="3" /> informed as possible of developments in the Community.  Deputies will be aware that a procedure has been established for periodic contacts between Britain and the European Economic Community within the framework of the Western European Union.  I have previously indicated here our interest in the establishment of a contact procedure with the Community, and I am happy to say that consultations are going on with a view to arranging a meeting in the near future between a delegation led by the Minister for External Affairs and members of the EEC Commission for the purpose of an exchange of views on developments in the Community and in Ireland of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>I should add that there have not been any developments in the European Free Trade Association which suggest that it would be to our advantage, at any rate at this stage, to seek membership of that organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says he is assuming; he said in recent months that his expectation is that we will be members of EEC by 1970.  Is he in a position to state whether or not Britain expects to be in by 1970, or has he had any communications or discussions with them in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not in a position to say what the British Government's expectation is in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach's view must, in the light of his past statements, coincide with the expectation of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reference to EFTA, has his attention been directed to the fact that EFTA have decided to embark on a review of their mutual agricultural trading and, if so, has he any information as to the extent to which these discussions are proposed to go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would give notice of a question in that regard.  I think his definition of what has happened in EFTA is not altogether accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that my <Col N="4" /> information is derived from the statement made in my presence by the Secretary General of EFTA that discussions were to take place between members at an early date; I asked him in the course of a meeting of the Council of Europe Economic Committee whether I had mistaken the tenor of his observations and he emphatically confirmed that such discussions were now proposed for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach bear in mind the obvious cooling-off in enthusiasm in Great Britain for membership of EEC, which may, in fact, result in Britain not persisting in her application for membership of that body?  Would he therefore say whether, in view of this general atmosphere, he proposes to continue his annual excercise of a reduction in our tariffs against imported goods, which, if we are not admitted to the Common Market, will have the effect of giving us all the disadvantages of non-membership and none of the advantages of membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making, I think, a wrong assumption in that regard.  While any action we may take of our own decision in respect of our industrial tariffs will naturally have relation to the international circumstances prevailing, one of the main reasons for engaging in this exercise is to encourage the growth of efficiency in Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach will admit it is also having the effect of making Irish industry compete against the products of countries which have shown noreciprocity towards us from the point of view of repealing their tariffs against our goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am personally convinced that the future of Irish industry depends entirely upon the success of the efforts to make it fully competitive by international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If Great Britain is not admitted to EEC is it the intention of the Taoiseach &ldquo;to go it <Col N="5" /> alone&rdquo; as he said here in the Dáil last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a hypothetical question which I could not be expected to answer at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <P Just="Center">VISIT OF PRIME MINISTER LEMASS, OCTOBER 15-16, 1963.</P>
      <P Just="Center">COMMUNIQUÉ BY THE PRESIDENT AND HIS EXCELLENCY SEÁN LEMASS, PRIME MINISTER OF IRELAND, FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS HELD IN WASHINGTON, D.C. OCTOBER 17, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the official visit of His Excellency Seán Lemass, Prime Minister of Ireland, the Prime Minister and President Kennedy discussed a number of issues of common interest and concern to Ireland and the United States.  The two leaders expressed their satisfaction at the longstanding friendship between Ireland <Col N="6" /> and the United States and reaffirmed their intention to maintain their close co-operation and collaboration in areas of common interest.</P>
    <P>The President again thanked the Prime Minister for the hospitality extended by the Irish Government to the President and his party during the President's visit to Ireland in June of this year.</P>
    <P>The President and the Prime Minister discussed the current state of affairs in Western Europe with particular reference to Ireland's efforts to improve its economic links with the continental European countries.  The Prime Minister expressed his country's hope that the amount of private investment on the part of American industry in Ireland could be expanded.  The President suggested that the steadily improving economic condition of Ireland should attract the interest of a number of American firms.</P>
    <P>The President also noted that on its part, the United States hopes to supply more goods to the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Noting the important role Ireland is playing in the United Nations, the President stated that he appreciated the substantial contribution made by Ireland to the establishment of peace and stability in the Congo.</P>
    <P>The President and the Prime Minister expressed their mutual desire to strengthen the cultural links between the two countries.  The President assured the Prime Minister of the continuing interest on the part of the United States in Ireland's economic progress.</P>

    <P>8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach the estimated sum which would be required by a man with four children earning £10 a week to compensate for the increase in the cost of living since the eighth round wage increase and for the impact on the cost of living of the new turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Between August, 1961, and August, 1963, the Consumer Price Index rose by 5.3 per cent. Between June, 1961, and June, 1963, the index numbers of average hourly and weekly earnings in transportable goods industries rose by 17.7 per cent and 14.9 per cent respectively.</P>
      <P>These figures make it clear that, in recent years, wage increases have exceeded cost of living increases, resulting in an improvement in real earnings.</P>
      <P>As regards the effect of the turnover tax, having regard to the fact that expenditure such as rent, rates, transport charges and insurance premiums are not liable to this tax, and assuming that the prices of purchased commodities will increase by 2½ per cent, it may be calculated that the outlay of a person earning £10 per week with four young children, and expending 80 per cent of his income on commodities affected by the tax, would increase by 4/- per week, or 17s. 4d per month.  He will, however, be fully compensated for this higher outlay by the extra children's allowances, amounting to 19/- per month, payable to him from November 1st.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the commodities to which he has referred, commodities which must be purchased by the breadwinner, have gone up in price since last August and that practically all manufacturers, wholesalers and importers have already increased the price of their goods by more than 2½ per cent?  Is the Taoiseach further aware that prior to the <Col N="8" /> coming into operation of the turnover tax, the social welfare benefits given have already been swallowed up?  Will the Taoiseach now say what extra remuneration by way of increased social welfare benefits he proposes to make available when the turnover tax comes into operation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Did we hear the Taoiseach aright when he said that he assumed the expenditure of the person mentioned in the question would go up by only 4/- a week, on the assumption that the prices of purchased commodities will increase by only 2½ per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to arrive at a precise estimate because of the fact that transactions between health authorities and official contractors under Section 10 of the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1939 under the current contracts are exempt from the tax chargeable under Section 47 of the Finance Act, 1963, and no information is available in my Department as to the extent to which the expenditure of the Cork Health Authority is in respect of such transactions.  On the assumption, however, that all purchases by the health authority were outside the scope of the 1939 Act mentioned, which is unlikely, so that the tax would be applicable without this exception, it is estimated that the increase resulting from the tax in a full year would amount to about £18,000 representing 0.6 per cent of the gross expenditure of the authority, amounting to about £3 millions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the great dissatisfaction felt by persons who obtain optical appliances, either through his Department or through local health services, because of the poor types of frames supplied and the excessive charges made for other than standard frames; and what steps he proposes to take to remedy the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Optical appliances are not supplied through my Department.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that great dissatisfaction is felt by eligible persons supplied with spectacles under the health authority ophthalmic services on the grounds that the type of frame supplied is poor.</P>
      <P>Up to fairly recently, only plain nickel-frame spectacles were supplied by health authorities but for some years past I have urged health authorities to provide a less austere type of frame.  All health authorities, with a single exception, now supply nickel beaufort frames to both adults and children under their ophthalmic services; these frames are made of nickel, with shell covering of the rims and side pieces.  They are of good quality and reasonable attractiveness.  In an effort to introduce greater diversity of type, however, some months ago I caused health authorities to be informed that I would have no objection to the supply of plastic-framed spectacles under their service when such frames can be obtained without undue additional cost.</P>
      <P>There is no provision under the health authority ophthalmic service for the supply of spectacle frames other than the standard types currently in use.  There is some evidence that a limited number of people purchase other type frames privately on their own responsibility from the official contractors, but if they choose to do so, I do not feel that I have any obligation to take special steps to protect their interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people who are getting services through the local authorities find the type of frames being issued absolutely useless, that they are something which those people are not prepared to wear and that as much as £4. 15s. is being charged for frames for spectacles which are in fact supposed to be issued free to the poorer classes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I follow the drift of the Deputy's questions clearly.  First of all, I find it hard to believe that frames, the main purpose of which is to hold spectacle lenses in position, are useless.  Is that not the purpose of the frames&mdash;to hold the lenses in position?  I do not think it is fair to expect the public services to bear the cost of particular types of frames people might want to add to their appearance or heighten their attractiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that the Minister and people like him do need such appliances.  I am talking about the type of frames required to keep spectacle lenses in place.  Is the Minister not well aware that the frames issued under the services are so bad that in fact they have been found to be absolutely useless and that the only alternative is frames which cost up to £4 15s.?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will have that question put down, I shall answer it in detail.  I shall say now that I am not prepared to interfere with any body of citizens who feel they can help individuals in this country who may be afflicted in a particular way. On the contrary, wherever I have spoken with relation to any of these institutions.  I have pointed out that they contribute a very necessary and desirable supplement to the efforts of the Government in this respect.  In relation to any particular activity on the part of such a group of individuals, I should like to have rather more definite proof before I would feel called upon to interfere with the exercise of what appears to be a public-spirited activity.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that there are three cancer hospitals in existence, would the Minister not consider that, as Minister for Health, he should turn this other newly-established body into these hospitals so that, instead of getting new bodies established, he might get the three hospitals grouped together to <Col N="20" /> raise funds?

We have a national cancer consultative council concerned with this matter and there has been a satisfactory development of the cancer services, which have in fact been improved very greatly in the past five years.  It does not occur to me to require that people who desire to engage in activities of this kind to help sufferers from conditions such as this should come to me and ask for my permission.  On the contrary, I like to see our citizens displaying initiative.  The only time I would feel myself called upon to interfere would be when activities of this kind were not merely overlapping but operating to the detriment of the existing services.</P>

      <P>The Council has undertaken as its first task to examine the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>&mdash; other than the agricultural aspects&mdash; and to advise on how the objectives of the programme can best be realised or, if possible, surpassed.  This task is under way.</P>
      <P>Regarding the non-representation of agriculture, it is clear from its title that the Council will confine itself to the non-agricultural sectors of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distinction made between agriculture and the rest of the economy in the establishment of the Council is explained by the fact that agricultural policy is determined to a large extent by external conditions which we cannot alter by decisions taken here. There would also be some practical difficulties in setting up a Council which would be workable in size but fully representative in character to deal with agriculture, industry and the rest of the economy.  The Government are, however, prepared to reconsider the position should experience of <Col N="22" /> the working of the Council or some other reason suggest that to do so would be desirable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  The main task of the National Industrial Economic Council is to prepare general reports expressing the views of the Council on the principles which ought to be applied for the development of the national economy and the realisation and maintenance of full employment at adequate wages with reasonable price stability and reasonable long-term equilibrium in the balance of external payments.  The Council shall have regard to the level <Col N="23" /> and trend of incomes, including wages, salaries, profits, rents and other incomes, with a view to the inclusion in its reports of policy recommendations on these matters.</P>
    <P>2.  General reports will be prepared from time to time as the Council consider appropriate.  The Government may, at any time, request the Council to prepare a general report or a report on a specific subject.  The National Employer/Labour Conference may, at any time, request the Council to prepare a report on a specific subject.</P>
    <P>3.  The Reports of the Council will be submitted to the Government and, together with any comments which the Government may make thereon, will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and published.  Where appropriate, copies of the Reports, and of any comments by the Government, will be referred to the National Employer/Labour Conference for consideration.</P>
    <P>4.  The members of the Council will be:&mdash;</P>
    <P>a Chairman appointed by the Government following consultation with the interests represented on the Council,</P>
    <P>eight other persons appointed by the Government,</P>
    <P>ten persons nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and</P>
    <P>ten persons nominated by the Federated Union of Employers, other employer organisations, Statesponsored bodies and the Federation of Irish Industries, Ltd.</P>
    <P>5.  The Secretariat of the Council will be provided by the Government. At the request of the Council, arrangements will be made, subject to the provisions of the Statistics Acts and other relevant legislation, to provide the Council with statistical and other information in the possession of Government Departments and Offices.</P>
    <P>6.  The Council will regulate its own procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While there may be some variation in the increases in the prices of different commodities as a result of the introduction of the turnover tax, the over-all increase in the general level of prices attributable to the tax should not exceed 2½ per cent. It may be that price levels will fluctuate for a short time while the turnover tax is being brought into operation, but thereafter the force of free competition should keep the general level at about 2½ per cent of the pre-tax level, except in so far as price changes unrelated to the tax may occur, for example coal, tea or other commodities, due to a rise in production costs or market prices abroad.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has certain powers of price control under the Prices Act, 1958 and he indicated in reply to questions in the House on 17th July, 1963 that if circumstances should require any action under that Act he would take it.</P>

What will he do if that becomes a general tendency after 1st November, as there is every indication that it will?  What is the Minister doing about the prices which, obviously, have now been raised in anticipation of the turnover tax?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on Incomes and Output was based on the principle that increases in incomes should be related to increased national production in order to avoid price increases and balance of payments repercussions which would be damaging to the economy.  This principle still stands.  Since the White Paper was issued, I am glad to be able to report that there has been a correction of the tendency towards a widening of the gap between weekly earnings in industry and output per wage earner to which attention was drawn in paragraph 4 of the White Paper.  The increase in productivity, though considerable, has not been sufficient to offset fully the increase in money earnings, with the result that the real value of these earnings has been reduced by higher prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as future policy is concerned, consultations with employer and labour interests have, as Deputies are aware, led to the setting up of the National Industrial Economic Council. The Council includes representatives nominated by the Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and <Col N="31" /> employers, including the State bodies. The Council's terms of reference empower it to report on the principles to be applied in the development of the national economy and to make policy recommendations regarding the level and trend of incomes, including wages, salaries, profits, rents and other incomes.</P>
    <P>It will obviously continue to be a matter of national concern, at a time of increasing competition, that the future relationship between incomes and output should help to promote the expansion of production and exports and thus be consistent with our development aims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arigideen River is part of the Owenkeagh catchment area.  This has been surveyed by the Commissioners of Public Works with a view to a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The results show that the works required are very expensive in relation to the value of the land capable of improvement and it is difficult to evolve a satisfactory scheme.  However, I am arranging that the final examination of this catchment will be taken up soon and I hope to have a decision on the proposal in the next few months.</P>
      <P>There has been a preliminary examination of the Ilen River but it will be necessary to have a detailed engineering survey to decide whether an economic scheme can be evolved. We have in hands at present a very big arterial drainage programme which includes extensive survey work in many parts of the country.</P>

The Parliamentary <Col N="34" /> Secretary should change his outlook but I suppose it is no use asking him at this point because, with the present trend of events, he may shortly not be there at all.</P>

The Minister for External Affairs has already explained our position in the matter in reply to Dáil questions on 28th March, 1962 and 23rd April, 1963.  I believe, for the reasons given on those occasions, that we should continue to concentrate our efforts on securing the conclusion of the international agreement to prevent the further dissemination of nuclear weapons called for in the Irish Resolution <Col N="35" /> No. 1665 (XVI) unanimously adopted by the General Assembly on the 5th December, 1961.</P>

      <P>As regards the first question, the veterinary surgeon concerned was authorised to test this herd on the current round of testing.  I understand that he visited the herd for that purpose on 9th September, 1963, but that the owner requested him to postpone the test for some time.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> As regards the second question, the herd owner was paid the clear herd bonus under the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme in August, 1963. A doubt arose as to the eligibility of this herd owner for bonus and the necessary investigations took some time to complete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position in regard to the rate of grant.

I have for some years been trying to secure agreement on a comprehensive milk recording scheme <Col N="39" /> which would be run by the creameries but so far this has not proved practicable.We have of course a successful scheme of progeny testing operated by AI stations which involves milk recording of the herds under test.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would be true.

The Board and the manufacturers have arranged to have that matter investigated under agreed terms of reference.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether the Government will consider the amendment of Section 42 of the Transport Act, 1950, to give Córas Iompair Éireann discretion to commute compensation pensions in their entirety at the desire of the pensioner instead of the present arangement which restricts them to commuting one quarter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of objections to the Deputy's proposal which would have to be very carefully examined but the matter is being noted for consideration in connection with projected transport legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if his mind has been directed to the fact that the weekly receipt of the sum of 8/- or 10/- is of relatively little value to country people who are rearing a young family, as many of these people are, whereas the capitalisation of such a sum does frequently provide them with a stake?  They are not over 70: they are very much younger.  Some of them are only in their thirties or forties.  Persons who are raising a family can, by the capitalisation of such a sum, get a stake which enables them to engage in some other remunerative occupation which would give them a much more satisfactory return than the microscopic remnant of pension that remains to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>I have seen various press reports of the kind mentioned by Deputy Norton.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question on prices on 17th July, 1963, I explained that the circumstances in which my powers in regard to price control may be exercised are laid down in the Prices Act, 1958.  I stated that I believed that the ordinary course of competition should apply to ensure that no excessive increase will take place in the price of any commodity but that, if circumstances required any action under the Prices Act, I would take it. I reaffirm that I will not hesitate to take action if any undue increases take place.  Deputies will appreciate, of course, that increases in prices in consequence of increases imposed abroad on commodities which we must import are outside the possibility of control by me.</P>

      <P>Here is something which can be ascertained by an inquiry conducted by the inspectors of the Minister's Department.  Distributors and wholesalers have, in the past few weeks, sent out circulars notifying the new prices of commodities, altogether independent of the turnover tax.  By the time November arrives, the increase will be not 2½ per cent but in the vicinity of ten per cent or more. If there be a case for an increase in these prices, surely it is better for the Minister to set up a prices tribunal so that the public will know the case for an increase.  If workers want an increase in wages they have to go to the Labour Court to argue their case.  Why should it not be compulsory that the case for increased prices be made before a similar body?</P>

      <P>However, because of what I consider to be sharp practice on the part of whoever was responsible for this in the main Opposition Party, apparently it is proposed to take the motion of the main Opposition Party, which was tabled 14 months later than mine, with the Estimate for the Department of Local Government today, the result being that any discussion of my motion will be extinguished because my motion would be deemed repetitious.</P>

I am not satisfied with that.  I think I am entitled to insist that my motion be taken separately.  I would ask the Taoiseach to consider, in equity and in the interest of fair dealing with Deputies, dealing with the Estimate for Local Government as one matter and let Private Members' Time proceed, without this arrangement which has been disclosed going through.</P>

May I suggest that, if the Deputy does not want to follow the same course, he can move his motion, he can say all he wants to say on that specific matter during the debate, at the end of which separate divisions can be taken in the House on his motion to which we have set down an amendment?

    <Title>National Loan, 1963. - Statement by Minister for Finance.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that a new National Loan will open for subscription on Monday next, 28th October. The loan will be for £25 million but £5.1 million of the stock is being allotted to certain life assurance offices so that the amount available for public subscription will be £19.9 million which will be underwritten jointly by the banks and the Government.An application for £5 million of the stock is being made on behalf of funds under my control.</P>
      <P>The rate of interest will be 5¾ per cent per annum and the price £100 per cent.  The stock will be redeemed at par not later than 1989 and may be redeemed at any time from November, 1984.</P>
      <P>The usual provision is made in the prospectus whereby only ten per cent of the purchase price need be paid on application, the remainder being paid in three further instalments spread over the period to the middle of December.  Those subscribers who wish to pay the full amount on application next week, or to complete their subscription on 20th November, will be entitled to discount equivalent to an interest rate of 5¾ per cent per annum on the advance payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax privileges attached to recent National Loans are again included. Interest will be paid without deduction of income tax at source, but, of course, holders will, if ordinarily resident in the State, be liable for whatever tax on the interest is appropriate to their respective incomes.  Stock of the issue will be accepted at its nominal value as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of death duties on properties of which it formed a part.  The stock and the interest on it will be exempt from all Irish taxation, present and future, if <Col N="71" /> owned by a person neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>The issue is being made under the authority of the Appropriation Act, 1963, and other statutes.  Both principal and interest will be a charge on the Central Fund.  The attractive interest rate it carries, its status as a trustee security, the concession whereby it will be accepted in payment of death duties and the substantial sinking fund allocations should ensure that the stock will always have a high market value.  The Government stockbroker will be ready continually to buy and sell reasonable amounts of the stock, and this will help to maintain an active market in it.</P>
    <P>The loan is required to assist in the financing of State capital outlay on agriculture and industry; on housing, sanitary services and schools; on afforestation and fuel resources; on transport and on other development schemes in pursuance of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>As you are aware, we are mainly dependent on domestic savings to finance the capital investment necessary for national development.  The Second Programme envisages an increase in capital formation in the period to 1970.  The resources necessary for this increased investment must come in the main from increased current saving.  The national loan provides an excellent opportunity for putting the savings of the community to good use.  Subscribers to the loan, while providing the State with the resources necessary to develop the national economy, will at the same time be making a safe investment on which they will earn an attractive annual return.</P>
    <P>The prospectus of the issue will be published in tomorrow morning's newspapers.  Copies of the prospectus, with an application form for subscriptions attached, will also be available as from tomorrow from any bank, stockbroker or post office.  The lists will close not later than Friday, 1st November.</P>
    <P>I am sure that every Deputy will give the issue his full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of a National Loan is a national matter, not a political matter and, accordingly, <Col N="72" /> on behalf of the Fine Gael Party in this House and on behalf of all the supporters of Fine Gael throughout the country I rise to support the appeal made by the Minister for Finance.  We all understand and appreciate that without adequate growth, there cannot be any rise in the standard of living or any hope of ending the drain of emigration.Equally, though we may differ as to the manner in which it should be done, every Party in this House is united in its anxiety to ensure that economic growth.  We in this Party have always been clear that the best way to deal with that matter is by a scheme of productive capital investment.This is an essay in productive capital investment and therefore we support this National Loan.  We hope that the funds raised by it will be utilised for the further development of agriculture, for the further drainage of our lands, to ensure that industrial development will be expanded and extended, with a consequent increase in employment, and that in addition, the social investment such as housing so urgently required will be expanded and made available.</P>
      <P>It is not only on national, patriotic grounds that this loan recommends itself.  The terms of issue are generous when one considers that it will be at the rate of 5¾ per cent.  As far as I can see looking at the newspapers this morning, the nearest comparable British security is the 5½ per cent stock redeemable in 1982 to 1984 which though it is a quarter per cent less stands at four and a half points.  The interest that is being offered here is therefore some ten shillings higher than is being offered on the other side. There it works out at £5 5s. per cent. Here the Minister is offering £5 15s. per cent.  To that extent therefore it is clear that the offer he is making is a generous one to investors.</P>
      <P>People who invest in this loan will not merely be helping progress in the nation.  They will also be doing themselves quite a good turn in relation to the moneys they are investing.  For that reason, we in Fine Gael support the loan and trust that it will be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to support the terms of the loan which have been <Col N="73" /> commended to the House and to the country by the Minister.  While it might at first sight appear that the issue of a national loan will affect only those with money to invest, that, however, is rather a short-sighted view because a national loan affects all our citizens.  It affects the man who has some money to invest and who is sufficiently patriotic to believe that he should give preference to investment in Irish stock because it will be used for the benefit of the whole nation.  But a national loan affects the man who is unemployed or the man of very slender resources, because unless the national estate is developed and unless public enterprise is pushed to the fullest, there will be very little regular employment for him, so that he must to a very large extent rely on the fullest development of the national estate not merely to be ensured regular employment at reasonable rates of wages but to get those benefits which accrue to himself and his family and other citizens from State investment in such projects as housing, schools, the provision of water supplies, afforestation, electricity, peat development and all those activities which yield on the one hand, a financial dividend or on the other, an equally important social dividend.</P>
      <P>The alternative to the issue of a national loan is either to abandon national development or, worse still perhaps, to borrow from another country sums of money to which strings may be attached.  These sums of money, if they were so borrowed, could be used with disconcerting embarrassment at any time when the borrowing country found itself in internal or financial difficulties.  Therefore, the progressive countries of the world have found that the best way in which to borrow money is from their own people, relying on their financial investment and their creative ability to produce dividends on the money so invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as we are concerned here, we have found in the past that not only are our national loans fully supported but the sum total of Irish investment in national loans is probably one of the highest in the world, taking the <Col N="74" /> national populations in relation to national loans of the various countries.</P>
    <P>This, as has been said, is a very attractive offer.  Five and three-quarter per cent for an investment over 25 years ought to be particularly attractive to insurance companies, whether Irish or British.  It is intended that some of the insurance companies will take up a sum of £5.1 million in this loan.  That is a wise decision on their part.  I hope that the same kind of wisdom will be shown by the public at large in recognising that it will be difficult to find a better investment than a loan bearing 5¾ per cent interest over 25 years.  I hope the loan will be an outstanding success and I feel certain that our own people as in the past can be relied on to make it so.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, I should like to state for the information of the House that during the recess I had meetings with the Leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties at which we discussed the procedures of the Dáil for disposing of financial business and considered the changes which might facilitate its fuller discussion and at the same time, permit all financial business, including the Estimates, to be disposed of before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>It was agreed that:</P>
      <P>(1)  the Vote on Account should be taken in the Dáil soon after its reassembly following on the Christmas Adjournment and in advance of the publication of the Book of Estimates, the topic for discussion on the Vote to be selected by Parties in Opposition.  It is assumed that procedure on the Central Fund Bill will remain unchanged;</P>
      <P>(2)  that wherever feasible, Estimates should be grouped for purposes of debate and that in particular, the following Estimates should be debated together: (a)  Defence and Army Pensions; (b)  Special Employment Schemes and the Public Works group of Estimates; (c)  Lands and Forestry; and (d) all Finance Estimates;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  early in each year the Party <Col N="75" /> Whips will meet to select some Estimates to be circulated and debated in advance of the publication of the Book of Estimates;</P>
    <P>(4)  the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to be requested to devise a Standing Order which will provide that on the conclusion on the debate on an Estimate when a division is challenged, the division will take place at 10.15 p.m. on that day if the Dáil be then sitting, or if the Dáil should have risen before 10.15 p.m. on that day, at 10.15 p.m. on the next day on which the Dáil should be sitting at that time.</P>

      <P>Is it permissible to make just a few observations on the statement which the Taoiseach has just made?  It is no more than this &mdash; it is not unknown to the members of the House or those outside it that we hope and confidently expect that there will be a change of Government in the early future.  That does not alter the fact that whoever is the Government in the Dáil at any given time, the Dáil belongs to us all and we are all mutually concerned to see that its work is done more effectively to give effect to the will of the people.  I think the proposals adumbrated in the Taoiseach's statement will constitute an improvement in our ordering of business.  It is with that intention that Deputy Corish and I discussed the matter with the Taoiseach on behalf of our respective colleagues.  I suggest these are initial steps towards bringing our procedures up to a more efficient method.  They can be only initial stages, and we may find further devices which will make our proceedings more efficient and expeditious as we go along.  This is a good beginning, and I join the Taoiseach in commending it to the favourable consideration of the members of the House and of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other <Col N="79" /> Expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
    <P>The chief increases in the Department's Estimate over that for last year include sums of £35,000 in respect of contributions towards local housing loan charges; £100,000 in the provision for contributions towards loan charges of sanitary authorities and towards the provision of private water supply and sewerage facilities.  The largest increase under any subhead is £250,000 to bring the provision for grants for private housing up to a total of £2,750,000.</P>
    <P>The number of local authority houses completed in 1962/63 was 1,828, an increase of 47 per cent on the output in the previous year.  These include 643 dwellings erected by Dublin Corporation as compared with 392 in 1961/62 and 277 in 1960/61.  At the 31st March last the Corporation had 1,156 houses either in progress or at tender stage.</P>
    <P>Figures for the present year so far indicate that this higher level of building by local authorities is being maintained if not increased.  Completions to the end of August, the latest date for which figures are available, are up from 744 to 767 while dwellings in progress at the end of that month are up from 2,591 the previous year to 2,798.  The figures for dwellings at tender stage at the end of August are also up from 857 the previous year to 1,560.  The value of tenders approved in the six months ended 30/9/63 was £3,073,000 as compared with £3,435,000 for the whole year ended 31/3/63 and £3,019,000 for the previous year.</P>
    <P>The increase noticeable for some time past in the demand for dwellings in Dublin city and many other areas from those eligible for rehousing under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, which is related to the overall change in population trends and to the falling emigration rate, has continued in the current year.  At a recent date, the certified needs, that is, the number of families certified by the medical officer as being in need of rehousing in Dublin city, was approximately 5,000.  The number of further applications <Col N="80" /> on hands was about 4,500.  No recent allocation of tenancies has been made to the applicants on the priority lists because of the decision to allocate all vacancies for the present to those displaced through operations under the dangerous buildings code.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Dublin Corporation over the years of giving priority to the rehousing of families from the older houses and not completely clearing them in the process, left a considerable number of older houses still occupied which had reached or passed the end of their useful life.  The weather extremes of the past 12 months during which a long period of wet and extremely cold weather was followed by a warm spell and a thunderstorm in June last caused a rapid deterioration of many of these houses and the complete collapse of three dwellings causing four deaths. The operations of the Dangerous Buildings Section of the Dublin Corporation had to be stepped up to meet the situation and by the end of September dangerous buildings notices requiring evacuation had been issued in the case of 367 houses.  The number of families involved was 1,189, consisting of 615 families of three or more persons, 248 families of two persons and 326 single person families.</P>
    <P>By suspending the list of ordinary priorities and allocating tenancies only to families displaced from dangerous buildings, by taking over houses as soon as completed by the builders rather than waiting for the completion of whole schemes, and by re-allocating vacancies more rapidly, the Corporation have been able to offer accommodation to 503 of the families of 3 or more persons, 90 families of two persons, and 105 single person families.</P>
    <P>In order to expand as rapidly as possible their current building programme the Corporation's proposal to extend existing contracts at the same rates for additional schemes has been agreed to in order to save the time normally given to the preparation of contract documents, advertising, and so on.  These and other emergency measures will enable the Corporation programme to be stepped up from a completion rate of 643 for last year to <Col N="81" /> an estimated 850 for the current year and 950 for the following year.</P>
    <P>I have discussed with representatives of the Corporation the possibility of further increases in housing output by new or improved methods and consequential discussions between officers of the Department and officials of the Corporation on the short-term and long-term programmes have been taking place.  One of the points discussed was the housing of one and two persons families, for which the Corporation's programme had never been geared to producing accommodation in the numbers now required.  In order to meet the needs of this class in the interim period, while suitable small-type dwellings are being designed and built, the Corporation decided to provide 100 temporary dwellings to a caravan design on sites not required for the permanent building programme.</P>
    <P>The use of industrialised building methods and techniques in other countries as a means of meeting their housing needs has been watched with interest.Little progress has, however, been made in the provision of housing by such methods in this country, although Dublin Corporation, by designing a standard flat block and standardising components for their house building, can claim to have made their dwelling production more efficient as a result.  Apart from this, however, the Corporation have not taken any initiative in recent years in investigating whether any system other than traditional building would be more suitable for their needs, or would help to achieve an expanded output.</P>
    <P>In view of the extent of unfit houses in rural areas disclosed by the housing survey and the difficulty experienced by local authorities in getting contractors and, in addition, the urgent need for expansion of output in the Dublin city area to meet the needs so much accentuated by the recent evacuations it was considered desirable to have an intensive investigation of the new methods and to invite building concerns interested to submit any proposals they might have for the erection of houses by other than traditional methods.  This invitation has been <Col N="82" /> publicly advertised in the daily press and in the technical journals here, in England, and in several continental countries.  Many replies have been, and are continuing to be, received and discussions have taken place with interested parties anxious to ascertain the position preparatory to putting forward proposals.  Any such proposals would be examined with a view to seeing whether the methods projected could be usefully fitted into a planned programme of housing output.</P>
    <P>As regards private housing, the amount provided for the financial year 1963-64, £2.75 million, shows an increase of £250,000 over the expenditure in the previous year.  This is necessitated by reason of the high level of the demand for all types of grants which continued during the year 1962-63.Grant allocations in that year reached the highest figure ever recorded at 23,442, representing an increase of over 7 per cent on the figure for the previous year, which, of itself, was a record allocation.  New house grant allocations, at 5,706, increased by 18 per cent on the previous year, while allocations for the provision of water and sewerage facilities at 4,068 increased by over 24 per cent.  This high level of activity has been maintained in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The existing allocation rate for the provision of water supply and sewerage (4,000 cases) is likely to expand considerably as a result of the taking over by my Department of the scheme formerly operated by the Department of Agriculture for the provision of water supplies in farm houses.  In addition, activity on group schemes is increasing.</P>
    <P>The survey which housing authorities commenced in 1960, to ascertain the extent of unfit housing which now remains, has not been completed in detail in all areas.  Analysis of the available returns, however, including pilot surveys and estimates, shows that the volume of housing which local authorities regard as being in need of replacement is of the order of 25,000 dwellings, of which 20,000 are in rural areas.  About 50 per cent of all unfit dwellings are occupied by householders of one or two persons.  The <Col N="83" /> most difficult housing problem is, therefore, the replacement of unfit houses in rural areas.  To meet this need, a continuation and expansion of social building in these areas is necessary to supplement the increased rate of building of private houses.</P>
    <P>The problem will demand a variety of measures for its solution, but it is likely that any intensified attack on it will involve a continued expansion of the number of private grant cases in the next few years.  Housing authorities can assist in the matter of unfit housing conditions in rural areas by using the powers provided under Section 5 of the 1962 Act to assist the carrying out of essential repairs or to carry out such repairs themselves where the object is to make the dwelling reasonably habitable for a limited period.</P>
    <P>I was glad to be able to announce during the year increases in the subsidisable limits of capital costs of dwellings provided by housing authorities.The new limits are 10 per cent higher in each case than the figures which previously obtained and they have been given retrospective effect so as to apply to dwellings commenced on or after the 1st April, 1961, or in respect of which loans were sanctioned on or after that date.  This increase in State subsidy should encourage housing authorities to speed up their housing programmes so as to eliminate finally the remaining pockets of unfit and overcrowded dwellings.  I am pleased to note a quickening of the tempo of house-building by local authorities in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Housing (Loans and Grants) Act, 1962, which became law on the 10th August, 1962, and which amended and consolidated the grant and loan provisions of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous) Provisions Acts, 1932 to 1960, was a first step towards the simplification and modernisation of the general housing code.  A further measure is envisaged in which many aspects of the law relating to local authority housing will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The 1962 Act enabled supplementary housing grants to be made on a <Col N="84" /> more generous basis and to wider categories of applicants than previously. A high proportion of rural housing authorities have amended their supplementary grant schemes to take advantage of the new provisions, but I regret to note that very few urban authorities have done so.  Indeed, a number of urban authorities do not make supplementary grants at all.  These grants can help to bring about a desirable balance between private and public building in any area and urban authorities who do not yet operate grant schemes would generally find, on reconsideration, that to do so would be substantially to their own benefit.</P>
    <P>There is a further facility which I would like to see housing authorities providing on a more enterprising basis than heretofore for persons building their own houses.  The authorities should ensure that persons who are prepared to provide houses for themselves will be able to get a suitable site on reasonable terms in the locality where they wish to build.  Too many people are inhibited from undertaking the task of providing their own dwellings by the difficulties which they experience at the outset in obtaining suitable sites.  I appeal again to all housing authorities to take a more active approach to this problem of providing developed sites for private houses and to foster a demand for such sites.  Action to make private sites available would be in the local authority's own interest, since many of the people who would take the sites would otherwise have to seek to have their housing needs met by direct local authority building.</P>
    <P>I have stressed to local authorities on a number of occasions the importance which I attach to the encouragement of tenants of local authority houses to become owners of their own houses.  I am glad to note in this connection that the work of vesting of cottages under the Labourers Act, 1936, is very far advanced in most counties.  It is regrettable, therefore, that in a number of other areas progress with cottage vesting is entirely unsatisfactory.  I would ask local authorities who, for one reason or another, have allowed a backlog of applications for vesting to accumulate to <Col N="85" /> deal with the arrears as early as possible.Many urban housing authorities have made schemes under which tenants may purchase their dwellings but the degree of response from urban tenants shows marked variations from one area to another, notwithstanding that all the schemes formulated are drawn on lines which one would expect would prove attractive to the tenants.</P>
    <P>The sum of £575,000 provided in Subhead G for sanitary services includes £500,000 for contributions towards loan charges of local authorities, an increase of £25,000 on last year's provision.  At the 31st March last, work was in progress on a total of 196 schemes at an estimated cost of £5m as compared with 103 schemes costing £3m at the same date in 1962. Another £2m worth of schemes was ready to start, while the value of pending work at the tender and contract document stages totalled over £12m. The total value of schemes at contract document and later stages therefore amounted to over £19m as compared with £13m in March, 1962, and £10m in March, 1961.  The prospects are that the programme will continue at a satisfactory level for the future.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a few county councils who have not yet come to grips with their local problems.  Apart from exhorting these councils to get into step with their neighbours, I must particularly ask them to make up their minds quickly in regard to the extent of the works they propose to undertake.This would enable persons and organisations to go ahead with grant-aided schemes in areas not included in county council programmes.  Where satisfactory county programmes are in progress, I should like to remind the county councils concerned of the need for vigilance in order to ensure that a regular flow of work will be let to civil engineering contractors at a rate with which their organisations can cope.</P>
    <P>A critical eye must also be kept on price levels to ensure that the increased volume of work does not result in price increases.  Every effort should be made to encourage healthy competition in tendering and to attract <Col N="86" /> any new organisations that are willing and qualified to enter the field of public works contracting and who have the necessary qualifications for undertaking the work.  The rapid development of the sanitary services programme has thrown up many complex engineering and related problems affecting the planning, design and execution of large schemes.  I have decided to establish a consultative council of engineering experts to advise on these problems as they arise.</P>
    <P>The existing grant allocation rate for the provision of private water supply and sewerage, which has now reached 4,000 cases a year, is capable of considerable expansion.  In previous years some Deputies referred to the possibility of duplication and overlapping between the private grant schemes for domestic water supplies operated by my Department and by the Department of Agriculture.  These schemes have now been replaced by a unified scheme administered by my Department which was brought into operation from 1st July last.</P>
    <P>The new scheme provides for aggregate State and local authority supplementary grants of two-thirds of the cost of piped water and sewerage installations, up to a maximum of £100 in the case of water and £50 in the case of sewerage facilities.  Where, after 1st April, 1963, a number of applicants group together and instal a water supply or sewerage system by co-operative effort, the State grant will be increased to a maximum of £60 a house and a similar amount may be paid by the local authority.  In the case of sewerage facilities provided on a group basis, the grants from the State and the local authority will be £30 each.  The higher grants will, I hope, prove an incentive to rural organisations and groups to work together and thereby avail themselves of the benefits of joint services.</P>
    <P>The scheme contains a new provision for recouping local authorities their full outlay on supplementary water supply grants paid to the rated occupiers of agricultural holdings, who would have been eligible for grants under the scheme hitherto operated by the Department of Agriculture.  Grants <Col N="87" /> will be payable in future for all approved works costing more than £10. There will be no restriction such as the 100 ft distance requirement which obtained formerly in regard to connections to a public supply.  A sum of £75,000 is provided in Subhead G to meet expenditure on these grants and on the contributions to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962, has greatly improved the facilities for fruitful co-operation between sanitary authorities and private persons and organisations promoting private installations and group water supply schemes.  I hope that councils will avail themselves in full of the new powers.  For my part, I propose to have the scheme operated as simply as possible with the minimum of paper work.</P>
    <P>The programme for publicising piped water supplies in rural areas was continued during the year.  A start was also made with the co-operation of Telefís Éireann in publicising fire hazards and water safety precautions.</P>
    <P>The preliminary review of existing fire legislation has been completed and good progress has been made by the Fire Standards Committee who are finalising their draft of revised standards.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of adequate swimming facilities, 19 local authorities have approved the provision of swimming pools and in three cases the proposals are at the contract document or later stages.  I have approved outline plans of a pool at Crumlin submitted by Dublin Corporation.Local authorities are quite properly concerned at the high capital cost of swimming pools.  While the covered, heated swimming pool gives the best value in the long run, only the larger centres of population can afford to provide them.  I have circulated some technical information on the design and cost planning of swimming pools.  Further research is clearly necessary to get a satisfactory covered or partly covered pool which can be erected at a cost that the smaller urban authorities would consider within their reach.  This matter is being pursued in <Col N="88" /> conjunction with developments elsewhere.Meanwhile I would recommend the smaller urban authorities to provide at least the minimum required for the teaching of swimming and for bathing and recreation for children.</P>
    <P>So much has been said in recent times both in this House and elsewhere about town planning that it is not necessary for me to review our policy and proposals on this Estimate. Regulations are being drafted to enable the new legislation to be operated.The number of appeals being received is increasing year by year; 457 appeals were lodged in 1962-63 as compared with 392 for the preceding year.  The number disposed of was 354 of which 86 were withdrawn by agreement or found invalid.  The number formally determined was 268 of which 88 were allowed and 50 were allowed subject to conditions.  The decision of the planning authority was confirmed in 130 cases.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead K, grants are provided for the acquisition, clearance and improvement of derelict sites. These grants are payable to private persons, local authorities, local development associations and similar bodies.  The maximum grant is £100 and works costing less than £30 are not eligible.  The greatest response to this scheme continues to be from private individuals.  A number of local authorities are operating the provisions of the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, by requiring the owners of the derelict sites to give undertakings for clearance or development.  If local authorities generally tackle the problem in this way, it would result in an increase in private effort to remove eyesores which continue to spoil the appearance of their towns and countryside.</P>
    <P>Grants are also payable under Subhead K to local authorities and local development associations for works of public amenity.  The grant amounts to 50 per cent of the cost of approved works of £100 or over.  Eligible works include the provision and development of parks, open spaces, playing fields, riverside walks, works at beaches, means of access, the opening up of views and prospects, landscaping of historic buildings, ornamental tree <Col N="89" /> planting, seating, shelters, car parks in scenic areas, public caravan parks, provision of museums and the protection of places and objects of interest.  The initial encouraging response to this scheme has been maintained. Ninety schemes were submitted by local authorities in the past year and 47 by local development associations and similar bodies.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of road traffic I have established a new road traffic section to bring into force and implement the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  A total of 103 sections and parts of two others have already been brought into force. Those which deal with the more serious driving offences and those which provide for regulations and bye-laws to deal with traffic control were brought in immediately in October, 1961.  The compulsory insurance provisions came into force in May, 1962. On the 1st April, 1963, the provisions on speed limits were brought into operation.  As from 27th October, provisions will come into force which enable regulations to be made on the construction, equipment and use of vehicles and the control of public service vehicles.  The relevant regulations have been made to take effect from the same date.</P>
    <P>As regards speed limits, the propriety of fixing particular limits or any limit at particular places gave rise to a number of questions in this House and elsewhere.  I need only repeat now that at every stage there was full consultation with the local authorities, that the local technical committees will review the limits each year and that in the meantime I would ask Deputies and the public generally to show forbearance and not to press for immediate changes in regulations which have been so recently made.  I wish to thank for their co-operation the Press, the radio and television authority and the local authorities and the technical committees.</P>
    <P>The regulations on traffic signs were replaced last year by a comprehensive instrument providing for standard signs based on international recommendations.In spite of the fact that my Department has given advice to <Col N="90" /> road authorities about the siting, height and maintenance of these signs, we often see them badly placed or obscured by roadside trees or hedge-rows.They are also sometimes wantonly damaged.  I would therefore appeal for local co-operation and the exercise of civic spirit by residents and road users alike to ensure that these signs fulfil the purpose for which they were intended.  My Department has at present in hands a further study on the question of road signs, and particularly roadway markings, with a view to effecting desired improvements.In particular, it is in mind having the more important main roads in the country marked with central lines for their full length.</P>
    <P>Bye-laws made during the year by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána include byelaws to deal with the parking problem in Dublin, their primary purpose being to assist the movement of traffic, particularly during peak hours, and to enable people having business to do in the central city area to get short-term parking facilities for the purpose.  Associated with these bye-laws were the regulations I made for the system familiarly, but erroneously, known as &ldquo;fines on the spot&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some steps have been taken to provide additional off-street parking facilities, the cost of which when undertaken by a local authority can be charged to their Road Fund grants. The construction of 13 car parks on this basis has been approved.  In Dublin, a scheme for a car park under the new Corporation flats in Dominick Street has been approved in principle and three other surface parking schemes have also been approved. Arrangements have been made in Dublin for the provision of 18 new zebra crossings and 5 sets of pedestrian lights as well as the erection of 10 new sets of traffic lights.</P>
    <P>As regards the regulations which I recently made, they are designed to ensure that the vehicles which use our roads will be properly lit and otherwise properly equipped and constructed.They take account of the latest European recommendations on the subject.  It is intended that these regulations will be kept constantly <Col N="91" /> under review in the light of developments here and abroad.  I may mention that, under the regulations, the dipping of headlamps is compulsory in specified circumstances, and the use of the horn is forbidden in built-up areas after 11.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>Two important features of the 1961 Act which have yet to be brought into force are the schemes for driver testing and for vehicle testing.  Both involve an immense amount of detailed advance planning in order to establish the organisation and to provide the means for effective administration of the statutory powers.  The preparatory work for driver testing is well advanced and arrangements are being made for the recruitment of the necessary testing staff and the provision of facilities for the work.  I propose to announce details of the contents of comprehensive regulations in relation to the licensing of drivers in the near future.</P>
    <P>The scheme for vehicle testing must of necessity be related to the standards for construction and equipment of vehicles in connection with which regulations have, as I have already said, been made recently.  There could be no degree of finality in relation to the vehicle testing scheme until the standards had been prescribed but, now that this has been done, the formulation of a scheme can be pressed forward.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking I am pleased to be able to say that the programme of implementation which we envisaged when the Act was passed is making good progress.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on &ldquo;Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol or a Drug&rdquo; was published on 4th October.  I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation to the Chairman and the other members of the Commission for the thorough manner in which they tackled the job. As the House is aware, the Government have accepted the general import of the Commission's recommendations, but will consider further certain aspects of it.  I have invited anybody interested to furnish his views on the subject before the 30th November, when the preparation of a Bill will be put in hands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> Now as to the roads themselves, the numbers of motor vehicles, particularly private cars, continue to increase. This evidence of growing national affluence creates, however, consequential problems and underlines the need for an expanded programme of road improvements, particularly on the arteries that bear the most of the increased volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>As set out in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, a study is being made of the roads programme to determine whether the national network of roads is being adequately developed to cater for the seven per cent annual growth of road traffic which is estimated to continue throughout the second programme.  A comprehensive national traffic census is being undertaken by my Department and, when its results have been processed and analysed, it will be possible to establish the priorities to be observed in the roads programme.  As part of the objective of getting far more information than is at present available on traffic flows on a national basis, a census of traffic on the main roads in rural areas was taken on Thursday and Friday, the 22nd and 23rd August last and a considerable amount of useful information will be available shortly as to the density and type of traffic on the rural main roads.  This information will be integrated and merged with the nationwide traffic census which will be undertaken in the near future and which will provide the basis for a comprehensive re-classification of the roads system.</P>
    <P>Excellent progress has been made in the last 15 years in bringing our county road system up to a reasonable standard.In the period 1953-54 to 1961-62 a sum of £24.7 million was expended on county road improvements, compared with £15.8 million on main road improvements.  There is now an extensive mileage of high-class county roads serving the farming community but the other side of the picture shows a serious backlog of improvement schemes needed on the main roads, particularly on those which may be described as arterial or national routes. Not only has the standard of these roads to be brought up to date, but it <Col N="93" /> is desirable that the road improvement works planned and executed now should be adequate to cope with further large increases anticipated in the volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>These considerations have led me to decide on a cessation of the grants for county road improvements schemes in the counties where the programmes for these schemes have been completed and a modification of the grants in areas where substantial progress to completion has been made.  The modifications in the distribution of Road Fund resources have been conservatively planned so that there is as much available in the grant for county roads this year in relation to the present unimproved mileage of 18,000 as there was in 1956 for the unimproved mileage which then stood at 30,000, or in 1959 for a mileage of 26,500.  In regard to the grants allocated for county road improvement schemes, attention has been drawn to the possibility of achieving improvement at greatly reduced costs by the introduction or extension of the use of modern low-cost methods, particularly the bladegrading system and the use of gravel instead of stone.  No reduction in the grant for county roads is being made in counties which had less than 50 per cent of county roads dust free on the 31st March, 1962.  In the case of counties above the 50 per cent level, the amounts of the grants have been reduced on a basis proportionate to the dust free mileage in each case.</P>
    <P>As regards main roads structurally unfit to take the present volume of traffic and also main roads which deteriorated in the bad weather of last winter, and finally in regard to the arterial routes, the recasting of grants is intended to enable essential improvement works to be undertaken on these important categories of roads.  The main features of the current year's scheme of Road Fund grants in the counties may be gathered from the total allocation under the three principal heads, namely, £2,403,000 for county road improvements; £1,499,900 for main road improvements and £1,000,000 for arterial roads.</P>
    <P>The urban road grant and the grants to county boroughs, tourist road grants <Col N="94" /> and grants for bridges, have all been retained at the same level as last year, as is also the main road upkeep grant fixed last year at the increased level of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>In most of the areas where the county road improvement grant was reduced, this was done without reducing the overall allocation of Road Fund grants to the counties in question because, by and large, the counties which had made most progress with their county road improvements are those containing stretches of arterial roads which qualify for a share in the new £1 million arterial road grant.  It will, however, be necessary to undertake a comprehensive review of the entire system of Road Fund grant allocations in the light of the information which will be available from the traffic census.</P>
    <P>The total revenue expenditure of local authorities, excluding vocational education committees, committees of agriculture and harbour authorities was £66.22 million in the past financial year and the corresponding figure for the current year is estimated at £69.03 million.  In 1962/63 the receipts from rates amounted to £22.773 million and State grants to £30.647 million.  In the current year estimated receipts from rates, £23.74 million, will meet 34.39 per cent of estimated expenditure, while State grants of £31.876 million will meet 46.18 per cent of that expenditure.The tendency to meet an increasing percentage of local expenditure by State grants, which has been evident for a number of years past, was greatly accentuated last year by the more generous scheme of allowances introduced by the Rates on Agricultural Land Relief Act, 1962. The further rate reliefs under the Act added about £2½ million to the total which would have been payable in 1962-63 under the preceding scheme of grants.  The grant for 1962-63 was £8.53 million and it is estimated that it will total £8.93 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure of local authorities last year was £12.4 million, an increase of £1.7 million on that of the previous year.  The bulk of the capital was obtained from the Local Loans <Col N="95" /> Fund.  The total indebtedness of local authorities at 31st March last, excluding amounts held in sinking funds, is estimated at £159.4 million.</P>
    <P>The total indebtedness of local authorities has been rising steadily in recent years.  This has been due to a number of factors, notably the big extension in the volume and cost, including cost of wages, of work being carried out by local authorities in housing, sanitary services, roads and so on and their more liberal attitude towards financial aid for private housing work, but still more so by the change in the form of state subventions to subsidy of loan charges rather than by way of capital grants, and improved wage rates and conditions for workers.</P>
    <P>The outstanding debt does not, of course, constitute a dead-weight liability on local authorities.  In fact, less than one-third of the outstanding debt will fall to be repaid out of local rates; the balance will be met by state subsidies and income from rents of local authority dwellings, repayment of loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, and other sources.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement, coming almost seven months after the commencement of the year to which it refers, highlights three main features of the Department's work, and I notice that the Minister devoted a large part of his statement to housing.  In lesser order, he dealt with roads and the traffic problem; then with amenity works and finally with the question of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the importance which the Minister has given to housing is a factor very much in the minds of the people in the country at the present time.  It is not alone a question emphasised by the fact that motions on the subject have been placed on the Order Paper in regard to centres such as Dublin, because anybody reading the newspaper reports as late as yesterday will have noticed that the national <Col N="96" /> Press have been giving attention to the substantial nature of the difficulties in regard to housing apparent in centres other than Dublin.</P>
    <P>In reference to my own constituency, I was able to gather from the evening papers yesterday that in Limerick quite a number of families are finding difficulty in being rehoused or being moved from dangerous buildings.  A deputation of them met the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  From the same report, I noted that people in Dublin are still troubled by housing difficulties and that the rumblings which continue in these old buildings still strike panic into the hearts of many citizens.</P>
    <P>It is therefore right and proper that the Minister should give such a large amount of his time to the question of housing.  I want to say at the beginning that this is a matter which is of as much concern to the Minister&mdash;he expressed his concern on it today&mdash;as to every member of the House, but I had hoped the general picture in regard to housing would have been resolved at this stage and that the housing survey instituted in 1960 would have brought some tangible figures for the country at large on which a firm programme of house building could be embarked.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, difficulties in this respect.  Perhaps in places such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and the other larger centres, the same difficulty does not arise in estimating more speedily the needs of the people in regard to housing, but in the rural areas it does pose a large problem and I should have been interested to hear the Minister advert to that fact and to the solution of the problem facing the various local authorities in trying to get an accurate assessment of the programme they have to tackle.</P>
    <P>Taking my own constituency as a fair example of the problem that exists at the moment, the local authority there are depending on the services of the health inspectors.  The activities of those men, who operate under the local health authority, are limited by the amount of time they have to give to the other duties for which they are responsible.  I notice that the county manager in Limerick, in submitting a <Col N="97" /> report to the county council recently, referred to the fact that this survey is not complete and that the situation is still quite hazy in regard to the needs of the area.  I assert, as I did last year, that it is a fair estimate that one per cent of the number of dwellings existing in any county at a certain time need to be replaced.  I have inquired today from the authorities and I find that the position is no different today from what it was last year, that somewhere in the region of 300 to 340 houses require to be provided by Limerick County Council to meet the needs of the people in the area.  That estimate is based on the pilot survey conducted in 1961.</P>
    <P>Before we can plan nationally in regard to housing generally, we must have a proper survey of the needs.  Of course, that does not in any way detract from the immediate necessity to deal with the problems of people who need housing, who are living in unfit or crowded houses or houses which are insanitary or which are dangerous.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the question of emergency measures.  I respectfully suggest that the whole problem of housing is of an emergency type not alone in Dublin, Cork and Limerick but in many other parts of the country.  Wherever there are people living in bad housing conditions we ought to deal with the problem.  Anything that impedes progress in the matter of housing should be rigorously examined.  If remedies are available it is the duty of those concerned to suggest what the remedies might be so that bad housing conditions can be dealt with at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the figures in regard to housing are improving.I am glad that is so.  It is well known that there is a backlog that must be made up.  Are we satisfied that all the steps that can reasonably be taken to deal with the housing situation are being taken?  The Minister mentioned last year that he was laying the blame at the feet of the local authorities for delay in the preparation and production of documents which must be submitted to his Department. Does the Minister feel that his strictures on the local authorities have <Col N="98" /> had any effect?  Has there been any improvement in the matter?  Last year I and many other Deputies suggested that the Department was not entirely without blame in the matter of having the backlog of work cleared so that housing authorities could proceed with their building programmes.  I have noticed from Press reports and have heard from Deputies of my own Party that in some parts of the country difficulty is experienced in having housing plans implemented.  Surely, by a combinatiton of effort at local authority and departmental levels it ought to be possible so to arrange affairs as to create order out of the chaos that exists in regard to housing? It has come to my notice in the past few days that county councils have criticised the slowness on the part of the Department of Local Government in letting local authorities have the results of compulsory purchase orders.</P>
    <P>I am sure that during the course of the debate Deputies of various Parties will have occasion to refer specifically to the housing situation as it exists in their constituencies.  Without having a complete picture of housing needs it is difficult to suggest what the programme should be but it would appear that the problem is a very large one. I have heard it suggested that in Kerry, for instance, over 9,000 rural houses are required to replace houses that need to be replaced.  I have mentioned the replacement figure of 300 to 340 houses in County Limerick.  I believe that to be a real estimate of the needs. The council have been able in the year 1962-63 to complete only 19 rural houses and 16 urban houses. There are 14 to 16 rural houses in course of building at present in the rural areas and about 32 in urban areas and there are tenders invited for a further 14 houses.  That is measured progress and I suggest that the progress is much too slow and that we are imposing on the people who have to live in unsuitable homes conditions that we should take every step to eradicate.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to inquire why it is that the housing drive is not proceeding as well as it should; what is tending to slow it down.  I have tried to analyse the situation by reviewing the <Col N="99" /> position in County Limerick.  I find that when the local authority advertise contracts, they do not find it easy to get contractors.  One is forced to the conclusion that the contractors are engaged in more remunerative work or that their tenders for local authority contracts are not approved.  I take it that contractors tender at the normal, reasonable levels and, therefore, that they are being rejected by the local officials dealing with them because they have to work within a set framework or, if the tenders do come to the Department, that they are sent back for review.</P>
    <P>One matter which has affected the situation in rural areas is the fact that last year the Minister embarked on a scheme of serviced houses generally in rural areas.  That immediately created an extra problem in the provision of rural houses.  First and foremost, there was the question of sites.  At that stage some sites had been secured and some were in the course of acquisition by the local authority.  Where sites had been secured, approval was sought from the Department, and this is one of the little matters which might be ironed out very easily.  I understand that in the case of a site for a rural house which has now to be serviced, the local authority may not take that site without first seeking approval from the Department as to its suitability.  If that is so&mdash;and I have no reason to think it is not, from the information I have&mdash;then I would suggest that where the qualified officials who are operating locally for housing authorities have inspected these sites and pronounced judgment on them, that ought to be sufficient.  Either the site is suitable or it is not, and if it is not suitable, I do not see that a visit by an inspector from the Department will change things one way or the other.  This is one snag that the Minister might look at to see if it is one of the things which might slow down, maybe not extensively but by a matter of weeks, the acquiring of sites.</P>
    <P>In regard to rural houses, the dream of piped water throughout the country is an admirable one but we must be realistic.  No amount of dreaming will <Col N="100" /> place piped water in a number of these areas.  Consequently, I presume in regard to many of these houses, one of two things will happen.  Either people will depend on a rainwater supply&mdash;which will mean the construction of some sort of reservoir or storage tank and pumping water into another tank in the attic, that is, if the houses are to be serviced with modern facilities&mdash;or there will be attached to houses being built a room which will be used for this purpose when piped water does come their way.  I do not have to press the Minister very hard to use his imagination as to what will happen to the room in the meantime.  It will probably become some kind of storehouse connected with the house itself.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the problem of contractors who are faced with this type of situation in rural housing. They have never faced this problem before.  It is something new to them. Quite a large number of rural contractors are used to building to a certain pattern and I am sure when they find that having tendered on a certain basis, everything is not what they thought it would be, they will not be as ready to enter this type of contract in future.</P>
    <P>That raises also the question whether all types of house building are costed at the one level.  Is housing of the social type costed in the same way as what one might call the luxury-type housing?  If we want to have houses built within the capacity of the local authority, aided as they are by State finance of various kinds, we must have regard to the fact that the Department, acting as the watchdog of finance, will exercise control and consequently there will be quite an amount of examination of tenders and so on when they reach the Custom House.</P>
    <P>I know it will be immediately said to me if I suggest the adoption of utility building, that this is something we ought not to do.  Certainly I should be very loath to suggest the introduction of a type of building that one might describe as monotonous or drab, if it were to appear throughout the country.  However, one has to weigh this type of consideration against the <Col N="101" /> absolute necessity of catering for people living in a single room or in two rooms, in houses that are unfit for habitation, or in houses with their relations.  It is not beyond the capacity of planners to produce a house which is adaptable and capable of variation without varying in the essentials.  I am sure the Minister has seen in his travels abroad something of this problem and how other authorities are dealing with it.  I am sure houses could be built with, say, variations in regard to roofing without actually increasing the cost.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to consider the possibility of building houses on the same lines as those already accepted by the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to schools.  The fact that such could be assembled quickly would give us a solution where it is urgently needed.  During the past year an urgent problem has arisen in Dublin and caravan-type accommodation was made available.  That was an admirable innovation and I am sure the people who secured that type of housing welcomed it.  It enabled families to live together which is the all-important thing in so far as christian families in a christian country are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is also the question as to how accurate is the survey of actual housing needs, having regard to the fact that a number of people are already living with their in-laws or that young couples having married may have secured a house only on a temporary basis.  I have seen applicants for houses being disregarded by a local authority because they were living in what were regarded as fit houses.  Of course, that is literally true so far as their conditions are concerned when the actual investigation is made by the health inspector.  He finds them in the house of an individual who has let them in but has only let them in for a short time.  There is no real justification for saying that these people are not in need of houses.  They certainly are in need of houses.  No amount of persuasion, or the production of letters written to them to get out, will convince the authority that they are really any worse off.  While there are people in the type of house which is described <Col N="102" /> as unfit, uninhabitable or insanitary, then, of course, they will have to come first.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister might have referred to his statement regarding the expanded building programme and the use of the National Building Agency to provide houses here and there. He felt that there could be much more done by this body in regard to housing in rural areas.  That certainly is very admirable but is there any reason why the local authorities are not being encouraged to do the work which the National Building Agency would undertake?  They have the skilled personnel although at present these are fully engaged.  I notice that the Limerick county manager referred to this in his housing survey.  He has not enough staff to do this work.  I suggest to the Minister that the addition of any extra engineer, who could deal with the work, would be sufficient. There are facilities within any administrative area for the examination of sites.  There are the councillors who are able to advise on suitable sites and I cannot see any reason why local authority services could not be expanded to take care of this type of building.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the types of houses under two headings.  He referred to the use of grants to repair, in a temporary fashion, old houses and he referred to the question, in rural housing, of the vesting of cottages.  Some counties have been able to avail of the facilities for repairing old houses because they have the personnel to deal with the problem. The fact that these facilities exist is not as widely known as it might be and perhaps the matter could be publicised to a greater extent to make it known that the local authorities can assist in this type of operation.  In some towns in County Limerick there are older houses which are still controlled by the landlord and which very often need extensive repairs but which the landlord is not prepared to carry out because of the rent he is receiving. Perhaps the tenants could be facilitated in having the repairs carried out themselves.While they are not the owners of the houses they are occupying them and sometimes their families have been <Col N="103" /> occupying them for so long that they have become virtually the owners.  I do not know if there is a legal problem there.  I understand that to get the grant the tenant would have to get the written permission of the landlord. Perhaps the Minister would advert to this.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country there is this question of cottage repairs.  I am sure it is something which will loom large in this debate.  The Minister expressed concern that the vesting of these houses is not as rapid as he would wish.  I have here the report submitted to the Limerick County Council by the county manager in regard to this matter.  I am sure it is not new to the Minister.  He expresses a point of view in regard to the urgency of vesting cottages and asks: &ldquo;Does our obligation end with vesting?&rdquo; He points out that at that stage what happens sometimes is that the vested cottage is sold for a sum which is beyond the reach of those who need houses within the area where the cottage is and that the house, which is provided by the local authority and central funds, passes on to somebody who can pay the higher sum rather than to somebody more urgently in need of the house.</P>
    <P>Another factor to which he referred was something which I mentioned here last year.  Has a survey taken place in the country at large in regard to houses which are available and are unoccupied at present?  The manager carried out a survey in Limerick and found that 135 vested cottages have been closed for four or five years.  He asks the council whether it is desirable that this should happen.  He points out that there is a demand for the erection of expensive houses to deal with this problem, where there are houses which have been erected with the aid of public and local authority funds and which were built for a type of people which originally they were meant to serve but which are not available to them any longer.  The question of repairs in this respect is something which is imposing a very large burden on the local authorities.  They must provide the funds to keep these houses in repair.  A question which came to <Col N="104" /> my mind and which I put to the Minister is: Is there any logical reason, or is there any reason in principle, why a Department should not pay to the local authority the ordinary grants they would pay to the private individual for the repair or modernisation of such cottages?</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that at present if an individual applies for a grant for the repair of his house, the engineers insist at that stage on certain work which requires to be carried out and a sum is allocated to the individual concerned which will enable him to have the house made habitable.  I should like to hear the case for the argument that a grant ought not to be payable in the same circumstances to the local authorities for the type of repair they carry out on these properties.The Minister may say that these are their own houses.  Certainly they are their own houses in so far as they have been erected by them and are in public ownership, but they are occupied by people and so long as those people and their families after them inhabit these houses, they are virtually the owners of them.  Perhaps this might encourage the councils to deal earlier with repairs which would remove the need for major repairs at a later stage.  That policy would lengthen the useful life of the house. It would be an inducement to local authorities to engage in that type of programme.</P>
    <P>It is quite some time since the Fine Gael Party announced publicly they would enable farmers to build houses and that the cost would be placed on the annuity.  I am glad to note that the Minister is thinking along the same lines.  Many of the houses in rural Ireland date back to the days of the landlords.  Certainly, some of them, of the bothán type, are well over 100 years in existence.  The replacement of such holdings is an immense problem and it is completely beyond the financial capacity of the inhabitants of such houses to deal with it.  It is time this problem were recognised and dealt with at national level so that the same type of facility would be given to small farmers as has been available for the housing of other classes.  All that is asked is that the necessary <Col N="105" /> capital will be available for the erection of these houses and that it will be put on the annuities over 35 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>The time has come for a review of the subsidy level in relation to housing. It is no longer a question of housing merely at local level.  Housing is not just a question of local administration. Local administration is availed of for convenience to deal with housing problems but housing is a national problem and a national asset.  Our progress in housing is reflected, not just in terms of the asset it represents to the district in which it is located or to the rates but as an asset to the country in general.  Good housing begets respect for the country.  It has its value even so far as the tourist industry is concerned.The Minister might with great benefit to the housing drive review the impetus of local authorities, as the agents of the Department at local level, in this connection.</P>
    <P>Mention has already been made of contracts for housing.  The Minister pointed out that it is becoming more difficult to get contractors for this type of work.  I should like to hear why this is so.  Is it a question of the level at which the engineering staff, locally and Departmentally, consider a house ought to be built?  Is that reasonable against the contracts the Department are receiving or does the Minister consider it is in excess of the normal building costs?  If the contractor system is failing, with what do we propose to replace it?  Do we propose to make any large-scale attempt to engage in direct labour building?  Is this the answer?  Surely the housing problem cannot be allowed to hang because contractors are unwilling&mdash;I take it because they think the margin allowed them is not sufficient&mdash;to do the work? If that be the case, it would not do any harm to say so and let these people prove that such is not the case.  Otherwise, it is incumbent on the Minister to take another course.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that investigations should be carried out by the Department of Lands in order to ascertain what areas of land and what type of land have been purchased in this country by aliens in the last five years, with a view to introducing any controls which may be found necessary on the purchase of agricultural land in Ireland by aliens.</P>
      <P>This subject has been discussed in and out of the House over the past few years and Government spokesmen have put the point of view that it is not really a serious problem, that the story about aliens buying up large tracts of land here is something conjured up in the imagination of people who want to embarrass the Government.They say that in fact aliens are buying only a small amount of land, that the land they are buying is in most cases almost useless, and that in general aliens are to be welcomed rather than abused.</P>
      <P>In August, 1961, certain restrictions were imposed and since then, a check has been made on the amount of land being bought and, so far as it is ascertainable, the price being paid for such land.  Since 1961, it has been found that non-nationals have bought 176 different lots of land involving 14,434 acres at an &ldquo;aggregate consideration&rdquo; of £876,687.  I do not know whether the Minister and his Government consider that is something which can be passed over as a mere minor detail, whether the purchase of 14,500 acres within two years is something which should not cause undue worry.</P>

      <P>It is now October.  I assume the Department of Lands are at least a couple of months behind in their records.  If they are up to date, it is the most extraordinary thing I have come across since I heard of the Department of Lands.  As the Minister <Col N="107" /> is aware, some of their records are up to 20 years in arrears, and it would be more than remarkable if we found that they were now right up to date.  I suggest that the Minister compromise and we agree on two years, from 1st of August, 1961, to 1st of August, 1963.</P>
      <P>I know I will be told that this is the bad land, the land nobody else wanted, the land which could not be given away.  I live in Meath.  There is not so much bad land there.  As the Minister is aware, because I have brought it to his notice often enough, aliens have been purchasing land in Meath in a big way.  I am not alone referring to the Germans, although they are by far the biggest purchasers of land there, but we have also Belgians, Dutch and Englishmen.  They are all aliens, non-nationals.</P>
      <P>If they buy land, put it to good use, employ people on it and generally use it as land should be used, there would be very little objection by the people who live in that area.  But when they find these gentlemen purchasing large estates and sitting back, maybe running cattle on them, maybe carrying on a very poor type of farming &mdash;in some cases where 20 to 25 men were employed, employing three or four and, if possible, three or four people of their own nationality&mdash;if they get away with that, we will object to it and make no apology for doing so.</P>
      <P>The question of whether this represents the whole problem is something that could be debated all night.  I am sure the Minister is aware that since August, 1961, the problem has not been as great as it was previously. I am sure he is aware that before records were kept these people could dodge stamp duty by buying up for a couple of hundred pounds companies which had been out of existence for years, and they were coming here in large numbers.  Even now we are not told the price.  We are told &ldquo;the aggregate consideration amounted to £876,687&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister will tell me that the people doing this are breaking the law and that, if I know of it, it is my duty to try to bring them to justice. <Col N="108" /> I am sure the Minister is aware of the racket they are working, where they buy land and give as much for the crop on the land as for the land itself, because there is no stamp duty on the crop.  I am sure he is aware that a lot of money is paid for stock which do not exist.</P>

      <P>That is so.  Would the Minister tell me of one case where this sort of thing happened which has been investigated?  If a farm of land is sold for a fantastically small sum, surely everybody must know there is something wrong?  If somebody sells a farm and gets very much less than he paid for it, very much less than its value, surely somebody should find out why that should be so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be fair to ask the Minister to give me now the number of prosecutions that have resulted from such investigations, but I should be grateful if he could perhaps do so in his reply.  If not, I could put down a question to him later. From what I have been told, I do not believe any such prosecutions have taken place, although it seems to be generally accepted that this little racket is going on.  The question of the price does not enter into it at all.  They pay a certain sum and both sets of solicitors are told the figure is X amount, when in fact it is a far higher figure.  So long as they can get away with that, they will continue this business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember a reference many years ago to &ldquo;peaceful penetration&rdquo;.  I believe the peaceful penetration of the country has commenced again from another direction.  There is one thing which the Minister and his Department must understand, that is, <Col N="109" /> that there are cases where they come here and purchase land but let it back to the owner for a nominal rent so that the owner is able to use the land and therefore recover a lot of money in a few years' time.  Even if they do that, the amount of money they get only covers the outgoings.  Land is continually rising in value and these people come back in a few years' time. The result is that without stirring a finger, they are able to increase their investment enormously.</P>
    <P>The Germans appear to be the biggest offenders in this case but they are not the only people.  We have quite a number of Belgians and Dutchmen, and let me say that the Dutchmen seem to be the only people coming in who actually know how to use land. Perhaps that is not so remarkable when we consider what they are doing in their own country.  We also have English people in many cases.  I do not know whether or not they should be allowed to continue on the line they have adopted, that is, to take over a farm and then apply to the Aliens Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce for permission to use some of their fellow-countrymen on that farm, always on the plea that the type of work they are going to do is specialised.  I would suggest to the Minister, and I am sure he will agree, that the Irishman working on the farm here knows more about farming in Ireland in particular than anybody brought in from Germany, Belgium or anywhere else.  It is an impertinence to suggest that somebody from the Continent is required to show the Irish people how land should be used.</P>
    <P>Recently I had occasion to protest against the appearance of a second workman on a farm which had been bought by a German in my constituency.I was amazed to find that the reason given was that a certain type of farming was being started and the landowner would be away a good lot and would require somebody honest to look after it.  The assumption there is clear for anybody to see that he could not trust an Irishman.</P>
    <P>We have been treating these people a little too leniently.  I believe the Department are entitled to check on <Col N="110" /> the type of land being bought, the amount of land they are already owning, that the correct prices are quoted and the correct amount of stamp duty paid, which is very important, and also that they do not purchase land which could and should be used by local people.  The Minister can tell me about the right of free sale and that it would be unfair to prevent people selling their farms at some fancy price. Some are getting very fancy prices, whether they are disclosing the correct amount or not.  I am very definite about one point, that is, that where there are a number of small holders or people who have no land at all but have been reared and worked on land all their lives, the solution to the problem is that the Land Commission should acquire the land and use it for the purpose of making farms for those people, not allowing the continental type of farmer to come in and use it.</P>
    <P>With reference to the stamp duty, it has been brought to my notice&mdash;I do not know whether it is correct or not&mdash; that in at least one case a German bought a farm and did not pay the stamp duty.  The Minister is well aware of how this can be done because they do not have to pay it for 30 days and can even let it run longer if it has to go into court.  Once a man owns the land, nobody can take it from him, though he can have a certain fine imposed on him for not paying the duty.  This particular gentleman, I am told, attempted to get out of his difficulty by asking the Land Commission to take from him the only bad land that was on the estate at a price that was sufficient to pay the stamp duty.  The Minister in reply to a question by me last summer told me that there were delicate negotiations going on and he did not want me to rock the boat, or words to that effect. He asked me not to press the matter. I am told that a solution has been found since, that this German has since sold the farm to a Belgian.  By the time the international complications are straightened out, goodness knows who will own the land.  I do not suppose that there is very much chance of the original stamp duty being recovered from the man who bought it in the first case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> The amount of land involved in this since 1st August, 1961, is 14,500 acres.  I would suggest to the Minister that very much more land was bought before that time, and bought at a very much greater rate.  The fact that the Government put in the restriction of checking on the amount of land and who was buying it did have a certain effect, but it is true that the land is still being bought and as recently as this month, at least three big estates in County Meath have changed hands, in each case passing into the hands of a non-national.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give the impression that we are all bitterly opposed to investment in land by outsiders.  As I said earlier, if the land is put to a good use, then there is no such great objection, particularly if the same or a greater amount of employment is given.  We have all been bitter in the past about the Irishman who has held anything up to 1,000 acres of land and only employed a man and a dog on it.  If we find non-nationals doing the same thing, we are entitled to be far more bitter against them.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of one particular genius who came here, bought a small amount of land, getting permission to buy it because it was alleged that he was going to start a factory.  He did not start a factory but a small farm became available a small distance down the road and he purchased it.  Possibly he was going to start another factory.  He has already in 18 months&mdash;the Minister can check this from the records&mdash;purchased seven such farms.  You may say that the amount of land involved is less than 100 acres, so what harm; but the harm is that on the land he is replacing the small holder and by being prepared to pay a higher price than the local people could afford, he is preventing the local people who could use the land as well from getting possession of it.  This is an aspect which one cannot overlook.</P>
    <P>While the problem of the type of land being bought may be peculiar to the midlands and the eastern part of the country, I have not yet seen any of these people purchasing farms of <Col N="112" /> bad land.  In all cases which I have come across, they have made sure that the land they bought was the best they could get.  Whether the money is hot or cold, or where the money comes from, does not really matter, but they come in here, buy it and take possession of it, and the more land that is taken over by non-nationals, the less there will be available for nationals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and join my voice in support of this Labour Party motion relating to the sale of land to non-nationals.  Permitting the finest Irish land to pass into the hands of such people is a retrograde step.  These people place no value on money in the sense that, no matter how high the price may be, it does not stop them purchasing.  I often wonder if it is for love of Ireland that these German, Belgian and English people come in here to buy up our land.  My own belief is that these purchases are made by people who, in expectation of atomic warfare, are trying to get their money out of their own countries and to invest it in something they think may still be there when the war is over.  Any sort of good farm that comes on the market is bought up by these people.  Price is no object.</P>
      <P>Now, there are some among us who seem to be in favour of this evolution; they say these non-nationals give good employment.  I do not agree.  I am deeply concerned for the small holder and the cottier.  I maintain that when a five hundred or six hundred acre estate is broken up and divided among small holders and cottiers, there is a far bigger dividend to the country than there is when these same estates are bought up by non-nationals.  The latter are taking the bread out of the mouths of our own people.  Small holders and labourers have no prospects except the boat to England.</P>
      <P>I believe the Land Commission are to some extent to blame for this situation.They are too slow in stepping in and acquiring land when it is on offer.  Even when they do acquire it, the policy seems to be to set the land in conacre year in and year out.  It is my belief that this is done in an effort to recoup the purchase price.</P>

      <P>These non-nationals have bought some of the finest land in North Tipperary, Limerick, Kerry and elsewhere.  They have bought land which normally provided access for our own people and tourists to beauty spots and beaches.  Once such lands are purchased by non-nationals, all access is denied.  I believe it is the duty of the Land Commission to ensure in all cases that such access is provided. Some Government, be it this Government or a new Government, will have to put a stop to the sale of Irish land to non-nationals.  There was a statement in yesterday's paper issued by Macra na Feirme and the National Farmers' Association that there is not enough land to go round for small holders.  The same paper gave the very big figures of purchases of Irish land by non-nationals.  What we won back over the years by the gun is now being bought back with dollars and English pound notes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider the terms of this motion very moderate and very reasonable in existing circumstances. The House will recall that over a long period the Fine Gael Party, in particular, the Leader of the Party, Deputy Dillon, have spotlighted the cheque book invasion from the Continent.Indeed, it was only as a consequence of constantly bringing the spotlight of publicity to bear on the problem that the Government at long last agreed that some little problem existed.  They then provided us with a register.  The information given in reply to a question tabled by Deputy Tully, since the compilation of that register, is pretty dramatic.  When one recalls the demands made on all of us by legitimate claimants for Land Commission holdings throughout the country, one appreciates what could be done with the area of land purchased by non-nationals within a two-year period: 14,434 acres is a formidable amount of land.  Mark you, this is selected land; it is land selected by <Col N="114" /> people who know what they are buying.</P>
      <P>The effect has been even more serious than just denying this land to our own people.  It has meant that a grievous situation has been further aggravated.  We all know the value of money is falling.  Whenever money falls in value, there is a rush on the part of non-agricultural people to save whatever money they have by investing it in land, with consequential inflation of land values, values which bear no relation to what the land is worth to those who normally live on it and obtain a living from it.  There was inflation before ever these people, when the north coast of Europe was closed to them, started coming in here; but, so soon as they started arriving, there was a further inflation in land values. The result is that the second and third sons of farmers are now deprived of the opportunity of investing their accumulated earnings from the day they left the national school in holdings of their own, and that, after their having worked seven days a week with no limitation on hours and no holidays.These have now no opportunity of acquiring a holding on which to rear families of their own.  These cannot buy in the open market because they are invariably outbidden by the German, the Dutchman or the Belgian.</P>
      <P>This situation has, as we know, created acrimony between some of our people and the nationals of other countries, nationals with whom good relations existed formally.  I hope the situation will not worsen.  The late German Ambassador did wonderful work in bringing to the notice of his countrymen the problems with which we have to contend here.  He appealed to those in residence here to realise the difficulties of their neighbours and to refrain from any act which might result in a worsening of the good relations that had existed between German nationals and our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to what is happening in the midlands and on the east coast but the situation in West Cork and along the southern coastline has been pretty grievous for some time past.  Were it not for the local objections and the protestations by local <Col N="115" /> organisations, many of these people would have gone further in their efforts to deprive the local inhabitants of rights and privileges which have been theirs and their ancestors' for centuries.</P>
    <P>We cannot provide for the number of applicants who are looking for suitable holdings.  In these circumstances, we feel that when the problem was first spotlighted, the Government should have taken action.  If they had done so and had curtailed the purchase of holdings by aliens, the problem would not have got out of hand in the way it has now.  The terms of this motion are quite reasonable and I hope the Minister will accept them as being very moderate.  If the Government took positive action now, even at this late stage, they might provide that the farmers' sons who have worked so long and so hard will be given an opportunity of acquiring holdings in their own country so that they can settle down and raise their families here.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Minister is no doubt aware of the number of uneconomic holdings we already have and of the clamour there is that the position should be improved.  He is no doubt aware of the number of people seeking exchanges of holdings and additional land.  Is it not regrettable that this pool of land was permitted to pass out of the hands of our own people and into the hands of aliens who were denied the facility of purchasing land in other countries where they attempted to obtain it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in support of this motion. It is becoming obvious to everyone that there is a quiet invasion taking place, not alone in the purchase of our land but also in the purchase of houses in Dublin and elsewhere throughout the country.  The prospects of our entry into the Common Market may be encouraging these people to invest their money in this country. When we examine the countries from which these people are coming, mainly from the Netherlands and Germany, we must examine the prices which they are paying for land and the value of <Col N="116" /> money at home here.  They are paying anything from £400 to £600 an acre in their own countries.  They are coming over here and buying our fertile land at prices under that figure.  If some action is not taken, those people, who would be good judges of fertile land, will be only too glad to pay the lower price for Irish land, in view of the much higher prices they have to pay for land on the Continent.</P>
      <P>Those people are buying fertile land at what are to them bargain prices and I feel that the Government should take some positive action to ensure that this difference in land values between the Continent and this country will not encourage people to swoop in here and take over whatever land comes on the public market.  It is a fact that they are purchasing land which is never put on the market. They make their own contacts by getting in touch with solicitors and auctioneers and selecting the prices and the localities that suit them.  Quite an amount of land is being purchased on the quiet and is not even coming under the auctioneer's hammer or being advertised for sale.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the difficulty regarding the right of any person to dispose of his property at the best price available.  You will find an Irish farmer saying that he can get a certain price from one of these Europeans and if he is not permitted by the Government or by the Land Commission to accept that price, he will feel that he is being unjustly treated. He is not being any more unjustly treated than the Irish farmers in the past who were compelled to sell to the Land Commission at low prices. It is true that farmers in this country got only £5 an acre from the Land Commission when they were not allowed to sell their land freely.  When we compare those unfortunate farmers with those who are now being tempted to sell their land at European prices, we can see the problem that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, the German Ambassador did ask the German people who had money to spare and who were interested in purchasing property in this country to refrain from doing so. He intimated that he was anxious that a measure of goodwill should exist <Col N="117" /> between this country and Germany and that that goodwill should not be destroyed by those speculators moving in here.  The problem was recognised by the German Ambassador at that time and should be recognised by the Government now.  It is difficult to see farmers' sons in this country, who are interested in going into farming and who have a certain amount of capital, being unable to complete for land that comes under the auctioneer's hammer. They have no chance of purchasing land when one of these Europeans is interested in it.</P>
    <P>We have a limited amount of land in this country but it is very fertile. It is our national asset.  We boast of the fact that this is an agricultural country and that agriculture is our mainstay.  However, that land is beginning to slip from the possession of our farmers into the hands of these people who are interested only in investing their capital and not interested in the expansion of our agricultural economy.  There is a limit to the value of this country in pounds, shillings and pence, and if we try to count it up and disregard the European prices at the present time, it would not be much more than £50,000 million. We can take that figure and say it is not very far from the figure of the annual budget in America.  If all the land, all the factories and other property were sold, we would not get much more than that.  I mention it because it shows that this country can be bought, lock, stock and barrel, for pounds, shillings and pence, and if the money from outside is comparatively more plentiful than the money in here, the purchase of our valuable assets can be still easier.</P>
    <P>I agree something must be done by the Government and the Land Commission to tackle this problem.  At the same time, when such action is being taken, I am very anxious that the rights of the landowners, the farmers, will be respected and that we shall never again have the system of confiscation which was practised to a great extent in the past by the Land Commission when taking over farms. I have in mind a case where a man wanted to give a farm to his nephew. <Col N="118" /> The very moment he went to transfer that land to the nephew, the Land Commission took it from him and divided it out.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Land Commission are adopting that kind of attitude now or that they will do so again, because nowadays they do not seem to interfere when these Europeans move in to purchase our good land at inflated prices.  At the present time an Irish farmer who wishes to buy land has no chance of securing it if any of these Europeans are interested.  That is an undesirable position and whatever steps can be taken to secure it, the purchase of our land by aliens must be discouraged or prevented altogether.  An effort must be made to ensure that our land is available for our own farmers.</P>
    <P>The same situation is arising in the city of Dublin.  It is amazing how many non-nationals are purchasing land in the city.  We may find a situation in the not too distant future where we may even have to take steps to prevent this developing further.  I feel it all arises from the possibility that the Common Market will expand, that if we do find ourselves in the Common Market the people in those countries will have a right to come in here and purchase our land, our houses, factories and other property since the values in this country may be much less than those outside.  I am very glad to support this motion and hope something practical will be done by the Government and the Land Commission to curb or possibly end the present undesirable development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to make a few comments on this motion, I am at a disadvantage because I was not in the House when the proposer was speaking.  If I have any fault to find with it, it is that it is too mild, that it does not go far enough.  It is a well-known fact that antagonism to this type of purchase in this country has been increasing for some considerable time and that very little effective action has been taken to lessen or prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to deal with this motion without giving a wrong impression. Quite a number of aliens have come in here perfectly legally&mdash;there was <Col N="119" /> nothing in the laws of the country to stop them&mdash;and have paid good prices for land, as they were also perfectly entitled to do under the laws of the country.  Some of them have done quite an admirable job of farming, have given a good deal of employment. On the other hand, quite a number have purchased these lands as an investment for surplus profits from industry in Germany and elsewhere and are not concerned at all about the income or production from these lands.</P>
    <P>In many cases they are not resident here and give only the minimum amount of employment.  Everybody would agree that is a very undesirable development.  This possibly is the only country in Europe that would allow this type of purchase to continue. Some European countries have legislation to prevent it.  In a country such as this, where the people are mainly dependent on agriculture and where there are so many people extremely anxious to get farms, even small farms, we should legislate immediately to prevent it altogether.  I think this motion is asking the very minimum when it says there should be a complete investigation of the amount of this going on with a view to introducing any controls that may become necessary.</P>
    <P>This type of development has been received with a degree of toleration that it probably would not have met in any other European country.  That is mainly because of our anxiety to get foreigners in here to establish industries and consequently provide employment for our people.  For that purpose, we would welcome them but in the case of agricultural land I think the amount available is much too small for the number of people in the country who badly need land, who are well-educated to make the best use of it but are prevented from getting it purely and simply because they have not got the money.</P>
    <P>I know of a number of big estates throughout the country bought by aliens at as low as £80 an acre.  It is very annoying to learn that the Land Commission did not move in to buy these first-class lands for the settlement <Col N="120" /> of some of our farmers' sons who have been brought up and educated to get the best out of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is so, but I did go into this question at very considerable length when replying to the debate on the Estimate for my Department.</P>
      <P>The wording of the motion is:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that investigations should be carried out by the Department of Lands in order to ascertain what areas of land and what type of land have been purchased in this country by aliens in the last five years, with a view to introducing any controls which may be found necessary on the purchase of agricultural land in Ireland by aliens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting back to the case that has been made by the mover of this motion, Deputy Tully, and to the motion itself, let me pose this question to the House: What investigation has any Deputy in mind?  I shall come down to the points made <i>seriatim</i> by Deputy Tully in moving the motion in a few moments but let me point out to the House and let me remind the House that for the very first time in the history of this land, under the Finance Act, 1961, there is a statutory register, under the law of the land, whereby the Land Commission have an exact record of every square foot of land purchased in this country by any alien, let him be heathen, Turk, Jew, let him come from Araby or the United States. That was the first time that such legal record was established under our law. I will deal with the question of fraud in a moment.  Therefore, coming back to the terms of the motion, we now <Col N="121" /> know with mathematical accuracy for the first time in this country the exact amount of land being purchased here by any non-national.  Under the law, as Deputies are aware, the Revenue Commissioners notify the Land Commission.Under the law set up, the Land Commission must keep this register of all lands purchased irrespective of the purpose for which it is purchased.</P>
    <P>What we are mainly concerned with in this motion is the purchase of agricultural land because that is, in the main, what the mover of the motion was dealing with.  I might point out to the House, therefore, that we have, as I say, for the first time, an exact record of what is involved in these transactions and it is a question for Dáil Éireann, having the figures that I propose to give, the picture that I propose to give, as to whether any action is called for outside the existing law, with the penalties prescribed, by way of the penal 25 per cent stamp duty, for people who come to purchase land here.</P>
    <P>It is also a matter of comment for thinking Deputies as to how far&mdash;I do not say this is confined to people in this House&mdash;this nostalgic question of Irish land is being exploited and scares are being created inside and outside this House for different purposes, the last purpose being the consideration of what might be done with this land should it be taken over by the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>We all know what a sensitive subject land in this country is and has been.  We all know how much political hay has been made from time to time about land questions in this country and we all know how easy it is to build up a scare that there is a new invasion of Ireland, as somebody is trying to suggest here, by people with million dollar cheque books.  But, while I cannot speak, and nobody in this House or in this country can speak, with very great accuracy, I believe I can say with a certain amount of accuracy&mdash;with the accuracy with which we can speak now as to what the pattern was prior to 1961 in so far as checks could be made in former years, including the checks that were <Col N="122" /> made when these issues were raised when a Coalition Government Minister was responsible for lands in this House&mdash;that the pattern has not changed drastically.  Generally speaking, the checks made then suggested that the average amount of these transactions with non-nationals was approxiamtely 5,000 acres a year for a certain period.  On that particular check&mdash;I will refer to it in more detail in a moment&mdash;amounts of land under 100 acres were disregarded.  So, adding some percentage on to that, you could say that possibly the amount involved was running for a period, from 1950, I think&mdash;for a certain period&mdash;I will give you the exact period in a moment &mdash;between 5,500 and 6,500 acres of land annually.  The same picture is true today and many of these transactions moved, as I will show, amongst the same people.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the House that it is imperative that we be realistic in our approach to this question.  I should like to urge Deputies not to exaggerate this problem out of its true perspective.I am sure it will be conceded, even by the sponsors of the motion, that in examining the question of property purchases in this country by outsiders we must have some regard to the principles of reciprocity which normally operate internationally in matters of this kind and, indeed, which this House has already recognised because, under Section 3 (1) of the Aliens Act, 1935, real and personal property in this country may be acquired by an alien in the same way as such property may be acquired by a citizen of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to bring to the attention of the House some provisions of our law that this Parliament in its wisdom saw fit to pass. That is not to say, of course, that further steps might not be taken should a position arise here in respect of which it is felt that further steps are called for in addition to the steps that have already been taken, which are substantial penalties on outsiders acquiring land here.</P>
      <P>However, in the context that positive steps have been taken by the Government in recent times to discourage the purchase by non-nationals of land required for the relief of congestion, it might be as well to point out, also, that in the case of property to which the Land Acts apply the sale of land to a new owner in no way impairs the powers of the Land Commission to acquire such land for the relief of congestion should such course prove desirable and the new Land Bill which has been circulated to Deputies will, if passed by the House, give certain new powers to enable the Land Commission to deal far more expeditiously with cases that Deputy Tully referred to and cases that other Deputies may have in mind.</P>
      <P>But, with a view to expanding land acquisition generally, substantially increased funds have been made available by way of both cash and land bonds to bring into the congestion machine a considerably larger amount of land than was formerly the case, even by purchasing lands that come on the market by way of public auction. The present position, therefore, is that, with certain exceptions, all rural properties purchased or leased by non-nationals are liable to this 25 per cent stamp duty.  The exceptions not subject to that duty are lands purchased for the purpose of industries other than agriculture or transactions specially exempted from the 25 per cent stamp duty under a recommendation of two Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the motion itself, I should like to inform the House once more that prior to August, 1961, the extent of land purchased in this country by non-nationals was investigated <Col N="124" /> upon two different occasions.  An investigation carried out in 1950 indicated that during the previous decade, a total of 50,000 acres had been purchased by 200 persons who were believed to be non-nationals; in fact, a number of them turned out to be of Irish origin and, also, many of the properties were of a residential type unsuitable for land division.</P>
    <P>Let me say, in passing, to the mover of this motion that I never claimed that all the land purchased by foreigners in this country was bad land. What I pointed out when dealing with this matter in my Estimate speech was that there were in a number of these cases what I described as white elephants, that is, places that would be unsuitable from the Land Commission point of view for relief of congestion or places with very large residences and possibly some indifferent land. With all respect to the good land of Meath which had been purchased, I also pointed out an instance, that no doubt is included in some of these figures, of 5,500 acres of snipe grass in the west of Ireland that was valued at 2d an acre, having been purchased by aliens during the past year.  I gave that figure to illustrate to the House the fallacy of taking a total figure of lands over a period purchased by aliens or non-nationals and suggesting that by splitting that into 50 acres, so many holdings could be provided for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>I merely pointed out that there is good and bad in this whole picture and I never claimed, as seems to be suggested by some, that all the land purchased by these people is bad land. Of course, some of it is quite good land and in the county from which the Deputy comes and in the midlands generally, some of it is land that possibly the Land Commission have no power to touch at all, such as stud farms which are excluded from the provisions of the Land Acts, with which exclusion I think the House as a whole would be very slow to quarrel, in view of the implications in respect of employment in the bloodstock industry and so on, that would be involved in that question.</P>
    <P>In July, 1959, a second investigation <Col N="125" /> was carried out by the Garda Síochána, with the co-operation of the Department of Justice, at the instance of my Department, into the extent of sizeable acquisitions of agricultural properties by non-nationals, and that investigation covered the period from April, 1957, to July, 1959.  In summary, the returns showed that in that period of 2¼ years, a total of 23 sizeable properties, of approximately 7,030 acres, had been purchased by non-nationals.The vendors of three of these properties of 891 acres were themselves non-nationals.  In that same period, 12 sizeable properties owned by non-nationals containing some 2,327 acres were sold back to Irish nationals.  The net sales to non-nationals covered by the inquiry therefore comprised 11 sizeable properties containing 4,700 acres in the period from April, 1957, to July, 1959, averaging roughly 2,100 acres a year compared with an average of 5,000 acres a year from 1940 to 1950.</P>
    <P>Let me say straight away that this was just a rough and ready check carried out by Land Commission officials, with the assistance of the Garda Síochána.  I cannot say there is mathematical accuracy here.  We asked them to look for any substantial holdings they knew of in their local areas that were sold to non-nationals, so these figures, which were compiled prior to the statutory register being established, can be given to the House only for what they are worth.  I think they are reasonably accurate for the purpose of our discussion here.</P>
    <P>From 1st August, 1961, up to this week, the total area recorded in the register kept by the Land Commission as having been purchased or leased to non-nationals and on which the 25 per cent rate of stamp duty has been paid, was 14,434 acres, comprising 176 transactions.Having regard to the investigation of 1959, which covers the two-and-a-quarter year period from April, 1957, to July, 1959, and to the existence of a register containing details of all transactions since 1st August, 1961, I am satisfied that we now have sufficient information to enable us to appraise the situation fully and that the steps already taken to discourage transactions involving the purchase of agricultural <Col N="126" /> land by non-nationals are taking good effect as is apparent from the recent figures.</P>
    <P>The present register, as I have said, was created under the Finance Act of 1961 and under it, every square foot of land that is being sold for this purpose is recorded.  Let me say also to Deputy Tully that any question of slowness on the part of the Land Commission cannot affect this issue.  It is the Revenue Commissioners who compile these figures from the purchase deeds being lodged with them for stamping and they automatically send to us these particulars to be entered in this statutory register.  Let me say also to Deputy Tully and to the House that in order to ensure the accuracy of this register in so far as we can reasonably check, my officials do make spot checks throughout the country so that when the figures come from the Revenue Commissioners, we have an idea if something is going wrong or if there is some evasion as has been alleged by some Deputies.</P>
    <P>Let me say that although this is strictly a matter for the Guards, because it is a criminal offence, we would be very glad to get particulars or to get information from any Deputy who thinks the law is being evaded in any constituency.  Under the 1961 Act, very severe penalties, not alone monetary penalties but very severe terms of imprisonment are prescribed for anybody who tries to get around this 25 per cent law, let him be dealing with company shares or anything else in order to avoid it.  As Deputies well know, it is a fraud if, say, the price of land is £10,000 and there is only £5,000 put in the deed and an allegation that there is £5,000 paid for non-existent stock.  That is plain, common or garden fraud and is punishable as such, just as fraud is punishable in any other walk of life.  If such instances occur, the law is there to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I can also say that the Revenue Commissioners, if they consider the area or valuation of the lands comprised in the deed of conveyance or transfer lodged before them is unrealistic, have a duty, and the power, <Col N="127" /> to send a requisition to the solicitor acting for the parties concerned to get more information.  Indeed, they have the specific power to refuse the benefit or to refuse to let these people out of the stamp duty, even though, on the face of the transaction, they go into the High Court and get a declaration that the transaction is genuine.  In any case in which the Revenue Commissioners are doubtful, they are entitled to do that.</P>
    <P>I want to point out these powers to the House because it appears that many Deputies do not appear to have familiarised themselves with the provivisions of the law which is already there to deal with this question.  Any of the devices outside of plain fraud that were referred to here, simply telling a lie to which you must swear under this law, will not get around the provisions of this 25 per cent stamp duty law as it stands.  It will not be evaded by having a solicitor buy land in trust and leaving it there for some foreign owner.  That does not avoid the law.  Indeed, the man, including the auctioneer, who would try that would get into serious trouble.</P>
    <P>I deprecate wild allegations here&mdash; which will get publicity elsewhere and which will be believed by people who are not familiar with this line of country&mdash;that there is widespread evasion of the law in this field.  You must remember that this House, in the Finance Act of 1961, put an end to the devices of the pre-1947 company under which land could be purchased.  All these gaps were closed under the 1961 Act. So far as I, or those for whom I am responsible are aware, a way of evading this law has not been found unless by common fraud, and of course you can avoid any law by that method if you are prepared to risk paying the penalty if you are duly caught out.</P>

      <P>May I ask, if a Deputy inquired from the Minister's Department whether or not stamp duty had been paid on a particular transaction, the Minister would be prepared to answer him?  Is it within his rights to ask simply by ringing up whether stamp duty had been paid in his locality?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with this point, which was raised by Deputy Tully.  Might I appeal to Deputies again to go back and read the provisions of the 1961 Finance Act and familiarise themselves with the law as it stands?  It deals with this whole question.  The position, under that Act, of people who purport to buy land for the purpose of starting an industry is that they are exempted but they must get going in a period of three years or they will be out.  There are certain penalties prescribed so that in the case mentioned by Deputy Tully, of an individual who is accumulating a number of small areas of land allegedly for the purpose of starting an industry and does not, he has under the 1961 Act only three years to get busy or he is out and he incurs the full stamp duty and penalties.  Perhaps that also answers Deputy Murphy's question.</P>
      <P>At all events, I will roughly summarise the position.  Both before and after the exact statutory records that we have since 1961, the amount of land involved in these transactions with non-nationals, with aliens, runs at about roughly 6,500 statutory acres a year.  That is roughly equal to about one-fifth of the amount of land purchased by the Land Commission each year for the relief of congestion.  As I explained, probably quite a good part of these 6,500 acres would not be suitable for Land Commission purposes.These are the figures and that is the picture which I want Deputies to realise is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Blowick was Minister for Lands and his check showed that 5,000 acres a year were involved in <Col N="129" /> transactions with aliens, he said in replying to a debate in this House that if the aliens were going to buy up this country, they would want to improve or it would take them 2,500 years to buy out the land at that pace.  I think it would be equally true to say that now in accordance with the figures.</P>

      <P>The figures are approximately the same as his check showed. Perhaps I should refer Deputy Tully to the figures I have for Meath for property on which the 25 per cent stamp duty was paid.  The number of transactions was about 11, the area 1,155 acres and the price £83,987. That was for the period from 1st August 1961 until 17th of this month. These are the figures for his county.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that this question is more involved but let me say&mdash;I am speaking from recollection now&mdash;a deed must be stamped within 30 days of execution, unless there is a special reason that it is held in escrow for the balance of the purchase money to be paid, or for some other valid reason. If it is not held in escrow, a special certificate must go to the Revenue Commissioners to deal with the situation.Very severe penalties are incurred on the actual stamp duty on those concerned.  In many cases, of course, the purchase money is lodged but the sale cannot be closed maybe for three or six months.  Therefore these cases do arise.  But the position, generally speaking, is that a man or his legal advisers will not part with the purchase money to the other side until he gets a conveyance of the land.  He would be a lunatic if he did.</P>

      <P>I was not aware of that.  Let me conclude by saying that I have dealt with this matter comprehensively and, indeed, answered points made by some Deputies, who evidently were not particularly familiar with this law, in my Estimate speech and I refer Deputies to that speech.</P>
      <P>The mover of this motion, according to himself, is not so much concerned with the purchase of land by aliens, if they work the lands properly and give plenty of employment, as with the exact record.  The law is working well as far as the 25 per cent is concerned and this picture has not changed anything worthwhile over a number of years.  I have given the number of acres per year at which it works out, on average.  We know how to deal with the problem outlined by the motion if it calls for action, which I suggest it does not.  I suggest that most of the speeches on this subject are for the purpose of exploiting the sensitivity of our people on this question for political purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister thumped his chest and said that for <Col N="131" /> the first time in history a statutory register is now available so that the House and the country may know how much land is in the hands of aliens and succeeded, I presume, in hood-winking his Party into the belief that this register was introduced without any outside persuasion.</P>
      <P>It is well known that this Government had to be forced by public opinion into the preparation of this register.  The Minister said that as a result of close investigation and observation of the actions of aliens with regard to land purchase no danger now exists of a big invasion of non-nationals into this country for the purchase of land.  If it be true that that danger has been averted it is because people inside and outside this House have forced the Government into a realisation of the danger that existed and that in the past the land was bought.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave figures over which he cannot stand.  He gave figures where the Garda Síochána were asked to act as observes of what went on in the various parishes.  He was careful to say he could not stand over the accuracy of the figures but as far as the general public are concerned the idea is to hoodwink them into believing that the figures are accurate.</P>
      <P>In 1950, Commissioner Mansfield, as he was then, went to Galway and at a land court stated that over 100,000 acres of the finest and most fertile land in Ireland had passed into the hands of non-nationals between the end of the war and 1950.  Does the Minister challenge that statement of mine?  That matter was raised in this House and the then Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, was crossexamined as to the accuracy or otherwise of that statement.  He said he was not quarrelling with the figures given but that the Commissioner, in his capacity of Commissioner, had no right to make such a statement in a land court.  That man was removed, by sealed order of the Government, for making the facts known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After that, I put down a motion in this House calling on the Government of the day to resume that land. <Col N="132" /> Deputy Moran was not then as exultant as he now is because he was in opposition.He tabled an amendment to my motion.  He would not support my motion but for his Party he sought to delete my motion, which was to resume the land in question, and to call upon the Land Commission to expedite the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion before the House is not going far enough at all. An investigation into what happened in the past five years is not sufficient. Although, quite clearly, it comes within the terms of this motion, we have not heard a word from the Minister about the purchase of some of the most beautiful scenic areas in this country by non-nationals.  We have heard no word from the Minister about barriers erected at scenic spots and in localities where the public had the right of way in the past to seaside bathing places.  We have heard no word about barriers put up by non-nationals in these localities and the purchase of land along the coast. The Minister sought to suggest that because a large amount of land in Mayo or elsewhere is valued at only 2d an acre it is justifiable to sell it to non-nationals.  Is that what the Minister and his Party think of a type of land that would be ideal for sport if properly developed?  Do we take the view that land ideal for shooting and lakes suitable for fishing are of no practical value to the Irish people and can be sold to non-nationals while the Irishman has to pay a fabulous figure for a day's shooting or fishing? Is it the Minister's intention to make of these areas what has been made of the Highlands of Scotland&mdash;a hunting place for retired aliens and half-witted colonels?  That is what this Government are aiming at in regard to the West of Ireland at present.  The best localities in the West and part of the South have passed into the hands of non-nationals and the local people are employed as gillies and servants in the big houses of all these people who have moved in.</P>

      <P>Speaking before the adjournment, I quoted the figure of 9,000 as the housing needs for Kerry. I wish to correct that.  The housing needs there are in the region of 980. As I said at the outset, the need for housing, whether rural or otherwise, is apparent and I do not intend to labour that any further beyond saying I am glad to see that the figures for this year have picked up and that more houses are being built than in the previous years.  But we have quite a backlog to make up to get back to the 1960 figure, not to mention the years previous to that, when there was a vast increase in the number of houses being built.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with housing we must consider the matter of water and sewerage.  I listened with interest to the Minister's address to the representatives of Muintir na Tíre in Tipperary when he stressed the great importance of rural water supplies. I was glad to hear that there was further encouragement for this type of scheme in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the end of June this year the Department of Local Government have taken over from the Department of Agriculture the direction of schemes of concern to the farming community.  Is the Minister satisfied that the number of inspectors available to him to inspect these schemes and approve grants is sufficient to enable the work to go on expeditiously?  People have approached me in regard to this matter. I know some of the delay has been due <Col N="134" /> to the change over.  People applied in the first instance to the Department of Agriculture and got a letter back saying this matter was now the responsibility of the Department of Local Government.  Does the Minister think that the present inspectorial system is sufficient to deal with the need and get the work going at an accelerated rate?  If inspectors have to deal with a large area and a scattered rural population and if they have to inspect the ground, you are going to have a slowing down of the process.</P>
    <P>In this country the weather is an important factor in these matters.  If people are going to sink wells and provide sewerage facilities, they do not care to start such work in the winter months.  I suggest it is necessary to arrange for a more expeditious inspection of these sites.  Certainly, the group schemes could be of great advantage in rural areas, but there again a difficulty has arisen in regard to pumping tests.  Where the well has been sunk the people concerned in the scheme are awaiting a trial pumping test to be carried out by the ESB. It was an improvement in the contract document to find that the contractors sinking such wells have to submit the wells to a pumping test.  If the ESB have not adequate facilities to arrange for the carrying out of these tests expeditiously, it results in the type of delay which can be frustrating for whoever promotes the scheme on behalf of the group and who has to deal with the provision of materials and the financing of it.  It is discouraging if the tests cannot be expeditiously carried out and the work put in hand.  Perhaps the Minister would use his good offices with the ESB to ensure that if sufficient testing units are not available, the Board, who are supplying the current and who will gain from the operation of the scheme in the long run, will increase the number of their testing staff to deal more expeditiously with this matter?</P>
    <P>Is there a minimum number of householders in regard to a group scheme?  Does everybody within the ambit of the scheme have to be in at that stage in order to ensure the success of the scheme?  Undoubtedly <Col N="135" /> local co-operation is important in cases like that.  It is important that people co-operate to secure the advantages of piped water for all.  I know the grant has now been increased to £60 per house and that the local authority can make a grant in this matter.  I think the Minister has had the experience in Tipperary of hearing about group water schemes and the amount one might be called on to bear and he would know whether there was any such scheme where the figure turned out very different from the amount budgeted for in the first instance.  This is something which it is not easy to get around.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his advisory staff are being as helpful as possible but any assistance which will enable the individual organising a group scheme to make an accurate estimate so that the participating householders can have a fairly accurate account of what they are expected to contribute would lead to more harmony in regard to these schemes.  Perhaps we might evolve a standard pattern for such cases.  On one occasion the Minister gave an example of I think £150 per house connected.  Has he revised that figure or does it still stand?  Perhaps he would let us know about that when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>The next big item the Minister mentioned in his speech was roads expenditure, road traffic and so on. Everybody in the country has been extremely shocked by the appalling death and accident rates on the roads. It is not the roads that are the cause of the accidents and it is not the cars. In some cases it is the drivers.  I am sure that the Minister for Justice and the Garda authorities have investigated these instances and obtained reports in regard to inquests on the victims, so that he should be able to arrive at some conclusion as to whether something could be done physically which would help.  The Minister has admonished people, and so have the safety first associations and the newspapers.Civics instruction may also help, but despite all these it seems that we have come to regard these figures as inevitable.  We are horrified when <Col N="136" /> we read of six or seven people being killed suddenly in an air accident or of deaths in a fire but we seem to have reached a stage where a pile up of cars on the road resulting in the deaths of four or five people makes headlines just for half a day.  Appeals from this House and elsewhere do not seem to have had effect.  On occasions the religious communities have been addressed in that respect by church leaders.  I wonder if there is any grain of truth to be found in the investigation of these accidents which would point to something which might help. I would be glad if the Minister has any information on it which he could publicise.  I know that he has been giving the matter thought.</P>
    <P>Driving a car as I do myself I have been not alone shocked but terrified at times on the road particularly at night when facing oncoming traffic.  The first driver coming towards you dims in response to your dimming but the line of traffic following him does not do that.  Somebody somewhere in the line keeps his headlights on.  In the new regulations the Minister has adverted to this and it is something which should be sternly dealt with.  If we can use Garda patrols on the road in the ordinary way in speed traps to use a device to catch the individual who is breaking the speed limits it should not be beyond our capacity to enforce dimming so that the individual who deliberately and flagrantly refuses to dim should be visited with the penalty a careless driver deserves, because this is carelessness and absolute discourtesy by individuals.</P>
    <P>We still find pedestrians who do not face oncoming traffic.  A motorist approaching such a pedestrian has no way of picking him out against the headlights of an oncoming driver. Such a pedestrian stands a grave risk of serious injury if not death.  It would be advisable for pedestrians always to walk on the side of traffic approaching them.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of damage to signs on the road.  It is very regrettable that we have this damage and the fact that there is a certain amount of vandalism is very hard to explain.  It is hard to understand how <Col N="137" /> anybody could want to feel a responsibility on his conscience for an accident caused if he disturbs or wantonly removes signs put on the road for the guidance of traffic.  In that regard the local authority or anybody in charge of a roads programme where work is in progress and signs are temporarily removed should be impressed very strongly with the absolute necessity of ensuring that those signs or signs of a like character even of a temporary nature are placed there to avoid accidents.I am afraid it is going to take a long time for us to grow up from the attitude of regarding interference with signs as being merely harmless antics or pranks.  A more responsible approach to public property is badly needed.  How it is to be got or enforced is hard to see because evidently people do not like civics being preached at them.  This is something on which the Press of the country should use its great power of persuasion.  When an accident happens its results are felt by the individual and the family affected by such a tragedy and it is brought home very forcibly in the area, but we are inclined in the national conscience to sleep on the matter until the next time it happens. Very often, I am afraid, this is not a question of damage being caused by young people, because the damage is of such a character that the signs are incapable of suffering such damage from youthful hands.</P>
    <P>The speed limits imposed, particularly in built up areas, have given a certain measure of confidence to people living in such areas and traffic is slowing down, but I wonder if we ought not to review these limits more quickly and more often in places.  The signs in some places are not well sited.  We have sometimes signs erected quite a long distance outside the built-up area of a town, imposing a speed limit of 30 miles an hour, where perhaps 40 would do until such time as one came into the more built-up portion of the town.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand why those who advise on this matter do not introduce speed limits in certain places. I am surprised that some villages in my constituency have no speed limits. Speed limits are very necessary particularly <Col N="138" /> in areas where schools are sited on the outskirts.  The siting need not be very far away.  Sometimes the distance is quite long and a speed limit over that long distance can actually impede traffic.  In the same way, a speed limit in very narrow streets can slow up traffic considerably and create more snags than were intended. Presumably the review of the operation of the regulations will supply a solution to some of these problems.</P>
    <P>To whom should people make representations when they want speed limits imposed?  To whom can they comment, should they wish to do so, on existing speed limits and the siting of them?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that newer methods are being adopted in regard to road building.  That is apparent to all who travel the roads.  I mentioned on the last occasion that there is need for investigation and research not alone by local engineers but by independent examiners.  We ought to try to arrive at what is best. Our roads are costing a great deal of money.  It is fortunate the Road Fund is so large.  Our roads are good roads. In my experience, they compare favourably with roads abroad.</P>
    <P>With regard to modernising reconstruction, why is there so little re-routing?Is the idea to take the traffic over the road so that it will act as a steamroller more or less and bed the material down?  Would it not be better to have re-routing to enable the surface to be put down in the ordinary way instead of having it churned up by passing traffic, very often to the grave detriment of the cars?  Surely the county engineers could time and devise their schemes to allow re-routing.</P>
    <P>With regard to parking regulations, the Minister has power to make these regulations.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us if he has collected much revenue from fines on the spot.  How is that operating?  Has the public taken to the idea?  Sometimes traders object to parking regulations.  The traders in William Street in Limerick complained bitterly to the Corporation because of the losses sustained by them as a result of parking regulations.</P>
    <P>With regard to pedestrian crossings, <Col N="139" /> we have not the advantage here of underground crossings.  Presumably the subsoil in Dublin will not permit of such crossings.  Of course, pedestrians often do things they should not do.  On a recent Parliamentary mission abroad I saw a pedestrian step out on the road when he should not: he was pursued by a policeman and fined on the spot.  I am not suggesting we should adopt that policy here.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the findings of the commission appointed to inquire into drunken driving.  Apparently the Minister has not been able to adopt in full the recommendations of the commission.  The type of test has given rise to a good deal of argument.  However, I suppose it will be a matter of scientific research.  One thing is readily admitted by all: anybody who drinks should not drive and those who drive should not drink.  The slaughter is bad enough but it would be quite horrible if a person put himself in the position, because of drink, of maiming or killing a fellow-citizen on the roads.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of fire hazards. The Minister said he has the report of the commision.  Is the report available? Does he intend to make regulations based on this review?  We had a big fire in Limerick during the summer. A great deal of damage was done. There was, too, a tragic accident in Dublin.  These things will happen but, if there is omission or inadvertence, it ought not to be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister did not refer to libraries this year.  The library service has paid a real dividend in Irish life.  Libraries nowadays fulfil a more useful function in Irish life other than merely the supply of books. In rural areas rooms in libraries are being used by secondary schools and it would be a great pity if such educational facilities were lost to prospective pupils because of the taking over of these rooms for some other purpose. When grants are being made available by An Comhairle Leabharlanna, I hope that aspect will not be lost sight of and that this amenity will be preserved in the rural areas.  Wherever the library is in part used as a secondary school, it should continue to be so <Col N="140" /> used.  It would not please the public to find out that the library could not be used as a secondary school.  They are synonomous with each other and help the work of each other.</P>
    <P>With regard to Subhead L, for the provision of money for seeds and fertilisers, last year it filled a need in the lives of the people who had suffered storm damage to their holdings.It enabled money to be provided for the rehabilitation of such holdings at two per cent, and that is something which we need to have at all times in this country.  All rural Deputies will have experience of land being flooded when river banks have burst.  We have had the experience in Limerick where a large tract of land is still under water because of the collapse of the river bank.  It will take a couple of years to rehabilitate this land and people with 17 or 18 acres of land, and having to face this problem, have already had a grave impost put upon them in the loss of livestock and crops.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be doing a good service to the rural community if he kept that subhead there and made any money which may be necessary available through any council to assist people in such circumstances. This would be particularly useful in the case of the banks of rivers which have not yet come under the scope of the Office of Public Works and Buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of local authority expenditure and the indebtedness of local authorities.  The position in regard to that is very easily stated.  At any time, the collection of rates is not an easy proposition.  It is not a difficult proposition, either. I believe that in the long run our people are quite willing to play their part in paying for what they are getting in the way of services but these services are continuing to grow.  A large amount of money is being collected for these services, the cost of which, despite pruning, continues to rise and represents a continuing burden on the rates.</P>
    <P>It might well be said that the people are receiving services for the money they pay but it is not so easy to say <Col N="141" /> that in cases where you have provided a road or a water scheme, or a certain number of houses and find that your costs in regard to these are continually increasing.  The position is that the provision of services in any particular county does not increase but the expenditure on them continues to rise.  A large proportion of the amount that must be provided from the rates goes to the health services, over which the Minister has no control, but which takes the form of a mandatory demand on the local authority.  Very often, this is not adverted to.  The expenditure on these services is continuing to rise and are we ever going to reach the stage when such expenses will level off, when the rising costs will begin to go down?</P>
    <P>The State provides a large proportion of these expenses at the present time but it does not matter from which pocket you take the money&mdash;it is still the taxpayer who is paying it, whether he pays it in local rates or in general taxation.  It all comes from the same source.  I mentioned last year that there should be some system of priorities in regard to this matter, that we should lay down some sort of programme to which we would adhere in an effort to deal with this problem.  One thing that would help in this respect would be the completion of the national survey of housing needs.  If that were done, a housing programme could be devised which would meet the national need. One should also expect that now that our roads are dust-free and steamrolled to a large extent, that expenditure in that respect would taper off somewhat.</P>
    <P>There is also that unknown factor that will come into play as soon as the Minister makes regulation under the Town Planning Act recently passed through this House.  That will mean an increase in expenditure in various parts of the country and we should try to keep that expenditure within the capacity of the people to pay.  At present the people are meeting their obligations fairly.  There is seldom anyone who wilfully defaults but it would be a bad thing if the public were not to be made aware of the programme they have to meet and if they could not look <Col N="142" /> forward with confidence to a time when there would be a decrease in the burden of rates.  It would be a welcome thing if some county manager, at an estimates meeting, could announce that he was recommending a decrease of even a small amount in the rates. It would have an encouraging effect on the public generally.</P>
    <P>This Department for which the Minister is responsible is one of the very important Departments of State.  It touches the people in a great many aspects of their life.  It is the one to which the people mainly look for help. Most Deputies know that many of their duties in making requests on behalf of their constituents are centred in the Department of Local Government.If there is anything the Minister can do to expedite the dealings of his Department with the public, he should do it in order to maintain the good relations that obtain.</P>
    <P>Local government in this country is not a matter of government but rather of administration.  The members of local authorities generally, and I am not one of them, have no power to regard themselves as in the category of dealing with local government. They are dealing rather with local administration because local government is centralised in the long run. I have said here before that I do not blame the Government for that because there is such a large amount of money being provided centrally that the Government say: &ldquo;We must keep an eye on these things.&rdquo;  I do, however, say that the Government could relax a little in this matter by allowing more liberty and discretion to local officials. It is a point on which I feel most strongly.  We have capable officials, engineers and accountants, at local level and I cannot see why the Department, with their system of local government auditing, are not able to keep a sufficient hand on the pulse of local authorities to ensure that a good job is done, while at the same time leaving to the locally elected representatives more administrative freedom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall begin where Deputy Jones left off and mention the problem of the rates.  I would say, however, that there is an angle to this <Col N="143" /> that we should not forget.  A Parliamentary question was answered here today as to the value of the pound in 1938 as against the present time and the reply was that the pound today is comparatively about 6/6d to 6/8d.  In South Cork, for instance, the rates are 47/- in the £.  We should all like to see them lower, but we must not forget the fact that if we were at the stage of being able to get as much value for 47/- as was got in 1938, or if we had progressed very well in the period up to 1938, perhaps rates might not then have been as clear an indication of a comparison against us now.</P>
      <P>Taking the pre-war value of the pound, I think it is true to say that if we consider the amount of work done by local authorities pre-war as against the present time, we can truly say we are getting as much value at the present time as we were pre-war when the rates were approximately 15/- in the £ and more in some instances. I mention that to make it clear that we in the Labour Party, although we should like to see lower rates, do not lose sight of the fact that because of the change of money values, we must pay extra for the necessary improvements in local authority areas.</P>
      <P>There is a touch of past history about this Estimate.  It is very difficult to speak on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government in the month of October, going into November, when in actual fact, we should have been doing so many months ago.  We clearly realise that the Minister's speech has been interspersed with statistical returns based on a period up to the end of August and that we shall therefore be going over the same ground in a few months when we are presented with the new Estimate which must include a number of the statistical returns before us tonight.  It is therefore somewhat a waste of time discussing it at great length now and I am accordingly limiting myself as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us many figures on house building and naturally I am not in a position to say whether the figures he gave are correct or not. I am not, of course, questioning them, <Col N="144" /> but, and I shall try to elaborate later on, it is strange that while the figures show an uplift in building operations during that period, those of us who are members of local authorities can say that many difficulties have been encountered in our dealings with the Department.</P>
    <P>One instance of this, to which I should like to draw particular attention has to do with private housebuilding.I am referring to the unsatisfactory system in regard to inspections by Departmental inspectors, whether it is where a person applies for a grant before work has commenced or otherwise.  In many cases, the person must wait very many months for an inspector to come along, even in the case of reconstruction work.  Then when the work is completed, the same procedure is encountered again&mdash;there are all these trappings and trimmings before the person concerned receives his grant.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into this problem in detail, but I would instance the case of a man in Innishannon, near Bandon. The inspector called on him before Christmas and became apparently so fond of the place that he or some other inspector paid several calls since. However, the unfortunate person still has not got his grant.  Yet, we are now told of the enormous amount spent within the past six or eight months as compared with previous years.  I could bring many other cases to light in that area alone to prove how unsatisfactory the present system is.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is essential that the Department should have an inspector attached to each centre.  I do not want an inspector in every provincial town but I submit there should be one in each area so that the local people could contact him if necessary, and a Deputy could call at his office the same as at employment exchanges or other Departmental offices in the country.  In the case of the Department of Local Government, we do not know who the inspector is or with whom we should get in touch.  We have to go all the way to the Custom House and then back again in a roundabout fashion to get in touch with the inspector.  I am not blaming the officials in the Custom House.  My experience of them is that <Col N="145" /> they do their work well.  However, I am complaining about these deplorable waiting periods between the time of application, the time of inspection and the time of receipt of grants.</P>
    <P>In the matter of reconstruction grants, my remarks are certainly not directed against the Minister in present circumstances.  However, the situation is continuing to become more acrimonious because of the length of time involved and the costs, whether material or labour costs.  They are increasing all the time.  For many years back, the system operated by the Department, and which the inspector must carry out, is that the allocation of grants for reconstruction is based on pricing that is completely outdated. I am speaking as one who has had fairly long experience of the building industry.  It is time that the Minister had the system thoroughly investigated.In respect of work that may cost £700 the Department's inspector will have to put down a cost of £450 or £500, not through any fault of the inspector but because of the rules laid down for him by the Department governing measurements and costs.  The figures are outdated and it is time to bring them up to more realistic figures having regard to present day costs of building and reconstruction work.</P>
    <P>I do not wish unnecessarily to castigate the Minister for some of his statements castigating local authorities for their failure in regard to housing programmes but I will say in passing that it was unnecessary, undesirable and unjust of the Minister to blame someone else for faults that very often can be laid at his feet and at the feet of his Department.  If the Minister had shown a greater sense of co-operation in dealing with requests coming from local authorities instead of attacking them for some things which were not their fault there might be greater satisfaction and co-operation in local administration.</P>
    <P>One matter mentioned by Deputy Jones to which I should like briefly to refer is the question of vested cottages or cottages in respect of which tenants have applied for vesting.  As I have said here very frequently, the procedure is unsatisfactory.  A tenant who <Col N="146" /> is not satisfied with the amount of repairs being carried out by the local authority has the right of appeal, within 30 days, to the Minister.  The snag is that very often the tenant will write a letter to the Department of Local Government drawing attention to the unsatisfactory state of the cottage after the repairs have been carried out but the inspector, according to the rule of thumb laid down for him by the Department, can deal only with the complaints specified in the letter by the tenant.  There should be a broader view taken of this matter.  If a tenant forgets, when writing to the Department, to include some item, the inspector should not be debarred from dealing with the matter merely because it was not included in the tenant's list of objections.  I know of cases where tenants were told that the inspector is so debarred.  That is unnecessarily restrictive.  The Department should be less rigid in dealing with the general public.</P>
    <P>Frequently we are faced with the problem of building costs.  The Minister has drawn attention to that problem.Some of our problems in that connection date from some years back before the present Minister became Minister for Local Government.  I have in mind a time when a Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government insisted that on all possible occasions the contract system should be considered as against the direct labour system.  In very many instances a direct labour system was being built up by a local authority.  As a result, a certain degree of competition was created between the direct labour system and the contract system.  That form of competition was killed by a certain Minister for Local Government during the 1950s.  We have not got over that yet in South Cork.</P>
    <P>I give credit to the Minister for two parts of his speech here.  In speaking of Dublin Corporation's proposals he stated that additional schemes had been agreed to save the time normally given to contract documents, advertising, and so on.  That is one important part of the Minister's speech.  It is a question of eliminating red tape. The Minister apparently agrees with the line Dublin Corporation are taking. <Col N="147" /> Certainly, if they are successful, there is great credit due to them.</P>
    <P>On page 4 of the Minister's speech, in a very long paragraph, the Minister refers to a housing survey and the difficulty experienced by local authorities in getting contractors.  That applies also in rural areas.  The Minister is right in speaking of the difficulty in getting contractors.  As I have already said, that was brought about to a large degree by the actions of a Minister in the past.  I wonder if the Minister is sincere when he refers to the difficulties in getting contractors? May I ask what is happening in his Department?</P>
    <P>In dealing with local government we must draw attention to the problems affecting our constituencies.  May I ask the Minister what has happened in the case of the many requests sent up, with the unanimous approval of all the members&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Farmers and Independents&mdash; from South Cork, for instance?  We did not have such difficulty in getting contracts in some areas.  Perhaps the prices were considered rather high. They may have been, but they were the lowest we could get.  In the case of an area &mdash; Blackrock-Ballinlough-Ballintemple&mdash;there was a request from the county council in connection with the building of 20 houses.  It is true that sanction was received in respect of the site but then the trouble started. It went on for a long time.  In August or September a reply came from the Department pointing out that there were certain objections, querying the lay-out.  That was dealt with, the last letter being of 28th September.  Surely we are entitled to a small amount of freedom locally?  When the Cork County Council, southern area, have the advantage of the services of a fully qualified architect appointed by the Local Appointments Commission, surely the Department of Local Government and the Minister should not be hanging on so long with the question of layout of 20 houses for 20 families?</P>
    <P>That is only one case.  There are two areas where 28 houses are involved, 24 houses in Carrigtuohill and <Col N="148" /> four houses in Dripsey.  A compulsory purchase order was made on 7th June, 1962.  Confirmation was sought from the Department of Local Government. An inquiry was held on 18th December, 1962.  When nothing was happening, a reminder was sent to the Departments last June and still nothing is happening.  Deputy Corry will support me, as Carrigtuohill is in east Cork.  We are still awaiting sanction in this case.  What is wrong there?</P>
    <P>There was another case where a site was selected for 20 houses.  I know all the fault is not that of the Minister and his Department but we had the extraordinarily sad experience of the Department of Agriculture stepping in and buying the land over our heads in spite of the fact that a portion of the land had been acquired by the council. The Departments of Local Government and Agriculture are still arguing over alternative sites and still denying the Cork County Council the right to build 20 houses there.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of an attempt to build 20 houses in Passage West. I admit no Minister could be expected to know the position exactly himself but it would be no harm for him to look at the glaring injustice in the town of Passage West in connection with a housing scheme.  We got an excellent site there for 20 houses.  The compulsory purchase order was carried out.  There was no objection by the ground landlords.  The legal responsibility of advertising in the papers was carried out in order to give the specified period to any genuine objector.  Nobody objected.  The proposal was sent to the Minister for sanction so that building could proceed.What happened?  Some people behind the scenes interfered.  I am not saying that they got at the Minister but they got at somebody because the proposal was salted away in the Custom House until August or early September because eventually we got the complete sanction which we should have got long before.</P>
    <P>There are ten houses held up, in another area around a part of County Cork that has a proud connection with the year 1920.  I am speaking about the Upton Cross area, famous as one <Col N="149" /> of the parts of County Cork connected with the struggles of that time.  I know one family there and there is no family in this city of Dublin living in worse circumstances.  We got a site by agreement and there are other sites involved there as well.  Tenders were sent up but they were too high and we had to advertise again.  Then we were told to get tenders for serviced cottages. Tenders were again sent in and are being dealt with but 12 months have elapsed, leaving a family living in the most disgraceful type of house I have ever gone into.  Does that show a sense of co-operation between the Department of Local Government and the local authority?</P>
    <P>Then, there was another compulsory purchase order, No. 3 of 1962, which was made on 31st December, 1962, and sent to the Department for confirmation on 8th January, 1963.  What has happened to it?  When will we get confirmation of it?  I get no pleasure from putting these points forward.  I cannot expect the Minister to answer every one of them.  We all have to depend on someone to advise us but it would be well for the Minister, should he doubt my word, to consult Deputy Corry or Deputy MacCarthy.  I do not mind whom he consults.  I want to get results.  In South Cork we sent in tenders which were rejected by the Department as being too high.  We were forced to advertise again and we got tenders that were higher still because naturally the cost of materials and other things involved went up in the meantime.</P>
    <P>It is no use saying this is a problem for the local authority and that the onus for the failure to build houses is on the local authority when these facts can be given.  I would suggest the Minister, before making any of these speeches, should have known from Deputies of his own Party, the exact position in relation to these problems. There was a similar situation in the town of Kinsale.  The urban council was clamouring to have houses built there.  There was more correspondence between the Department and the urban council in question but that does not build houses.</P>
    <P>The important question is: are we <Col N="150" /> in local authorities to get any degree of true local autonomy?  While it is essential that local authorities should get the grants they are getting from the Exchequer, the trouble is that, irrespective of who may be in Government, the local authorities seem to be completely sold to the Custom House. Why should the situation not be the same in regard to house building as in regard to the allocation of road grants?  Every county gets its allocation from the Road Fund on the basis of mileage.  That system should be put into operation in connection with housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken of the nation-wide survey that is taking place. The Minister has at his disposal in his Department all the necessary information and data in connection with the housing needs of each local authority area.  Why not depart from the system which has not been satisfactory in the past?  Why not adopt the same method as in the allocation of road grants? Allocate so much per year to each council for housing and if a council fails to build a number of houses, then it loses that money at the end of the year.  Then let it be said that it is the fault of the local authority.  But be fair to them: tell them at the start of the year how much money is being put at their disposal.  Trust the local authority and their officials to try to get the best bargain they can in tenders for these houses.  Local authority members are not a group of country boys, not a group which a Minister or Government cannot trust.  Down the years, we have had experience of the solid work done by the officials and members of local authorities as a whole.  Therefore, if they can be trusted in every other way, why can they not be trusted now to adopt a new system?  Then they cannot blame the Minister if, at the end of their financial year, they cannot show that all the money has been spent in a proper way.  That is my suggestion for getting out of the <i>impasse</i> created by the hold-ups, the red tape and legal formalities in rural areas as well as in towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Commission who have done very good work in connection with studying the <Col N="151" /> problem of driving motor cars under the influence of drink.  These people, brought together by the Minister from various walks of life, have by their ability given us a solution which is well worth bringing into operation. Deputy Jones referred to speed limits, as did the Minister.  We hope that, at the end of 12 months, the matter will be reviewed.  It is quite right to say that at the approaches to some cities and towns the 30 mile an hour sign is too far out.  In some cases, too, some changes may be made.  At least an attempt is being made and I must leave it to another Estimate to protest against the breaking of this law.  It is not the fault of the Minister for Local Government.  It must come up under Justice.  Some people seem to find a delight in driving faster inside the 30 mile an hour speed limit than they do outside it.  All the Minister can do is prepare and put into operation the necessary measures which will give the officers of another Department a responsibility to which I hope they will live up.</P>
    <P>On the question of roads, the old problem of the advantages of the Local Authorities (Works) Act arises.  It gave employment and, as Deputy Corry said, it produced very good results.While much good work is being done on the road system at present, we find an enormous amount of machinery being used.  I agree with the use of machinery but I believe there is a point beyond which we should not be prepared to go.  I see tractors going along the roads cutting the brows of the dykes and the drivers are getting £5 a day, but a man doing the job would get £6 odd a week.  Would it not be better to have a man doing the job? Where machinery is essential, by all means make the fullest use of it, but we have lost our sense of proportion as regards the amount of money we are spending on machinery to replace human beings.  I would rather see a man who is keeping his wife and children getting £6 a week.  Much machinery is being used in this useless manner.  I suggest the county managers knew the path to the Custom House, even before the Minister went there. <Col N="152" /> The advice and co-operation they get there is nobody's business but perhaps the Minister might have a word with them and with the Parliamentary Secretary from his own county, and ask them how much machinery they are using and what labour has been replaced by the introduction of that machinery.</P>
    <P>Another matter with which I want to deal is salary increases.  This is a very sore point with the people concerned, the officials and the members of local authorities.  There is too great a time-lag between all the negotiations between the representatives of the workers, whether they are staff officers or clerk-typists, and the county manager, and then with the Minister and the Department.  Ultimately, they have to come back again to the county manager.  The trouble is that finally when the Minister agrees, or when they agree, and the matter comes before the local council, there is an outcry from the members.  Naturally, the Minister and the staff are justified in expecting that the agreement will be retrospective to the time the negotiations started but because it is, an extra sum of money is involved and the members see red when they hear about this and say: &ldquo;They are doing very well if we give them an increase from next week or the week after.&rdquo;  I never agree with that.  I suggest that in future these negotiations should be simplified and that no time-lag should be involved, so that when these people are awarded an increase, it will come automatically to the council for sanction in the shortest period.</P>
    <P>Another point is that about which Deputy Jones spoke, that is, night driving and the fact that our roads are tarred.  As they are black, we cannot see any pedestrian in front of us when driving.  Would the Minister inquire if anything could be done in this regard? We find fault with our public lighting system and there may be justification where there are pools of light, but you have to consider the country roads as well.  I believe that a frequent cause of accidents is the fact that at night people are not easily discernible on the roads.  Does tar have to be black in colour?  Could we have it in some other colour?  We have luminous signs <Col N="153" /> which we can see some hundreds of yards away.  I do not suggest we should have roads that will dazzle us but it would be a wonderful help if our roads could be of a colour other than black so as to assist a motorist to see pedestrians at night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Estimate.  I am very happy to note that plenty of money is available for housing.  It is the means by which we can expedite our programme. I am a member of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation. Some time ago, the Minister received a deputation from that committee and he offered all the co-operation of his Department to expedite by every means the building of houses in the Corporation area.</P>
      <P>The housing problem in Dublin was aggravated some months ago because of all the houses which had to be condemned as a result of the fatal accidents that occurred in Bolton Street and Fenian Street.  No member of the Housing Committee and no member of the Corporation wants to see anybody displaced without having a house to go to.  The system now adopted by the Minister to expedite sanction and to allow the same contractor to continue without advertising the houses has definitely short-circuited the length of time involved in building houses and will expedite the programme.As a result of the work now on hands we feel that within a very short period Dublin Corporation will surmount the housing crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is too bad that it never rains but it pours.  Not alone had we to cope with the collapse of some buildings but almost a thousand families were displaced because it was considered that they were living in dangerous buildings.  Approximately six hundred of these people have been re-housed but at a very serious cost to the unfortunate people already on the waiting list for houses.  I understand that the officials of Dublin Corporation and of the Department of Local Government are in consultation with a view to seeing how they can increase the erection of houses. The members of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee are most <Col N="154" /> anxious that, if possible, the rate of erection will be trebled.</P>
    <P>Dublin is bursting at the seams as far as sites are concerned.  It is not so very long ago since Dublin city took over a lot of County Dublin. Now we have almost gone short of main drainage schemes.  The south part of the city and the borders of the county are crying out for a south Dublin drainage scheme.  Such a scheme might encourage further private building which would greatly alleviate the present demand for houses.  Our drainage scheme in Dublin, both north and south, is not adequate to cope with requirements.</P>
    <P>Speculative builders try to buy up sites and the Corporation are taking over, or are trying to take over, some sites because of the crisis which has arisen.  An inquiry has been held and the matter is awaiting the decision of the Minister and his Department.  No matter how we like it, people will ask why we do not build up the centre of the city.  It takes time to acquire property in the centre of the city.  We have had the experience of Church Street where it took about seven years and the property has not yet been finally acquired.  The recent Town Planning legislation will short-circuit that procedure considerably.</P>
    <P>Unless the corporations or the county councils have sites and are allowed to go ahead with development, it takes from two to three years to get on with building.  The Minister has long ago given the green light to Dublin Corporation officials and to the Housing Committee to go ahead with their job and he has adopted a very liberal view in that connection.</P>

      <P>Another point the Minister raised this evening was the possibility of local authorities making sites available for people who would like to build their own houses.  The price of land in Dublin city and county, especially where the services can be provided, is very dear.  Sometimes people from other countries come in and buy the land and develop it.  Some of our people find that, because of competition, the price of land is very high.  I do not seek to cut down the price of land.  It is an opportunity for anybody who has land to get the highest price possible for it but, on the other hand, it means that the price of houses has gone very high. It is very hard for the lower middle class group who are buying houses to pay for them and I have received quite a number of complaints in that connection.</P>
      <P>Money is being made available through SDA loans.  The banks are giving money and there are other ways of raising money.  Tonight, the Minister spoke of an increase in private building and, especially last year, the money given for SDA loans and grants increased considerably.  These are some of the problems we face.</P>
      <P>Land is going very scarce in the city due to the great prosperity we have experienced in the past four or five years of Fianna Fáil administration.  With the continuance of that prosperity, there will be no unemployment and there will be plenty of speculative builders.</P>

      <P>The one you have in Galway, is that right?  The day has come when the Department of Local Government should allow the county engineer and the county medical officer to make a decision on sites.  I admit that for a certain type of local authority house the Department give a two-third subsidy.  In County Dublin, we require about 1,200 houses as soon as possible and we have decided to build 1,000 within the next three years. There is an outlook in the Department of Local Government&mdash;it was there even before the present Minister took office&mdash;which is detrimental to the interests of a number of my constituents.The position is that a number of nominee sites, especially in NorthWest County Dublin, have been turned down.  It is frustrating for public men trying to get houses built to be told that they must wait for sewerage and water.  This has been going on in the Department for a long time. I am sorry I have to speak so strongly on it, but it is affecting a number of people I know to be living in shocking housing conditions.  If the county engineer and county medical officer select a nominee site without sewerage and water, they are told it cannot be built on, although we know sewerage and water will probably not be available in the area for nine or ten years.</P>
      <P>Some decision will have to be arrived at by the Department to deal with this problem.  Many of the sites are being turned down and we are getting abuse from the people who want houses.  I put this to the Minister and his Department: is it not better to give people a house without water or sewerage than have them living in a house where they are losing their health, a house which is falling down on top of them?  We should try to evolve some scheme whereby a pump might be sunk or a group scheme and septic tanks provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal now with making sites available for private houses.  I welcome the statement in the Minister's speech advising local authorities <Col N="158" /> to make sites available for people who wish to build their own houses.  We have an example of that in Dublin, where people have availed of sites to build their own houses and are doing so still.  It is a great encouragement to people to get a site at the nominal cost of the ground rent.  If that were the case in every area, it would mean the people in the lower income group, who cannot get a house, who have not sufficient money to purchase a site or who live in small towns where there are no speculative builders, would be facilitated.  It is all right in the cities where speculative builders have a chance of selling their houses, but that opportunity is not available to people in small towns or even in the suburbs of Dublin.  I am delighted the Minister has given his blessing to this scheme and I hope local authorities will make more use of it.</P>
    <P>Any place we have tried to get group schemes going&mdash;and we have succeeded in a few places&mdash;they have been warmly welcomed.  The people have appreciated having piped water supplies to their homes.  It has taken a lot of the drudgery out of the work of the housewife.  The inspectors and engineers in charge of the group scheme are excellent officials who have done a fine job.</P>
    <P>With reference to reconstruction grants, it is very hard for certain people to get work done by these grants because it is very hard to get a contractor to do the job.  One of the problems affecting the contractors I have known who are anxious to do this work is that they find they are quite a long time out of their money.  While I have been dealing with the Department and getting nothing but co-operation from the inspectors dealing with the reconstruction of houses, both in the Department and in the local authority, I feel nevertheless that some method of short-circuiting the inspection should be brought in, because I believe the work would progress more rapidly, if that were the case.  People are left a long time out of their money where there are a number of grants and a number of inspections to be carried out.  If there were some way by which that could be expedited, it would be most helpful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> Another point I want to make is that in quite a number of cases I have been dealing with over the years, but for the liberal outlook of the reconstruction grant inspectors, a number of people would be deprived of their grants.  Even where the Department of Local Government have decided that the grant applies, I have found on a few occasions Dublin County Council officials who differed completely and wanted the grant cut down.  I had one particular case and only because I kept the pressure up did we succeed in getting the grant for the person I was interested in.</P>
    <P>I feel that one inspection should suffice.  There should be more liaison between the local authorities and the Department of Local Government.  If the inspector for the Department is satisfied that the work is well done, a second inspection should not be carried out by the local authority, because sometimes they come along and raise a number of objections, which I think should not be done. Again, I want to say how grateful I was to inspectors for getting over the difficulties we have had in County Dublin in dealing with reconstruction grants.</P>
    <P>We have another headache in County Dublin, that is, the number of small farmers who are living in mudwalled cabins and are not in a position to purchase or build their own houses and have just a small amount of land.  They are nobody's children. While Dublin County Council, as I have been told by the Department of Local Government, can build houses for them, and I have tried it out on a few occasions, in only one extreme case where the people were living in shocking circumstances on a five-acre farm did we succeed in having one house built.  I should like the Minister and his officials to look at this matter again because there are a number of cases of people in a very bad way who are in no position to build houses themselves and the houses are too bad to get reconstruction grants or for anything to be done with them.  In the particular case of a man and his young family, the house is falling down on them and he has no money to <Col N="160" /> buy another house.  I appealed to the local authority on his behalf but nothing has been done about it since.  I see that the Minister made reference to it.  I welcome his reference to this problem and hope that he will be able to look after it, provided, as I have no doubt, he will be allowed during the next three years until his term of office is over.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the small farmers, we have another problem here in Dublin which we have discussed on numerous occasions in Dublin Corporation.  My old friend, Deputy Sherwin has often raised it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is, the traffic in Dublin at present.  Suggestions have been made about building a tunnel under the city, and while I know the Minister is engaged in trying to drive forward housing in the city, this traffic congestion in Dublin is a very serious matter.  While the Minister has concerned himself with the improvement of roads generally, I feel that a co-ordinating committee between the Department of Local Government and Dublin Corporation is very essential.  They will have to get down to it, provided, of course, we are left there long enough to do the job we would like to do for the people of the city of Dublin and the remainder of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make the suggestion that we should have an overhead bridge very possibly from Amiens Street across the Liffey to Westland Row.  That would at least relieve a lot of the congestion caused by traffic going north and south.  There are overhead bridges in other cities.  The day is coming when they will be essential here.  Going from the south to the north side of the city, especially during the peak period, there is constant congestion.  Not long ago, I timed it and it took half an hour to get from here to Butt Bridge.  This shows that the problem is getting out of hand. There is more traffic coming on the roads and streets every day.  The people have got so prosperous in the past four or five years that they can <Col N="161" /> buy more cars all the time.  This is a problem which the engineers of the Local Government Department and of Dublin Corporation will have to consider seriously.  We have been discussing for too long the problem of building a tunnel under the Liffey. The position has definitely got out of hand, especially at the point I have referred to.</P>
    <P>With reference to roads leaving the city of Dublin, I want to say again that I am very grateful to the Minister for his enlightened views in trying to have a four-lane traffic route on roads out of the city.  This is long overdue. We are definitely far behind, both in Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, in this matter.  I must admit that I and other members should have done a lot more some years ago.  Now, the Naas road is a great improvement and will be a great asset to the people going south when it is finally reconstructed.</P>

      <P>My motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, viewing with great concern the appalling housing conditions which exist at present in the City of Dublin and the country generally, and believing that urgent and drastic measures are necessary to alleviate the present situation, resolves to establish a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann of fifteen persons for the purpose of:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> (a)  investigating the causes of the present housing shortage,</P>
    <P>(b)  evaluating the future housing needs for the city and the country generally,</P>
    <P>(c)  examining the present legislation relating to housing and its administration, and</P>
    <P>(d)  considering the steps necessary to deal with the present situation,</P>
    <P>which Committee would be required to report to Dáil Éireann within three months of its appointment and would have power to send for persons, papers and documents.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak, Sir, on this motion and to relate my remarks solely to it, particularly in its applicability to the city of Dublin.  The motion describes the housing conditions in Dublin as &ldquo;appalling&rdquo;.  That word was chosen carefully.  It is not an exaggeration. Anybody who is conversant with social conditions here in Dublin&mdash;social conditions which did not start this year as a result of a crisis which developed because of houses falling in Fenian Street and Bolton Street, but which have been with us for many years&mdash; must know that what is suggested in this motion is vitally necessary.</P>
    <P>This subject of housing is, of course, a political subject.  It is a subject on which political considerations arise. But we are dealing with the lives of people, with the happiness and health of people, of thousands of people, old people and young people, and it is with those we are concerned in this motion.  We believe urgent steps are necessary to tackle a situation which has been for many years and still is critical in the extreme.  We suggest that a way of taking such steps would be to establish a Select Committee, which would not dawdle along for years, which would not be used as a means of shelving a difficult problem which could conveniently be put away in the care of a Select Committee, but which would be required to report to this House within three months.</P>
    <P>There are at present in the city of Dublin nearly 10,000 applicants for houses.  There are 5,209 families certified <Col N="163" /> as being in need of houses. There are 3,466 families in overcrowded conditions in immediate need of housing.  It is against the background of these appalling figures that this debate takes place.  Remember, we are dealing in families and not just with individuals and, when we give a figure of 3,466 families in urgent need of immediate housing, we are talking about husbands and fathers, wives and mothers, and children, and we are talking about their mothers and fathers in whose houses they are living, and very frequently with their brothers and sisters, and their children, too.</P>
    <P>Anybody conversant with social conditions in the city of Dublin knows what is happening in our housing estates.  The young people have grown up and got married.  We see the pitiable spectacle every year of the young married couples waiting to see if Lady Luck is on their side, because that is all that this society will give them in the way of new housing accommodation.The lucky ones may draw housing accommodation but, for every one that draws a house, there are hundreds who do not and these go back very frequently to their mothers and fathers in the Corporation housing schemes and they raise their children there.  Brothers come in with their wives and sisters with their husbands and they, too, raise their children there.  I am not exaggerating when I say I know of one family of 19 people &mdash; old people, middle-aged people, and children&mdash;living in a two-room corporation house.  I suggest there is not a Deputy, a councillor in the city of Dublin, or in the county council who cannot match me with similar stories and who cannot tell this House of similar cases of dreadful overcrowding throughout the whole of this city, where homes are being split up, where all sorts of moral problems arise, and where inevitably ill-health follows.</P>
    <P>Apart from that problem, we have the problem of the old people, the people whom, it is admitted, have never been catered for in the past, the people who are living in houses <Col N="164" /> which have not actually been condemned but from whom the families have been taken away to be rehoused; one old person has been left, or perhaps two, and these old people are here in this city, hundreds of them not very far from this House, living in one room in a derelict house which has not yet been condemned but which to all intents and purposes should be.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of conditions with which we are dealing and I think these facts should be given as wide publicity as possible.  We should get into perspective what the situation really is in this country because we are all too inclined to juggle around with figures; we are all too inclined to say there have been so many pounds spent last year on different services, and this is an increase on the year before, and therefore things are going all right.</P>
    <P>There was published in <i>The Times</i> on Monday, 5th August last a report of the Housing League, an international body which obtains information from all the countries of Europe concerning the annual average number of houses built per 1,000 inhabitants. For 1961/62, there were 23 countries whose returns were given in this report, 23 countries from Eastern Europe and Western Europe.  The country that had the lowest return of houses built per 1,000 of the inhabitants was Ireland. It was the lowest by many points. Countries that we are inclined to regard as socially backward, such as for example, Portugal, were a good deal higher than us.  Again, countries which we are inclined to regard as not looking after their social problems adequately, such as Spain, perhaps, or Greece, are away ahead of this country in the number of houses built per 1,000 of the population; and all the countries east of the Iron Curtain were building more houses than we were per 1,000 of the population.  A poor country that could be compared to ours in regard to its national income and population, Norway, was building three times as many houses per 1,000 of the population than we were.</P>
    <P>We should note these facts.  We should realise that this country is called on to make a superhuman effort in relation to its housing drive.  I assert <Col N="165" /> that the present programme for building in the city of Dublin is entirely inadequate.  I shall deal later with the suggestion that part of the problem that has arisen here recently was because net vacancies declined suddenly and created this problem.  I shall deal with that later.</P>
    <P>Dealing with net vacancies for last year and the estimated number for the current year, it would appear that the proposals for our building in the city of Dublin are based on a net vacancy rate of about 900 per year. On that basis, on the Minister's figure of 846 for this year, and with the net vacancies of 900, we will have available for letting in the current year 1,746 houses.  Again, on the basis of net vacancies of 900 in the coming year and on the building programme of 950 in the coming year, we will have lettings available to the number of 1,850.  That figure is, in fact, only a very little higher than the number of lettings made in the past two years when, it is admitted by everyone, there was an inadequate number of lettings and the number in need of accommodation was increasing.</P>
    <P>Looking further into the future, it is quite clear that on the housing programme of the Corporation and on the assumption that net vacancies will remain at 900 a year, that programme is not going to provide, either from old dwellings taken over or from new dwellings built, a sufficient number of houses to deal with the number on the waiting list and the number that come annually on to it.  Of course, it will be expensive to knock down the old buildings and put up modern flats but I would suggest that not one Deputy would vote against it, if it were suggested by the Minister that he was going to build houses and flats for the people, that they were going to be uneconomic with regard to the rent, that it was going to cost money to acquire the sites and compensate the people in the putting up of these flats.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there will be a Deputy who will vote against such a proposal, even though the cost of building is going to be uneconomic.  This is the only solution to our housing problem <Col N="166" /> and we have got to face up to meeting this problem.  If we regard ourselves as Christians, surely it is our Christian duty to build these houses and flats now when they are so badly wanted and not leave the building of them to the years ahead.  Surely we ought not to allow these people, who are in such urgent need of immediate housing, to wait in the appalling conditions in which they find themselves because we will not spend the money for housing? If this committee which I suggest were set up, I should like that to be one of the things it would recommend but I understand that that committee is not going to be set up.  I believe the proposal is to be voted against.  If the Minister and his officials bring forward proposals to build flats and houses for our people, even though they are going to cost the community a large sum of money, I do not think anybody will vote against it. It should be done immediately.</P>
    <P>This crisis is not one that developed in the past few months, a crisis that suddenly developed because a couple of houses fell in Fenian Street and in Bolton Street.  An attempt is being made to suggest that it developed due to the unfortunate and unforeseen weather conditions and that the Dublin Corporation then found themselves in a crisis.  In fact, this crisis has been with us for years and it is well to explain to the House how it came about.  I wish to quote some figures which have been given before but which, I think, will bear reiteration.</P>
    <P>In 1956-57, the number of new dwellings supplied by Dublin Corporation was 1,564.  In 1957-58, that number fell to 1,021 and in 1958-59, it fell to 460.  In 1959-60, it rose slightly to 505 but in 1960-61, it fell to 227. In 1961-62, it rose again to 392 and last year, the number was 643.  From 1956-57, a figure of 1,564 houses fell to 227 in 1960-61, a drastic and catastrophic decline in the building programme of the city of Dublin.  This matter of housing in Dublin is not something that has been discussed here for the first time within the past few months.  I think it is desirable to state that these matters have been before <Col N="167" /> the House regularly and have been discussed in the House regularly.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote what the Minister had to say in June, 1959, with regard to the then position of housing in the city of Dublin.  I quote from column 1383 of volume 175 in which the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The building of approximately 500 houses is in progress, tenders have been approved for a further 450 houses and the Corporation estimate that approval to tenders for about 800 dwellings will be sought this year.  The current programme, therefore, shows an upward trend on last year.</P>
    <P>That was true at the time.  The current programme for June, 1959, showed an upward trend but in the following year it declined again.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>The reassessment of housing needs in the city has received close consideration.  It was intimated by the Corporation in March last that a new panel of approximately 6,000 families was being compiled following the invitation of applications for tenancy of houses and flats.  Analysis of the new list, however, shows that the maximum net need was in the region of 4,300 families, including families of two persons only.  There are about 3,000 unfit houses to be closed, demolished or cleared within the next three to five years.  The Corporation expect to displace 2,700 families from unfit dwellings this year, which figure, added to the new panel, brings the current housing need to approximately 7,000 families.The elimination of all unfit dwellings would add to this total.  It is expected that at least 1,200 vacancies a year will continue to arise in Corporation dwellings representing 3 per cent of the housing estate.  This vacancy rate is not high having regard to the size of the estate.</P>
    <P>In 1959, it was anticipated that the need then for immediate housing was for 7,000 persons.  Notwithstanding that the decline in housing was permitted to continue and in the following <Col N="168" /> year there was a further decline to 277.  In the following year, there was a small increase, to 392.  In the following July, July, 1960, there was a further discussion and the view was expressed by the Minister that the situation was satisfactory.  In July, 1961, there was a further discussion and on that occasion there was a type of argument which we have heard frequently reiterated in a rather jocose manner by Deputy P.J. Burke that the problem of housing was really the fault of the previous Government and that the fault lay with what had happened in 1956.  That is the type of excuse we heard given here only a few minutes ago and it is worth quoting again from what the Minister said on that occasion.</P>
    <P>In volume 191, column 478, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The last four years have made a radical change in the situation, and the serious situation in which we found ourselves in the later part of 1956 and the beginning of 1957 is now gone.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's view, the effects of the mismanagement by the previous Government had gone by July, 1961. If that view is correct, there was certainly nothing to stop the Minister, or to stop his colleagues, or to stop the corporation expending further sums from the Development Fund on the building programme if it were felt it was inadequate.  I think the point is clear from the quotations I have given that it was considered all the time from 1959 onwards that in fact there was to be a slowing down in the building programme here in the city and that that slowing down was something which was being accepted and that this situation was not being regarded in any way as being a crisis one, and nowhere in the debates or in statements from official sources is it said that the corporation were not doing their job or that the housing drive was inadequate.  On the contrary, figures were produced to show that the housing drive was continuing adequately.</P>
    <P>The situation, of course, changed. The situation changed dramatically, and later in 1962, when the pressure <Col N="169" /> was developing from many sources for action to be taken, the matter was discussed on many occasions in the Dáil. Again, I wish to refer to the Official Report of the debate on 31st October, 1962, in volume 197, column 329.  The Minister was being asked, at Question Time, about the position of corporation housing.  He was being asked about the needs that remained to be satisfied, and he said:</P>
    <P>I do not think it is just a question of its being an appalling situation that this should be so.  It is apparent that there may be this long delay.  I do not think the city council of Dublin, the City Manager, the Department of Local Government, the Minister for Local Government or the Government are to be blamed for this situation, for the reason that from the Department we are and have been prepared to provide all that is essential and necessary so far as house building for Dublin Corporation and any other corporation is concerned by way of finances and what have you.</P>
    <P>You had, in October of last year, the Minister admitting the situation was grave but saying nobody was to blame &mdash;that it was not the fault of the city manager, that it was not the fault of the Department of Local Government or of the Minister or the Government that you had a situation that had developed and which he apparently accepted when he used the word &ldquo;appalling&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That was last year, before the terrible occurrences earlier this year.  In March of this year the matter was again discussed in the Dáil, as reported at column 915 of volume 200 of the Official Report.  The Minister gave the figures which I have given this evening for the rate of building by the corporation, the figures which showed the tremendous decline in the number of houses built by the corporation, and said:</P>
    <P>I would much prefer if the figures were double what they are, but there is nothing I can do.  I have helped in every way possible, but Dublin Corporation and other corporations have had difficulty in <Col N="170" /> framing their programmes.  We all know it is impossible to turn around, change your organisation and get into the production of houses when you have been practically out of production.That is the position.  I cannot do anything further about it. We provide every assistance.  I have appealed for more houses.  Further than that I cannot go.</P>
    <P>That was a <i>cri de coeur</i> from the Minister&mdash;that he had done everything he could.  I do not accept that situation.  If the Minister has not power to make a local authority build houses which he thinks they should build, then he should take that power. If the statute law in this matter is defective, then the law can be amended.  If he were not satisfied with what had been going on in Dublin since 1956 and he had not the power to alter it, then he should have taken that power, and he would not have found any opposition from these benches to making recalcitrant local authorities, if that is the case that is being made, do their jobs.</P>
    <P>Of course, I do not think that is really the situation.  I do not think the situation is really that the Corporation had dropped their housing drive and that the Minister had been trying to get the Corporation to increase their housing programme because the records do not show, until the past year, that the Minister had been endeavouring to get the Corporation to increase their housing drive and that he had failed.  On the contrary, the records show the Minister appeared to have been quite satisfied with what was happening in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Who is to blame for what has happened, who is to blame for this tragic decline in the house building programme in the city of Dublin?  There is one matter to which I must refer in answer to that question, just to get it out of the way.  It has been suggested, but nowhere officially, that there was a great flow of emigrants back from England and that these have swollen the numbers here in the housing lists and that this came as a complete surprise to the housing authorities, that it brought about a <Col N="171" /> situation which could not have been forseen.</P>
    <P>In fact, the official figures which have been given by the corporation indicate that between October, 1958, and September, 1962, there were 549 returned families housed by the corporation&mdash;an average return of a little more than 100 a year.  It is quite clear that the idea of our emigrants flowing back in unexpected numbers is not the explanation for the crisis which developed, or is it the explanation given by the city manager in his report to the corporation in September, 1962, because at page 479 of the report, referring to pressure on new housing, he says:</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, this was essentially due to the substantial drop in net vacancies and in the number of new houses becoming available.</P>
    <P>The city manager stated there were two causes for the pressure on housing in the city of Dublin: first, there was a substantial drop in the net vacancies, and secondly, a drop in the number of new houses becoming available. That, of course, is what caused the crisis.  If you drop building from the rate of 1,500 houses to 277, there is bound to be a crisis in a city like Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that a contributory cause of this crisis was the drop in the net vacancies.  Let us be clear&mdash; because this is another excuse that is given from time to time&mdash;what is involved in the question of net vacancies. These are the houses and the flats which come back to the possession of the Corporation by reason of the death of the tenants, by reason of their emigration and for one reason or another, sometimes through their getting better accommodation.  In a vast housing estate such as one has in the city of Dublin, it is of course to be expected that this vacancy rate will be at a certain level, roughly several hundred every year.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind Deputies of what the Minister said in 1957 when he referred to the net vacancy rate as being round about 1,200.  He said that this was three per cent of the total <Col N="172" /> housing estate and that this was not abnormal and it is quite clear that all the planning with regard to housing was based on the fact that there would be coming back to the corporation each year about 1,200 dwellings.  In fact, the net vacancy in 1958-59 was 1393&mdash;a bit more than what was regarded as normal.  The net vacancy in 1959-60 rose to 1,605.  The net vacancy in 1960-61&mdash;only two years ago&mdash;went back to 1,260, which is regarded as the normal figure for a housing estate of this size, and it declined last year to 856.  But, the point is that with whatever number of vacancies that are made available each year it is still absolutely necessary to keep up the housing drive because, undoubtedly, the number of these vacancies will change from year to year.  It is impossible to get any accurate forecast of what they are going to be and if you budget for a figure of around 1,200 a year you do not then start declining building because you are going to get that number.</P>
    <P>The blame for what has happened, I think, must rest on the Government. I do not accept the view which is being stated in Deputy Dunne's motion that the Housing Committee is to blame or that any member of the corporation is to blame, because I recall what the whole basis of this Government's economic programme was.  The whole basis for the Government's economic programme since November, 1958 was that there would be a decline in social capital investment in the State and there has been&mdash;and in paragraph 7 of the White Paper, <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> it is stated:</P>
    <P>...The social capital investment of past years has given us an &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; of housing, hospitals, communications, etc., which is equal (in some respects, perhaps, superior) to that of comparable countries. What is now required is a greater emphasis on productive expenditure which, by increasing national output &mdash;particularly of goods capable of meeting competition in export markets&mdash;will enable full advantage to be taken of that infrastructure and in due course make possible and, <Col N="173" /> indeed, necessitate its further extension.The expected decline in social capital expenditure in the coming years will afford an opportunity&mdash; and underlines the necessity&mdash;of switching resources to productive purposes.</P>
    <P>If Deputies turn to the table at the back of this White Paper <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, they will see that it was anticipated as part of the 1958 economic programme that expenditure on building and construction, including houses, sanitary services and schools, would decline.</P>
    <P>I say that the Government set out deliberately to bring about a decline in social capital investment.  There may be economic reasons for doing that.  Of course, economists can put forward reasons for doing that.  I do not acceept it but I do not think it is just a mere coincidence that it was part of the economic programme of this Government that there would be a decline in social capital investment and for those years, from 1958, the Dublin housing programme declined.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am wrong.  Perhaps the Minister did not want this to happen. I do not know.  If he did not want this to happen he should have taken the powers and I feel that the answer lies in the fact that what was happening here in Dublin was part of the Government's economic programme and that the people of this country have been affected by it.</P>
    <P>I have stated this, Sir, because it is quite clear that this motion is not going to be accepted by the Minister. The Minister made a public statement which was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of October 5th of this year in which he said that the suggestion that a committee of inquiry be established was one that did not appeal to him for the good reason that such a procedure would delay rather than hasten the solution to problems which the Department of Local Government is considering.He has suggested that a committee of this House which would be charged with the task of reporting within three months was going to delay the housing programme, to delay in some way the Department of Local Government.  If I am wrong in what I have said and if, in fact, the responsibility for what has <Col N="174" /> happened does not lie on the Minister or the Government but lies on the corporation or if, in fact, the Minister was right when he said a few months ago that it was nobody's fault, that you could not blame the City Manager or the City Council or him or the Government, this committee would be charged with finding out where the truth was.  I can be left only with the conclusion that the Minister is afraid to face what would come out of a committee of inquiry if the only reason given is that this committee will hold up the housing drive.  That argument does not hold water when it is accepted by the drafters of this motion that the committee must report within three months.</P>
    <P>This, as I have said at the outset, is a great human, social problem with which we are dealing.  The public that so obviously is adversely affected by what has happened, the people living in these dreadfully overcrowded conditions, are not very much concerned with whether it was Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil or an inter-Party Government or a Fianna Fáil Government that was responsible or whether it was the City Manager or the Housing Committee.  All that they know is that they are living in appalling conditions, which is breaking up their families, which is ruining their health.  We are all involved in this.  Politicians are involved in this as a class because these people do not care who is to blame.  All they know is that they are suffering.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to try to do something about it.  We have a duty to try to see that what has happened in the past will not happen again, that the present situation will be alleviated as quickly and as speedily as possible, without regard to cost.  The motion which we have suggested is a way of doing that.</P>

      <P>I made a claim here on a former occasion that only three people knew much about the housing position in Dublin Corporation.  I said that they were Deputy Barron, Deputy Timmons and myself.  I still hold that view because I have here a record of the attendances of members of the Housing Committee for the past eight <Col N="175" /> years.  I asked Mr. Molloy, the Principal Officer, for the attendances.  I have here for the five years 1955-60 a record of the attendances.  They show that Sherwin had 136 attendances.  That is the highest number of attendances in that five years; Larkin, 133, he comes next&mdash;Moore of Fianna Fáil comes third&mdash;128; Lemass, Fianna Fáil, 125; Ellis, Fianna Fáil, 121 and Timmons, Fianna Fáil, 118. There is no Fine Gael member in that list.  I am quoting here the official lists and I can be taken up in the Corporation.I cannot make a false statement because what I say will appear in the Dáil Reports and any person who wishes may ask a question and will get an answer.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with that. I have figures here for attendance at meetings of the Housing Committee during the past three years.  There was a tie between Deputy Barron and Deputy Sherwin with 71 attendances out of 76; Larkin, 69 attendances; Moore (Fianna Fáil), 63; Timmons (Fianna Fáil), 62; Hughes (Fianna Fáil), 61; Keebles (Fianna Fáil), 58. None of the Deputies over there is in the first six for the past three years. Deputy Ryan is very quick at asking questions.  He is a good lawyer but lawyers lie when it suits them.  I am fond of biography and I have been reading the life of Father Ronald Knox.  He had the facility of a lawyer and he once spoke for his own motion and then against it and did as well on each.  It is all right for these lawyers <Col N="176" /> to talk on these matters but when a man like me who lives with the thing day by day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to know anything, there was no shortage of houses.  It was the lack of flats that was our trouble, not the lack of houses.  I want to quote from page 269 of the municipal minutes for 1960:</P>
      <P>The number of transfers demanded by tenants out of houses in Ballyfermot and Finglas was 655 from Ballyfermot and 233 from Finglas.</P>
      <P>In spite of that number wanting to get into the city in 1960, we were told we should have been building more houses.  In the same year, two-thirds of all the people who were offered houses refused to take them.  It was a flat or nothing.  They remained in their houses in Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot get flats. Sites have to be acquired.  For the Deputy's information, the position would not be improved by building flats because very often twice as many people have to be moved off the site. The real advantage is houses because they are being built on virgin ground but people would not take the houses. In the recent emergency, half of the people who were offered a house said: &ldquo;No; we will sit in the street&rdquo; and as regards all the people who were in the newspapers about whom the previous speaker was worrying about, they were people who had been offered houses and would not take them because they wanted flats.  The vacancy rate in regard to houses was so heavy that the Committee decided it was unwise to build any more houses.  I wish to quote a question asked by Deputy Ryan.  Deputy Ryan had no comment to make in 1960 about the shortage of houses.  In 1960 and 1961, there <Col N="177" /> were no wise guys asking: Why are you not building houses?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan's main concern in 1960 was the houses lying idle.  What case could you make for building houses in 1960 if Deputy Ryan was crying about all the houses lying idle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They would not take them.  I went through the minutes for 1960 and there is not a question by any member of the Fine Gael Party or any other Party demanding that we should build more houses anywhere. Even Peadar Cowan who invented questions did not ask one.  He only got wise in 1962.  This is Deputy Ryan's question at page 270 of the 1960 minutes:</P>
      <P>To ask the City Manager to state the number of Corporation tenant houses or flats vacant for any reason whatsoever on the first day of each of the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>The answer was:</P>
      <P>The information requested is not readily available as no records are kept showing the number of houses or flats vacant on any particular day.  A count has been made of the number of houses and flats vacant on the 28th September, 1960. The number is 117.</P>
      <P>That was the position in 1960: 117 houses lying idle in one day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Point three of one per cent of the total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, we were faced with demands for the repair of houses which were lying idle and being wrecked.  No one said we should build more houses.  Deputy Barron put down a motion that we should build no more on the perimeter and that only flats should be built.  As I say, there were no wise guys in 1959, 1960 or 1961.  They only came along, as they always do, when there was a calamity.  Wise guys love calamities. They love a crisis: &ldquo;Give us houses falling down; give us floods; give us <Col N="178" /> poverty&mdash;we will get votes now.&rdquo; These people are only wise guys when something happens but they were not wise at the time they alleged we should have had wisdom.  They had no wisdom either.</P>
      <P>The fact is that I attended a meeting in 1959 when it was decided, on a recommendation by the City Manager, that we should go slow, that the people were refusing houses and that the houses were lying idle, that we should judge the number of houses needed according to the increase in the vacancy rate because a vacant house is as good as a new house.  That was the general feeling in the Corporation Housing Committee at that time.  There were no wise guys then.  The only concern of Deputy Ryan was that so many houses were lying idle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all a question of how you look at this problem.  In 1959 and 1960, we were also in the position of being able to house people in two's and three's, families of three, or people in ill-health.  It goes to prove that there was no problem.  How could there have been a problem when married couples with one child were being housed, or if people were refusing houses, or if there were 1,600 vacancies, vacancies that would continue; when the ratepayers were complaining about vandalism and the cost of maintaining these idle houses of which there were 117?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of that knowledge, anybody who wanted to go on building houses would have <Col N="179" /> needed to get his head examined.  With the advice available to us and on the facts I have presented, we decided to build flats and to stop building houses. The people did not want houses; they wanted flats.  But it takes up to four years to build flats.  You can build houses in two years but flats require four years because you cannot get sites.  You have to decide on an area and put a compulsory purchase order on it.  There is a vested interest and that will mean compensation.  The Minister has to consider the compensation end of it because he does not know whether it will be too expensive or not.  Then you have to give the people time to get off the site.  When you count the number of tenants, you will probably find, as we usually do, that there are 80 but that you will only be able to build flats for 60 and you end up on the wrong side.  You do not solve the housing problem with flats but we had to do what the public demanded.  They wanted flats or nothing.</P>
      <P>As everyone knows, the man who caused a lot of the publicity in Jervis Street some time ago, was offered a house but he would not take it.  Half of the people who were put out would not take houses; they wanted flats. Where was the crisis in 1959 and 1960 when those on the waiting list in two's and three's said: &ldquo;No, we will stay where we are.  We will wait until we get a flat?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To return to the matter of the houses which collapsed.  I will admit there was a problem regarding flats but there was no problem regarding houses.  I am the person who constantly agitated on the Housing Committee for the building of flats for old people, singleroom flats.  I have been arguing for five years but I had the &ldquo;housing lobby&rdquo; against me, as distinct from the &ldquo;flats lobby&rdquo;.  They wanted also, to build big flats, but I was in favour of small flats.  Deputy Barron is a witness to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may interest the House to know that on the Friday before the houses fell I spoke for half an hour on the need for housing old, single people who were in the condemned houses. <Col N="180" /> I pointed out that there was grave danger; I explained how the houses came to be there, because the old people could not be housed and could not be thrown out on the street.  The manager admitted that I was right and said he would bring in a report.  This was before anything happened.  I was right, as I believe I am always right. My conscience tells me I am right and I do not give a damn about anybody.That is why I could stand up to all the terrorism of the past few months.</P>
    <P>I was the only one who went to the enquiry.  It was stated that anyone who wished to do so could give evidence.  I was the only public representative who had the nerve to go along.  I had the facts and the evidence. It was not like speaking in this House where you can put up any yarn you like.  I gave my evidence before the housing authority, represented by senior counsel.  They would have crossexamined me but they did not. The case I made was that they were at fault for not building flats for old people.  I made the case which I made for five years, that if they had built flats for old people, then those houses would have been empty and could have been demolished.  The houses were left there; the years went by and the owners would not spend a nickel on them because they were only getting money from perhaps two or three people in them.</P>
    <P>The last speaker wanted to have a crack not at the Corporation but at Local Government.  Deputy Dunne wants to have a crack at the Corporation, which is a different thing altogether. An extraordinary thing about Deputy Dunne is that he would like to abolish the Housing Committee. Were it not for the Housing Committee, all the rents of the 40,000 tenants would have jumped in the past few years.  It was the Housing Committee which blocked any attempt by the manager to increase the rents. Only by one vote, and again it was my vote, such an attempt was stopped. Half of those present wanted to put up the rents and half of them did not.  I was there as usual, always present, and it was my vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the affairs of the Corporation were run by some officials or by commissioners, the people would have no protection; there would be no Housing Committee and there would be no veto.  Deputy Dunne wants to do away with this veto which year after year has prevented the rents of Corporation tenants being increased. Deputy Barron knows that also.  If we were not there, every tenant would be paying 5/- to 15/- a week more.  As I said, if there was any problem at all, it was really the lack of flat building, especially small flats for old people.</P>

      <P>Let us bring our minds back to the reasons why we decided to stall on the building of houses on the outskirts of the city.  It is only on the outskirts that we have ground.  The big moan was that the poor people were stuck out on the outskirts of the city and that they found the bus fares very heavy.  Then there were differential rents.  There was not a single word throughout the years up to 1962.  Everyone got wise in 1962: there was a bit of a crisis and there were votes knocking around. Deputy Costello is a bit cute there.  He tried to make little of the point made by me some time ago about the number of people coming back from Britain which was the cause of the crisis.  He said that, in all, only 500 came back in the last few years.  But he does not give us an up-to-date report.  He puts it back a year: that is an old gag.  It is quite possible that in the past year the number could have doubled, but, if it did, a cute guy would let a year slip and make the argument nicer for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is that over 900 returned: that is a big difference from 500.  In the last year, especially early in the <Col N="182" /> year, scores per week came back. That has a lot to do with it because they were all families and they had to get priority.  A very large number of them were Corporation tenants.  The vacancy rate has a lot to do with this business.  Last year, it was only about 550.  Again, Deputy Costello said something wrong there.  He quoted the Minister for Local Government&mdash;but I do not accept it&mdash;that the average vacancy rate in a big estate is about 1,200.  No: proof of it is that it was only about 550 last year and only a little more in the previous year.  The average is 600 and it is caused through deaths and a certain percentage going to Britain.</P>
    <P>However, as I said, there was a trementous drop which was gradual.  It took place over two or three years.  In 1960, we were faced with an increasing vacancy rate which jumped 200 or 300 from 1959.  What person in his senses in 1960 would say; &ldquo;Now, we shall start building again&rdquo;?  It was going up to 1,000 or 800.  Late in 1961, it began to drop a bit.  Then, when we saw that happening, in 1962 we decided that as the vacancy rate was dropping, we would immediately get going again.  It was like the market&mdash; small goods dearer and a big lot of goods cheap.</P>
    <P>We did the commonsense thing and what any intelligent person would do. But you cannot just get going from say, 300 or 400 dwellings to 1,000 in a year: how could you?  As I said, it takes two years.  You must get the site. You must have sketch plans and they must be approved and you must have working plans.  The quantity surveyor must come along and estimate what it will cost.  You must advertise and do all sorts of things.  Then you have to bond people to make certain they will not crash, as happened in 1956, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is on record that 1,100 building workers were sacked in 1956 and most of them went to Britain.  It takes two or three years and therefore we have jumped 300 or 400 per cent since.  We cannot do a lot more than than.  In the recent crisis, we did things we do not generally do.  We reduced the planning period.  We offered contracts <Col N="183" /> to builders who were building a similar type of block without any question of advertising, and so on.  We cut the planning period by three or four months.  That was an important advance to meet the crisis.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, the Minister has approved of 100 caravans to meet this problem which I have in mind and which I agreed to.  If the Housing Committee can be charged with anything it is that they did not build for single old people in the past few years. They can be accused of that and they are guilty of that.  I challenged them and I gave evidence at the Housing Committee and they did not dispute it. But nobody else gave evidence because they would not know what they were talking about.  Deputy Dunne was not there to give evidence&mdash;what would he talk about?  He would talk through his hat and the wise guys there, with everything at their finger-tips, would immediately ask questions of him and make a fool of him.</P>
    <P>Politicians believe there are an awful lot of chumps among the public.  Unfortunately, there are.  You will always have lies in politics because they are more open to be collared by a lie than by the truth&mdash;any lie you like to tell to please them.  If you tell them the truth, they will say: &ldquo;Never again&rdquo;.  That is what you get.  That is why all this sort of stuff is thrown across the floor of the House&mdash;because nobody is crossexamining them.  If I had the power to crossexamine people here, I would make monkeys out of them but I will not be allowed to crossexamine.</P>
    <P>In this House, you are given freedom to talk tripe, to slander people, and so on, as they slandered me a few months ago but they did not do it outside the House.  I watched every newspaper to see if some of those guys were reported as saying one little word &mdash;but no.  It is safe to say what you like in here.  The case I make is that the allegations are groundless, that there was no cause for complaint and therefore the Corporation were not at fault.  Furthermore, it has nothing to do with the Government.  I am not aware that the Government have ever held up any schemes.  I am aware that <Col N="184" /> they might hold up a flat scheme because of the cost, and so on.  However, flats were not the answer to the problem, although flats were what people wanted.</P>
    <P>I am an Independent in this House. I do not like throwing bricks at the Opposition.  Do not think that because I vote with the Government, I am necessarily prejudiced against the Opposition&mdash;I am not.  I believe that I voted for the country when I voted for the Government.  The question of prejudice one way or another does not arise at all with me.</P>

      <P>Do not blame me for the interruptions.  It is very difficult to speak when interrupted.  I have such a mountain of knowledge of this thing that I do not need to think my case out.  My case is all in my brain.  I do not like throwing bricks but, for my own satisfaction, I asked for the complete attendance at the Housing Committee for the past eight years.  I was amazed at the information I received. Here is one for you.  If only a few houses were built, as you say, in 1961, do you know that for the first six months of 1960 two of the three Fine Gael representatives on the Housing Committee did not attend any meetings and one attended three out of nine meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> If houses were to be built at the tail end of 1961, they would have had to be planned early in 1960.  It takes about two years.  There was a municipal election in June, 1960.  If houses were to be built in 1961 and if we were to meet our housing programme, they would want to have been planned early in 1960.  What are you talking about?  Two of the three Fine Gael representatives on the Housing Committee did not attend any meeting for the first six months of 1960 and the third person attended three meetings.</P>
    <P>If you do not attend a Housing Committee consistently, you lose grasp. You have always to be there in order to know what you are talking about. <Col N="186" /> Let us be candid.  The Opposition do not know what they are talking about, any more than does Deputy Dunne who is not a member of the Housing Committee.  He seems a bit prejudiced or perhaps he thinks it is popular to say certain things.  It is popular: I know the people.  Their outlook is: &ldquo;I am as much entitled to a house as is the man with ten children.  Every man for himself.&rdquo;  The art of politics is to please everyone.</P>
    <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again.</P>

    <P>3.  The excess of Col. (2) over Col. (3) in Table I represents charges for outpatient specialist services.</P>
    <P>4.  It should be appreciated that the figures in Table II relate only to Section 231A of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, as amended.  They do not include payments in respect of Wards of Court, amounting to £39,000 a year, approximately, or to receipts amounting to £137,000 a year approximately under Section 8 (1) of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960 out of old age pensions payable in respect of patients.</P>

      <P>The compilation of figures on the lines requested in respect of the early years mentioned in the question would involve an amount of work and expense which, it is considered, would not be justified.  Moreover, the calculation of comprehensive figures for those years would not be feasible due to the circumstances then prevailing.</P>
      <P>The total expenditure on tuberculosis services in respect of the year 1962/63 was £1,986,200 which represents 0.31% of the gross national product for the year.  Disability benefit paid under the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1963, to persons suffering from tuberculosis has not been included in the above total, as it is not possible for the Department of Social Welfare to identify from its records payments in respect of disability attributable to specific diseases.</P>

      <P>The following are the replies to the Deputy's queries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) I understand from the National Mass-Radiography Association, who <Col N="57" /> provide the services for all health authorities, except Cork, that at present they employ seven X-ray plants.  The country is divided into four separate regions for the purposes of the service, viz.  North West Region, South West Region, South East Region and Eastern Region, to each of which a mobile unit is assigned.  Another two units provide a comprehensive service for Dublin City and the remaining unit is engaged entirely on community surveys throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Cork Health Authority do not participate in the national arrangements as they have their own mobile X-ray plant.</P>
    <P>(b)  A mass-radiography service provided by the Dublin Corporation X-rayed 12,611 persons in 1949.  A mobile mass-radiography unit of the Cork County Council went into operation in 1949.  The number of persons examined by this unit in the calendar year 1949 is not available but a total of 10,928 persons were examined during the year ended 31/3/1950.  The National Mass-Radiography Association was not in existence in 1949.</P>
    <P>The total number of persons examined by the National Mass-Radiography Association in 1959 and 1962 were 303,917 and 284,737, respectively.Corresponding figures in respect of the Cork unit were: 15,863 and 19,208.</P>
    <P>(c)  The number of new cases of tuberculosis diagnosed was 7,552 in 1949, 4,005 in 1959 and 2,820 in 1962.</P>

    <P>Since 1st August, 1961, relevant transactions have been recorded by the Land Commission in accordance with the provisions of sections 33, 34 and 35 of the Finance Act, 1961.  Since that date, more than 2 years ago, 176 transactions, involving 14,434 acres, have been recorded, the aggregate consideration amounting to £876,687. Stamp duty at the 25 per cent rate, <Col N="66" /> paid on this amount, would represent £219,172.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the records of the Revenue Commissioners do not show any assessment of duty at the 25 per cent rate outstanding at present.</P>
