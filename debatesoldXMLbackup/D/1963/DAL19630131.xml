    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for a Grant (Grant-in-Aid) to An Chomhairle Ealaíon (No. 9 of 1951).</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Two of the Deputies who spoke yesterday&mdash;Deputy J. A. Costello and Deputy A. Barry&mdash; appeared to be slightly misinformed regarding the reports published by An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  In fact, a printed report is published every year which is not unattractive in form although I think the Comhairle hope to improve its appearance.  It has not yet been issued this year because of some trouble with the printers.  The practice of publishing a stencilled report, to which the Deputies referred, was adopted in response to a request from that side of the House to have available to Deputies the material of the report at the time when the Estimate of the Comhairle would normally be taken and to avoid withholding it until the audited accounts of the Comhairle could also be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach arrange to have the report of An Chomhairle Ealaíon circulated to Deputies and Senators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure it is not done.  I shall see if it can be done. I think Deputy J. A. Costello was misled by the fact that the Estimate for the Comhairle is being taken now rather than six months earlier.  In fact, the stencilled report to which he <Col N="751" /> referred was published on 21st June last year which, as it related to the period ending 31st March, 1962 did not involve any undue delay.</P>
      <P>In regard to money, while it is true that I said last year that An Chomhairle Ealaíon had not asked for any more, I did not want to misrepresent their interest in getting more.  In fact, last year, they carried over a balance of some £9,500 into the present financial year.  That year was the first in which they had got the increased grant and their plans for spending it had not been developed.  There is, of course, probably no limit to the amount of money that could usefully and beneficially be expended upon the activities for which the Comhairle is responsible.  Certain consideration is being given at present to the possibility of amending or extending the functions of the Comhairle, which may also involve some change in their financial appropriation.</P>
      <P>Much of the discussion last evening related to industrial design.  It is true that An Chomhairle Ealaíon was given responsibility for promoting interest in industrial design in the Act which set them up.  At that time, although the Department of Industry and Commerce had made various attempts to interest industrialists in the importance of design, there was no other State body which had functions in the matter or money to spend in promoting interest in design or in improving the standards of industrial designs. Nevertheless, I think it was a mistake to associate solely industrial design with An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>
      <P>Deputy J. A. Costello referred to the fact that interest in the importance of design was not developing amongst industrialists at the time when he was Taoiseach.  I believe that can largely be attributed to the fact that through An Chomhairle Ealaíon industrial design was presented to business people as an arty matter, whereas, in fact, it is an entirely commercial matter.  Consequently, therefore, I asked Córas Tráchtála to take an interest in the improvement of industrial design and in the commercial importance of so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was Córas Tráchtála which <Col N="752" /> arranged for and published the report of the Scandinavian experts.  That report&mdash;whatever value one might attach to the recommendations in it, and I would not agree with all of them &mdash;did, by its very controversial character, promote greater interest in industrial design, by reason of the discussion it engendered, than all the exhortations of Ministers and Art Councils and others had succeeded in doing up to that.</P>
    <P>Training for design&mdash;taking Irish men and women and giving them the training to enable them to become competent industrial designers&mdash;is an educational matter.  It is a function of our educational system and is a responsibility of the Minister for Education.  There is at the present time some overlapping between An Chomhairle Ealaíon, Córas Tráchtála and the Department of Education in this matter and perhaps even some tendency towards empire-building. However, I should not think any harm has been done yet but if it should produce complications, then it might be necessary to define more precisely the functions of each body in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy A. Barry was induced to suggest here last evening, having heard Deputy Costello, that Cork has a grievance in respect of the composition of the Council of An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  The Director of the Comhairle is a Corkman; as usual, a Corkman occupies the key position.  Deputy Costello urged that the Comhairle should be entitled to express its opinion freely upon matters which come within its sphere of activity.  So far as I know, they have done so.  They have not infrequently been asked by Government Departments for their opinion on particular projects or to nominate persons to whom specific tasks should be entrusted.  While they are free to express their opinion, it would be most undesirable that they should be set up in any sense as censors in matters of art.  If they are free to express their opinion, then we must be free and everybody else must be free to disagree with their opinion.  In my view, they have often given some bad advice but nevertheless their advice, when offered, <Col N="753" /> must be considered.  It is true to say, as agreed by all the Deputies who spoke here yesterday, that the activities which the Comhairle has sponsored and financed through its grants are highly beneficial and indeed none of us would dislike to see a further extension of its activities when it becomes possible to add to the resources available for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach one question?  Does the jurisdiction of An Chomhairle Ealaíon extend to the possibility of helping learned bodies to carry out useful works? I have particularly in mind the preparation of the Irish dictionary by the Academy.  Is it free to the Comhairle to make a grant from its resources to carry on that work where the moneys available to the Academy are not sufficient to enable it to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to answer that question without notice but I should say not.  The preparation of an Irish dictionary would be more a matter of education than art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that possibility, but perhaps the Taoiseach would look into this question, as I believe the work on the Academy dictionary, which is a very valuable and important work, is at present not moving as fast as it could move because there is not sufficient money to pay the printers.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Bills have been generally welcomed, there were some minor criticisms not so much of the Bills themselves as of our industrial grants legislation that I think were based on false premises. One I referred to last night was a criticism by Deputy Esmonde that our Undeveloped Areas Act legislation had failed utterly.  I said that was very far from the truth.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer the House to the last statutory report and accounts of Foras Tionscal.  No doubt many Deputies have read these reports and they give a complete picture from the beginning of the operation of these two Acts as well as a closer account of the preceding year's grants and the identify of the firms to whom grants were made available.</P>
      <P>Taking the Undeveloped Areas Acts first, the amount of grants approved from the beginning up to the end of March, 1962, was £6,128,000.  I do not think it is necessary to refer to the amounts paid and the amounts outstanding because the amounts outstanding will be paid in due course, according as certain developments take place within the particular industries. Putting that amount of total grants against the amounts of total capital involved in the industries concerned, £15,000,000, and further against the total number of people estimated to be employed, 10,450, gives a fair indication of the reasonable success&mdash;and I would not claim any more than that for it&mdash;of this legislation as affecting the undeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the Industrial Grants Act which was first introduced in 1956 and amended and extended on a number of occasions since, the amount of grants approved in that case were £4,500,000 up to the end of March, 1962, against a total capital investment of £20.2 million, involving an employment potential of 11,500 people. Again, I suggest that is an indication <Col N="755" /> of the fair measure of the success of the industrial grants legislation.</P>
    <P>Taking the two together, the total number of grant applications approved was 172, involving in grants £10.5 million, and in total capital invested £35.3 million, the total potential employment being 21,870 workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what employment figures were realised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently a survey of the number of firms in undeveloped areas was carried out by Foras Tionscal.  It was not comprehensive. Deputies will realise that an assessment of the realisation of employment potential can never be comprehensive because grants legislation, the injection of grants and the expansion of a particular industry, is something that is not static.  Therefore, there will always be, on the one hand, a greater amount of money approved than is actually paid out and, on the other hand, a lesser number actually employed at any given time than the total maximum potential of the industries aided by grants.</P>
      <P>Taking the limitation of this sample survey and the limitation on getting close figures in that respect, this survey to which I have referred, showed that the actual employment amounted to 93 per cent of the employment forecast. Again, I think that gives a good indication that the estimates by the proposers, accepted by Foras Tionscal in the giving of grants, have been reasonably close and reasonably satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was it possible to carry out a spot check only?  One would imagine that the number employed could be found out reasonably quickly on the telephone.  How many industries are there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 172.  As I tried to explain, the potential employment figures are figures which apply when a particular industry is in full production, and this attainment of full production is a sliding business.  It is <Col N="756" /> never static because new grants are being given all the time.  With the attainment of full production in one industry in 1965 and in another in 1967, and so on, one could never get&mdash; or be expected to get&mdash;a firm figure in that respect at any given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not mean that 93 per cent. of the potential has been realised.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Another criticism we hear from time to time is that no Irish need apply, that the grants are available only to foreigners.  I was glad to hear a number of Deputies refuting that suggestion.  Again, I would refer to the results that can be clearly seen. I have denied it several times myself and there is no truth whatever in or no foundation whatever for that criticism.</P>
      <P>Under the Industrial Grants Act, of the 67 grants approved, the number of promotions sponsored by foreign promoters was 33; the number set up by foreign promoters with Irish participation was six; and the number set up by Irish promoters was 28.  Again, that gives a fairly clear indication that there is no truth whatever in the suggestion that foreigners are preferred to Irish promoters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am not disturbing the Minister by interrupting him, but I said to the House what the Minister has just said, and within a fortnight Foras Tionscal told me, with <Col N="757" /> perfect courtesy, that they had an obligation to consider an enterprise with foreign participation in priority to all Irish enterprises who should properly go to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I suggested to the Minister that that regulation should be cancelled because it means that Irish enterprise feels it is getting a run around, whereas when there is foreign participation Foras Tionscal will take complete charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing Foras Tionscal with the Industrial Development Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the giving of grants is concerned, Foras Tionscal is the granting board and it has no brief whatever in that respect except to examine every project on its merits and allocate grants for them.  So far as internal promoters are concerned, certainly the industries branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce deals with them; so there is that slight juxtaposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can ask it later, if he does not mind.  I have given the respective figures for Irish and foreign promoters under the <Col N="758" /> Industrial Grants Act.  I want to refer now to the proportions under the Undeveloped Areas Act and the House will see again that this suggestion is unfounded.  Of the 123 promoters assisted by grants under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 59 were set up by foreign promoters; six by foreign promoters with Irish participation; and 58 by Irish promoters, that is, a total of 123.  I think those figures clearly give the lie to any suggestion that there is a bias in the grants on the side of foreigners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I could ask my question now.  Can the Minister break down the £10,000,000 odd that has been allocated for the assistance of industry and say what in fact had been notified to those foreigners who established industries, to Irish people who established industries, and to the combination of both?</P>

      <P>It could be worked out all right from the annual returns, or perhaps it could not, as the firms are named but the origin may not be named.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with another point that has been raised to the effect that small undertakings are not considered.  &ldquo;Small undertakings&rdquo; can have a number of different meanings. From time to time, applications are <Col N="759" /> received from people who have small undertakings, like joinery works, in country towns.  They want to make doors, windowframes and kitchen furniture and these are not assisted because I am sure that there is hardly a village, or certainly a small country town, that has not such an industry already established with the aid of whatever capital the proprietor was able to get himself.  There are many other such small activities, the products of which are being well catered for by existing manufacturers, and with products that can only go on to the home market I do not think it could be justified that the people who promoted these small undertakings themselves, out of their own resources, should have set up against them competitors in that limited market sponsored by State grants.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy yesterday referred to a small undertaking as one involving a capital of £50,000 to £100,000.  Taking roughly the ratio between the grants and the capital involved in firms as perhaps between 30 to 50, then of the 172 aided industries I mentioned, the grants allocated to 108 of them have been under £50,000 and of those 108, 62 received grants under £20,000.  If Deputies refer to the latest report, they will see that there are in fact set out grant allocations which are comparatively small and one can only assume that the purpose is to assist certain small industries throughout the country.  Again, I want to say that because an industry is small, it is no bar to its qualifications for a grant, as long as the over-all qualification is satisfied that it is of a reasonably permanent nature, creates new employment and does not displace existing employment in other areas.</P>

      <P>I just want to make another point in a general way.  Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Norton never miss an opportunity in a debate such as this to remind the Taoiseach of what he said when the 1956 Industrial Grants Act was being passed.  Other Deputies take up that theme and enlarge on it and suggest that now when a Bill like this comes before the House, it shows a change of heart on the part of Fianna Fáil.  It is true that the Taoiseach was critical of the 1956 Act but the 1956 Act was a very limited instrument and in practice, it turned out to be not very effective.  A number of grants were given under it but the Act was duly amended on, I think, no less than two occasions between then and now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the first breakthrough, let us call it, from the undeveloped areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this breakthrough idea has been developed to the point that industrial grants generally were the conception of 1956&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about industrial grants generally.  Deputy Donegan came into the House the night before last and said that 1956 was the first time that industrial grants were given in this country.  I tried to correct him but he literally shouted me down.  He did not want to hear the truth and I want to record it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 1952 saw the passing of the Undeveloped Areas Act and the 1956 Act was perhaps a natural consequence of applying limited grants to the rest of the country.  Both of these have continued in existence since then. They have been amended and extended as occasion demanded and as practice dictated.  Deputy Donegan also suggested that nothing was done to ease the strictures of the Control of Manufactures Acts of 1932 and 1934 until, he said himself, the tax concessions on <Col N="761" /> exports, or profits derived from new exports, were given by Deputy Sweetman when he was Minister for Finance.  That was not in any way an easement of whatever strictures were involved in the Control of Manufactures Acts but the Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Act, passed in 1958, was, and many of the new exporting firms with foreign participation have been operating here under that 1958 Act which facilitated their coming in.  As long as they export, taking one year with another, 90 per cent. of each of their products then the Control of Manufactures Act does not apply to them.</P>
    <P>I know that most Deputies know all about this but when you hear a Deputy like Deputy Donegan, who sits on the Fine Gael Front Bench, making these statements and asserting them as facts, one wonders whether it is brash politics or whether it is his belief.  In any event, it is better to have these things put on record.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish suggested that nothing was being done about the adaptation of industry for freer trade conditions. Deputy Corish said that there was no evidence that the Government are doing anything to encourage private industry to fit themselves for freer trade conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;apart from what the Government were doing by way of legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will accept that the Deputy qualified it.  Deputy Norton asked the same question, possibly in more detail.  The Deputy forgets, first of all, that the Committee on Industrial Organisation was set up by the Government.  Under it, survey teams were sent to review a number of industries and they continue to carry out these reviews.  The CIO made four interim reports.  The first one referred to the need for assistance to industry to adapt and re-equip themselves for the new conditions.  In the course of that report, which incidentally was completely adopted by the Government in a matter of days, they suggested <Col N="762" /> that loans free of interest and the repayment of capital for a period of five years should be made available. The Government accepted that recommendation entirely but went further and provided&mdash;I should say made provision, in case &ldquo;provided&rdquo; might have a certain meaning&mdash;for a grant of 25 per cent. of the cost of readaptation or re-equipment, should the industrialists so desire.</P>
      <P>These are two significant things that were done: the loan and taxation provisions which were recommended and adopted and the grants provision which is inserted in these two Bills, which was not recommended but put in as something extra by the Government.</P>
      <P>As well as that, the Interim Reports of the CIO suggested the desirability of setting up adaptation councils both in industry and in labour, in order to review certain industries, on the one hand, and on the other hand, to review what trade unions might do to help readapt their members, where necessary.  That suggestion was adopted and the Government immediately said that whatever financial provision would be reasonable would be made available by the Government.</P>
      <P>In addition, I announced early in the autumn the setting up of the Industrial Reorganisation Branch in my Department with an assistant secretary and very senior officers under him, whose sole function would be to ensure that the CIO survey teams' reports were properly applied by the firms concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister can tell us a little more about that, we might be more reassured that something was being done as far as private enterprise or industry itself is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was announced already that the linen, cotton and rayon group had set up an adaptation council.  The Industrial Reorganisation Branch have been working in close consultation with them ever since.  The motor assembly group has set up an Industry Committee and the Industrial Reorganisation Branch have been in contact not only with that <Col N="763" /> Industry Committee but with each individual motor assembler and has had discussions and there will be factory visits to see to what extent the proposals I made for entering into new lines of production can be carried out, which, again, will be facilitated by direct Government action of enabling motor firms to bring in assembled cars so that their distribution plans will not be upset while their new production lines are being developed.</P>
      <P>There is another branch of motor assembly, the vehicle building or body building, which will continue in any case because there are many firms in Dublin and other parts of the country that specialise in building special bodies for specific purposes and it is a significant part of this motor assembly business.  The Industrial Reorganisation Branch have been in contact with them and with, I think, almost every other group of firms engaged in industry in the country.  It is pursuing its job most energetically and I am being kept informed of progress as it takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister at this stage say whether there has been any evidence of any response from those now engaged in the motor assembly business and if they intend to do anything in order to try to maintain employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to the Deputy, in reply to a Parliamentary Question last week, these things cannot be done in a few days.  The motor assembly report came out early this month and the Government's announcement about assisting assemblers to go into alternative lines of production was made simultaneously.  The firms were contacted.  The Industry Committee of the motor assembly business was contacted and it is really a matter of only two weeks or so since work could have commenced on this idea, so that it is unreasonable, I suggest, to expect that results could be shown in such a short period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may refer again to adaptation plans, I want to make it clear that the provision we are making here, this 25 per cent. grant for readaptation and re-equipment, is not going to be a nostrum for all the day-to-day ills of an industry.  First of all, it must be shown, in order to qualify for these grants, that the industry is going to be more competitive in free trade conditions and that it is necessary to re-equip in order to achieve that greater degree of competitiveness. Applications for small sums which clearly could do nothing to increase the competitiveness of an industry in free trade conditions are not the type that will be considered under this legislation and, similarly, I do not think it can be expected that applications by big firms for replacement of, or addition to, plant or equipment which would in the ordinary way be provided for out of reserves or out of their own resources otherwise, should be acceded to, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would he have difficulty in getting 25 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="765" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us the conditions under which he will get it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Between these two extremes&mdash;the small grant for something that could not add anything to the competitiveness of a firm, and the large concern which could be expected to replace equipment in the ordinary way out of their own resources if they have reasonable reserves&mdash;there is plenty of room for giving the type of assistance we are providing under this Bill.  Deputy Corish has asked on a number of occasions, and he repeated it on this occasion, why some State control is not exercised over these companies to whom we give grants. My reply always has been that these grants are given without strings.  Of course that is not completely true because there are contracts signed about the non-disposal of buildings and plant within a certain number of years. Apart from that, however, the grants are given generally without strings.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that the State should put in a director as a watchdog does not appeal to the people seeking to set up industries here and I should remind the House again that we have not any monopoly in the giving of these grants. Almost every other country in the world now is in this market, seeking new industries from outside, and if we were to exercise controls over people intending to come in here that they do not want, we will not get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody wants absolute control but surely, where a grant and substantial loan are given, a Government appointed director is not unreasonable? Sometimes that provision is applied even to Irish nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Credit Company operate as an ordinary finance house.  That is as far as the loans go.  Grants, however, are once-for-all grants and if we try to exercise control over them, I do not think we would be successful in the final analysis.  It has been considered several times both by the Government and by Foras Tionscal but the outcome <Col N="766" /> has been that promoters have said: &ldquo;If you insist on it, we shall not go ahead.  We want full control of our own enterprises.&rdquo;  It is clear then that to try to impose these conditions would detract considerably from the attraction of our grants system and might turn away a number of potential industrialists.</P>
      <P>Coming to the bigger investments, Deputies will see we are making provision somewhat along the lines of the suggestion about some State interest in undertakings.  Deputies will see there is a new provision now that grants in excess of £250,000 in any part of the country must represent not more than 50 per cent. of the capital invested in the entire undertaking, or £1,000 per worker, whichever is the lesser, but in order to provide for what we know as capital intensive industries, there will be this extra provision not provided for in these two Bills, because it is a matter for the Industrial Credit Company over which the Minister for Finance exercises statutory control.  There will be a Bill by the Minister for the Finance providing for special loan provisions, to supplement grants, to cater for these capital intensive industries.  Naturally, if an industrialist wanted to set up an industry of which the capital involved would be, say, £5,000,000, under the Acts and with the permissions that are necessary from the Government and from the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce, he could get £2,500,000 by way of grant.  Everybody will agree that is a very big hand-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is the very type of industry I have been talking about in connection with some Government control.  I was not talking about putting in a State director in a company eligible for a £25,000 grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I are moving along the same lines and perhaps we will get together eventually. The Industrial Credit Company in the ordinary way can make available to such an industry a loan at ordinary lending rates and this new finance company which will be set up will make a special loan available as <Col N="767" /> well which will be interest-free for a period of seven years and thereafter will bear the same rate of interest as the commercial loan granted by the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean two loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the case of the second loan, the promoter will be entitled to pay off any of the amount at any time he likes but in the case of the second loan, it will start bearing interest from the seventh year onwards and then will be in the form of an investment by the Government in the company through what I might call a redeemable debenture, bearing interest.  However, the promoter will have the right to pay off at any stage, even within the seven years, and if he does so, of course the loan will not have earned any interest for the Government.  If it goes on after the seventh year the Government will be getting the benefit of investment in the successful undertaking for as long as the loan is being repaid by the promoter.  There is this element of participation, if not control, in these capital intensive industries which I think goes quite a long way to meet some of the views put forward by Deputy Corish and, I think, by Deputy Cosgrave on occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where very large stocks are necessary, would these loans apply to such stocks, say, very expensive stocks ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Loans perhaps could be applied in respect to working capital.  Grants usually are only for fixed capital.  I should have added that those special loans which will be made available will not only bear interest after the seventh year but will also qualify for the payment to the Government of one-half the rate of the dividend payable by the company above 7½ per cent.  That means that if there is a dividend of more than 7½ per cent. the interest payable on the loan will be increased by half that amount&mdash;that is, by half the rate of dividend above 7½ per cent.  For example, if the dividend is 9½ per cent. <Col N="768" /> the rate of interest fixed on the special loans, plus one per cent. will be payable after the seventh year and this will be a means of profit for the Government if the investment continues and at the same time will act as an inducement to the promoter to pay back the loan.</P>
      <P>A number of questions were asked about retraining of workers and Deputy Corish wisely said there would not be much point now in embarking on such retraining unless we knew clearly for what purpose and what industries might become redundant. Nevertheless, as the House has been informed, the CIO have this retraining and resettlement question under consideration and the Government as well have set up an inter-Departmental committee whose function is to examine primarily the Common Market provisions for the retraining and resettlement, but they will naturally have regard to whatever changing circumstances will be brought about if the Common Market application is not proceeded with.</P>
      <P>That brings me now to another type of grant that will be made available, even though not specifically under this legislation.  I refer to the conversion grant which was dealt with in the recent CIO report.  If one can envisage an industry in a particular small town, employing the majority of the working population of that town, operating a type of industry which cannot survive in free trading conditions, then there would be an obvious necessity for a complete switch-over of the production of that firm.  That firm would naturally be entitled to receive special consideration.  This will be available by way of conversion grant, even though it is not referred to as such in the measures before the House. These grants would inevitably take into account the cost of retraining the workers for any new process that industry would undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having referred to this conversion grant proposal of the CIO, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the members of that Committee. As the House knows, the Committee is composed of members of the Civil Service, representatives of the <Col N="769" /> Irish Congress of Trade Unions and representatives of the Federation of Irish Industries.  They have produced their report expeditiously, very concisely and very clearly.  They have been most objective and certainly should prove most helpful to any industries that have been reviewed.</P>
    <P>The most recent report&mdash;the one published a couple of days ago, the Interim Report on State Aid to be granted to Industry to adapt itself to meet Common Market Conditions&mdash; puts forward a number of very useful suggestions.  I should like to say here that An Foras Tionscal has been considering for a long time some of the suggestions that have been put forward in this report.  For example, there is the suggestion of development centres. That is not new and I do not think the CIO represented it is portraying any novel thinking on their part.  It is something that has been talked about for a number of years, and specifically, by An Foras Tionscal.  I am sure Deputies will remember an address given some months ago, long before this report came out, by Dr. Beddy in a paper to the Irish Management Institute, on the possibility of developing such a centre.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening statement, the Government have not immediately accepted the recommendation of the CIO in that respect but have referred it for examination in connection with the publication of the next five-year economic development programme.  I do not want to comment on it at this stage.  Incidentally, Deputy Cosgrave mentioned that a suggestion along these lines was contained also in the Grey Book, <i>Economic Development.</i> I do not know if Deputy Cosgrave favours the immediate setting up of these development centres, but I am sure he will appreciate that there are a great many difficulties connected with such a decision. For example, the obvious place to set up a development centre would be where all the services are available, where fuel is in abundance, and power likewise, and where there are good port and other facilities.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Deputies, no matter what constituency they represent, would suggest the setting up of <Col N="770" /> a number of huge colossi of industrial centres to the exclusion of the rest of the country, even if that had certain economic advantages.  We have social problems as well, and I do not think any part of the country, even Dublin, could be held to be over-industrialised. The selection, therefore, of these development centres would be a matter of some difficulty for whatever group would have to decide on them.  Nevertheless, as I have said, it is something that is being considered in connection with the economic development expansion programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde asked about the membership of An Foras Tionscal.  I told him there were three civil servants and two non-civil servants.  Again, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the members of that body.  They have discharged very onerous functions in making substantial grants from State resources available for new industrial development. I can assure the House that none of these men is being paid very highly for his services.  The annual fee is a very small one and, in some cases, taking income tax into account, it may perhaps be a negligible one.  They have, however, applied themselves not only to the problem of making grants available but also to a general review from time to time, as conditions change, of our industrial grants legislation. They have made a number of recommendations to me from time to time.  Again, many of these recommendations coincide with matters that were considered by the CIO.</P>
    <P>I have stated that the specific recommendations on grants for industry made by that committee have been accepted, with two exceptions, by the Government, and are already embodied in legislation or are capable of being implemented either under existing legislation or by administrative action.  The first exception is the recommendation for the complete abolition of the differential in maximum grants between the undeveloped areas and the rest of the country.  The Government decided that the time was not yet ripe for that abolition.  The second exception is the reference of the development centre idea to review for the purposes of the economic expansion <Col N="771" /> programme.  Other than those, all the recommendations have been adopted, as in the case of the previous reports, and are either being implemented or are capable of implementation.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned in respect of Foras Tionscal that the grants cum loan scheme, which I think was envisaged in the CIO report, was previously being considered over a long period. Eventually, the scheme which has now emerged was adopted, mainly on the advice of Dr. Beddy, the Chairman of Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>I think, with the experience of a man like Dr. Beddy at the disposal of the Government, it was obvious that the suggestions he would make in this respect would receive close attention and, in so far as possible, be implemented. I am glad it was possible to implement the suggestions made by Dr. Beddy in respect of this grants cum loans scheme for capital intensive projects. Incidentally, these would not operate in the case of smaller grants nor would the loans of the special finance company apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratio is worked out.  Between grant and loan, the total of State investment may not be more than two-thirds of the fixed assets. Therefore, the promoter will have to put in at least one-third hard cash himself and be responsible, by other means, for repayment of the loans involved. This would apply only in respect of grants in excess of £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to another matter in connection with the statement that the Government have accepted the recommendations of the CIO report without equivocation in any respect except the recommendation for the abolition of the differential in the development areas.  It was suggested in an economic article in one of our daily newspapers some time ago that the Government's action was &ldquo;evasive&rdquo; in respect of the recommendation that grants should be <Col N="772" /> given only where it is shown that an industry would be competitive in Common Market conditions.</P>
    <P>It has been a cardinal principle of the undeveloped areas legislation right from the very beginning that industries must have a reasonable prospect of permanency.  It is in Section 6 of the 1952 Undeveloped Areas Act and has been written into the other grant Bills as they were enacted.  Certainly, the obligation remains that before a grant can be given the industry must be of a reasonably permanent nature and will be carried on efficiently.  That is an overall qualification.  I do not think it is necessary that it should be written again into the Bills that the industry must be capable of surviving in Common Market conditions.  Surely this is inherent in the overall qualification?</P>
    <P>I want to say, too, in respect of the comment in this newspaper article that there was some resistance by the Government to favouring capital intensive industries, that that is not true. The arrangements which I have made in the grant cum loan facilities are specifically designed to assist capital intensive projects; so that when a really worthwhile basic industrial proposal involving high capital investment comes to the country we shall not, by reason of any limitation in the legislation, run the risk of losing the industry. We all know the benefits that can flow from having the basic industry established&mdash;benefits such as the establishment of subsidiary industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy S. Collins suggested that this new finance company would further complicate the grants and loans arrangements.  This new finance company will operate only in the case of those new industries which are suitable according to the provisions of this Bill and it will not be the subject of the Parkinson Law process in any way. The bulk of the grants approved&mdash; almost 95 per cent.&mdash;are well under £250,000.  This new finance company will not in any way complicate the arrangements already in existence.</P>
    <P>A couple of Deputies then referred to the rights of Deputies to ask the Minister in this House about any industrial proposal in which the giving <Col N="773" /> of a grant is being contemplated.  In all these Bills, the House has deliberately given Foras Tionscal a degree of autonomy.  No matter what Deputies' views may be about the autonomy of other companies in the running of their day to day business, I think there is very good reason, in the matter of giving out grants, that the Minister or the House should not exercise day to day control over An Foras Tionscal.  Having established a board of men in whom we can have confidence, it is better that they should not be under the influence of a Minister in any way in determining when a grant may be given and what amount.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that questions be answered about proposals being considered by An Foras Tionscal, it is obvious that such a course would be fraught with dangers.  No industrialist likes his proposals to be discussed in public and certainly not in Parliament.  The system we have adopted is the best system, namely, the system whereby the amounts of grants are published in the annual reports of An Foras Tionscal.  The firms are identified and the actual amounts the firms receive are stated at the end of each financial year.  I think that this is the safest way to proceed.  To do otherwise&mdash;to leave these individual cases open for discussion in any way in this House&mdash; would, I think, seriously prejudice the prospects of attracting people to this country from outside, or people from within, to set up industry with the aid of State grants.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy T. Lynch that the Government have no prejudice against Waterford&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems like it.  We must only judge by results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;nor, indeed, against any other part of the country. It is not possible to direct an industrialist to a particular area, or to say he may not go to a particular area, in the ordinary way.  When we have the development centre proposal examined, then that may be possible. Surely the industrialist who is going to invest a substantial amount of his own money&mdash;let us not forget these <Col N="774" /> grants are not intended to cover the entire capital cost; they are intended only to be of assistance to an industrialist&mdash;must be given some choice? I for one have never attempted to influence an industrialist away from any part of the country he had put his eye on as a location for his industry. I know similarly that Foras Tionscal would not try to influence anybody.  They obviously make sure that the employment is available and that the facilities that are required, such as power and transport, are available.  It is part of their task to judge the economic soundness of any industry, but other than that, they have never tried to influence a man or a group of men to leave a place or to go to a particular place if they have some other place in mind.  I think I have dealt with most of the points raised during the course of the debate but if there are any others, I shall try to answer them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that in giving grants to an industrialist he does not seek the power to direct them to any particular place to start an industry.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks it necessary for social or other important reasons to have an industry in a Gaeltacht area or along the western seaboard where industrialists do not want to go, would he consider that the Government should build whatever factory would be needed, train the operatives for the factory when built and then put in his representative or a representative of the Department of Finance for a certain number of years and dispose of the industry to private enterprise afterwards?  That is what I meant to ask the other night.  I do not want the Minister to answer it now.  I would like it to be considered and I shall ask a question in about a week or a fortnight's time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer it now. In the first place, the differential in respect of undeveloped areas in the case of grants not exceeding £250,000 still remains and An Foras Tionscal in dealing with these grant applications always have regard to the remoter area and invariably give the <Col N="775" /> promoter who goes to the remoter area that little extra grant assistance in order to compensate him for doing so.</P>
      <P>To deal with the Deputy's other point, could the Deputy pick the place along the western seaboard where he would like to set up a factory and where the Government would train workers and operate an industry?  Is there not a difficulty there?  For example, if a factory were set up in Carraroe, would the residents of the Donegal Gaeltacht not ask: &ldquo;Why was it not set up here?  We have as good a Gaeltacht as they have in Galway.&rdquo;  Similarly with Ballyferriter, even around to Ballyvourney and Ring.  There is the difficulty of selecting a location for such a factory.  In any event, the suggestion that has been made that the Government should set up factory buildings in different parts of the country to which industrialists might move is not a sound one.  It is better that the grants system we have should be continued in existence so that the industrialist can build the factory to suit his own particular needs.  That is as far as I can go in answer to the Deputy's question but if he would still like to pursue it at a later stage he is welcome to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Other than the company expenses, there have been a number of payments made in connection with the contract.  The company were authorised by me to borrow from their own bankers in advance of the Supplementary Estimate for £900,000 which was introduced in connection with the Second Reading of the Bill last week.  That £900,000 is expected to provide sufficient funds for the company in its contractual and other obligations up to the end of March, 1963 when this Bill will be in operation.  At the moment, apart from office staff, which is not very big&mdash;I think there are about four or five&mdash;the number of people employed on the site is very small, about ten.  It was hoped that the actual construction would be undertaken soon but the bad weather of <Col N="778" /> recent weeks delayed site development so that the actual construction work has not yet commenced.</P>
      <P>There is another item to which I should refer.  The office premises were purchased, one of those big houses on the outskirts of the city, at a cost of about £10,000 to £12,000, which, I think, was a good investment anyway, and another sum was spent in engaging the technical consultants.  I cannot give the Deputy a breakdown of the money spent or committed already on the actual contractual work but it is still within the limit of the £900,000 we have passed for expenditure up to the end of March.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I had practically made all the points which I considered to be important, having had experience of planning in the Dublin region.  I want to say that I am not nearly so critical of our housing development as other Deputies appear to be.  I have seen development in various parts of England and on the Continent and I must say it left me feeling rather proud of the efforts made here.  What we need is more housing and every facility for providing more housing and removing all the restrictions that arise in the course of trying to get more building done.  If I have any criticism to make of our architects, it is that they appear to place far more importance on the outside appearance of a house than on the interior comfort for the people who have to live in the houses, things like insulation and the exclusion of draughts and so on.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister was not able to be present when I was speaking before and apparently he is not able to be here today.  I am not fully satisfied with Section 35.  We regard it in Dublin as an extremely important section. It is the section which gives power to a local authority to insist that a developer carries out the work fully which he proposed to do in accordance with the provisions of the planning permission.  What rather disturbs me is that its application is fully retrospective and that is indicated in Section 82 also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to page 25 of <Col N="781" /> the Minister's speech where he deals with Section 35.  He said:</P>
    <P>As drafted, Section 35 of the Bill has the advantage of enabling the planning authority to place responsibility on a developer, to make it an offence for him not to discharge his obligations, and to recover from him any expenses which they incur in making good his default.  If the planning authority fail to serve an enforcement notice under the Section they may be compelled to do so by the Minister.  If the developer is in receipt of ground rents, they may be attached&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>What if he is not in receipt of ground rents?  I want to develop that further.</P>
    <P>&mdash;they may be attached for the purpose of recovering expenses if such is necessary.  The most important aspect of the section is, however, that it will be possible to apply it not only to future cases, but to many of those currently being dealt with.</P>
    <P>My comment is: why not all?  What are the cases to which it is not applicable in retrospect?  Are we referring here to cases where we have no way or no means, where there are no ground rents to be attached?  This is the position in many cases because ground rents are very often sold and disposed of before a development even begins. Unless there is some provision in the new legislation prohibiting the sale of ground rents in advance of the completion of development, we lose all effective grip on the developer and many people will in future continue to suffer as they have suffered up to the present as a result of development not being completed and the refusal of the local authority in those circumstances to take the estate in charge.</P>
    <P>I should like to know also if it is still the intention that the developer must make a request to have a particular estate taken in charge before the local authority can proceed to take it in charge because that condition has been an instrument for holding up the taking in charge of many estates.  The developer often has more reasons than one for not making that request.</P>
    <P>There is another matter of importance. <Col N="782" /> A developer at his own expense brings services such as sewerage and water to the edge of a development and does not want any other developer to continue the development in an adjoining property.  The fact that he has brought the sewerage gives him a lien on adjoining property.  I, personally, think that that is all wrong.  It excludes all other bidders for the property. There should be some way of compelling a developer to surrender rights to these services on payment of adequate compensation by the person who wishes to develop the adjoining property.</P>
    <P>It is very important that Section 35 should be completely tied up because of the frustration that it has caused, especially in the Dublin region, where we have had considerable experience of this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to building densities, in preparing a plan and determining building densities, very often in regard to the rural areas of a county the density is fixed at one house per five acres.  In the case of a person who has been resident in the area all his lifetime and whose people have resided there for generations, and who, although he may be comparatively poor, is very anxious to build his own house, it means that he must first secure the sterilisation of five acres which, again, often means that he must buy five acres, before he will have a site which will be acceptable for the building of a house.  That should not operate in the case of old residents of any area.  They have a right to have their house built in the area in which their people have been living for generations and they should not be required to incur the unnecessary expense of sterilising five acres because they want to build their own house. There is no indication in the section that this can be taken in charge.</P>
    <P>There is great necessity, also, for the coordination of the activities of Government Departments and local authorities in connection with the laying of the various services in housing estates, and cooperation in paying for the services.  That would obviate the necessity for repeated excavation work <Col N="783" /> on the same road and the same footpath, with everybody's objection and to everybody's disturbance.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to unauthorised structures.  What exactly will be regarded as unauthorised structures? Take, for example, a case where a building proposal was made to the local authority and where they failed to reply to the application within the period laid down&mdash;two months.  The applicant has no written evidence that he got permission to carry out the building.  Even though, legally, he has permission, by default, is he to be regarded as a person who has erected unauthorised structures?  That is an important point.  A considerable number of buildings have been erected in areas where there were no bye-laws governing this matter and because there is no written permission in existence these buildings are unauthorised structures.  Is the power being given in this Bill to have these structures knocked down at the expense of the person who put them up?  That is a matter that should be attended to.</P>
    <P>The clause, &ldquo;of any other material considerations&rdquo; is a most objectionable feature of this planning legislation.  It enables a local authority or the Minister to reject an application on any and every ground.  We must be specific. We must show that we are anxious for development, not anxious, in fact, to retard development.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that it is proposed to grant to local authorities the power to secure necessary development expeditiously but I should hate to feel that some over-officious bureaucrat could use this as an instrument of persecution, as could easily happen.  Unfortunately, some people in certain positions are capable of carrying things to extremes.  If this were carried to extremes a man could not put down a flower bed in his front garden if it required a concrete surround, without permission.  A case has come to my notice where three old women living in a wooden hut were getting a porch built by the St. Vincent de Paul Society and somebody stepped in to say that <Col N="784" /> they had no authority and could not build without permission, that if they did build, the rent and rates would be increased, and frightened the life out of them.  That sort of thing should be safeguarded against.</P>
    <P>Planning, while not really essential for the major portion of the country, has become very essential in built-up areas, such as the city of Dublin, partly due to a decision to remove all transport and traffic off the railways and canals and on to the roads.  The position will become worse in future, due to many factors.  At the moment in the Dublin region about one person in seven of the population has a car.  In New York one person in three of the population has a car.  I would say that we will reach that point in the not too distant future.  It is expected that there will be much more leisure in future, that there will be a shorter working week.  In countries where that position obtains it is found that it is people on their way to and from recreation that clutter up the roads.  It is absolutely essential that we should plan in advance to meet such a situation.</P>
    <P>When dealing with Section 35, I omitted to mention a very important matter in regard to the question of ground rents.  It is extremely important and certainly it has not been fully explained here and the position has not been sufficiently safeguarded.  It is the question of claims for compensation.  I am just wondering in what form claims for compensation can arise.  It is said that they can arise only when a proposition has been turned down.  In an area where there are no services at present can a person put forward a pretty large development proposal based on a local sewerage and local water supply and if that is turned down can the person concerned automatically proceed against the local authority for compensation?  It is important that that position should be clarified.  If that is the case, I think we will have many such claims.</P>
    <P>In regard to compensation, what is the position of a man who has land in an area which is surrounded by building development and who is not allowed to build on that land?  He is on the fringe of a development area and <Col N="785" /> no further development is permitted, for one reason or another, beyond that area.  He is surrounded and he has endless trespass or, if he is not to have endless trespass, he would want to build a fortification around his bit of land.  Is he entitled to compensation?  I think he is.  His farm has been rendered practically useless for agricultural purposes and he is not allowed to build on it.  His position should be clarified.</P>
    <P>I have referred to delays of all descriptions.  If there is an appeal to the Minister, there should be a time limit for the determination of the appeal and a definite reason should be given for any alteration of the decision of the local authority.  If the decision of the local authority is reversed on appeal, the Minister should be required to state the reason.</P>
    <P>My personal view, of course, is that it is wrong that the Minister should have the final power and authority that it is sought to give him in this Bill.  In the first place, it makes for duplication and, in addition, it makes for many undesirable approaches to the question.  I am not referring to any particular Minister because there will be many changes, I am sure.  Where officials of the planning Authority refuse permission for a development, that refusal should come before the elected representatives of the local authority and if two-thirds of the members of the local authority decide in favour of the development the development should be allowed and the matter should not have to go to the Minister.  As I say, the appeal to the Minister makes for duplication. If there is a large number of such appeals, and I would expect that there would be, the appeals would then have to be considered by town planning experts in the Department who would not be in any better position to give advice than the local planning officers. In fact, they would not be in nearly as good a position to do so.  It would merely create extra work.  The matters should be referred to the elected representatives and they should make the decision.  If they do not know what the people want, they should know. In the last analysis, it is what the people want that should be allowed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> Of course, the Minister has a function. In my view, where he comes in is in regard to regional development. If there is a dispute between two local authorities with regard to regional services it is the Minister's responsibility to settle that dispute and to allow of development on a national scale but I would confine his power and authority to that aspect of planning in legislation and I would confine it very strictly because it is completely wrong that the Minister should get the powers that are sought in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 35 should be more specific. Coupled with that section there should be a provision laying down the obligations and responsibilities of local authorities in co-operation with developers and others carrying out building.  If you do not get such co-operation, the position will still be chaotic.  There should be a more reasonable and a well-defined attitude. The obligation should exist for the taking over of estates road by road as development takes place.  Such takeover should not have to await the completion of an estate.  The estate in question may be a big estate or an estate that will grow.  We should not have to wait until the entire estate is completed or until we get a request to take it over.  The estate should be taken over street by street, road by road, and all the services provided. Otherwise, the ratepayers are being defrauded and people are being discouraged from providing for themselves their own housing accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to congratulate the Minister and his Department on embarking on such a comprehensive and very difficult piece of legislation.  The Minister's difficulties, great as they have been, I have no doubt, in bringing this Bill before the House, are as nothing compared with the difficulties which he or his successor will experience when the Bill becomes law.  By that I do not mean that the Bill is not one that should be passed.  I mean that, because of the nature of the planning and control with which this Bill is concerned, it inevitably produces <Col N="787" /> dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction in this matter will lead to appeals to the Minister for Local Government and, indeed, his decision will undoubtedly lead to dissatisfaction in many cases.  It seems to me that the Minister for Local Government will spend a considerable amount of his time in dealing with questions arising under this Bill when it becomes law.</P>
      <P>There are, however, some points to which I should like to direct the attention of the House.  First of all, there is one matter in connection with the existing town planning legislation which has always somewhat mystified me, that is, the possibility of the prosecution by local authorities of persons who have erected structures without permission.  The reason I am concerned with this matter is that I have known of cases where local authorities prosecuted in such circumstances and the offender was usually fined something like £5 but as far as I know &mdash;I am open to correction on this&mdash; Dublin Corporation has never prosecuted anybody because he erected a structure without permission.</P>
      <P>That is a strange situation because one would expect that the occasion for such prosecutions would arise in Dublin at least as frequently as it does in other areas.  From my personal experience of matters such as this, I know that the Dublin Corporation, and to some extent, I think, the Dublin County Council, take the view that the existing legislation does not give them the power they need to institute such prosecutions, although, as far as I know, the county council has prosecuted on occasions.  The strange thing about this is that in the two cases in Dublin city where the Dublin Corporation refused to prosecute and the local residents got together and nominated one of their members as a common informer, the offender was prosecuted, found guilty and substantial fines were imposed.  In that case, an appeal was made to the circuit court and the conviction and fine were confirmed.  In the other case, the appeal succeeded on a purely legal technicality, which had nothing to do with the offence in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> That being so, I have often wondered why it is that local authorities maintain they do not have the power to prosecute.  Because of that, I am urging the Minister now to ensure that the provisions in this Bill will be such that local authorities will express themselves as satisfied that it gives them the powers they need so that we will not have in the future the situation we have had in the past where people, without any warning, commence to erect a structure, to be used as a boiler factory, in the middle of a residential area and, after numerous complaints and appeals to the corporation, the corporation decide they have no power to prosecute. That was one of the cases in which the local residents eventually prosecuted at considerable expense to themselves. I want to ensure that a situation like that does not arise again and I urge the Minister, therefore, to satisfy himself that the local authorities can now tell him that, under this Bill, they will have the necessary machinery and powers to prosecute in cases such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the difficulty involved where someone submits a plan to the local authority and, in the event of refusal, appeals to the Minister.  Local residents who are vitally concerned with the provisions of this plan find it virtually impossible in many cases to know what is proposed until, as far as they are concerned, the damage is done; in other words, the permission has been granted.  Some form of machinery which would ensure that notice must be given to enable local residents to inform themselves of the provisions of the plan is vitally necessary. I know that provision is being made for notification of the plan adopted by the local authority.  That is not the matter to which I am referring. It may be that I have overlooked some provision in the Bill.  The matter to which I am referring is where an individual submits a plan for approval; some provision should be made whereby the district in which the proposed work is to be carried out can be notified of the proposal to enable local people to have their objections heard. <Col N="789" /> Under existing legislation it frequently happens that approval has been given, or the Minister has decided on appeal, before the people vitally concerned know what is going on.</P>
    <P>Another matter dealt with in this Bill is the planning of facilities for traffic, traffic control, and facilities for pedestrians in relation to traffic control. It has always seemed to me that our traffic control suffers grievously by reason of the fact that it is not really controlled by anybody.  The Minister for Local Government has certain functions in the matter.  The Minister for Justice has certain functions.  So has the local authority.  Because of this divided control no one body, it seems to me, can take positive action.  The three parties are required to get together. That is difficult.  Having got together, they then have to agree as to what is to be done.  I know there are considerable administrative difficulties involved in overcoming this, but it would be preferable, I think, to have the overall control of traffic vested in one authority, be it the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Local Government, and the person in whom that overall control is vested should also have responsibility for seeing that the necessary steps are taken to co-ordinate the efforts of the three parties involved.  It should not be a question of the Minister for Local Government having to await the initiative from the local authority, or the Minister for Justice, or <i>vice versa</i> in the case of any of these three parties.  Until the overall responsibility is vested in one Minister the situation will not be very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>A new departure in this Bill relates to appeals to the Minister against the refusal of permission by the planning authority.  Provision is being made for the hearing of the appeals orally in certain cases.  This is an interesting development.  It is, I think, a welcome one but, again, this Bill being so comprehensive, I may have overlooked some of the provisions in it; if so, I apologise for taking up the time of the House.  It does seem to me that any provision governing the situation that would arise in the event of an <Col N="790" /> oral hearing must give rise to something closely resembling a public inquiry.  The expense involved could be very considerable.  What is worrying me is that I can visualise a local authority utilising the possibility of an oral hearing in certain circumstances to intimidate someone and keep him from appealing to the Minister because of the tremendous expense involved in such a procedure.  I would urge the Minister to make provision for some control of the situation. Human nature being what it is, there are certain officers in local authorities who would take advantage of this provision, if they could do so, to intimidate somebody from appealing against the decision of the authority.</P>
    <P>Another matter in which the Bill does not go far enough is in relation to structures being erected by Departments of State or by the planning authority itself.  I know certain steps are taken here to control that development but, offhand, I cannot see any good reason why the State or the planning authority should not have to go through exactly the same machinery as the individual.  This Bill is, after all, providing for an overall plan and neither the local authority nor, indeed, the State should be permitted to depart from that plan. They should have to follow exactly the same procedure when dealing with proposed developments.  Admittedly, it can be said, if the planning authority is going to embark on some development, there is no point in asking it to submit a plan to itself.  That is quite true.  On the other hand, I feel that the Bill should go further than saying that, if there is objection to it, it can only be carried on if the Minister consents.  I think that is the provision in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I would think that the local authority should have to submit such a scheme to the Minister in the same way as if it were an appeal from one of its own decisions and that the Minister should then examine it in the light of the existing plan as though, in other words, he were stepping into the place of the local authority in the case of a normal plan being submitted. In the case of Government <Col N="791" /> Departments or semi-State bodies, I feel that the same consideration should apply and that all parties in the State should be obliged to go through the machinery of submitting their plan and having it tested as to whether it conforms with the overall plan for the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, is to be congratulated on the provision which he has introduced here which allows a planning authority to protect and maintain existing public rights of way but, more important, to create and maintain new public rights of way. This, from the legal point of view, is quite a revolutionary proposal but I think it is a very sound one socially. When it comes into operation it will have to overcome a number of the difficulties which have been experienced around the country, especially where estates have been purchased by foreigners.  This business of rights of way seems to have led to a considerable amount of friction.  I think this provision could help to overcome that friction.</P>
    <P>Another matter for which the Bill makes some provision is the question of control of noise but how it will work out is a rather difficult problem. I should like to see the planning authority, the local authority, having power to ensure that the noise emanating, for instance, from factories will not exceed a certain limit.  There are factories situated in residential areas for many years past.  I do not think this Bill will compel them to be moved.  In some cases the noise emanating from these factories is undoubtedly a very grave and serious interference with the amenities of the neighbourhood.  In most cases, it is technically possible to reduce the noise but, naturally, I suppose factory owners do not tend to do anything about it unless they are compelled to do so.</P>
    <P>The old question of the portable radios which annoy one in places is one that I would hope could be controlled by this measure but I rather doubt that it can.  The difficulties of defining the nuisances caused by portable radios will, I think, present an <Col N="792" /> insuperable problem.  However, some effort may be made to attempt this and even to attempt, perhaps, some form of insurance against too grave abuse.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the Bill which I welcome is the power to provide uniform building regulations throughout the country which would be substituted for the varying and sometimes archaic building bye-laws in force under different local authorities. Many of these bye-laws date back I think to the last century and bear little relation to building practice today.  I also think it is an advantage to have the same uniform regulations applying throughout the State which I think is what is contemplated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of assessing compensation.  The existing rules for the assessment of compensation are being amended by the addition of the existing rules which are set out in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.  Rule No. 9 in the Fourth Schedule has presented me with a little difficulty.  It seems to me that it is somewhat contradictory. It says:</P>
    <P>Regard shall be had to considerations related to proper planning and development, including the preservation and improvement of amenities ....</P>
    <P>That is on the one hand.  On the other hand, it says:</P>
    <P>subject to the proviso that regard shall not be had to any depreciation or increase in value attributable to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the land, or any land in the vicinity thereof, being indicated for any particular use or purpose in a development plan, or</P>
    <P>(b)  inclusion of the land in a special amenity area order.</P>
    <P>I may be misinterpreting this but it seems to me that it is asking the arbitrator on the one hand to have regard to certain types of effects imposed by the planning regulations and, on the other hand, not to have regard to certain other types of effects imposed by the planning regulations. Whether any arbitrator will be able to work out which ones he is to take into account and which he is not is, in my view, somewhat doubtful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> The Bill provides also for the exclusion of compensation in various cases.  One, for instance, is where the proposed development would constitute a traffic hazard.  Perhaps, I am unduly suspicious of what we might call bureaucracy but I can see a certain danger here.  Suppose somebody submits a plan and the local authority, the planning authority, want to refuse permission but realise that if they refuse the permission on the main ground of their objection they will have to pay compensation.  My fear is that the local authority might give a different ground for refusing as, for instance, a traffic hazard&mdash;one of the grounds on which compensation would not be paid.</P>
    <P>My concern is to ensure that if such a thing should happen the grounds for the decision of the local authority will be open to review.  It may be said that the developer can appeal to the Minister.  That is true but the Bill obviously contemplates cases where someone applies for permission, is refused it, and then looks for compensation without appealing to the Minister.  In such cases, I should like provision to be made that the arbitrator or whoever is assessing the compensation would have power in such circumstances to investigate not only the amount of compensation but the genuineness of the local authority's reasons for refusing permission where those reasons are such as to exclude compensation.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether this Bill does make provision for this matter but it has been a subject of considerable difficulty in Dublin and I think in other places where estates were being developed and the planning authority insisted, in connection with the plans, on the provision of an open space. The open space was left but no provision was made for the maintenance of the open space.  It became a source of weeds, then a dump, then a place for children to play in and to hurt themselves with tin cans.  However, more than anything, it became an eyesore. Eventually, by sheer force of public opinion being dissatisfied with the conditions, the local authority or the Minister reject the provision for <Col N="794" /> an open space and building is permitted on it.  A number of open spaces in Dublin which have been planned for have disappeared.  The reason this situation developed was that provision was made by the planning authority to have an open space.  They insisted on that and were entitled to insist on it but no provision was made for maintaining the open site.  It would be far better not to have any provision for open spaces insisted on by local authorities unless provision is made for maintenance.</P>
    <P>Whether the maintenance should be by the local authority or by the developer is a matter to be examined. To impose the obligation on the developer would present very great difficulties and would probably be impracticable.  Therefore, it would appear that the obligation to maintain the open space should be on the local authority.  Whatever solution is arrived at, I would urge that provision be made to ensure that no more will we have open spaces being insisted on and no provision made for their maintenance so that we have these eyesores and dumps as we have had in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton made reference to the difficulties which have arisen about the taking in charge of roads and services by the local authority.  I wish to echo what he has said.  This is a matter which has caused very great difficulty to the Dublin Corporation and other local authorities in the past.  The Minister would do well to take a completely new look at this question of the taking in charge of roads and services to see whether it cannot be viewed in a more rational way.  Deputy Clinton suggested that provision be made for the taking in charge of an estate street by street.  I think that, in fact, may be done at the moment but the local authority refuses normally to do it because it may find itself at the end with a small section of street which is not being completely developed and which it cannot compel the developer to complete because he has no further interest in the estate.  This has been a big problem in Dublin. Indeed, there have been cases where roads and footpaths have been left there, not taken in charge and in nobody's <Col N="795" /> custody for many years.  They have been deteriorating and sometimes an emergency operation is carried out by the Dublin Corporation to maintain some particularly bad portion of it but, strictly speaking, the local authority is not entitled to enter that property which it has not taken in charge.</P>
    <P>A more rational approach to this problem could be developed.  It might involve a local authority in taking on expense for doing work which it should not have to do, which the developer should do, but provision should be made to enable the local authority, where the developer is not doing his duty, to move in, do the work and to recover the money it expends from the developer or through the ground rents created.  It may be said that the developer can dispose of the ground rents but provision can be made that such a charge by the local authority would be a charge automatically on the ground rents.  If that were done nobody would purchase the ground rents from an estate until they were satisfied there was no liability for this and it would be a very effective way of getting developers to complete the development.  In any event, provision should be made to enable a local authority in necessary circumstances to move in and do the work.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the effort being made in the Bill to control advertisements, a very welcome provision and one that is quite necessary.  One has only to travel around the city and a short distance down the country to see the necessity for these provisions.  All I hope is that they will work effectively and that we shall succeed in preventing our country becoming a complete eyesore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in justice.  I am neither a legal man nor an architect.  You would want to be one or the other fully to understand a large Bill of this sort but I will generalise in my remarks.  In the explanatory memorandum is a statement that one of the purposes of the Bill is to secure that the amenities of town and countryside are preserved and <Col N="796" /> improved.  I am thinking of Portmarnock when I read that.  Up to now the Dublin County Council have refused to develop Portmarnock, one of the largest seaside resorts in Ireland and, as far as Dublin is concerned, the most popular resort.  It has been undeveloped for years simply because the county council said: &ldquo;The Dubliners use that.  We shall spend no money on it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At present a local authority cannot spend money in an adjoining area which is the reason why Portmarnock, nine miles from the city, is neglected. Portmarnock has a fine strand and is completely safe for bathing.  You seldom if ever hear of any children being drowned there because you can go out quite a distance and find it hard to get your depth.  There would be 20,000 or 30,000 people there on a fine day.  This Bill enables a local authority to contribute part of the cost of improving an amenity of that sort in an adjoining area.  But there is a snag.  Dublin County Council have already told Dublin Corporation that they do not intend to spend any money on Portmarnock. Dublin Corporation have considered this matter and have said: &ldquo;Why should we spend 100 per cent. of the cost of something we do not control?&rdquo; They are right and I am sure there are other snags like that throughout the countryside.</P>
      <P>The General Purposes Committee of Dublin Corporation feel they should get control of the Portmarnock area. The city extends to Baldoyle, about a mile or two away, and they feel they should get as much of Portmarnock as would give them control of the strand. However, if in these border cases one area holds another up to ransome seaside resorts like Portmarnock will be left as they are.  It is up to the authorities putting through this Bill to enable an authority like Dublin to get possession of something that is exclusively used by them.  I do not want this Bill to pass through unless this snag is dealt with because it can still mean Portmarnock and other areas will be undeveloped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A complaint I often hear is that Dublin Corporation cannot take lanes <Col N="797" /> in charge; in other words, if a lane is not a public utility, if the general public do not pass through a lane, they cannot spend any money on it.  The residents around say they cannot afford to spend any money on it and there is no agreement.</P>
    <P>The result is that lanes are derelict and are, in many cases, a sort of slob-land for junk of all sorts.  The Corporation have appealed to the Department on hundreds of occasions for permission to take lanes in charge but the answer has always been that the Department had no authority in the matter.  I am asking that the local authority should be permitted to take them over if there is such a need.  Otherwise, these city lanes will remain in the city and in the country.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the question of car parks.  This is a problem at the moment but it will become an even greater problem in the future.  There are a number of car park sites in Dublin and apart from the fact that the number is inadequate, the Corporation is going to use them for street widening purposes or the building of flats and the capacity of the sites will be reduced by about 30 or 40 per cent. We heard various suggestions to the effect that motorists should not be allowed to bring their cars into the city, but motorists pay heavy taxes and pay heavily in other ways also, and they have certain rights and should be helped in a planning manner rather than told: &ldquo;You cannot bring your car into the city.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question is what are we going to do?  It occurred to me that while everywhere else there is wholesale building of underground car parks it is only in odd cases that you hear of such parks being built in Dublin.  I do not understand why the authorities do not encourage people to build underground car parks.  In parts of the Continent people are helped by grants or they are allowed depreciation in rates.  When new structures are being built it is quite easy to build such parks.  It is not so easy when the structures have been built.  People should be encouraged and given grants or <Col N="798" /> some form of rates depreciation to do this.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have a scheme of flats in Dominick Street and an underground car park will be built under those flats which will hold 150 cars.  Dominick Street is only a stone's throw from O'Connell Street.  When new structures, like the office building being erected where the Royal was, or Liberty Hall, are being built people should be encouraged to provide underground car parks at the same time.  If you do not plan now to do it in a big way you are going to have plenty of trouble in the future.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another matter.  I have &ldquo;a bee in my bonnet&rdquo; about underground air raid shelters.  I am one of those people who thinks ahead, and I also think back.  I remember during the last Emergency we had hundreds of ugly shelters all over the city.  From time to time in the future we are going to have alarms and, perhaps, wars.  I believe there will always be wars.  This is where the Minister for Defence comes in.  He should have a say in the future planning of the city and he should have in mind the provision of underground air raid shelters.</P>
    <P>What is to prevent us, when planning, to think in terms of underground car parks and also in terms of such places being used as air raid shelters? In normal times, they could be used as car parks but in the time of emergency, they could be used as air raid shelters.  It is again a question of inducing people to do it.  We could say: &ldquo;We will give you so much grant or rate depreciation if you build a car park but we will double it if to our specification you construct it so that it could also be used as an air raid shelter.&rdquo;  Surely this is the time to plan all that and not in the future when a sudden panic occurs?  If in ten or 15 years time there is a panic what are we to do?  Are we to erect those shelters in the street again?  I am not a lone thinker in this regard.  On the Continent they are planning with their eye to the future.  They have built car parks but they have an eye to the air raid shelter aspect of the matter also.</P>
    <P>I mention those matters for what <Col N="799" /> they are worth.  I regard the additional powers granted to local authorities as being necessary.  A case in point is Church Street in Dublin.  Nine years ago, the local authority decided that Church Street required to be widened. There had been a number of accidents there, many of them fatal.  But we found we had no power to compel people to accept compensation.  As the law stood, if a person appealed to the High Court, then the High Court made an Order deferring the matter until there was an agreement.  There had to be an agreement between the party concerned and the local authority and if the party concerned decided not to accept compensation they could hold up the whole business.  That has been the position regarding Church Street. The laws are not retrospective and, therefore, we have to deal with Church Street by means of whatever Act was invoked at that time.  The Corporation now are in the happy position of being able to say that they have agreement with almost everybody and they expect a final agreement this year, after nine years.  The local authorities need power in relation to that sort of thing. I hope that in granting it to the local authorities, they will not act the bully. Officialdom can be a bully and people are entitled to consideration and fair compensation.  They must not be caught by the scruff of the neck and used in any fashion the local authority choses.</P>
    <P>One further point which occurred to me in regard to private developers who are not completing the job either because they abscond, go bankrupt or die.  We have a number of private estates around the city in which the developers did not complete the job. They left paths and roadways undeveloped. We have to deal with that sort of thing in future planning and we have got to give the local authority power to stop it.  I do not think they have that power.  If developers go bankrupt and leave a road in its original condition, why should we sit back and look on?  We are thinking now of planning for the future and we should give the local authority power to step in.  We should make certain <Col N="800" /> provisos but we should give them power to deal with those problems.  We do not want more undeveloped estates and lanes.  This is the time to make a comprehensive plan for all our planning problems.  Dublin is an old city, unlike such newly established places as New York, and consequently more and urgent planning programmes fall on us.  Our biggest bogey is, of course, our traffic.  If we do not make immediate plans to tackle that problem, our traffic will be out of hand in ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I agree there is great necessity for a planning Bill, I cannot say I welcome this measure in its present form.  My main reason for saying that is that certain sections provide that in the last resort, the citizen has an appeal only to the Minister.  Deputy Colley inspired me when he forecast that if this Bill went through in the form in which it is now before us, the Minister for Local Government would be a very busy Minister.  Although he did not say it, what the Deputy meant was that it would be impossible for the Minister to deal with all the appeals that will fall to be decided under it.  Of course it will.  No Minister could properly deal with them.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that if we pass this Bill in its present form, we will be condoning the taking away of further powers from ourselves and of more rights from the citizens.  Under this Bill, all power is vested in some invisible being in the Local Government Department.  It denies the right to the citizen to appeal to the courts and of course this will reduce us to the law of the jungle. Some Deputy stated this morning that the person in the Department who will be dealing with these matters will be a human being, who will be prone to make mistakes and so on.  That is not the great danger I see in this.  My fear is that he might be inhuman and my experience of the Department of Local Government is that they can be very inhuman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy has had experience of dealing with situations that arise under the housing reconstruction legislation. They know how difficult it has been for the Department to recruit housing <Col N="801" /> inspectors and the consequent great delays there have been in the inspection of completed work.  Now, if this Bill goes through in its present form, there will be a need for a horde of additional inspectors to visit places strange to them and report on streets that are strange to them.  Their reports will disappear into the maze of the Custom House and the private citizens who may eventually have reason to appeal against the Department's decisions must go to the Minister, not the courts.  At long last, the Department's decisions, as contained in the inspectors' reports, will be issued. These will be based on the findings of men who were strangers to the areas affected.  I do not see how we can let such a Bill pass through the House.</P>
    <P>Since the Dáil first assembled, it has given away many of its powers. The time has now come to call a halt to that sort of thing.  The British passed a great Act in 1899 which gave wide powers to the local authorities but, little by little, these powers have been taken away by our own Ministers under successive management Acts and goodness knows what else. If this Bill goes through, it will make Mr. Parkinson write a new volume telling the world how right he was. Here is Parkinson's Law <i>in excelsis.</i></P>
    <P>When I speak of planning, I refer first and foremost to housing.  I have been saying inside and outside the House for many years that the greatest delay in the building of houses is in the producing of plans, the submission of these plans to the Department and the long wait for their return from the Department with, in most cases, idiotic recommendations that mean nothing or small recommendations that might mean something. Meanwhile, queues of people wait and wait for badly needed houses.  Of course they are the last to be considered.  I submit that the planning should be done entirely by the local authority officials.  They are the men on the ground who are best able to determine what is suitable for their locality.  The plans should then go before the local authority for approval, the local authority being advised by their manager and engineers, and it should be necessary <Col N="802" /> to send only notice of their intention to the Department.</P>
    <P>I know there must be safeguards in these matters but surely these safeguards are provided in the standards laid down for house building.  At the moment, this whole business is a ridiculous forest of red tape and bureaucracy.  Say a local authority build a row of houses on a perfectly flat piece of land, having sent the plan to the Department and having had it approved.  If, later, the same authority want to build a similar scheme of houses on a similar site, surely it should not be necessary to send the plans again to the Department and have the whole thing held up while poor unfortunates wait for new houses and local authority members at meeting after meeting enquire if the plans have been approved by the Department and all they get are the last words of Robert Emmet: &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I should say anything about planning in Dublin. Why should I not, though, since it is the capital of my country?  It has now become fashionable for great interests to build enormous office blocks right in the centre of Dublin.  I submit a stop should be put to that kind of planning. There are sufficient office blocks in the centre of Dublin already.  Putting up more of them will bring an enormous extra working population into the centre of the city.  That, in turn, will bring in more and more cars.  There will be more people coming in to do business in these new office blocks and they will also come in cars.  All this will bring about a chaotic state of affairs and the centre of Dublin will be a perpetual traffic jam unless the Minister intends to ban motor traffic from the centre of the city altogether.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I would draw the Minister's attention to planning in certain American cities where people know their business.  Great American companies, instead of building new building premises among the skyscrapers of New York, Cincinatti and other big centres, have begun to build office blocks in the green belts outside these cities.  Articles have appeared in the newspapers, in the thorough way these people do their business, giving reports of interviews with employees of <Col N="803" /> these firms.  Groups of these employees have said how pleased they are with the new arrangements.  They are now able to build houses in the neighbourhood of their offices.  Having for years driven miles to and from work through dense traffic conditions, and having wasted the better part of the day doing so, they are now delighted to be able to walk to and from work.  The same applies to the business people calling at these office blocks.  It is now much easier for them to get to and from these business headquarters.  For those reasons, I submit we should be very careful about what is now happening in Dublin in this respect.  It should be examined very closely before it is allowed to become too fashionable.  We might find ourselves with several other skyscrapers cluttering up the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a provision relating to the control of noise.  This will be a very hard thing for the Minister to do because factories and industry are so welcome in certain places that the people are prepared to put up with an awful lot from them.  At the same time, I suppose we must give the local authorities power to control noise in their respective areas because there are factories which are noisy just through carelessness.  Perhaps this has nothing to do with town planning, because the real noise in most of our towns and cities is caused by people using engines without silencers.</P>
    <P>We will have great difficulty in dealing with our parking and traffic problems. I think many of our difficulties stem from the fact that this matter is under the control of two Departments &mdash;those of Local Government and Justice. The Department of Justice is responsible for enforcing the rules and the Department of Local Government for laying down the rules.  I do not know whether there is a proper liaison between them and I certainly do not want a third authority set up.  I suggest that the Minister should consider having all these problems relating to traffic dealt with by one Department.</P>
    <P>Section 13 refers to the preservation and improvement of amenities by local authorities and the making of special <Col N="804" /> Amenity Area Orders.  That is all very fine but the difficulty most local authorities have in this respect is adequate funds and provision should be made for this in the same way as money is made available for the removal of existing buildings.  That is very often an expensive business, a very uneconomic proposition for most local authorities.  For years, we have been playing ducks and drakes with moneys in the Road Fund: we have been pouring out money on mountain roads nobody has ever heard of and which nobody ever wants to use.  I would therefore draw the Minister's attention to the fact that it could not be regarded as an illegal raid on the Road Fund if he were to make money available from it to provide 100 per cent. grants to local authorities for the laying down of amenity roads and roads through all housing schemes.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to the alteration and removal of existing buildings, advertising hoardings and it discusses advertisements.  An immediate halt should be called to the erection of advertisement hoardings, but we should not, of course, approach this matter in the same way as we would approach the piggery problem in Dublin.  This requires examination because there are people involved who have enjoyed a certain income for a considerable period from the letting of space for these hoardings.  It would be very harsh treatment of them to take away their earnings in this regard. My hope would be that it would be the local authority which would decide and not the Department of Local Government or the Minister.  If these assets are going to be taken away, then those who enjoy them should be generously compensated.</P>
    <P>The prevailing opinion seems to be that, if we are going to have town planning, we must try to get out of compensating anybody who owns anything. The idea is all too general that, if we are going to take away a piece of land or a building, we should be ashamed to give the owner a reasonable price for it.  That is not the way to do business.  We should have a businesslike attitude in all this.  If an asset is going to be removed, or a <Col N="805" /> business injured, because of the implementation of town planning, then there should be a reasonably generous approach to the aggrieved party and not the skinflint attitude that has prevailed up to this.  As many have said, there were in the past delays after delays and most of the delays were caused because of the parsimony of the officials involved.  I know there were cases&mdash;I know this will be thrown back in my face&mdash;in which people asked 20 times the value.  I am not speaking about those.  I am speaking about those who ask only for reason, and do not get it.  Every one of us has had experience of the stand that can be taken by officialdom and the stupidity of officialdom when it is a question of making a deal between the owner of some property and the local authority which wants the property.</P>
    <P>As far as planning goes, the ESB and CIE seem to be outside the law altogether.  They can do what they like. They can put wires anywhere they like, or build anything they like; and get away with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>I was about to say that.  I have in mind some of the extraordinary contraptions these bodies have put up all over the country.  I am hoping that under this measure we will be able to get them to remove these and put them underground.  That can be done at fairly reasonable cost.  Local authorities and local officials&mdash;I put the local authorities before the local officials&mdash;should have power to give a direction to, say the ESB to put wires underground.  Equally, the ESB should have the right of appealing, if they so desire, to the local court.</P>

      <P>I am sure they would, but I know that the ESB does not, of course, produce its current with water or coal alone.  What the collectors collect is important ammunition.  I am not being tough now with the ESB, though <Col N="806" /> there are occasions on which one should be tough; an illustration of such an occasion was the Fitzwilliam Street project.  That was officialdom run riot again.  The best method is to give the local authority the necessary power in all planning, whether it be a private individual, the ESB or CIE.  It is to the local authority the application should be made.  I consider we should start here now with this Bill, going back over a great deal of the legislation.</P>

      <P>There are those who are not very anxious to give people oral hearings.  They make up their minds.  Deputies should make it their business, when the Committee Stage arrives, to give every power possible to the local authorities and, secondly, to give the ordinary citizen the opportunity of appealing against those powers to the courts.  The powers of the courts should not be usurped by someone else.  They should not be handed over to the Department of Local Government.  This is not a new idea on my part.  I came in to public life 25 years ago.  I opposed the managerial system because it was taking power out of the hands of the local authority.  I have been opposing it ever since.  As time went on, I have <Col N="807" /> seen all the functions of local authorities being filched away from them.  I welcome this Bill now because it gives us a chance at last to call a halt to this trend.  I regret the Minister is not present.  I trust he will be sufficiently recovered to be here when the Committee Stage is before the House.  I hope that the Committee Stage will not be taken for at least two weeks so as to give Deputies time to put down amendments to these sections.  In my opinion and in the opinion of many people with whom I have spoken on both sides of the House, these sections are an attempt by the Department of Local Government to take unto themselves the power of the courts of the land and to take unto themselves all power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past few years, it has been obvious to everybody in public life that a new Town Planning Bill was necessary.  That Bill is now before the House and public representatives should seek to integrate the private rights and individual freedom of the people in a reasonable way with the necessary developments that are now being made in the public interest. These apply mainly to highways, streets, houses, parks, playgrounds and, to a certain extent, public buildings.  Provision is made by the Minister, in the Bill submitted to us, to exercise our judgment in regard to all these matters.</P>
      <P>Public transport is changing a great lot due to the fact that some railways are being closed and the heavy traffic is being diverted to public roads.  These roads must be widened and improved to take that traffic.  The building of houses, which is very extensive in the vicinity of our cities, if not done in a regular way would ultimately lead to chaos.  Deputies who criticise the provisions of this Bill ought to make some suggestions which will improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the carrying out of town planning certain qualified persons are necessary. These will include engineers for the roads, architects with town planning qualifications for the housing schemes and public representatives who will consider the public interest.  Up to the <Col N="808" /> present, the corporations in the towns have really been only advisers to the town planning authority which would include the architects appointed for that purpose and the manager.  Where a proper consideration of the problems was rightly undertaken, after a report had been made by the architect to the manager it was often the case that an objection was made by the affected party.  The local authority gave him a hearing in the presence of the architects or solicitors, as the case may be. The local authority, having heard him, then made the recommendation to the manager.  The manager sometimes might act on that recommendation or he might vary in some way the original order which he intended to make or he might confirm a complete objection. There were then 21 days for appeal to the Minister rather than to the courts.</P>
    <P>I presume that the reason for that is that the Department had its qualified personnel to deal with these problems. The courts had no such advisory body to help them to exercise their judgment in the best interests.  That is the reason, I would say, that an appeal of that nature is being included in the present measure.</P>
    <P>The point in that is that the affected person should get due notification that he has 21 days for appeal and that he can act as he thinks fit in that eventuality.  You have, then, contiguous areas where the making of roads and the building of houses on one side or other of a boundary might cause confusion.  In these cases, joint authorities were sometimes set up, as was the case, indeed, in Cork where the sub-committee of the Corporation and the South Cork Board of the county council, which was the local housing authority, met occasionally to consider any proposals coming before either one body or the other which would affect that particular district. Usually, matters were decided amicably and things worked out pretty well.  But, on other occasions, there was conflict.  I think it is proper that in this Bill, fundamentally, each public authority should get control in its administrative area.  Where it comes to the point of consultation, it should first <Col N="809" /> take place between the engineers of the two authorities and the matter should subsequently be considered, in co-ordination, by the elected representatives so that a proper decision may be reached.</P>
    <P>Some of the things that can be occur in that respect have, I am sure, come to the knowledge of elected representatives from time to time.  We have, for example, people who build a house, or take a house in a scheme thinking they will have privacy for their homes in what might be considered a cul-de-sac road.  However, subsequently houses are built outside that.  In the general interest of traffic, there has to be a link-up road.  I have seen a case in recent times in Cork suburbs where a scheme of houses was built and a link-up in the roads had to be made.  The houses on one side, say, were £2,500 and on the other side, they might have been of a little lower standard.  When it came to the link-up area, there was a space for only one house and because two semi-detached houses similar to the other houses could not be built, the town planning architect would not allow the site to be built on. That is taking the matter too far.  A certain amount of variety is necessary in particular schemes and we do not want that conformity which insists that only one type of house can be built in an area.  The alternative was to let that as an open space but, as Deputy Colley and others have said, that would eventually become derelict, a dumping ground and a weed garden, which would spoil the appearance of the whole place.</P>
    <P>There are too many of what are called open spaces, too small to be playgrounds or to have houses built on them.  They are there because of a statistical regulation that there must be a certain amount of open space. Generally, these open spaces are at the end of the road so that on entering a scheme, the first thing one sees is this place flourishing with weeds and thistles which eventually spread their seeds over all the adjoining gardens. Would it not be better to add that space to somebody's garden or the garden of at least two people so that it would be under control rather than <Col N="810" /> left in this way?  It is not an open space if it is a garden but it is an open space if it is a place for growing weeds and dumping.  When laws or regulations are carried to that extent, they nullify the idea behind the legislation.  Under this Bill, I hope this problem of open spaces will be dealt with in a different way.</P>
    <P>We have then the position sometimes that the owner of a field in a housing site is told that field cannot be built on.  He cannot use it for any other purpose.  That may have been his original idea in taking over the property, that housing schemes could be extended there in due course but it is left there and he will get no compensation for it.  He will not allow it to be taken over as a sportsfield because his windows may be broken by ballplaying and so on.  The only solution is to have these open spaces compensated for and devoted to some useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Sometimes a case arises where a road has to be widened at some future date and an owner of a house might feel some repairs have to be done in order to keep the house up to a certain standard. He is told he cannot do it because sometime in the future road widening will take place.  He will get no grant to do that job.  Why not let that work be done and give the man his grant so that that place will not become derelict in the midst of other property? One need not go to a whole lot of expenditure but the person should be entitled to assistance through the grants made available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the defects I have seen in the present system.  There is also the question of ordinary derelict sites.  Sometimes it is difficult to get owners to co-operate.  They will not build on them or give them over to any public purpose.  Perhaps they will build a cement block wall around it so that it can no longer be designated as a derelict site and then tin cans and other rubbish are thrown over the wall and the rats congregate there. The whole surrounding property depreciates in value and annoyance is caused to the people concerned.  This Bill will help local authorities to devote these sites to some useful public <Col N="811" /> purpose.  I welcome this Bill for that reason and for the other reasons I have stated.</P>
    <P>At the moment, there are, too, advertising people who will try to forestall the provisions of this Bill when it becomes an Act by making application to the local authorities in regard to putting up advertising signs in all kinds of undesirable places.  As a matter of fact, if there is any delay in the decision they put them up here, there and elsewhere, and take a chance on it. They will not get away with that if we keep our eyes open when we come to the section of the Bill dealing with these matters.  If they put them up without authority, they should be removed or those who put them up should be compelled to remove them, so that we would not have these eyesores and unsightly erections where they should not be.</P>
    <P>The intention of this House, and I am sure of all elected public representatives, is to make things as pleasant, and as happy and as beautiful, as they can for the people who reside in the various districts, and to make their roadways as safe as they can be made for those who use them.  This Bill, as I say, is wide enough in its scope to ensure that, in future, extensions of our housing schemes will not be conglomerations of alley-ways which they have been in the past.  I am sure Deputies will use their brains and efforts to make this Bill, when it leaves the Dáil, worthy of its purpose and generally useful in the interests of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I have not had as much opportunity of studying this complicated piece of proposed legislation as I should have liked.  Without doubt, it is one of the most important Bills to come before the House for consideration.  I should like to congratulate Deputy Colley on his very thoughtful, restrained and well-informed speech on the Bill.  I think it is correct to say that his speech represented an indictment of the Corporation in regard to certain matters, and it also pointed out some serious flaws in previous town planning legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> May, I express the sincere hope that the objects of this Bill will, in fact, be realised?  My experience of planning, particularly where local authorities are concerned, leads me to have serious misgivings on this point.  The record of the county council in Mayo in regard to housing, one of the principal objects of planning and development, is a sorry one.  Despite the passage of various Bills through the House, no effort appears to have been made in Mayo, or in the adjoining counties, to get rid of the evergrowing number of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>Certainly, planning is urgently needed but I have misgivings, as I say, as to whether the objects of the Bill will be put into operation without venality or without corruption at some level.  I have misgivings about the system which gives power of decision on appeals exclusively to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has been suggested by Deputy Gallagher, and possibly by others, that it is not desirable that a private citizen should not have the ordinary right of appeal to the courts in matters as important to him as the price he will get for his land or whatever rights are being acquired from him.  I support that suggestion, not merely in principle, but because of my experience in regard to ministerial appeals down the years.  A lot depends on the personality and the ability of the Minister and whether he happens to be either incompetent or indifferent.  A situation has been reached where it is impossible for a person to find out the basis of the decision which has been communicated to him.  It is of no use to a private citizen to be told: &ldquo;The Minister in coming to his decision had to have regard to ...&rdquo;, followed by a lot of Civil Service gobbledygook, entirely meaningless to the ordinary person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In matters in dispute between two planning authorities the Minister certainly should have the right to determine between the two what should be done as, for instance, when two county councils are involved in one area or, as for instance, in the case of Portmarnock referred to by Deputy <Col N="813" /> Sherwin.  In that sort of internal problem the Minister should have power and should be able to discharge it effectively, but in a Bill which is bound to affect the rights and privileges of so many citizens it is going too far to invest in the Minister alone the sole right of determination.</P>
    <P>The questions regarding housing development that were raised by other Deputies caused me to think about the relative value of the local authority as against the private builder. I honestly think that over the past 15 years or so&mdash;during which I have taken an active interest in these matters&mdash;the efforts of the private builders have been very much more successful and economic than those of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear&mdash;if it is possible to have it&mdash;on the one side a break down of the figures for the cost of putting up local authority houses&mdash;the cost of development, the amount levied on the rates and, in particular the cost of the upkeep of the houses&mdash;and on the other side similar data in regard to houses put up by private company builders.  That is why I say again what I said at the beginning, that it is not enough merely for the House to pass a very laudable piece of legislation like this, with very laudable objects, unless there exists the machinery and the men with the determination to see that these objects are realised.  I have the gravest misgivings as to whether we have in this country at the moment the machinery or the people capable of achieving the objects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies who mentioned the effect on the tourist industry, and indeed, on the ordinary amenities of the life of the people, of the undesirable type of advertisement that has come here in recent years, I wholeheartedly approve of the inclusion of tourist amenities generally and advertising particularly, within the scope of this Bill.  I can only hope that the various authorities will exercise their statutory rights when they have them, particularly with regard to advertising, because in recent years the face of this pleasant land is becoming scarred by an undesirable type of hoarding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> I must compliment the Minister and his staff on having this Bill prepared. It is immensely complex and of very broad scope and I accept and I know that it is brought in with the intention not merely of remedying the defects that have become apparent in the operation of previous town and country legislation, but of having the entire country put under a sensible system of planning and development in regard to the various matters for which it is designed.  The criticisms I have offered do not reflect on the Minister or his staff but are directed towards the fact that our duty here is to protect the citizen, to protect his rights and make sure whatever legislation leaves this House will not infringe in any way the rights which the ordinary citizen is entitled to enjoy.</P>
    <P>There are some other points which occur to me in connection with the Bill which I think would more suitably be discussed at a later stage because this is a Bill which, unless it is very carefully studied on its way through this House, will lead to interpretative disputes afterwards and possibly to expensive litigation, so that whatever points of detail that have occurred to me, or will occur during the closer study I hope to make of the Bill during the next week or so, can be brought forward on Committee Stage.  Once again, I compliment those involved in the preparation of this Bill and with Deputy MacCarthy and other speakers, express the fervent hope that we will be able to achieve the objects of the Bill without, in the process, creating another bureaucratic monster which will swallow this House, its representatives and the ordinary people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with the remarks made by the previous speaker, Deputy Flanagan.  The Minister and his officials are to be complimented on this very complex and detailed Bill.  The Minister has also earned the thanks of this House for the method in which he introduced the Bill and the opportunity he has afforded councillors and other people interested in town planning of studying details of the Bill and his Second Stage speech.  I am <Col N="815" /> aware that various local authorities have been attended by either officials or experts on planning and that they have been asked to go into the provisions of the Bill in as much detail as possible and submit their observations to the Minister.  The entire approach has been as it should be, that is, that this is not to be a politically controversial piece of legislation but an attempt to bring in planning and development measures which we, the majority of the members of the House, feel will be in the best interests of the citizens as a whole.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the former speaker that these details will best be discussed on the next stage and I should just like to make some general observations. I am very glad this Bill recognises the fact that from now on the town or the urban built-up area will no longer remain the centre of preoccupation.  The development of the territory, both town and country, in a properly planned and organised way is, in my view, of vital importance to the general welfare of the country.  I believe we should deal with the planning of this island on a national level and we should learn from other European countries how to divide our regions or sub-regions.</P>
      <P>The theory is that the region would have, first, a capital town.  The region, say, around Dublin would naturally have Dublin as the capital; Cork region would have Cork, and so on. This town would have a university, thus being the centre of culture, and it would have a regional hospital which would have the special equipment required for rare operations.  The courts would be centred there and thus most of the competent lawyers would also be assembled there.  It would be the commercial centre, containing big stores, banks and so on, and the administrative centre, having at least one newspaper if not more circulating generally in the area, and it would ensure specialist services of all kinds in the region of which it is the capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the sub-region, there will be the chief towns.  Here the chief town would have most of the essential <Col N="816" /> functions&mdash;administration, education, culture, health and commerce, but it would not have a university, for instance, just secondary, primary and technical schools.  Its hospitals would send some of the patients requiring special attention to the hospital in the regional capital.  It should also be the main centre of attraction for industry and employment.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the way to zone this sub-regional capital would be all the territory that a person can reach by ordinary transport in from half an hour to three-quarters of an hour. In that way, the services required for industrialisation can be centralised and therefore provided in the most economic way.  Any of the population who cannot be employed locally outside the capital can easily travel to the town for employment and not break with the family ties.  I believe the attachment of a man to a locality or home is an essential element in planning and must play a most important part in any development plan.</P>
    <P>Development here in recent years indicates that there is a general tendency to underestimate the demand for dwellings and communal facilities. Dublin Corporation have been very badly caught out in this respect.  Now that this has been brought home to them, they find it will take them years to get into reasonable production of houses and to catch up on the back-log created by their lack of foresight in this matter.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept as other than gross exaggeration the City Manager's statement as reported in the Official Corporation Reports, reference, 1962, No. 132, Page 478, where the City Manager says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have frequently referred to the fact that the number of new dwellings <Col N="817" /> under construction and becoming available in any particular year represents the result of policy which was settled several years previously. The determination to acquire a particular housing site, the legal formalities involved in seeking authority for the compulsory acquisition of all the interests in that site, the examination usually involving public Sworn Inquiry by the Minister of the application for compulsory acquisition powers, the de-tenanting and clearance of the site when authority to acquire it has been received, the planning, sanctioning and execution of development works and finally the planning, tendering for, and carrying out of housing construction schemes, entail a time lag of not less than five years on average, and in individual cases very often double that time.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In 1960/61 the previously increasing vacancy rate started to reverse itself ... .  Immediately that tendency became pronounced steps were taken again to develop the momentum of increased housing production.</P>
    <P>That is from the City Manager's report.</P>
    <P>Six years ago I urged that the site development be proceeded with in Edenmore as the demand for houses would increase as the country's economic position improved, with an upsurge in demand.  This time lag would be largely overcome had I been listened to at that time.  I was accused of making a Party political speech but now we can see that either the Corporation's officials were shortsighted or the politicians opposed to our view succeeded in obstructing progress in an effort to put a smokescreen around the fiasco of 1956/57.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem that the Housing Department are now trying to step up production and it is to be hoped that the output of houses will be sufficient in the future to catch up on the back-log and eliminate the hardships caused by their failure to <Col N="818" /> build sufficient houses in the past two or three years.</P>
      <P>In good planning it must be remembered that the industrial development that will take place as a result of the regional plan will bring about a rising living standard, which in turn will bring an increased demand for material and cultural pleasures.  It will also influence the family structure. Therefore, in the future, we must make allowances, first, for more dwellings, because there will come a change of the family structure, a splitting up of households, and so forth; secondly, we need better dwellings because the demand will be created with higher living standards for a better type of dwellings.  The Corporation, I am glad to say, have made progress in this regard by now providing five-roomed houses in their newer schemes.  Thirdly, we want more convenient dwellings, that is, more convenient to places of employment, because married women will earn their own living to an increased extent.  Fourthly, there will be an increased demand for communal facilities because industrial development will gradually result in a reduction of working hours and there will be more leisure time.</P>

      <P>The Bill deals with proper planning and development of cities and towns and the Deputy seems to be discussing the question of housing <i>per se,</i> which would not be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on the general theory of planning as laid down in various planning reports at international conferences and this is the general theory of what town planning should do.  It should lead to increased demand for better housing, increased industrialisation, increased standards of living, demand for better type housing.  I am hoping that these remarks will induce Dublin Corporation in particular and other local authorities, to display more foresight than they have shown in the past in anticipating what the future demand will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they had done that in the last few years we would not be faced with what is probably one of the worst <Col N="819" /> social problems that we have in Dublin today, that is, the inability of the Corporation to provide the required number of dwellings, for which the money is available and has been available for a number of years.</P>
    <P>When the first steps towards the realisation of a plan for the development of a residential area have been taken, it is important to make sure that there is a reasonable chance of continuous development.  Only in this way is it possible to ensure the necessary economy.  It is important to utilise as soon as possible the roads, the sewerage and other communal facilities provided with a view to future housing development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is especially important to note that low building costs, which are relied upon to raise housing standards for the ordinary citizen, can only be obtained if development is stable.  A rational housing production with industrialisation as the final goal is only possible by long-term planning in this field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Bill itself, I have some specific fears. I believe that the payment of compensation for properties that will be affected by the town plan, assuming Dublin Corporation bases its future plan on the plan that is already in existence, might run to a figure in the region of £40,000,000.  As I read the provisions of the Bill, the owners of properties that might be affected can claim compensation immediately and demand payment within six months.  It is needless to remark that if such a thing should happen it would involve an immediate very sharp increase in rates, which I estimate at over 15/- in the £.  Therefore, should such a thing happen, I should like an assurance from the Minister that moneys will be available from the Local Loans <Col N="820" /> Fund, either interest-free or duty-free, or by way of grant, to handle any sudden rush on the municipal funds, which would impose grave hardship on the ratepayers who, to my mind, are already contributing enough for the services they are getting.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views on that aspect of the compensation provisions.  It may be that I have misinterpreted them but it seems to me that anybody who will be affected by a plan drawn up may claim compensation immediately although his property may not be touched for ten or 20 years.</P>

Since no planning scheme has been brought into operation, no application to the district court could be made under Section 52.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether women whose husbands have disappeared for periods in excess of twenty years can be deemed eligible for widow's pension, if qualified in every respect save for proof of their husband's death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Women whose husbands have disappeared for periods in excess of 20 years cannot be deemed eligible for widow's pension, if qualified in every other respect, by reason of that fact alone.  However, applications for a widow's pension in such cases are carefully considered on their merits and a pension is awarded if the evidence available is considered sufficient to warrant the reasonable presumption of the husband's death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are in his Department a very large number of cases of this character in which it has been impossible to produce evidence of the nature to which he refers, evidence deemed to be conclusive of the husband's death? By reason of that, these women are apparently permanently deprived of ever having access to the widows' pension code because they will never be able to prove their husbands are dead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary to produce conclusive evidence.  As I said in my reply &ldquo;if the evidence available is considered sufficient to warrant the reasonable presumption of the husband's death&rdquo; a pension can be granted.  There are, in fact, cases on record where pensions were granted, and the husband subsequently materialised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious matter. I know a number of women in this position in my own constituency.  If the Minister examines his records he will find that, for every pension so granted, 50 or 60 applicants are rejected.   Where a woman is of pensionable age, and her husband disappeared 40 years ago, that cannot be accepted by the Department as presumptive evidence of death.  It is now quite manifest that no such evidence can ever be produced of a character that will bring that woman within the pensions code.  There ought to be some provision whereby a protracted period of disappearance will be accepted in itself as evidence of death to enable the woman to qualify for the widow's pension.</P>

      <P>The person referred to has been employed as herd on this 342 acre estate on a temporary part-time basis for the past year.

The part-time employment has been terminated in accordance with his written agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

The Land Commission take the view that it is not compatible that he should be whole-time employed on building construction work and that, at the same time, he should be part-time employed on herding.  He is employed <Col N="839" /> on building construction work at the moment.</P>

He was asked to do more work than his terms of appointment required.  That was why the complaint came.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;Europa&rdquo; stamps issued in September last were printed in Dublin.  The sales for philatelic purposes, which I presume is what the Deputy has in mind, are estimated very tentatively at £33,000 as compared with the previous record for such sales estimated at about £13,000.  This was for the previous issue of <Col N="840" />&ldquo;Europa&rdquo; stamps&mdash;also produced in Dublin&mdash;in 1960.</P>
      <P>The question of improving the stamps in our permanent series is still under examination, and the matter raised in the last part of the Deputy's question is one aspect of that examination.  As I have previously indicated, the matter is complex and early results cannot be expected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a house for the former Director-General of Radio Éireann was an exercise of a power incidental to the functions of the Authority.  The purchase was financed by a repayable interest-bearing advance made to the Authority under Section 23 of the Broadcasting Authority Act.  I understand that the total capital cost including renovations and decorations was £10,550 and that the property was let to the former Director-General at an economic rent. The purchase involved no cost to public funds.</P>
      <P>I am not, at present, aware of the Authority's plans regarding a house for the new Director-General but I understand that the Authority also intends to provide him with a suitable unfurnished house at an economic rent.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if a landlord who receives repair grants from the State and the local authority for the repair of a house in which there is a tenant is entitled by law to increase the rent of such house under the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, whereby the landlord is entitled to 15 per cent. increase by way of rent on the first £100 expanded in excess of two-thirds of the basic rent and 8 per cent. on the next £100 or part thereof; and, if so, if he will consider having the law amended to prevent such happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 10 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, a landlord who incurs expenditure in excess of two-thirds of the basic rent on putting a dwelling into a reasonable state of repair is entitled to increase the rent by a percentage of that excess of expenditure. Subsection (8) of that section provides, however, that the amount of any repair grants he receives shall not be reckoned as part of his expenditure on the repairs.</P>
      <P>In effect, therefore, the landlord can only increase the rent by the prescribed percentage of the amount of the excess expenditure which he has had to bear himself.  I do not think that any amendment of these provisions would be justified.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was asking the Minister to examine the implications that might arise if there were a sudden demand for compensation for all the properties affected in Dublin city at the time of the implementation of a town plan under this Bill.  I was endeavouring to get some assurance from him that a very severe burden would not be placed on the rates.  I realise that as properties are demolished and new properties erected in their place, these properties will be of greater valuation and therefore bring in a greater return for the same poor law valuation than the old properties that were demolished.  In time, this question of rates will balance itself out.  The only thing I am concerned about is that a majority of the people who might find their property is to be affected in the course of the next 20 or 30 years would claim immediately for compensation because they cannot have any future plans for that property and, as a result, the demand would be enormous and beyond the capacity of the Corporation to pay unless they got assistance from local Government funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority in planning matters should not, I think, be allowed to decide on any particular development without acquainting the property-owners in advance of their proposals and in this way give the owners an opportunity of putting forward alternative proposals where practicable.  In the general zoning outlined in Dublin no great problem will arise but I am aware of properties in County Dublin which have been zoned for particular development and the owners were unaware, up to a short time ago, that these properties had been zoned and were marked for development as car <Col N="845" /> parks, parks or open public spaces. Therefore, when owners were not concerned with what might happen their properties for some time, the local authority might say: &ldquo;We are not satisfied with the condition of that property.  Unless you do something with it we are going to acquire it and make a car park out of it,&rdquo; or whatever they had in mind, thereby giving the owner an opportunity of saying: &ldquo;I am going to do some development myself which may fit in with your general planning scheme.&rdquo;  I think an owner is entitled to that courtesy. That matter was dealt with under Section 6.</P>
    <P>I notice in Section 7 (1) (b) that service with notice can be made by leaving the notice at the address at which a person ordinarily resides or, in the case in which an address for service has been furnished, at that address.  That means when you leave the notice you have then complied with your statutory obligation.  That is very loose and I think any such notice served by local authorities involving property should be served by registered post.  I have taken quite an interest in various local development bodies.  There are several in the constituency I represent.  Most of them can be congratulated on what they have been trying to do although many of them have not made as much progress as they would like or as I, as a public representative, would like them to make.  I ask the Minister to consider, in the provisions of this Bill, the setting up of development bodies which would form themselves into limited companies and these limited companies would have 50 to 100 separate householders as shareholders. Fifty or 100 individuals would buy £1 shares and then you would have what would be required as a limited company of the type I have in mind.</P>
    <P>This company would have, say, a Board of Directors of five, say, the then parish priest or some other person whose office would be continuous, a director appointed by the local authority, another by local government and two appointed by the general shareholders.  This company, of course, must not be a profit-making concern <Col N="846" /> but I think provision could be made to allow certain expenses and, perhaps, one paid official could be attached to it.  Its objects would be those which local development bodies usually have, provision of public amenities, community halls, swimming pools, sports grounds, libraries and other such items which the local authority would like to provide but is slow in providing because of the financial implications.</P>
    <P>I believe if such a company or body could be formed that would be recognised by the State, that where some scheme undertaken by them was one which would normally qualify for an 80 per cent. grant as an emergency relief scheme, the local authority could provide ten per cent. of the cost and the local body itself should raise ten per cent. by public subscriptions in its area. Where no grant is attached to the scheme they had in mind, then the State could provide one-third of the cost, the local authority one-third and let the residents raise one-third by public subscriptions.  There could be snags in this and I have been trying to think of ways by which they could be overcome and this is the closest I can get to it.</P>
    <P>If such bodies could be devised and set up with proper rules and regulations and articles to ensure their activities are in the public interest, then I believe that progress in the development of local amenities would be very much speeded up because citizens themselves would belong to the body responsible for speeding up development. Unfortunately, at present, there is a lagging behind in this type of development.  Sportsfields, schools, churches, community halls, libraries and so on are not provided until many years after the Corporation housing scheme has been completed.  Initially, we would have buses travelling to the old schools and it would be some years before new schools are open.  Every effort should be made to have all these amenities developed within the housing scheme.  One way of doing that would be to provide that, when the Corporation or local authority draw up a housing scheme, that housing scheme should include the other amenities required in the area and that the inclusive <Col N="847" /> cost of the entire scheme should be subject to Government subsidy. The subsidy should be payable on local halls and other amenities required.  You would then have a much better chance of having these things developed side by side with the housing scheme and you would not have these open spaces which still exist in my constituency where building finished several years ago.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill for extending water supplies.  These provisions are quite good but I have no doubt that some existing water supplies are below what ordinary medical requirements would expect.  I came across a case where a certain industry in the midlands was using a town supply and having had the water analysed, got a report to the effect that the water was certainly not fit for human consumption.  Having been surprised to hear that, I made further inquiries and a local official in the area told me afterwards that each year for several years previously, they had been agitating for new filtration beds, etc., but when the rates meeting came at the end of the year they said: &ldquo;We will cut that out; put it back for another year.&rdquo;  They agreed the existing supplies were not good enough.  It is not just sufficient to have running water in the area.  We must never be satisfied that it is good enough unless there is clean water available to everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill allow a certain amount of elasticity.  Dublin Corporation were forced by court order to produce a plan and then found themselves bound to that plan. They could not move from any of its provisions in the slightest and as the years went by, they found the original plan needed amendment as new ideas and proposals came before them.  The only way it could be dealt with was by appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this Bill allow any plan drawn up to be changed.  If I remember rightly, the provisions are that every three years or so the plans would be looked at and changed if the local authority so desire.  As I read them, the plan can be changed for <Col N="848" /> every individual proposition brought forward.  You can have a plan and somebody comes along with a proposal that is not in accordance with the plan and the local authority, as I read this legislation, can say: &ldquo;We will change that under Section 20&rdquo; and that is all there is to it.  In other words, you have not a plan at all.  You will still be working in a very loose type of way.  There should be a minimum period of from two to three years.  For instance, every two years you can look at your plan and at the changes that have taken place during that period but certainly not sooner than every two years.</P>
    <P>In Section 21, I notice there is provision regarding advertisement in one newspaper circulating in the area. That could be <i>The United Irishman</i> in Dublin.  It could be a paper with a very small circulation which nobody buys in order to read what the local authorities advertise in it.  In the paper I mentioned, they do not advertise at all.  That is the extreme case.</P>
    <P>It could be that in some of the areas where there is a local newspaper that local newspaper is not the paper most extensively read in the area.  Provision should be made that such advertisements should always be placed in the national newspapers, that is, in the three morning national newspapers. There might be circumstances in which there are substantial papers that are more or less national papers and that certainly have a very extensive coverage of the areas in which they are principally circulated.  The description &ldquo;one newspaper circulating in the area&rdquo; could be tidied up.  That might require examination.  People can come along with the genuine plea: &ldquo;I never saw it.  I never had that paper at all. There is nothing in it but local gossip.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There are also provisions regarding car parking space and open spaces in the measure.  I should like to know what the Minister considers is reasonable.  I have come across a case in point.  It is now subject to appeal to the Minister, having been rejected by the Corporation.  A man proposes to build a new public house.  He is in an area acquired by the Corporation.  He has retained his licence and he is to build a new public house in the suburbs.  He has acquired a substantial site in a populous area where the population increase has been sufficient to merit the transfer of the new licence to it.  His difficulty is that the Corporation want ten parts of the site devoted to car parking space and one part of the site devoted to the public house and stores.  That, to my mind, is quite excessive considering that there is a cinema adjoining this property where I would say there is car parking space for about ten cars and the cinema, I am sure, can hold 800 to 900 people.  There are other public houses in the area that have no car parking facilities at all.  Because we want to improve the situation, I do not believe we should change it to the extent that we now say we want ten parts car parking space and one part building space.</P>
      <P>Again, a lot of local Government legislation is largely permissive.  It is up to the local authority to interpret it.  However, if something is incorporated in the measure there should be some indication of the Minister's view and intention in regard to it.  As I said in my opening remarks, if all the various authorities have prepared their local plans, then the Department, to my mind, should examine them with a view to having what we might call an overall national plan so that we would not have any great variations between one administrative district and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of Section 37, the local authority may come in and say: &ldquo;We do not want that factory there.  We shall acquire it.  It is not suitable according to our plan.&rdquo;  They may come in and acquire it.  What is not provided for in the Bill is what use should be made of the building afterwards.  I know some factories in <Col N="850" /> my constituency that will probably be affected under this section as it stands. I know buildings which would make excellent communal halls.  Once they say: &ldquo;We shall acquire that factory because it is a nuisance&rdquo; we may well ask: what is it suitable for?  What is the Corporation's authority to dispose of it?  Will they just say: &ldquo;This is money spent for planning reasons&rdquo; and level it or can they utilise it by giving it to some association for more desirable purposes?  On that point, I should like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>In Part 5 of the Bill, I think the word &ldquo;areas&rdquo; is rather too broad and that we should always stick to the principle that each proposal should be considered on its merits.  To my mind, each owner in the area referred to in that section should be notified by registered post.</P>
    <P>Regarding rights of way, I think there might be administrative difficulty. It may be said that such and such is a right of way but somebody might wander off the particular right of way, as defined, if it is not clearly marked. Under Section 49, they can be quite severely dealt with.  I should like also to be sure that the owner of private property will in these sections be protected in some way.  I know what the section is designed for.  I know it is designed to prevent landowners from closing up our beaches and other beauty spots and that is a most desirable thing.  However, so long as the provisions in the measure do not go too far, I am quite happy.  Perhaps the Minister will make some comment on that when he replies.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Section 51 might lead to the end of certain political meetings, certain church processions where amplifiers are used and interfere with the mass X-ray service which uses amplifiers?  These are things we must consider.  Some way or other, the permissible functions under this section should be itemised.  In that regard, I do not know why CIE should be the only people who, I understand, are entirely excluded from these provisions.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to Section 83 under which the local authority has compulsory powers to come into a man's front garden, dig it up and lay <Col N="851" /> down whatever services need to be put through the front garden.  There is no provision I can see whereby the local authority must come back and put that front garden into a proper state of repair.  It is certainly necessary to have powers available to enable development to be carried on but there should be adequate protection for the owner of private property to ensure he will not be at financial loss or be seriously inconvenienced as a result of our planning provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill still recognises the right of appeal to the Minister.  I have heard it said&mdash;I am sure there is no truth in it&mdash;that if a certain developer goes over the corporation's head and gets a plan approved on appeal, he is then treated like a bad boy by the planning officers and difficulties are put in his way because he had the nerve to go over their heads.  I do not believe the officials I dealt with would act in such a childish way, but if there could be the slightest suggestion that that kind of thing might happen, then there should be some other form of appeal available to developers than a direct appeal to the Minister.  This appeal to the Minister can only lead to charges of political corruption, charges of favouritism, and so on.  They can create a great deal of work for a local representative who might believe that a certain amenity should be provided but which, according to the experts, is absolutely out as far as good planning is concerned, and when his efforts with the Minister fail he is then held up to ridicule by the people on whose behalf he was making representations.</P>
    <P>If there were a right of appeal to some form of inquiry or court where the matter could be threshed out by somebody adequate and competent to judge such appeals, then a lot of unwarranted talk could be completely done away with.  Any provisions which can lead to suggestions that belittle the dignity of this House and the members in it should be avoided if possible.  There must be some provision for an appeal, I agree, but as the Minister for Justice last year did away with the practice of restoring licences <Col N="852" /> taken away by the courts, the Minister for Local Government should now consider a different form of appeal in regard to town planning.  The more these appeals are considered in public the better it is for the administration and for relations between the official and the ordinary member of the public.</P>
    <P>These are the matters that occurred to me when I read this Bill.  I realise that a Bill of this nature could not be compiled that would have complete agreement at once from everybody. However, the Minister has made an honest and genuine attempt to deal with all the weaknesses in our previous town planning legislation which have become apparent.  I sincerely hope he will get the co-operation for which he has asked from all sections of the community in his efforts to ensure that a really first class piece of legislation is passed in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that, in general principle, I fully support this Bill.  I have been worried for a long time about the deficiencies in the planning legislation generally and I feel that our whole conception of planning has been virtually non-existent as regards national government or even local government planning.  It is something with which we have only toyed instead of dealing with in a really businesslike way.  In this connection, I was delighted to hear of the action of the Minister in initiating a series of lectures by prominent authorities, most of them cross-Channel, I think, on the whole subject of planning for the benefit of the staff of local authorities and elected members of those authorities as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>And the staff of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I was invited to one of these lectures but, unfortunately, I was unable to attend.  However, I believe it is one of the first steps that require to be taken in order to get across this whole idea of planning into the public mind and, in particular, into the minds of those who are entrusted with the details of local administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea is now being accepted that <Col N="853" /> proper planning is an economy rather than the reverse.  Previously, planning was regarded with considerable suspicion and was regarded more as something for cranks and idealists. Now it is being accepted as a realistic policy to have wholehearted long-term planning.  If we can get a planning scheme in full detail and put it into operation at once, it will result in economy because the amount of money which would otherwise have to be spent on compensation will be avoided. All the time we are waiting for proper plans.  Consent has been given for the erection of new buildings which, it is more than probable, we shall subsequently regret.  Then we shall be faced with the very painful decision as to whether we shall pull down these comparatively new buildings and pay very considerable compensation or accept a plan which is far below our ideals.</P>
    <P>I am glad, in particular, that this Bill makes much better provision for the enforcement of plans and for the punishment of those who offend by erecting buildings, either without proper approval or in defiance of an existing town plan.  Up to now, it has been comparatively easy for those with enough money and enough nerve to carry on with the building in blatant defiance of the local authority and of a town plan.  This has been particularly noticeable with regard to the erection of petrol stations.  In that connection, I must refer to the fact that I have a personal interest in this matter, as a member of the motor trade, operating a petrol station myself.</P>
    <P>On this matter, it is common knowledge that the larger petrol companies, as a matter of policy, have been erecting, and are still erecting, petrol stations all over the country.  In some cases at least, they have been constructed in outright defiance of the local authority.  In my own area, in Mount Merrion, there was one case where permission was withheld and the station was erected literally overnight. As darkness fell, there was no sign of a petrol station, and as the sun came up, it was discovered that trees had been felled, petrol tanks had been <Col N="854" /> sunk in the ground, pumps had been erected above them, and everything was complete.</P>
    <P>There was another case in Blackrock where, in spite of my warning to the Minister that something was afoot, in defiance of town planning, a petrol station was erected in deliberate breach of the town plan for the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  Not content with that, an effort was made to dig up the footpath to give a wider access to the petrol station than was permitted by law.  On the first occasion, that effort was stopped in time.  The petrol company concerned made better provision on the second occasion.</P>
    <P>On the second occasion, they chose a Saturday afternoon which was the occasion of an international Rugby football match at Lansdowne Road. About 3 p.m., when all the officials of the local authority were away from their office, an assault was made on the public footpath.  It was broken up; a new entrance was laid to the petrol station; and a new footpath was put down giving an entrance to the petrol station which was far in excess of that permitted.  In due course, the company were prosecuted and a nominal fine was imposed.</P>
    <P>I have received numerous complaints in that regard.  There are others of my constituents who are owners of private houses, or small shops, who have always done everything in their power to comply with the requirements of the local authorities when making any addition or alteration to their premises. They have come to me and asked me why the petrol companies can act in this defiant way and get away with it. All I could say was that the legislation was defective, as it undoubtedly was. I hope that under this new Bill, when it becomes law, we will have no further cases of similar acts of defiance in the future.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear as to the significance of Section 87 of the Bill which refers to the granting of licences for the erection of petrol pumps on or near a public roadway.  This is probably a matter with which we can deal in greater detail on Committee Stage.  At this stage, I should like to <Col N="855" /> say that I hope the Minister has something in mind for controlling the erection of petrol stations, because the multiplicity of such sites means that a considerable additional hazard is being created on the public roadway by the multiplicity of entrances and exits on to and off the public road.  Motorists using the roads are constantly being taken by surprise by cars leaving the filling stations and coming out on the public roadway.  Again, a hazard is also created by motorists constantly slowing up in a fairly fast-moving stream of traffic in order to go into the petrol station.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom, much stricter regulations are in force, particularly on the new motorways.  I hope the Minister is keeping that legislation in mind with the intention of introducing something similar here as well.  On the British motorways, anyone wishing to open a petrol station has to comply with very strict conditions.  A petrol station may not be erected anywhere, and there is a strict limit on the density of petrol stations generally on those motorways. Any petrol station which is in operation on a motorway must give complete service to the motorists.  He must be able to give a proper selection of fuels and lubricating oils.  He may not tie himself to the supply of one type of petrol only.</P>
    <P>These are matters which are of very great concern to the motor trade in this country, because an effort, which is approaching rapidly very near to success, is being made by the petrol companies to get complete control of the retail distribution of petrol and diesel fuel.  That matter has been dealt with to some extent by the Fair Trade Commission, but, to my mind, the action taken so far to impose some sort of control falls very far short of what is required.  The Minister has inserted in this Bill a definite provision for the licensing of petrol stations.  I would urge him to consider very carefully making that section effective in controlling not only the siting but the number of petrol stations to be erected in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> With all this new legislation, it will be necessary to have a considerable number of extra staff, both in the local authorities and in the Department.  I know that many people object very strongly to any increase in the Civil Service.  The call always is that we are overburdened by civil servants and red tape.  To my mind, the curious thing is that simultaneously the same people often say to me: &ldquo;Why do the Government not control this, or stop that, or do something else?&rdquo;, quite forgetting that if the Government are to interfere more and more in the rights of private individuals and the activities of industrial concerns, they must employ additional staff.</P>
    <P>At present the lack of speed with which plans are passed or rejected by local authorities is quite appalling.  In many cases, delays are well-nigh intolerable, and that is a direct incitement to people to go ahead without consent, in the hope that they will not be found out, or in the hope that even if they are found out, the local authority can be persuaded not to take any action in the matter.</P>
    <P>On the question of appeals, I think it essential that there should be a bigger staff to deal with that matter.  Anyone trying to carry out any worthwhile addition or alteration to his premises has obviously taken a long time in preparation before he gets to the stage of furnishing a detailed plan for approval.  Once he reaches that stage, he is in a hurry.  If he finds that his plan is being passed from one official to another or if he suspects that his plan is right at the bottom of an enormous pile and will not be taken for weeks or even months, he is apt to become nearly desperate.  I hope, therefore, that it will be appreciated that additional staff will be necessary, so that when the Minister and the Government are criticised for increased expenditure, we will be prepared to take part of the responsibility, if not all of it, ourselves.  I for one am perfectly prepared for such additional expenditure and I feel that such expenditure would be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>When we come to think of a general scheme of planning for the whole country, there is a temptation to feel <Col N="857" /> that the best thing would be to have one central planning authority, but the Minister in this case has very properly decided that the preparation of plans shall be left to local authorities, in the first place, at any rate.  No one would like a plan imposed on them by the central authority.  It is far better that the local authorities, both the elected representatives and the staff, should satisfy themselves on the point and then carry out the necessary work for the preparation of the plans and thereafter accept full responsibility.</P>
    <P>On one point, however, I feel there is justification for an exception, that is in the case of the planning of roads. In Dublin, there is no doubt that the planning of roads, as far as we can see from outside, is virtually non-existent. As the number of vehicles increases, and shows signs of continuing to increase, we will rapidly reach the stage when the traffic in the city and parts of County Dublin will grind to a halt.  This is not far-fetched imagination on my part.  Anyone who has travelled on roads in Great Britain will know that that is what is happening there.  I had not travelled in England for some time, but I did so last year.  I consulted the Automobile Association on the question of a suitable route and suitable stopping places for hotels.  They assured me that anyone who could maintain an average speed of anything like 30 miles an hour on a cross-country trip, otherwise than on one of the motorways, would be doing extremely well.</P>
    <P>On our roads, an average of 30 miles an hour is the sort of speed that the driver of a heavy commercial vehicle would think nothing of, but driving in England at the moment, otherwise than on the motorways, is an ordeal which anyone would seek to avoid, if it were conceivably possible.  The roads are grossly overcrowded, far too narrow and the town and city entrances and exits are literally appalling.  Until the advent of all these new motorways, it appeared that virtually nothing was being done to relieve this pressure.  I would not like it to be thought that I am very keen on putting maximum speed on the roads&mdash;far from it.  This question of roadways should be treated <Col N="858" /> in exactly the same way as we treat the question of flooding in some of our rivers.  It is no use clearing part of a river in order to obviate flooding.  It is essential to start at the mouth of the river and work your way up, so that as the flow is eased, there is no question of its silting up and overflowing lower down.  There is no point in starting at the top or the middle and that is what we are doing on the roads in Dublin.  Every now and again, there is a sudden burst of activity and a certain stretch of road is widened, but the road leading into that wide stretch is narrow and consequently traffic coming from the narrow portion, when it reaches the wide portion, splays out right across it, just like shot from a gun.</P>
    <P>There is one example of that in my constituency, between Williamstown, at Blackrock College, and Merrion Avenue.  There is a very wide stretch of road there, with a bottleneck at each end.  It is known locally as &ldquo;Death Mile&rdquo;.  Certainly that is what it is known as to the ambulance drivers who frequently pick up casualties there from crashed cars.  It is a very wide stretch of road with a beautiful surface.  It shows that this hit-or-miss attitude of widening and improving roads is proving a source of danger and the only way to reduce the danger, if not eliminate it, is by having roads of equal width so that motorists will not be encouraged to splay out across a wide stretch, racing neck and neck to see who will get into the bottleneck first.  That is a cause of accidents.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the local authorities have far too much on their plate already and they are unable to produce a comprehensive plan for the solution of the road traffic problem of Dublin city and county.  If we take the northern side of Dublin along the coast, we have a very good road running through Marino and along the front to Clontarf.  There is a beautiful stretch of road along the old tram line and then there is a very moderate road from there on.  That again is a source of danger because that beautiful stretch, which has no junctions, is a direct incitement to any motorist to put his foot down so that cars tear <Col N="859" /> along in perfect safety until they come to the end of it and then they are in trouble.  If we take the main road to the north, there is a very slow run out through Whitehall and Santry.  I know there are plans for by-passing Santry altogether but those plans have been in existence for a long time.  A wide stretch of land has been left vacant between two large blocks of houses to allow the road to go around Santry on the eastern side.</P>
    <P>Although that plan has been in existence for many years and although, so far as I know, the land has been acquired, all main road traffic going to Belfast has to filter through the very narrow bit of road round by Santry itself and some quite dangerous bends. Then one comes out on to a very nice stretch of road just before the Airport and suddenly the road narrows again and, I am sorry to say, it is only when one gets outside the Dublin County Council area that there is evidence of road planning at all; the road improves enormously.</P>
    <P>Due west, there is little or no adequate road for heavy traffic.  The road is quite well surfaced but it is not nearly wide enough and the width of the road varies quite dangerously.</P>
    <P>So far as the Naas road is concerned, the approach to it is bad.  Any traffic going to Cork or Limerick must either work its way up through the maze of traffic in Dame Street and out through the bottleneck at Inchicore or else work up along the overloaded quays, turn off around Kingsbridge Station and work its way out in that way.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Bray road is the classical example of bits and pieces of excellent road interspersed with bits and pieces of road which are an absolute menace to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.</P>
    <P>I feel, therefore, that the Minister should now take matters into his own hands, at least as far as Dublin city and county are concerned, and set up some central road authority which will have the sole responsibility, not only for planning a new road system, but for carrying it out.  Whether that is to be done entirely from central <Col N="860" /> funds or with some contribution from local authorities is a matter which we could discuss more appropriately elsewhere. It is only in this way that we can get rid of the danger which is always present at the entrances to and exits from the city.</P>
    <P>The traffic position in the centre of the city is appalling.  One reason, of course, is the congestion on the bridges over the Liffey.  It is almost inconceivable that Butt Bridge ever handled any traffic at all in the condition in which it was 20 years ago, but even the wide bridge that it now is is hopelessly congested, not only by traffic travelling from north to south of the city but also by traffic trying to get from the north quays to the south quays.</P>
    <P>The traffic congestion at O'Connell Bridge is nightmarish also.  It is high time that we not only seriously considered but actively planned and executed at least one proper tunnel under the river.  If the entrances to that tunnel were properly placed, it could mean that traffic going from the south of the city to the north could start down the tunnel possibly as far out as Merrion Square or Mount Street, or somewhere in that area, and not come up again until somewhere round about Clontarf.  That would ease the traffic position in the centre of the city enormously.  Also leading into that tunnel there could be minor tunnels running from the north quays to the south quays.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say that this is highfalutin' nonsense and too idealistic for words but, if we do not start planning and acting now, it will be far more expensive to do it later on.  The cost of materials and of site acquisition will go up and up and every year that passes means that we are passing on an additional load to those who will come after us.</P>
    <P>Not only do we need proper facilities for crossing the river, but we also need far better facilities for getting around the city generally.  There is quite an amount of traffic which wants to move from the south to the north of the city.  There is the road along the canal which is referred to as the south ring and there is the North Circular <Col N="861" /> Road which is referred to as the north ring.  A ring road normally is and should be a road which has no intersections but the ring roads which I have mentioned have many traffic lights, crossroads and intersections of all sorts, so that progress along them is an appallingly painful procedure.</P>
    <P>We are far behind continental practice in this respect.  My experience, in even not very large cities or provincial towns in France, Italy and Germany, is that the authorities would not consider having a by-pass road, unless it was properly equipped with fly-overs so that traffic proceeding around the city or town proceeds without interruption whatsoever and traffic that has to cross the ring road goes either over or under, with connecting roads for the needs of those who wish to join the ring road halfway round.</P>
    <P>Here, again, we could look for enormously high speed.  I want to repeat that I am not advocating speeding.  I dislike it and would discourage it in any way we could.  We want to ensure, however, that traffic will proceed in a constant flow and not in fits and starts.  The waste caused in the city by engines turning over for four, five or 15 minutes while the vehicle is stationary, waiting for the traffic ahead of it to clear, is enormous.  It is a waste of time, money and material.  It increases air pollution.  By ensuring that traffic is kept flowing, a tremendous amount of that waste could be avoided.</P>
    <P>That can only be achieved by an overall plan.  Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister to consider very seriously having a central road authority for the city and county of Dublin.  If that were done, I would hope that that central road authority would act in a reasonable way by giving priority to certain roads and having those roads completed from end to end.  If it can do two roads together, so much the better, but let us get rid, once and for all, of this appalling habit of doing spasmodic improvements on short stretches of road, which tend to increase danger instead of reducing it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> Personally, I should like the Minister to go even further than that, although perhaps that is asking too much.  I hope not.  I would hope that at least the main roads in the country should be made a national charge and put under national control.  Here, again, there is ample evidence that this is the modern trend and that it can pay dividends.  The autostrada of Italy and the autobahn of Germany are marvellous arteries of traffic.  They carry a tremendous weight of traffic with great safety and while the speeds are not exceptionally high, the average speeds are far above anything we can hope to have in this country.  On the Continent, these motorways, which are of constant standard of road surface, have a uniform width throughout, and even off the motor ways&mdash;this applies even to England&mdash;there are stretches of what they call clearways where parking or stopping are not permitted.</P>
    <P>On a number of our roads, we could introduce that very rapidly because many of our roadways are unusable, by reason of the fact that so many cars are parked along the sides.  Take the Merrion Road, for instance.  For most of its length, it carries one lane of traffic in each direction, even though the total width could carry at least two lanes of traffic each way without any trouble.  However, anyone who gets into the near lane is apt to get into trouble because of parked cars. If anyone tries to increase the flow of traffic along that road by doubling up, he would be in a lot of trouble when he tries to pull out into the second lane of traffic.</P>
    <P>I should like to see this scheme of main roads under central authority covering, say, the roads from Dublin to Waterford, Dublin to Cork, to Limerick, to Galway, to Donegal and the midlands, with national main roads connecting the provincial towns and cities.  Let the by-roads, by all means, stay under the local authority. In many cases, the local authorities are doing extremely well and the general standard of road surfacing and road planning outside the city of Dublin is excellent.  But as a motoring correspondent in one of our national dailies said recently, the city and county <Col N="863" /> of Dublin are the worst serviced areas as far as roadways are concerned.  If we could have this national road authority to plan and carry out these roadways, and to plan them well ahead, with a proper system of flyovers rather than intersections, we would be investing money very wisely and very well.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that any planning legislation can be successful, if we do not regard the preparation and execution of a good road network as top priority. Once we know where the good main roads will be, we can then plan where we wish to place our industries, where we wish to have our open spaces, our dormitory areas and so on.  At the moment, we are in a tangle, with one local authority working at cross-purposes with another.  There is no proper scheme so far as I can see, in the planning of roadways.</P>
    <P>In general, I am in absolute agreement with this Bill.  I hope it will be a success and that on the next Stage, when we get down to details, it will be made clearer to me and other Deputies that proper provision has been made to ensure that the planning has been carried out.  Once the planning has been carried out, all the development from then on will be in conformity with that plan, and anyone, whether a petrol company or anyone else, who attempts to defy that plan will be punished in such a way that, having tried it once, they will make good their default and will never try it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody in this House can do anything other than welcome this Bill and admit that its presentation at this time is the result of much thought, consultation and collaboration between the Department of Local Government and the appropriate officers of the local authorities all over the country.  While this Bill is a comprehensive one and seeks to deal in a general way with the legislation thought to be necessary for proper planning, we must not lose sight of the fact that the interests of local authorities vary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to lack of <Col N="864" /> planning in the past under the old town and city planning legislation and to hold-ups, difficulties and so forth.  I think it is opportune at this moment to put on the records of this House this particular fact, and in this connection I speak for the Dublin City Council, of which I have the honour to be a member.  An Act was passed in this House which could have been opted for by local authorities.  Once opted for, they were to proceed with a town plan, for adoption and approval by the Minister, but there was one unfortunate phrase in that Bill which decreed that they must proceed with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>Since the passing of that legislation and its adoption by the city of Dublin authorities, the war intervened and all ideas of planning for the aftermath had to be shelved.  Nobody knew what was happening and immediately after the war, there was a scarcity of materials with which buildings could be repaired, improved or even new constructions proceeded with.  We in the Dublin City Council were brought to court for neglecting our duty because we had not adopted a town plan with all possible speed.  Had we so proceeded, it would have meant a heavy cost to the city.  If we were to proceed, we had also to produce as accurate an estimate as possible of the cost of the liabilities in which we would involve ourselves.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding our explanation to the court as to why it would take time to work things out, having regard to the impact on the ratepayers and on the community, the Dublin Corporation, each one of the 45 members, was told: &ldquo;Finish your town planning within so many months or you will find yourselves in Mountjoy Jail.  The lot of you will be deemed to be in contempt of court.&rdquo;  The town plan was rushed through and presented to the Minister.  Fortunately, good sense prevailed and the Minister did not adopt this rushed plan, done under difficult circumstances, a plan which we admitted quite openly was neither the plan we had hoped for, nor the plan we desired, and certainly was not a plan representative of the conclusive views of the officials and representatives <Col N="865" /> of the corporation in conjunction with, if you like, the Department.</P>
    <P>We are faced now with this new Bill. I have read the Bill but I have not been able to study it.  Indeed, I think it is beyond the capacity of any one individual to study this measure on his own. There are, however, a number of things in it which will have to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I anticipate that the Committee Stage will be a very full one.  We have already agreed in the corporation that we will have all sections of the Bill examined in detail by various committees with a view to discovering what the impact will be on the financial side, what the impact will be on our own ideas of immediate town planning development requirements, and, if these things are not covered as we would want them to be, all Parties in the Corporation, irrespective of political affiliation, will come together and jointly try, by reasoning with the Minister, to prevail on him to accept amendments.</P>
    <P>One of these will, of course, be concerned with the financial aspect.  The Bill, when it becomes law, will make the corporation liable for very large sums of money, particularly with regard to the acquisition of property, street widening, new development, and so forth.  We would like to be told to what extent the Department will assist the local authority financially.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 42 concern us also. We recognise that Portmarnock Strand is the playground of the citizens of Dublin.  We recognise we have a responsibility to try to develop that strand, to make it clean and safe, and to provide proper amenities.  For many years, we have been prepared to produce a substantial amount of money for that purpose.  There is, however, a difficulty.  The city of Dublin goes out as far as Howth.  It includes Baldoyle.  We have already done certain development work at Bull Island.  In connection with this Baldoyle-Portmarnock area, we feel that where one local authority is prepared to spend a considerable amount of money in an adjacent authority's area, being responsible for subsequent maintenance, there should be provision in <Col N="866" /> this Bill permitting the local authority making the investment to take over the area in which they are so vitally interested.  I just mention that.  I am satisfied we will make the best case we can for the inclusion of a provision on the lines I have suggested for the acquisition of property from another authority where there are good and valid reasons, without having to go through this long-drawn out process of regarding it as an extension of the city boundary.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we will be able, when this Bill becomes law, to control the ESB. Under existing legislation, that body can do what they like.  If we are considering proper planning, which will include the appearance of the city, then there must be an amendment of the Electricity Supply Acts to enable the local authority to decide whether or not wires should run overhead or whether buildings should be constructed in certain areas.  All too often these buildings are eyesores.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to all kinds of improvements.  In the Dublin Corporation, we are prevented at the moment from spending money on cleaning out dirty laneways because these laneways have never been taken over by the Dublin Corporation and are, therefore, not in their charge. Some cannot be taken over because no one knows whether the owners are alive or dead.  Objection was made to the posting of a notice when one otherwise failed to find these people. If we cannot find the owner, and if we cannot make him comply with what is expected of him on the basis of his responsibilities as owner, then we should be permitted, if a search has not been successful, to take over these laneways, following the posting of a notice.</P>
    <P>We want the present position remedied. We want this difference of opinion between lawyers as to whether we have or have not the right to take over clarified in this Bill.  If that is not done, we will not be able to do our work properly and beautiful, clean areas will continue to be surrounded by rat-infested laneways, in which people dump refuse, and which we cannot go in to clean because they do not come under the control of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> We will want, too, to have power under this Bill to acquire property, compulsorily, not for street widening and housing alone but so that we can have an area we can clear and put aside for industrial development.  We will then be able to regulate areas for industrial development and end, if we can, the building up of industrial undertakings in the midst of residential areas.</P>
    <P>Another thought of my own is this. I have not consulted anybody on it and I suppose I will be regarded as something of an extraordinary revolutionary. There will be an impact on the valuation of property if this town planning proceeds and succeeds.  There will be increases in rates.  I want to stake a claim that from this moment on we should think in terms of differential rates.  How many Deputies know that business houses and industrial concerns are allowed as overheads for income tax purposes the full cost of rates?  Yet a person living in a private house cannot recover a halfpenny allowance from the Revenue Commissioners. His rates are just part of his expenditure and are non-recoverable. I want to point out I intend to consult my colleagues and discuss with other people to see if I can at some stage get agreement that there shall be a differential in rates, so that the person who occupies his own home&mdash;the workman who owns his own home&mdash;shall be relieved to a certain extent as compared with the big industrialist who, in fact, does not pay it at all.  It is the State who pays it, because he claims it as overheads for income tax purposes.</P>
    <P>I was listening to my own colleague, Deputy Booth, almost with an open mouth in complete amazement.  He spoke with regard to roads in the city and county as a person with a great deal of theory but certainly without any knowledge or practical experience. I would object very much to the limited powers of local authorities being reduced from what they are by a takeover and by the State having control and management of our roads. We would have then another State body.  I do not know how we would <Col N="868" /> ever get through our business here because there would be about 500 questions a day concerning the management of roads.</P>
    <P>We have tried to study the road problem in Dublin.  All we have learned from that study over a great number of years is that, with the great growth in the users of roads and with the movement of people in different directions, nothing is static.  We have learned that it would be advisable, and was advisable, for us to get experts to study our traffic situation and to envisage a town plan that would cure some of the elements of our congestion and make recommendations.</P>
    <P>Butt Bridge was referred to.  I do not know whether Deputy Booth knows there were officials as well as students from the Universities for many months standing at various bridges, including Butt Bridge, counting every car that went each way, trying to find out what were the peak traffic periods, trying to follow up where they came from and where they were going, and then trying to decide where you will have a bridge, if a bridge is necessary.  That kind of study has been going on for years.  Our officials have given us lectures on this matter, including the difficulty of making decisions.</P>
    <P>We are ready to bring a road from George's Street right up into Liffey Street and to widen the Metal Bridge, as it is called.  We need a town planning Bill in order that we can acquire property.  At the same time, we must take into account what consideration we will get by way of assistance from the State, either from the Road Fund or from some other source, in order to make this development possible and as less costly as possible to the citizens of Dublin.  It is something that will undoubtedly benefit the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth spoke of a tunnel&mdash;a dream of a tunnel, starting somewhere and coming out somewhere else, with byways and sideways in it.  The idea of a tunnel is not new.  It was discussed in Dublin Corporation at least 15 years ago I would say.  One of our officials went to the great trouble of studying the details required <Col N="869" /> for a tunnel as compared with a bridge at the very same place&mdash;further down the Liffey from Butt Bridge towards the mouth.  A tunnel under the Liffey anywhere in that area would have to start somewhere at Ballsbridge in order to get the decline.  Then it would come up God knows where, probably around Phibsboro.  With the subsoil we have&mdash;we are not built on a rock like New York&mdash;it would cost umpteen millions, if anybody knew what umpteen meant.  It is beyond our calculation of worth.  A bridge is also a difficult thing to construct and decide on.  These are all in our terms of calculation as to the future.</P>
    <P>Under the old Bill, we had more or less decided to do certain things in four stages over five years.  The first thing one thinks of is roads.  I want to show Deputy Booth and put on record that one speaking here should be careful to know what one is speaking about.  He said the cost of roads should be borne by the national authority, as if that were not already so.  All the money we spend on roads&mdash;I am sure the same applies down the country&mdash; except for maintenance comes out of the Road Fund by way of 100 per cent. grant as to cost.  It is not the Government are causing the holdup; it is the ability to spend it.  We are told in Dublin that we are not going quickly enough.  The Department are on our necks telling us: &ldquo;There is £500,000 you have not spent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion we were rushed into urgent expenditure on the roads.  We were doing one end of the Stillorgan Road and doing another road parallel to it at Ballsbridge.  The then Taoiseach, the present President, was coming into Leinster House.  He could not get through the Stillorgan Road and he could not get through at Ballsbridge.  He had to make a detour because we were blocking the incoming traffic.  We can only do so much at a time; otherwise, we will only add to the existing confusion.</P>
    <P>Many of these road operations have to be done in collaboration or in conjunction with our neighbours in the county because if we widen a road and they do not widen the continuation of it, we are creating a new bottleneck. <Col N="870" /> However, I am not afraid that local authorities throughout the Twenty-Six Counties will not be able to do their work.  I believe, once this Bill passes through the House with necessary and suitable amendments to meet the different concerns of different areas, that we can then get down to doing something satisfactory in local authorities with the financial help, guidance and approval of plans by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>This has nothing to do with planning but I notice in reading the definition section the term &ldquo;statutory undertaker&rdquo;. I wonder is he going to bury somebody?  I suggest that the Minister might call him a &ldquo;statutory operator.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are many things in the Bill that have yet to be clarified to me and my colleagues in Dublin Corporation by our own officials.  There have been many meetings between local authority officials from all over the country and the headquarters, if I may call it that, at the Custom House.  There has been a friendly understanding on both sides and this measure appears to be the best that can be produced up to the present.  I believe it will be a good measure when it finally emerges from this House.  Although there are many more matters to be discussed on Committee Stage, from the point of view of accepting the Bill in principle, I do so without hesitation but with the reservation that there will have to be certain amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very comprehensive and complex measure and I wish to pay tribute to the Minister's staff for the thought and energy they have put into it.  As a member of Dublin Corporation, I also welcome the Bill as it will help the corporation by removing the rigidity from its present planning decisions.  As Deputy Briscoe pointed out, the corporation a few years ago were forced to produce a plan.  It was a very hurried measure. Staff had to be assembled and a plan produced in a couple of months.  Then a hurried meeting of the corporation was held.  Unfortunately, in the circumstances, the plan did not receive the consideration it deserved.  Overnight, property owners affected by the plans were notified by circular and in <Col N="871" /> the atmosphere of a Christmas period then existing, hurried meetings of interested traders and various associations were called.  Some meetings were poorly attended.  Some people had not an opportunity, because of business commitments, of calling such meetings to protest against the plans passed by the corporation.</P>
      <P>Since then, because the corporation itself was committed to the plan, numerous proposals had to be turned down.  Each month, the manager reports to the council with a page-and-a-half of proposals rejected, mainly because they are in conflict with that plan adopted by the corporation.  I think this Bill takes that rigidity out of the corporation plan.  The Bill proposes that the local authority within three years can make a plan.  That has to get the approval of the elected representatives.  We have the situation where local authorities, administrators and planning experts in association with the local representatives, can produce a plan for local requirements in an orderly way.  That is very desirable.</P>
      <P>The Minister has invited local development associations to give their views on any feature concerning their district and that is also very desirable.</P>
      <P>The question of appeals has been mentioned.  It is a matter of contention among local representatives and local authorites, particularly the corporation as it stands, that so many appeals have been made to the Department.  One of the unfortunate consequences of that is the long timelag in determining appeals.  I understand the Department has only one planning officer and that is one reason why appeals are so long delayed. When this Bill comes into effect, it will impose a big burden on local authorities in the recruitment of skilled planners.  I do not know how many planning experts there are in the country.  Somebody says 60.  I hope there will be an adequate number to carry out the requirements and the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with unfinished estates.  Most city Deputies <Col N="872" /> are very much concerned with this problem.  It has been an irritating feature of local government in Dublin and contiguous areas in County Dublin for several years.  The Bill will ensure that in future development suitable safeguards will be provided for the completion of these estates.  I do hope that something will be done about the existing unfinished estates in the city and along its confines. There are a large number of these estates.  Some of them lack properly developed open spaces; some are without lighting, and so on.  They have remained like that for many years.  It is a source of concern to the residents in them, some of whom have very high rateable valuations.  They have to pay their rates every year and naturally there is constant agitation for the services for which they are paying but which they do not enjoy.  I trust the Minister will come to the assistance of the local authorites who are faced with that problem.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Bill inasmuch as it attempts to deal with eyesores that spoil our amenities fringing the city, particularly seaside resorts.  I had occasion some time ago to visit a seaside resort in County Dublin.  On a Sunday afternoon, I found young men erecting wooden structures there. I do not know whether they had planning permission but I doubt if they had.  I do not believe any responsible local authority would give permission for the erection of wooden structures. Not alone were they erecting these wooden structures but they were spoiling a very nice view.  Whether this Bill will prevent that type of development in the future or whether it will meet the situation as it exists at the moment in regard to these eyesores, I am not quite clear.  I should like the Minister to deal with that point.</P>
    <P>Our road pattern was raised by Deputy Booth in his reference to the inadequate road pattern of our city. Within recent weeks&mdash;and I congratulate him on it&mdash;the Minister drew attention to that problem to the Dublin Corporation.  There is an urgent necessity to develop the approach roads that serve our city and the corporation are concerned with the problem.  They <Col N="873" /> are awaiting their consultant's report before anything can be done.</P>
    <P>A Deputy referred to the traffic counts on our roads.  A continental traffic consultant firm undertook that matter and I understand that the report is now being examined by the corporation officials.  Having examined the report and the recommendations, some steps should be taken to relieve the growing traffic congestion in our city.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of private house development in estates and the lack of open spaces there.  I hope that under this Bill it will be possible to increase recreational facilities in housing estates.  The position over the past few years is that certain sites are developed without due regard to proper recreational facilities for children.  On the other hand, the corporation give generous open spaces for such facilities. Indeed, the Department of Local Government should insist on that in any planning requirements for corporation housing estates.  I should like to see it extended to future development of private housing estates.  I realise a financial problem is involved in the high cost of building sites.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see some curb on the price developers have to pay for land for house building.  I think that high site prices are responsible for the high cost of building today and developers find it is not an economic proposition to devote more space for recreational facilities which are necessary for a normal community living in private housing estates.</P>
    <P>I hope that when this Bill reaches Committee Stage any points of contention will be discussed and, where deemed necessary, suitable amendment made.   The corporation itself, as Deputy Briscoe pointed out, is considering the measure in its various committees.  A representative committee of these has been appointed and they will formulate suitable amendments.</P>
    <P>Housing in Dublin city has also been adverted to.  This Bill will give the corporation great assistance in reaching a solution of our housing problem.  In that connection, I should like to advert to the point about co-ordination of planning schemes.  If Dublin is to cope <Col N="874" /> with the economic trends that are apparent today, co-ordination is very desirable.  I have in mind industrial activity, the demands by industrialists tor more space for the extension of factories, the erection of new office buildings and so on.  Associated with that is the demand for housing, both private and local authority housing. If these problems are to be solved, I believe there must be closer co-ordination, concentration and co-operation between the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council.  In fact, I would go so far as to suggest that both bodies should be integrated because of the overspill.</P>
    <P>The tread has been to move more out into the county.  Today, there are very few sites available for Dublin Corporation housing.  That is a matter which should be given some serious thought.   I believe it will help immensely the future of the corporation's housing problem and programme if such integration can be brought about.  Certainly, closer co-operation between the two bodies is essential, if the major problems facing the city are to be solved.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I congratulate the Minister once again on the introduction of this measure which I trust will have a very easy passage through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene briefly at this stage to make a few references to this measure which I consider is a most important one.  It is a comprehensive Bill which is bound to have a very great impact on the social and commercial life of this country for many years to come. It is a Bill into which a great deal of planning and research has gone.  In the light of the experience of the 1934 and the 1939 Acts, it was designed to be a measure that would deal adequately with the many problems which inevitably arise in the important matter of planning.</P>

    <P>Having listened to some of the speakers early on in this discussion, I think it is obvious that many of our people are inclined to regard town planning as something which merely restricts one from doing what one <Col N="875" /> wants to do, and that sometimes commercial interests try to exert undue pressure for the purpose of overcoming some of the provisions of existing legislation.  However, planning as envisaged in this Bill covers a far wider field than merely restricting persons from doing certain things in relation to building and so forth.  It takes power to develop and that is an important aspect of the Bill which is possibly overlooked by many people who think of it in terms of the type of legislation which has been in operation in this respect in the past.</P>
    <P>The amount of work which is there to be done in the way of development is very great.  The sooner a development plan can be formulated so that the public generally will know what the blueprints of planning for the future are, the better.  The Bill provides for a statement by the planning authority as to what is envisaged in the way of control of planning.  Many people wish to look far ahead, particularly in relation to the value of property and wish to know what the adopted plan for their area is.  That is a very important provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>One has only to look at the various obstacles one sees on highways and the many things on our horizons which are unsightly to realise the lack of planning in the past.  On the other hand, as is set out in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, there are many examples of very good planning in some of our past construction work throughout the country.   However, frequently going along the countryside on even a moderately long journey, one will discover many places where obstacles are erected which if any reasonable planning had been in existence, could not possibly have been placed in that position.  As regards commercial interests trying to obtrude themselves on places considered to be vantage points for the purpose of business which do not always conform to elementary ideas in the matter of proper planning, when personal interests are affected, people seem to think that nothing should stand in the way.  I do not believe for a moment, <Col N="876" /> nor does this Bill suggest in any of its provisions, that planning should sweep aside all commercial interests.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch cited the case of the ESB insisting on having the Fitzwilliam Street buildings demolished and replaced by other buildings and suggested that was an example of where town planning should be able to step in and prevent their doing so.  There are cases where commercial interests must transcend any provision of town planning, unless it is completely in conflict with the basic principles of planning as set out in any Act or in this Bill.  If we allow the aesthetic mind to run riot and have its way in the matter of enacting legislation of this type, we shall be going too far in that direction, just as, if we allowed commercial interests to dominate legislation of this type, we should be going too far the other way.  Anybody who examines this masterful piece of legislation must agree that it makes ample provision for good middle of the road planning which will meet every situation.</P>

      <P>Flexibility is the operative thing in the Bill.  It makes provision for every foreseeable case, if I may use another adjective that is not unfamiliar to the Leader of the Opposition.  It does make provision for flexibility which is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister comes to reply to the debate on this Bill, he will possibly cover all the points made by the Deputies but I wish to refer to what Deputy Lynch said.  He seemed to take particular exception to what he regarded as the complete lack of authority as regards the local representatives of the people.  If anything, this Bill goes so far in that direction that it possibly could be said that it goes too far.  The elected representatives of the local authority are the <Col N="877" /> people who will have the full say in the development plan and I do not think anything could be more democratic than that.  In fact, it could be going even a little too far because sometimes these human beings are inclined to be influenced a little by their own personal interest and it is only right to ensure there are the necessary arrangements for appeal in cases where that type of thing could possibly happen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch deplored the managerial system and regretted the passing of the days when the elected representatives had complete authority. That is something with which I do not agree at all.  I shall not follow that line of argument except in so far as it relates to the authority and control envisaged in this case.  We have given them in this Bill more control than has possibly been accorded to <Col N="878" /> them in any legislation with which we have dealt here for a long time.  I think that is right and I hope they will appreciate their responsibilities in that direction.  When it comes to urban councils and other local authorities of that type, I hope they will appreciate that their duty is to serve the general good and not that of the individual and that they will base their plan on that assumption and pursue it accordingly. To have a development plan is an important thing but the duty to pursue the various objectives set out in that plan is also imposed on the authority in the Bill.</P>
