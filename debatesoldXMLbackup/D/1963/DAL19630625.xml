      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together and to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing for each townland involved, information on the total population and number of private families, as returned at the Census of Population 1961.  It has been necessary, in order to comply with the requirements of the Statistics Act 1926 in regard to confidentiality, to combine <Col N="1530" /> the data for certain of these townlands.</P>
      <P>The information regarding the rateable valuation of all agricultural holdings in the State of which persons usually resident in the household are the rated occupiers has not been compiled for individual townlands.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">NUMBER of private families and population in certain townlands in Galway County as returned at the Census of Population, 1961.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the quantity and value of imports of linoleum and other kinds of floor coverings under the appropriate headings in the Official Import List, for the years 1958-1962 inclusive, and for the period 1st January-31st March, 1963. A revised edition of the Official Import List came into effect on 1st January, 1963, and as the figures for January-March, 1963, are in some cases not directly comparable with those for the earlier years, they are given in a separate table.</P>

      <P>Before making the Order giving effect to the proposal of the Galway Health Authority for the abolition of the Ardrahan dispensary district and the division of the district between the dispensary districts of Gort and Kinvara, I had the matter examined fully and was satisfied that the change was desirable and feasible.  If the Deputy has any grounds for thinking that the district medical officers of Gort and Kinvara are unable to perform their duties in the revised districts, I suggest that he might take the matter up with the health authority in the first instance.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>There are at least 16 airlines operating on the North Atlantic route and I am not in a position to give information as to the method used by all the companies in preparing their accounts. In so far as capital invested is equity or share capital the question of interest would obviously not arise.  I am aware that at least five companies other than Aerlinte do not show dividends on equity capital in their accounts.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any public misunderstanding of the nature referred to by the Deputy.  It is evident from the published accounts of Aerlinte taken in conjunction with the Chairman's introduction to the air companies' accounts that no dividend has so far been paid on State capital but profits have been retained for development. The Chairman has assured me that the position will be presented with the greatest clarity in the forthcoming annual report.  I made it quite clear in my speech in November last on the Vote for my Department that the air companies have not yet been able to remunerate State capital and I have also referred to the matter in reply to questions in the House and also in speeches made elsewhere.</P>

Would the Minister say whether he proposes to take any steps in respect of these people, who innocently continued to pay their premiums to the company, because it was still functioning, and who found only after the company had been granted an extension of time that the company was not, in fact, solvent when it was receiving their money?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last week, I was referring to the detrimental effect this Bill will have on the economy of the small traders and farmers in the west of Ireland.  I pointed out the injustice of high rates and the injustice of the proposed increased taxation under this Bill&mdash;increased rates, increased taxation, reduced incomes.  Whatever pittances were obtained will, under this Finance Bill, be dissipated because of the grasping hand of the Minister for Finance.  No reference whatever has been made to the capacity of these <Col N="1566" /> smallholders to pay increased taxation. Without any doubt, this proposed new taxation will increase the cost of living. In a part of the country which is subject to a very high incidence of emigration, the effect of this new taxation will be tragic.  Twenty years ago, there were 65 children on the rolls in my school.  Today there are five.  That is an example of what the position is in the west of Ireland today. From the social and national point of view, the depopulation of any area is a disaster.  Nothing can compensate for the loss of flesh and blood.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, we were promised by the present Government 100,000 new jobs in this country.  So far as the people in the west of Ireland are concerned, these 100,000 new jobs were found, but not in this country.  They were found in the large industrial cities of England&mdash;Birmingham, Coventry, Manchester and London.  That is where Irishmen and women, especially from the west of Ireland are to be found today.  If something is not done&mdash;and there is nothing in this Finance Bill to say that anything will be done&mdash;about the decay that has set in, I see nothing but disaster for the west.</P>
      <P>We know that once this turnover tax is introduced and the machinery set up for its collection, it will be an easy way to collect money and that the tax will be five per cent next year and possibly 7½ per cent the year after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, there is nothing in this Finance Bill to support, in so far as my constituency and the west of Ireland generally is concerned, the contention of the Government that industrial development and economic expansion are taking place.  The industrial development in my constituency and county has run like this: In the past few years, the Ballisodare lead mines have been closed, with consequent loss of employment to about 300 people.  At the time I appealed to the Government to start drainage of the Owenmore and Arrow which flow into the sea at Ballisodare and which work would give productive employment.  Deaf ears were turned to that appeal.  The people concerned had the emigrant ship and nothing more.  The Benbulben barytes mines have been closed for the past <Col N="1567" /> two years and have not been reopened. In recent times, the largest industry in Sligo town, the Sligo Spinning Company, closed and no other industry has replaced it.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult for me as a Deputy from the west of Ireland to listen day after day to talk from the Government benches about industrial development and economic expansion. That may be taking place in other parts of Ireland but it is certainly not taking place in the west, not in my constituency.  On the contrary, there is a deterioration in the economy due to the fact that the lands are waterlogged and we have been refused the money for drainage.  The withdrawal of the Local Authorities (Works) Act was one of the worst things that ever happened in my constituency.</P>
    <P>There are three factors militating against the people of the west of Ireland and there is nothing in this Finance Bill to deal with them.  The first is a factor that I would not expect to be mentioned in the Finance Bill but which I would expect the Government to appreciate.  It is the fact that in the west of Ireland the rainfall is higher than the average for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had expected that there would be something in the Finance Bill to deal with that aspect of our case.  The second factor affecting <Col N="1568" /> the west of Ireland is that due to the excessive rainfall, there are many aquatic plants-rushes and flaggers. All these things militate against our increasing our economy and the Government have turned a blind eye to them.</P>
      <P>The third factor that we have to contend with in my constituency and the north-west generally is the Fianna Fáil Government who never seem to appreciate or to realise that we are there.  The economists who are advising the present Government would probably say that they were as well off without the west of Ireland, that it would be as well to wipe it out in so far as any use to the economic structure of the country is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>No member of the Government was naive enough to imagine that this Finance Bill would not meet with some opposition.  It is always difficult to get something new accepted, particularly when what is proposed is not fully understood at the beginning and more particularly when an all-out attempt is made by vested interests to confuse the situation and to create the maximum possible amount of hostility and opposition, as happened in this case.</P>
      <P>We knew full well that it simply could not happen that the Fine Gael Party would be prepared to put the permanent strengthening of our financial structure above Party political advantage.  Their whole record and tradition rule out any such possibility. We could anticipate clearly exactly what was going to happen.  This Finance Bill imposes additional taxation and that is never a very popular thing to do.  We knew that Fine Gael could not possibly deny themselves an opportunity of achieving Party political advantage and that they would, of course, endeavour to extract the maximum amount of political advantage from the situation.  We had no hope at all that they would take a statesman-like constructive line in regard to the measures that we were proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospect of that opposition, however, did not deter us in the slightest.  We do not mind that sort of opposition.  We are well used to it.  It <Col N="1569" /> is nothing new for us to have to fight and fight hard for development, expansion and progress.  It is nothing new for us to have to fight Fine Gael for social justice, to get better conditions for our workers, to get increased social welfare benefits.  We are well used to fighting reaction and those who have not the sense to see when they are being used as the tools of reaction.</P>
    <P>In fact, it is only when we get really determined opposition like this from the Fine Gael Party that we know that we are on the right lines.  The Fine Gael Party do not want progress or development or better conditions if they cost money.  I think that is a fair assessment of their position.  They are still the Party of reaction and diehard conservatism.  They are against this tax, not as a tax, but because of what it makes possible.  They have always been against progress and development of any sort.  In the past, before we could achieve any progress, we had to over-come the very often fierce and determined opposition of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies recently have been taken by Bord na Móna to see the magnificently successful work that is going on in our bogs.  Indeed, many visiting journalists have commented on this development and have held it out as a headline which other countries might profitably follow.</P>
    <P>It is interesting now to remember that this whole programme of bog development was bitterly and violently opposed by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Dillon.  He used his very considerable oratorical ability to do everything he could to prevent the implementation of that programme. I am sure Deputies will recall how he ridiculed the idea of that development, how he did everything he could to kill it by ridicule.  I suspect that Deputy Dillon is still of the same mind, and that it is his deep-rooted antipathy to any form of economic or social progress that is really behind the determined onslaught which he is making on this Finance Bill and the turnover tax.  What I am saying is probably surprising Deputy McLaughlin.  He is looking a little surprised at my assertion that his Leader could ever <Col N="1570" /> possibly have criticised this development in the way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In case there is any doubt about it, I propose to give a quotation from the official record to illustrate Deputy Dillon's approach to and thinking on this national development project.  As reported in the official Report of 9th May, 1946, volume 100, column 2539, in a flight of oratory, Deputy Dillon expressed himself as follows:</P>
      <P>We are going to pour millions into the bogs of Ireland for the production of turf.  Just imagine the folly, in a time when there is a scarcity of coal of announcing that our reaction to that scarcity of coal, is to turn to the bogs in the year 1946. Suppose we heard that the Egyptian Government had started to create a national scheme for the Pasha of Cascara Sagrada's fleet of camels in order to increase the domestic supply of camel dung for the purpose of utilising it for fuel for generating electricity! Camel dung is a very much superior fuel to the turf of this country.  That is perfectly true.  The water content of that comestible, carefully controlled, is much less than that of the turf cut on our Irish bogs.  But that is going to involve the use of machines, and, of course, every blockheaded Deputy in this House&mdash;and there are a good many of them&mdash;who foresaw that some of the expenditure would be spent in this constituency stood up and cheered and said: &ldquo;This is lovely and when are you going to start in my constituency?&rdquo; The truth of it is that it is a disgusting, shameless piece of codology, involving an expenditure of millions of money for the glorification of the legs of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was Deputy Dillon's approach to an important project of national development in 1946.  He has been proved wrong, but I suspect that the same mentality still prevails, and that it is because he is fundamentally opposed to the economic development <Col N="1571" /> which we support that he has, as I say, mounted this very determined onslaught on this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Fine Gael Party on any important issue of this sort can nearly always be predicted in advance.  Their opposition to this Finance Bill and to what the turnover tax makes possible in terms of social services, is directly in line with their political philosophy.  We had no illusions about that.  We knew they would oppose it as bitterly as they could, but I think we were entitled to feel a little disappointed with the Labour Party.  I think that with some justification we would have been entitled to expect support from the Labour Party, particularly when it can be clearly demonstrated that the only way to provide the money required for the increased children's allowances, social welfare benefits and so on is this turnover tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>From the point of view of the political philosophy of the Labour Party, there can be no objection to a turnover tax of this sort.  It is regarded by Labour Parties elsewhere as an ideal instrument for the implementation of their policies on social justice.  One would get the impression from certain things which were said in the course of the debate on this year's Finance Bill in the British House of Commons that if a Labour Government take office in Britain after the next election, the introduction of a turnover tax of this sort is very likely there, too.</P>

If the Labour Party in this country, like the Labour <Col N="1572" /> Parties elsewhere, have no objection in principle to a tax of this sort, and if they agree with the objectives for which the tax is designed, namely, the improvement of our social welfare arrangements, why oppose the Finance Bill?  I would hesitate to think&mdash; although there would seem to be grounds, possibly, for believing&mdash;that they have not yet really succeeded in getting away from the Coalition mentality of thinking of themselves as the junior partner of Fine Gael.  This was one occasion when the Labour Party could have clearly demonstrated that they are a free, independent, political organisation with a policy and philosophy of their own.</P>

      <P>We knew we would have a fight to get this tax accepted, and we were prepared for that. Nothing worthwhile is ever achieved without a fight.  We are not fighting for the tax itself&mdash;it is only the mechanism &mdash;but we are fighting for the objectives which the tax will enable us to achieve. This tax is the ideal instrument for the implementation of our policy of social justice.  It is a perfectly fair way of providing the money necessary to finance that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the House that the Government decided on this type of tax only after the most careful and earnest consideration.  We are not political fools.  We do not do unpopular things for the fun of it.  We made up our minds on the improvements which had to be brought about in our <Col N="1573" /> social welfare arrangements, health services, and so on, and we satisfied ourselves beyond any shadow of doubt that the money required could not be provided by any of the conventional methods.  We reviewed every method and system of taxation available and, finally, after the most careful and exhaustive examination, we had no difficulty in deciding that this type of turnover tax is the fairest, the most effective, and the cheapest way of raising the money required for our plans.</P>
    <P>I have been giving a fair amount of thought to the opposition which has been fomented to this turnover tax throughout the country.  It is quite obvious that this opposition has nothing whatever to do with the technical merits or demerits of the tax as such.  It can be clearly shown that it works well in other countries.  A great deal of the more hysterical type of opposition has been whipped up by a number of the paid organisers of various trade bodies in an endeavour to build up membership and consolidate their own position.  Some of it arises from a simple misunderstanding of what is involved.  When we allow for all that, however, it is still obvious that there is a powerful force at work in an all-out attempt to defeat this new turnover tax and it is now becoming clear what is the mainspring of this deep-rooted opposition.</P>
    <P>Those who do not believe, as we believe, that the State has a duty, by social welfare and other arrangements, to achieve the greatest possible measure of social justice see in this new tax a great danger to their reactionary ideas.  They are shrewd enough to appreciate that this tax, by the resources it will bring in, will enable us to proceed on a far broader base than we have been able to do so far under the present narrowly based tax structure.  They can see that we are providing ourselves with a new, effective instrument for social improvement, better social welfare arrangements, better schools, better houses, better health services and that is what they really object to.</P>
    <P>That is why this particularly violent and bitter opposition has been <Col N="1574" /> fomented.  It is clear to these reactionary elements in the community that our existing tax arrangement put a definite limit to the extent we can go in achieving economic and social progress. Those who oppose this tax realise that under the existing conventional tax arrangements which we have there is a limit to where we can go, and that this tax opens up vast new possibilities for improving our social services and so on.  They want to confine development of our social services generally to the existing narrow limits.</P>
    <P>The White Paper which has been issued shows how this tax will operate and how various technical difficulties which have been raised will be over-come. It is interesting to recall that before the Government announced their plans in relation to this tax, there was a considerable amount of support throughout the country for the idea of a turnover tax of this sort.  I recall clearly a prominent leader of a well-organised section of traders openly advocating precisely the sort of turnover tax which has been introduced. I have not heard him speaking very much recently but that was his view then.</P>
    <P>The technical difficulties to which reference has been made and about which so much play has been made are not the real issue here.  They are being used as a smokescreen.  The real objection is to the aims which this turnover tax is designed to achieve. I am firmly convinced that when the artificially fomented hysteria which is there at present dies down and when the people see clearly what our purpose is in introducing this tax and what can be achieved as a result of its introduction, then we shall have no difficulty whatever in defeating these forces of reaction to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In Fianna Fáil, we are not satisfied with things as they are.  We want to build a community in which an expanding economy will provide all sections of our people with living standards which are comparable with those of any other country in Europe.  We have outlined our plans and the means by which we hope to bring this about. <Col N="1575" /> These plans are practical and comprehensive. Many of them are already in successful operation.  We in Fianna Fáil accept that there is an obligation on the Government to plan for a consistent annual expansion in national income and we are hoping to devise and to have accepted generally&mdash;a realistic plan for the orderly distribution of that increase in a fair manner to all sections of the community.  We want to build up our social welfare and health services, improve our educational system, improve social and recreational amenities throughout the country.  We know more houses are required.  All these things can be achieved if we plan for them in a realistic and determined manner.  This Finance Bill is merely a mechanism whereby these plans of ours, these comprehensive plans for social and economic development, can be given effect to.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy who votes against this Bill on any pretext whatsoever, be he Labour, Independent, Clann na Poblachta or what have you, is in fact voting against these comprehensive plans of ours, no matter what way he may try to disguise that fundamental fact.  That is what is at issue in this debate.  We want progress, development and improvement.  We want to see the necessary money made available for these purposes.  Anybody who agrees with us in these objectives will vote for the Finance Bill and those who do not will trail pathetically into the Lobbies behind the reactionary banners of Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>Many people throughout the country believe that it is the duty of the Opposition in Parliament to oppose just for the sake of opposition. I am quite sure that, should any member of the Opposition, having regard to the present feeling of the people, accept that view and trade on that principle, in relation to the obnoxious turnover tax, which takes from the shoulders of the rich part of the burden they have been carrying for a long time and seeks to place it on the backs of the ordinary people, he could win loud acclaim by simply <Col N="1576" /> voting against the Government's proposals in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party, strange as it may seem to the Minister for Justice, do not feel that voting against the Finance Bill is the answer to the matter.  The Labour Party have asserted their individuality by putting down the amendment they felt was best suited to the Finance Bill.  There are some 104 sections and six Schedules in the Bill and the Labour Party agree with the vast majority of the sections in it. It may not be the exact Finance Bill that the Labour Government would introduce&mdash;it probably would be varied to lean more heavily on one section than on another&mdash;but the Labour Party objection to this Finance Bill relates only to one section.  If the Minister for Justice could give an assurance to the Labour Party that that section would be removed, the Labour Party would not be trailing behind anyone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would give that assurance if Deputy Kyne could tell me where else we can get the moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the duty of the Government to find the money but do not think the Labour Party will trail behind anyone, be it Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  The Labour Party have their own mind on these subjects.  Why do we oppose this one section?  Is it just to give us an excuse to vote with Fine Gael on this?  The Chair will finally decide how the amendments are put but should the Chair, in its wisdom, decide to give an opportunity of voting on each amendment, it will be very clear then that the Labour Party will be voting for their amendment. Those who want to will vote with the Labour Party.  The Labour Party will not be voting on any other amendment so that if the Government go out, it will be because they insist on including a provision in the Finance Bill which transfers the burden of taxation from those best able to bear it to those whom we represent and who are least able to bear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Combined with that is the proposal made by the Government a short time ago.  Not only are they to make us <Col N="1577" /> pay more in taxation but they will not permit the trade unions to seek the readjustment of wages which will become necessary because of this increased taxation.  Surely no Minister will have the cheek to say that this will not increase the cost of living? I am quite sure that no Minister or any sane person will suggest that finally it will not come back to the consumers and be reflected in the cost of living index.</P>
    <P>If I know my trade union people, and I think I do, they are going to recover this by means of a ninth round of wage increases.  Let the Government do as they will, no matter what regulations they will make, unless they are emergency powers regulations the trade unions will readjust.  That will be fine for the trade unions but it will not be fine for those on fixed incomes or those who have to live on social welfare benefits.  The Labour Party have tried to be honest and to make it clear that they support the Finance Bill and the increased corporation profits tax.  In regard to the suggestion that we are looking for increased social welfare benefits and that we are not prepared to face up to the realities of providing taxation, included in the Bill is increased taxation for £4 million for a full year.  That is more than enough to finance the promised increased social welfare payments.  If we support the various other sections of the Finance Bill, we will be giving the Government more than £4 million extra in taxation than they had last year to provide for the proposed increases.</P>
    <P>We will conscientiously examine proposals for increased taxation whether in this Finance Bill or in a supplementary Budget and provided we are satisfied that better services and better benefits, in respect of housing, health, social welfare or the promotion of industry will result, and if we believe the Government are genuine, we will not be afraid to support this Government or any other Government in power.  We do not want to be like many local authority councillors of various shades of opinion who all through the year lead deputations and make demands on the county manager <Col N="1578" /> for increased services, better roads and so on, and who when it comes to the estimates meeting, refuse to provide the money.  We have no desire to adopt that attitude in Parliament on the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are quite prepared to do their duty as an Opposition and to seek to amend what is wrong and support what we believe to be right.  It is not our responsibility to indicate to the Government where a different tax should be put on.  On the Budget debate, I did say that the Labour Party are always willing to support a tax on what could be regarded as luxuries, even to agree to increasing the price of the packet of 20 cigarettes from 3/7 to 4/-.  It would be much preferable to see taxation increased on such luxuries as drink, cigarettes, entertainments of various sorts and such non-essentials rather than on foodstuffs, bread, butter, and sugar, or clothing, footwear, houses and furniture.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Justice think that we in the Labour Party have gone crazy when he calmly suggests that this was done in our interests?  It was done to raise money.  The Minister for Finance was very clear and honest when he announced the proposal to introduce the turnover tax in his Budget.  He said: &ldquo;I must get money. This is the only way I know in which I can get it.  It is the only sure way. The old traditional ways have reached saturation point.&rdquo; I quite agree it is a good way for the Minister to get money but the Labour Party agree that it is but a simple transfer of taxation from the shoulders of those who formerly were carrying the burden to the backs of those who are just unable to bear it.</P>
    <P>It is not a new idea, of course.  It was suggested by the Commission that income tax should be reduced and that this tax should be substituted in order to reduce it.  The late George Bernard Shaw, who was a very good Socialist, said that he always knew whether a budget was a good one or not by whether income tax went up or down. That is how I judge whether a Government is a good Socialist Government or not and if I see an attempt being made to do away with direct taxation <Col N="1579" /> and impose indirect taxation on the ordinary man and woman irrespective of his or her income, I know that the Government who tell me that it is for their good are only trying to pull my leg.  The Minister for Justice should think for a bit if he feels that this fine speech is going to induce the Labour Party to alter their views on certain things.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice says that the public do not care.  He did not use the names of the four paid organisers going around to improve their position but I have no doubt that it was RGDATA to which he was referring. I do not want to put words into the Minister's mouth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Justice knows, the Irish Housewives Association, speaking not on behalf of the Labour Party or in opposition to Fianna Fáil, because they are great friends of the Minister for Justice, did not issue a warning to the Government, did not even make a demand, but made an appeal to the Minister for Finance to reconsider this tax, at least, insofar as household essentials were concerned.  They suggested transferring the tax to luxury goods such as radios, television sets, cars and various other things in higher price brackets. They suggested that the tax lost on foodstuffs would be made up in that way.  I did not think anyone who at the present time has to pay between £800 and £900 for a car&mdash;and that is a cheap car, the type of car I buy myself&mdash;would worry about the £50 extra even if it meant his having to go to Bowmakers.</P>

      <P>The question of whether Deputy Leneghan is to be kidnapped in an expensive car or a cheap car does not concern me at the moment.  Of course, I would much prefer if he were not kidnapped at all, if he were left there.  I would say that the electorate in the Dublin North-East constituency are a fairly representative cross section of the community as a whole. We put up a candidate who, a very short time previously, did not have a wonderful poll.  This time, in the by-election, his poll was doubled.  What was the factor responsible for that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is so, but if Fianna Fáil were to put up an old coat, their supporters would still vote Fianna Fáil.  We were to assume, therefore, that Fianna Fáil would get the normal proportion of the votes, unless there was some outside factor.  What was responsible for doubling the poll of the Labour candidate?  It was the same candidate and the same electorate as in the general election.  I <Col N="1581" /> suggest to the Minister for Finance that the outside factor which was responsible for the increased Labour poll was the proposal of the Minister to impose a turnover tax.  It was because the people believed this tax will worsen their lot, that they will have to pay more money for the essentials of life and that it will mean a worse time for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice says the people believe that but that they have been fooled into that belief by RGDATA, by Fine Gael and possibly by the Labour Party.  I do not think we have fooled them at all.  I do not think anyone in his sane senses will suggest that price increases will not follow this tax.  RGDATA have not said they will accept this price increase without passing it on.  Let us have a look at what traders throughout the country think of the turnover tax.</P>
      <P>The smaller trader believes he will be wiped out of business.  He believes the big man will eat him up because of the fact that his custom was from people who bought in small lots.  He will now have to add a halfpenny at least, because it is the smallest coin we have, or perhaps a 1d., to his present prices.  His customers will find that buying from him is comparatively unprofitable and will cease going to him.  They will concentrate their purchases in the one shop and, as we all know, the smaller trader, the huckster, will not be able to cater for them in the way that bigger traders will.  Consequently, the small man will lose.  The small trader has had to work on a minimum profit margin because of his type of sale and the type of people who bought from him&mdash;mostly people who had to buy after the bigger shops had shut, people who had to buy near their homes and in small quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medium trader believes he will lose because now he must keep an additional set of books and, therefore, employ extra staff.  He will also be forced into competition with the big traders, the supermarkets, who will be able to continue trading perhaps without operating the turnover tax.  The small trader and the medium trader, therefore, believe the day of the big man has arrived, that this tax&mdash;and I <Col N="1582" /> do not believe Fianna Fáil intended it this way&mdash;will discriminate against them to the benefit of the supermart. The small man will be forced out of self-employment and on to the labour market and the medium trader will lose because of keen competition and because he will not be able to stand the turnover tax himself.</P>
    <P>The medium trader will now also be compelled to keep books so as to permit inspections and make proper returns to the Government.  If this type of trader in the past has been able to dodge income tax, he will now find that his turnover tax returns will help the income tax authorities to assess him in the right amounts.  I have no sympathy with him if in the past he has been dodging tax, considering that because of the introduction of PAYE, every worker earning over £6 a week is assessable.  Quite a number of traders have incomes of over £6 a week but have not been contributing to the Exchequer by way of income tax.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have the most peculiar and ridiculous situation that where a farmer with over 40 acres of land employs a worker, the worker, if a single man earning the Agricultural Wages Board rate, must pay income tax whereas the farmer may not.  If the Minister for Finance looked into it thoroughly, I am sure he would find here an additional source of revenue and it would be acceptable to the Labour Party.  Whether it would be acceptable to Fine Gael I do not know. I do not see how the Minister for Justice could have suggested the Labour Party were bound to accept this Bill because of the increased social benefits it provides for, or how he could believe that we should automatically either not vote in the same Lobby as Fine Gael or vote with Fianna Fáil. There are only the two Lobbies and they must vote in either.  We agree with the Finance Bill in the main.  We would have some variations in it but we doubly oppose this section and will in every way we can, by our votes and otherwise, seek to have it removed from the Bill.  If the Government see fit to remove that section, then the Labour Party will be supporting the Finance Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> We believe taxation is necessary. The money must be found for better social welfare benefits, for housing, and so on.  If the Chair sees fit to put the question in a certain way, the Labour Party will then vote for their amendment. They will not be voting with anybody else, if the Chair decides to put the question in that way.  However, the Chair has indicated that the question to be put will be: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;, and that voting for or against the Finance Bill may take place.  Then, if it will include the infamous turnover tax section, the Labour Party will vote against it in company with whoever will be voting against it.  Therefore, I suggest the Minister for Justice should use his persuasion on his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to accept the voices of himself and his friends of the Irish Housewives Association and to see if this infamous turnover tax cannot be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of of what particular amendment the Labour Party or any other Party may vote on, I think it is quite clear that all organised political Parties in this State, with the exception of Fianna Fáil, are vehemently opposed to the turnover tax provisions in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Budget, which is being implemented by this Bill, has been described as one of the worst Budgets that ever came out of the Dáil.  I think that the more the people have had the opportunity of examining the implications of the Budget and the implications of the turnover tax, the more it has become apparent to them that this new tax is likely to bear even more harshly on the weaker sections of the community than did the wanton destruction by Fianna Fáil of the food subsidies in an earlier Fianna Fáil Budget.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Justice complains of organised opposition to the turnover tax and an all-out attempt, as he puts it, by vested interests to confuse the position, I think he has misled himself.  If that is the point of view he is urging on his Government colleagues and the Deputies supporting him in the Fianna Fáil benches, I think he is misleading them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> There is nothing clearer than the fact that the sustained and widespread opposition to these Government proposals was spontaneous.  The Minister for Justice-as in my case and in that of every Deputy&mdash;has now received from various bodies such as chambers of commerce, trade associations, housewives' associations, even county councils and the National Farmers Association, protests against and opposition to this tax.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Justice suggest that all of these bodies are lending themselves to the type of vested interest opposition he talks about here? When his Leader, the Taoiseach, spoke to a Fianna Fáil body, the report appeared in the daily papers of 13th instant.  The report concludes with these words:</P>
    <P>He believed the Irish people had developed in political maturity and wanted to be treated as responsible men and women capable of exercising intelligent judgment on political questions.  He was willing to stake the political future of the Government and his Party on this judgment and he did not think he was taking any risk whatever.</P>
    <P>I want to invite the Taoiseach now to give the people of this country an oppportunity of exercising their intelligent political judgment on this turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Is it not because the Taoiseach and every one of his Ministers know that the opposition to this tax is so widespread that it would overwhelm the Government and overwhelm their Party if they dared face the people in a general election that we have this rearguard action being fought by the Taoiseach and his Ministers; that we have the spectacle of the Taoiseach standing up here and, in what I believe was a most injudicious speech, threatening a respectable trade organisation that they would get bloody noses if they carried on their opposition to this turnover tax.</P>
    <P>This &ldquo;bloody noses&rdquo; campaign was then furthered by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Lands in week-end speeches.  We do not want to misquote the Taoiseach in any way. <Col N="1585" /> When speaking in this House on 20th instant, he referred to RGDATA, as reported at column 1396 of the Official Report, as trying to work up a political agitation against the proposals for a turnover tax.  Later on, in the same column, he said that if RGDATA now want to become a political organisation, that is their right but they must not complain if in future we treat them as a political organisation.  Then, again, he said that anybody who wants to get into a political conflict must be prepared to get out of it with a bloody nose.</P>

      <P>Then we have the Minister for Justice carrying on this &ldquo;bloody noses&rdquo; campaign.  He sets up a wail in Donnycarney that the whole thing is a negation of democracy. The very idea that any traders or trade organisations or business people should endeavour to oppose the will of the Government in this matter, should endeavour to influence their public representatives into voting against the Government in relation to these tax proposals, is, in his view, a negation of democracy.</P>
      <P>We had the Minister for Lands thumbing through the pages of the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I invite any Minister who wants to shelter behind the skirts of Queen Victoria to do so and he is welcome to any consolation he gets out of that exercise.  However, this is all a &ldquo;bloody noses&rdquo; campaign.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands tells us that those who have endeavoured to influence a Deputy in their constituency are guilty of illegal action and are liable to be imprisoned with hard labour.  The Minister for Justice says it is a negation of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the Taoiseach in the same speech to which I have already referred, as reported in the newspapers of 13th June, 1963, making this remarkable <Col N="1586" /> statement.  It comes from the head of the Government and it refers to the fact that the Fine Gael Party had indicated their intention of putting down an amendment on the Second Stage of this Finance Bill to endeavour to secure its defeat.  The Taoiseach is reported as follows:</P>
    <P>If they brought about the defeat of the Government on the second Reading of the Finance Bill, thus forcing a general election, they would create complete chaos in the country's finances, irrespective of the outcome of the election.  It would not be possible to have another Finance Bill introduced and enacted within the statutory time limit.  This would mean that income tax would not be collectable, that income tax already paid, or deducted as in the case of PAYE, would be liable to be refunded.</P>
    <P>Did the Taoiseach intend to be taken seriously when he made that statement? The Minister for Justice said he did.  I wonder is the Minister for Justice as naive as he appears to be at times in this House.  Does he not know that his Leader on 23rd June, 1954, moved an amendment on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party to a Finance Bill introduced in that year that Dáil Éireann declines to give it a Second Reading?  What is the difference between 1954 and 1963 so far as the mechanics of State are concerned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not talk nonsense.  If all these consequences the Taoiseach now foresees were to be brought about in 1963, precisely the same consequences would have ensued in 1954.  But the fact of the matter is that the Taoiseach was quite wrong and the Minister for Justice is quite wrong if he believes that those consequences would ensue from a defeat of this Bill.</P>
      <P>When speaking on his amendment in 1954, at column 472 of the Official Report of 23rd June of that year, the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment has annoyed the Minister for Finance.  He went down to his constituency and said that this amendment indicated Fianna Fáil's <Col N="1587" /> obstruction of the Government, that the Fianna Fáil Party, as indicated by this amendment, were engaged on a policy of obstruction.  It is a characteristic of incompetent Governments that they always try to prevent criticism, that they always try to blackmail their critics into silence by alleging obstruction or something of that kind.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Justice to take those words to heart:</P>
    <P>It is a characteristic of incompetent Governments that they always try to prevent criticism, that they always try to blackmail their critics into silence....</P>
    <P>First, we had the Taoiseach threatening a bloody nose to a responsible trade organisation if they carry on their agitation against this turnover tax.  We have another Minister wailing and whining in Donnycarney about the negation of democracy if the Fianna Fáil proposals are obstructed.  Then we have a third Minister threatening these people with the penalty of imprisonment with hard labour and telling them that what they are doing is illegal.  Would the Minister for Justice like to hear again in that context the remarks of the Taoiseach in 1954?  He said:</P>
    <P>It is a characteristic of incompetent Governments that they always try to prevent criticism, that they always try to blackmail their critics into silence....</P>
    <P>I should like him to learn those words off by heart.  I suggest that over a cup of tea in the Dáil restaurant he might invite the Taoiseach also to go back over his speech delivered in 1954.</P>
    <P>I do not think I remember since I came into public life any Government proposal which aroused more real and spontaneous anger than the Government's proposal with regard to this turnover tax.  Fianna Fáil Ministers and Deputies are seriously misleading themselves if they do not recognise that position.  I think they do recognise it.  They cannot but fail to be apprehensive of what is facing <Col N="1588" /> them.  The Minister for Justice, in particular, who complained about organised opposition, must realise that the opposition to these proposals is very real, very angry and very spontaneous. His constituency is the only constituency in Ireland that has had an opportunity of passing judgment.  We know the judgment they passed.  They told the Government as emphatically as they could that they did not want this tax and that the Government should get out of office and give the people an opportunity of passing judgment in a general way.</P>
    <P>Are the people to be denied that opportunity?  The Minister for Lands, when thumbing through the Constitution to find something illegal in the activities of those who were opposing this tax, overlooked Article 6 of the Constitution.  No doubt the Minister for Justice will be familiar with Article 6 of the Constitution, which lays down:</P>
    <P>It is the right of the people to designate the rulers of the State and in final appeal to decide all questions of national policy according to the requirements of the common good.</P>
    <P>Are the people to be denied that right in relation to this tax, which everyone concedes is a completely new departure and which has aroused opposition from all sections of the people.  Do Ministers not realise that, in face of crumbling Government support, by their obstinacy in trying to force this measure through the House, they are only increasing the anger of the people?</P>
    <P>Why not put the matter to the test the Taoiseach spoke of earlier in the month when he said he believed that the Irish people had developed in political matters and wanted to be treated as responsible men and women capable of exercising intelligent judgment on political questions.  Why not allow the Irish people an opportunity of exercising their intelligent political judgment in this matter?  I could understand it if the Ministers had introduced proposals which they had forecast in relation to the turnover tax. Remember the picture painted before the Minister for Finance stood up to make his Budget speech was that the tax would affect only luxury and semicas <Col N="1589" /> luxury goods.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that a broadly-based tax is the Party line. I have here a copy of the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of March 23rd, 1963&mdash;if the Minister for Finance wants it, I shall have great pleasure in giving it to him &mdash;in which is reported a speech by one of the junior Ministers, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands.  This is what he said:</P>
      <P>In the next few weeks and months the budget would be the main topic of conversation and he wished them all to have the facts at their fingertips. There would be no increases on those items which were already perhaps over-taxed, items such as beer, cigarettes, petrol, spirits and so on.  The increases would be on luxury goods and semi-luxurious goods such as jewellery, furs, and expensive motor cars and these items were already taxed in Britain and the Continent.</P>
      <P>We had it straight from the horse's mouth on 23rd March before the Budget that the new taxation was to apply to luxury and semi-luxury goods such as jewellery, furs and expensive motor cars.  I hope the Minister is satisfied now that I am not chancing my arm when I say that was the forecast before the Budget by Government sources.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was very emphatic about it.  He did not want any misunderstanding and he continued according to this report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Lenihan said he was telling the members these things so that they could all act as propagandists for the Party.  They would meet criticism but he wanted them to remember that most, the vast majority of people from whom criticism would <Col N="1590" /> come, were anti-national.  One found that the people who supported Fianna Fáil came from a national background.</P>
    <P>Luxury and semi-luxury goods were the items to be taxed by the Minister for Finance in the Budget and if anyone criticised Fianna Fáil, they were anti-national.  It was easy to silence them.  He wanted members of the Party to whom he was speaking to have these arguments at their fingertips.</P>
    <P>We now have Fianna Fáil fighting frantically and desperately with their backs to the wall.  The Taoiseach comes into the House and threatens bloody noses.  We have the Minister for Lands threatening jail and hard labour and I suppose before we finish this debate, we shall have Fianna Fáil spokesmen repeating the line of the Parliamentary Secretary, that those who are criticising are anti-national. Let us see the type of people who are criticising&mdash;virtually all political Parties in the State, the National Farmers Association, county councils up and down the country, chambers of commerce wherever they function, housewives associations, trade associations and trade unions and the vast majority of the electorate in Dublin North-East.  Are all these to be dismissed as anti-national because they raise their voices in criticism of the outrageous proposals of the Government?</P>
    <P>Surely the humiliating defeat which the Government sustained in the constituency represented by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Colley and Deputy Timmons must bring home some message to them?  It is now some weeks since the result was announced.  Can it be that the penny has not yet dropped and that the message has not yet come home to Fianna Fáil Ministers that they are not wanted by the people who seek an opportunity of adjudicating on the matter at a general election?  There is no doubt whatever if the Taoiseach wants to submit the matter to the people and take a chance on the political contest about which he taunted RGDATA and allows the public to have a general election, who will come out with the bloodiest noses.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not always so gentle.  I find it difficult to hear him.  Perhaps he is timid because he represents the by-election constituency.  When I saw the Taoiseach's references to bloody noses for people who oppose the Fianna Fáil tax, it reminded me of a poet describing&mdash;I think the name of the poem is &ldquo;The Village&rdquo;&mdash;a character in the village as:</P>
      <P>A potent quack, long versed in human ills</P>
      <P>Who first insults the victim whom he kills.</P>
      <P>That, in some ways, summarises the position of the Government in regard to many small businesses in this State, the operators of which in many cases are members of this trade organisation which is doing its job for its members in opposing these measures.  Yet that is the kind of treatment they get in the speech made by the Taoiseach.  When the senior and junior members of the Government have reconciled their differences, Sir, I shall carry on.</P>
      <P>One of the main fears, and I believe it is justified, is that this 2½ per cent proposal is merely the thin end of the wedge for future increases.  As it is, it will be an extremely heavy burden. I believe the Fianna Fáil Party thought they would get away with this on the basis of saying: &ldquo;Sixpence in the pound, what is that?  That is not going to worry anyone.&rdquo; In fact, people are worried about this tax, first, because of the weight of the tax itself and, secondly, because they regard it as the thin end of the wedge for further future increases.  Bad as the tax is, it is made much worse by the fact that such a large proportion of it is to be collected from the basic essentials of life, food, fuel and clothes.  When the Minister for Finance introduced the tax, he made it clear that about three-quarters of the entire tax would come from food, fuel and clothes.</P>

      <P>We shall get the Minister's statement in due course. I think there is not very much doubt about what he said.  My own reference is taken from a quotation I gave of the Minister's speech, when speaking here on 24th April last.  I said that the Minister for Finance in his statement said that, if he did not include the basic essentials, food, fuel and clothing, in his turnover tax, the amount of the tax would require to be, not sixpence in the £ but 2/- in the £.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the fuel about which I am talking.  That is the fuel I believe the Minister was talking about when he made his Budget Statement.  I will accept his apology now and the silent apology of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, sitting beside him.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the Minister himself has told us that, on his calculation, if these basic essentials were not included, the tax would require to be 2/- in the £ instead of sixpence in the £.  What does the Minister hope to get by this tax?  The figure given by himself was £10½ million in the course of a full year. That is, incidentally, about £7 million more than he requires to balance his Budget.  The point I want to make is that of that £10½ million about £7½ million will come from the basic essentials, food, fuel and clothing.</P>
      <P>The next point I want to touch on for a moment is as to who will pay the tax.  There was a certain amount of confusion, and I do not lay this at the door of the Minister for Finance because he was quite terse and forth-right from the very beginning in making it clear that the shopkeepers were entitled to pass on the tax <i>in toto</i>, fully and entirely, to the consumers. Nevertheless, a certain amount of confusion has crept in as to whether the shopkeepers will, in fact, do that. Looking at it from the point of view of those who wish to convince the consumer that there is no obligation on the shopkeeper to pass on the tax, the point was made that if the shopkeeper does not pass on the tax, then that will be grand for the consumer; nothing will cost him more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not quite clear, in fact, that in virtually every case, the shopkeeper will pass on this tax?  There are no shopkeepers, or very few anyhow, who will be strong enough to absorb taxation at the level proposed by the <Col N="1594" /> Government in this turnover tax: sixpence in the £, 2½ per cent, may seem very small, but, if we take the example given by the Government in their explanatory paper called <i>An Outline of the Proposals of the Turnover Tax</i> issued with the Finance Bill, we find that the trader with a turnover of £1,000 a month will be required to pay a monthly tax of £23 7s. 6d., which works out at an annual tax of £280. Talking of the type of cars that Deputy Kyne referred to a few moments ago, it would require the sale of only one or two cars a month to reach that turnover in that particular business. When that is applied to a trade such as the grocery trade, which has a profit margin of something like seven per cent on its turnover, it means that the profit of the trader will, in effect, be reduced to four and a half per cent; the man who gets a total profit of £880 a year, for example, will find at the end of the year that his profit will be cut to about £600, if he chooses to pay this tax himself.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, is it in any way realistic for Government spokesmen to think that the tax will not be passed on?  It is quite unrealistic to believe the tax will not be passed on. Whether or not it is passed on, the Government will on their own figures, and at a rate of 2½ per cent, collect another £10½ million in taxation from the people.  This is the proposal by a Government who, since their return to office in 1957, have already increased State spending by a figure of approximately £62 million over and above the level of State spending in the year 1956-57.  They have managed to increase it at approximately a rate of £9 million a year.  That is what the people are paying annually in increased expenditure for keeping a Fianna Fáil Government in office.</P>

      <P>It is possible, of course, for the Government to make economies.  Let them start at the top and get rid of a couple of Ministers and of Parliamentary Secretaries, too, for good measure.  If these are got rid of, that might reduce the need for some of the Government's spending.  This tax has proved a little more than just a hornet's nest for the Government.  I do not believe they will ever recover from it.  So long as they manage to secure the support of a couple of Independent Deputies for this type of proposal, there is nothing we can do to put them out of office; but they cannot go on indefinitely refusing to listen to the voice of public opinion.  They cannot turn a deaf ear to the crescendo of criticism which is rising all over the country because of these proposals.</P>

There is no doubt that if the government of this country is to be carried out with the consent and the approval of the governed, there is only one way that can be done in this situation, that is, by the Government dissolving the Dáil, going to the country and risking their necks and their noses at a general election.</P>

      <P>Nothing typifies the reactionary policy of the conservative Fine Gael Party more than the remarks of the last speaker, Deputy O'Higgins, in belabouring the Government because of their increased expenditure since 1957.  The Fine Gael Party quite clearly are against Government expenditure. Deputy O'Higgins mounts his attack on the Fianna Fáil Government on the basis that they as a Government have steadily increased Government expenditure.  We can stand over increased Government expenditure in our economy.  We will stand over increased Government expenditure in the future in the fields where it is so necessary&mdash;in education, in further agricultural and industrial development and in the implementing of the social policies required for a proper policy of redistribution in the interests of social justice.  We have consistently followed that policy over the years. We regard Government expenditure as the major instrument to be used in our economy to make for a greater level of investment and for the redistribution policies so essential&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact is that Deputy O'Higgins in arguing his case against this Finance Bill on the basis that it represented a further example of the Fianna Fáil trend in government towards increased expenditure thereby pinned his own Party to the belief, the reactionary belief which it had always assumed, that Government expenditure is bad and that increased Government <Col N="1597" /> expenditure is not needed.  This is typical of the conservative reactionary tradition in which Fine Gael were born and in which Fine Gael continue. It is the real basis of their opposition to this Finance Bill.  They are currying popular favour by emphasising certain of the taxation proposals contained in the Bill but the real basis of their opposition is the traditional Fine Gael opposition to any constructive increase in Government expenditure which we in Fianna Fáil have always believed in.</P>
      <P>We have always believed that in our economy by reason of our late start in the industrial race, it has been essential for the State to step in in a positive way to increase investment, directly through the various Departments of State which have increased expenditure over the past few years, such as the Department of Lands in the Land Commission and the Forestry Division, and indirectly through the various public companies established by statute of this House, such as the Irish Sugar Company, Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, which are also giving gainful employment. It is our belief that increased expenditure channelled directly from the State or indirectly through these organisations can be fully defended. All of these constructive proposals in the past were opposed by Fine Gael.</P>

We want to know from Fine Gael how they propose or would propose to put into operation here an education system fully geared to the needs of our country in the 1960's and 1970's.  We have not heard from Fine Gael any suggestion as to how they would raise the necessary finance to put into effect a constructive and modern education policy.</P>

      <P>And we are doing our job.  It is precisely because we are facing up to the responsibilities of our job that we have introduced taxation proposals designed to sustain the Government expenditure which we consider necessary in such desirable fields as education.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Fine Gael Party prefers to be all things to all men or to go a bit of the road with everyone. Indeed, that attitude was shown clearly in the Mansion House some weeks ago when, in the atmosphere of euphoria which prevailed there, Deputy Dillon saw fit in one speech to promise the Irish people that Fine Gael had a free-for-all education scheme, a free-for-all health scheme, interest-free loans for houses in rural areas and at the same time, would press for reduced rates, reduced taxation and the abandonment of the turnover tax.  That sort of shabby playacting is not the stuff of a Party who claim to be the alternative Government in this House. Indeed, &ldquo;a bit of the road with everyone&rdquo; is not the sort of policy that will ever put Fine Gael into the position for which they have certain ambitions, that is, the Government of this country.  The Fine Gael Party by reason of their opportunism in this House, their traditional opportunism, are geared for permanency in Opposition or else for some sort of weak participation in Government such as they experienced on two occasions in the past 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that the Budget and the Finance Bill which we are debating here which implements the budgetary tax provisions, are designed as the means whereby the Government can obtain the necessary revenue for an <Col N="1599" /> increasing level of expenditure so as to raise the total level of investment in the State and provide more gainful employment for our people.  That has been our consistent policy over the years and that is still our policy.  For that reason, we have faced up to our responsibilities and we have decided that increased expenditure is necessary in the fields of education, social welfare and industrial and agricultural investment.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael would object to that expenditure because they are a conservative Party.  As a progressive Party, we say that expenditure is necessary, and that it is essential for the Government to take a more decisive part in encouraging investment than is done in other more developed countries.  We started late, and for that reason it is necessary for the Government to take a positive attitude in raising the level of investment in the State, directly through their own Departments and the State-sponsored bodies and indirectly through organisations such as the Industrial Credit Corporation, the Industrial Development Authority, and the various marketing boards which are designed to encourage private investment to a greater degree.</P>
    <P>We believe in increased expenditure under those heads.  Quite clearly, Fine Gael are opposed to any increased expenditure. The real basis of their opposition is that they are opposed to anything progressive and constructive. They react in their traditional conservative mould.  I brand them as the conservative reactionary party in this House.  We are facing up to our responsibilities. As a progressive Party, we have designed taxation proposals, broadly based, to yield the necessary revenue for increased expenditure in the fields I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>These taxation proposals are such that everyone will pay something, but no one will be burdened to a depressive degree.  That is a fair summation of these proposals, considered <i>in toto.</i> I feel certain that when the proposals come into operation, after orderly consultation between the interests concerned and the Minister, they will prove to be the most progressive taxation proposals to be introduced since the <Col N="1600" /> formation of the State.  They will provide the basis for a broadly-based system of taxation in the future under which successive Ministers for Finance &mdash;certainly not from the Fine Gael side of the House&mdash;can plan ahead for the economic development which is so necessary.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another characteristic which distinguishes Fianna Fáil as a progressive Party from Fine Gael as a reactionary conservative Party who believe in the dictum: sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.  The Fine Gael Party have never had the courage to come into this House and declare what is their policy, and say: &ldquo;Here is where we stand and here is what we propose to do.&rdquo; They have, in the past, by opportunist methods and through expediency and bargaining, secured participation in Government, but they have never outlined for the Irish people what their policy is.</P>
    <P>In 1958, we laid down our targets for economic advancement in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Our second plan for economic expansion will be published shortly, and it is designed to reach a target of a 50 per cent increase in the national income by 1970.  That plan will be laid before the people.  We are now seeking the necessary revenue and the means to ensure the operation of that plan.  By reason of their lack of policy, Fine Gael are showing themselves as an essentially conservative Party.  I challenge them to produce their alternative method of raising the taxation necessary to provide for the future of our economy.  In their heart of hearts&mdash;and I believe the people realise this&mdash;they know they have no such alternative system of taxation, no such means of raising revenue, because their way of dealing with a problem is not to consider an alternative form of taxation but to consider retrenchment of the social services, and economic development. To cut down on social welfare benefits would be one way of not having to increase taxation.  They might consider that.  They might consider cutting down on the various proposals for economic advancement which we have outlined in the Budget.  They <Col N="1601" /> might consider cutting down on investment in the field of education.  Why have they not produced any alternative method of raising taxation?  At all stages the Fine Gael Party have been concerned with opposing merely for the sake of opposing, and of objecting without proposing anything constructive.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have produced detailed plans for education.  In many ways, they correspond to the recent proposals outlined by the Minister for Education.  Last week, in an interview on Telefís Éireann, a very prominent member of the Labour Party, a trade union official, approved very strongly of the proposals of the Minister for Education.  He said very emphatically that the Irish people would have to face up to the fact that we require much greater investment in education and that investment can be got only through increased taxation.  I was pleased to hear a very prominent member of the Labour Party, and a very prominent member of the trade union movement, speaking in that responsible fashion.</P>
    <P>I say to the Labour Party in this House that if it is the desire of the Labour Party to have planned progress and economic improvement, they should, as a responsible Party, face up to the fact that if this progress is to be made, they must also advocate the necessary taxation measures which are required to bring about that improvement and development.  As I said earlier, the £10½ million approximately which the turnover tax will bring in in a year could be spent in the field of education alone&mdash;I say that quite emphatically&mdash;and much more if we could afford it, apart from the various other fields.</P>
    <P>We are behind in regard to our total investment in education.  The Minister has outlined his progressive and modern educational policy and, as the trade union spokesman said on the television screen, if the Irish people are serious about increasing scholarships, and having a more organised technical and technological educational system, we need more colleges and schools.  If we are serious about improving this important field, we must get down to the practical question of <Col N="1602" /> where we will get the money to pay for these desirable measures.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael do not believe in anything. They have no faith in the future of the country or themselves.  They have suggested no alternative method of raising taxation.  I believe the reality is that they are opposed to expenditure by the State.  The Labour Party go the whole way with us in believing that it is necessary in the annual Budget to raise the level of desirable Government expenditure, but they have not gone the whole logical way we have gone by facing these matters in a responsible fashion and saying that we must devise taxation proposals to raise the necessary revenue.</P>
    <P>I believe that the real debate in Irish politics to-day behind the facade of the Finance Bill is between the people who are looking forward and the people who are looking back.  The real issue is whether people here have belief and faith in the future of this country.  If they have, then they will be on the progressive side.  They will plan ahead, secure in the knowledge that the country has a future.  Planning ahead and devising measures necessary to secure the finances to implement the plans require faith in the future and require a progressive attitude.  I believe this Government have that approach. Fine Gael have never had that approach and seem to have no other approach except opposing for the sake of opposition.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party for their part in this broad political discussion go half the way with us in advocating many of our measures but they are not going the whole way by facing up to their responsibilities and how to carry them into effect.  That is the real issue in this debate.  The Finance Bill is merely a front behind which this basic discussion is taking place between the forces of reaction and the forces of progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has suggested that this Finance Bill and the turnover tax and other taxes which are contained in it are designed to enable Government expenditure to be increased on matters such as land division, educational facilities, Bord na Móna and social welfare benefits generally.  That is the <Col N="1603" /> broad argument made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He expounded at some length on the necessity for an altered educational system here.  If his conversion to that is genuine, there is nobody will welcome it more than our small Party.</P>
      <P>Three years ago, there was a motion in our names requesting the House to agree to the extension of the school-leaving age.  The Government accepted that motion at the time and from the day of its acceptance, we have not had the slightest attempt by this Government to implement it, although this House was promised&mdash;and there was no division on it&mdash;that the school-leaving age would be raised from 14 to 15 or 16 years.  Now we have the Parliamentary Secretary telling us that the funds for increased Government expenditure are to be raised by the turnover tax, in particular, for the purpose of improving educational services and facilities of the State.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that the Minister for Education produced a new plan for education in the past few weeks.  This so-called change in the educational plans of Fianna Fáil was timed to coincide with the recent by-election in Dublin.  It was a deliberate attempt to try to catch a few votes in this by-election.  The Minister for Education and his Party had no plans whatever prepared to put into operation and if we examine the implications in this Finance Bill, we shall find that the increase over the last year for educational purposes is negligible.</P>
      <P>There is no question, when it comes to education, that this Government were never serious about it and their attempt at this stage to suggest that the turnover tax is for the purpose of increased expenditure on education is eyewash and will not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion by the Parliamentary Secretary that there will be a further increase in the amount of money made available for the division of lands is laughable.  It is ludicrous that a Government who over the years, with their former Taoiseach, on many occasions stated that the pool of land was drying up and was not available <Col N="1604" /> for the relief of congestion and for the improvement and enlargement of small holdings, should suggest at this stage that they were in a position to implement a plan that would give 45 to 50 acres to every small farmer. When it is examined, it will be found that there is no germ of truth in it.</P>

When we compare that statement with what he has said down the country in his constituency, there is food for thought as to where this person stands.  A famous candidate for the Presidency in the United States said some years ago about an opponent: &ldquo;I do not know where that man stands.  As far as I see, he is standing on a basket of eels.&rdquo; So it is with the Parliamentary Secretary because he can wriggle and twist and turn but he still sits on top of the basket.  He is progressive today and reactionary tomorrow.  He is taxing the rich when he is in Boyle and he is taxing the poor people when he comes to this House.  That, of course, is what his Government are doing and as a small boy, he is learning fast from the chief acrobat, namely, the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Finance Bill itself, I should like to refer to the turnover tax.  I do not intend to delay the House very long because I know other speakers want to get in.  Over the last few weeks, a multitude of devices has been used by spokesmen from the Fianna Fáil Party trying to justify this tax and to get it across to the public and get their consent to it.  There is a deliberate attempt in the rural areas to drive a wedge between, on the one hand, the farmers and the workers and, on the other hand, another section of the community, the small traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a belief one time in rural Ireland that a yard of counter was worth 100 acres of land.  That illusion existed for years in rural Ireland and many people, small farmers, workers <Col N="1606" /> and others, had the impression that people in business were making fortunes. In rural areas, the Government have attempted to suggest that the turnover tax will be borne completely by the trader.  One of the statements they put forward is that competition is such at the present time that traders themselves are undercutting one another as regards prices and that the Government are now going to step in and take advantage of this by imposing a turnover tax which will be absorbed by the trader.</P>
    <P>That is one argument made by the Government spokesmen to a section of the community in the country. The belief is that a neighbour's jealousy towards somebody who appears to be doing better than himself will persuade that individual to support the idea of a turnover tax.  That is the approach to the consumer in the rural areas.  Fianna Fáil's other approach is to the small shopkeeper.  He is being told: &ldquo;You need not pay this turnover tax at all if your turnover is small.&rdquo; He is getting an injection to calm him down before his execution.  That argument which is advanced to the small traders is nonsense. Even if he does not have to pay a cheque to the State each month for this turnover tax he will be paying it to the wholesalers before he gets his goods.</P>
    <P>I believe that the small trader with the small profit which he has to-day will not be able to carry on business. I listened to other Fianna Fáil speakers and I heard one intelligent man stating yesterday that the small traders and the public in the west of Ireland would not be affected by this turnover tax. He said that only the large traders and shopkeepers in the big towns will be affected.  Although I described that man as intelligent, he had little regard for the intelligence of the people to whom he was talking.  It was at a county council meeting in the west of Ireland.  We had, of course, people like the Parliamentary Secretary saying that there was to be no taxation in the Budget except on mink coats and Mercedes cars and on the wealthy.  He followed up that statement by saying that anybody who opposed the Finance Bill and the turnover tax was anti-national. <Col N="1607" /> That is the type of argument that is being put forward by this junior Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Parliamentary Secretary, let me say that in his own constituency the leading organisers of those opposing this tax, are well known, well respected, and prominent supporters of Fianna Fáil.  They are the leaders whose signatures are attached to every protest in connection with this turnover tax. Here we have their former spokesman in the Dáil saying that anyone who protests against this Budget and the Finance Bill is anti-national.  I will leave it at that as far as this archpatriot is concerned.  He will be dealt with by his own people whom he has described as anti-national.  Of course he has described me in those terms for years but it has not worried me very much.  However, when he starts to describe his own people in those terms, they will deal with him in their own way and in their own time and, if they get a chance, in the near future.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with some remarks made by the Taoiseach when he spoke last week on the Finance Bill.  It appears to me that he became hysterical in the course of his remarks. He suggested that people in the trade who opposed this Bill, retailers, wholesalers and other people, were forming themselves into a political Party and that they had no right to become, as he described it, a political organisation.  I am not here to act as a spokesman for the wholesalers or the retailers or any other vested interest or organised group, but I find it hard to stomach the attack launched by the Taoiseach on the traders, telling them that they are not entitled to protest.  He said at column 1396 of Volume 203, No. 10 of the official Report.</P>
    <P>Traders who mix up politics and business usually do not do much good at either.</P>
    <P>That is the statement made by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Taoiseach about this document from which I propose to quote.  It is headed &ldquo;Fianna Fáil, 13, Upper Mount Street, Dublin: <Col N="1608" /> General Election Finance Committee.&rdquo; It is a letter addressed to every citizen and it carries the names of the most prominent traders and business people in this city of Dublin.  It is an appeal for funds made by a special committee of the biggest business people in this city, so that Fianna Fáil could be returned to power.</P>

      <P>They cannot.  If Deputy Lenihan had admitted that one of the reasons this turnover tax was imposed was to raise funds to give grants to people of the type I have mentioned, the names on this list, he would have been more sincere and honest in saying for what purpose the money was needed.  I say that instead of the money going to education, to Bord na Móna, to the development of this country on lines on which it should be developed, the money is being handed over to private enterprise, with no control exercised on behalf of the taxpayer who is giving the money.  Huge sums are voted but the names are not disclosed of the people who benefit, some of them belonging to the Parliamentary Secretary's Party.  There is no check afterwards either on how the money is expended or what employment it provides.</P>

      <P>Of course it is true. It is a well-known fact that in a number of cases where grants have been given for modernisation and automation, workers have been laid off as a result.  To make it topical as far as the Finance Bill is concerned, this is one of the reasons why Fianna Fáil are introducing this turnover tax.  We know how little extra employment has been given in the last few years.  We know that what has been given is to juvenile labour in Limerick and female labour elsewhere at shameful wages and shameful conditions.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to argue that the number of people going to Britain has been reduced, my reply is that it is not due to any action on the part of the Government but to inefficiency and lack of planning in England itself where employment attractions are not as valuable as they were in years gone by.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government put forward the case that this turnover tax has already been in operation in Sweden, that that provides an example of how it works and that there is no reason why it should not work equally well here.  If this Government were prepared to put into operation here the social services, the economic development, the restriction on exploitation, the control of profiteers and the excellent health services that obtain in Sweden, there might be some justification for aping or copying the Swedish system, but it is downright dishonest for a Government like this, which is reactionary, to copy the taxation system of one of the most progressive socialist countries in the world without also copying the social welfare conditions and the employment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most dishonest effort on the part of the Government who say <Col N="1612" /> they are endeavouring to go to the left.  How far to the left?  They have not a notion of going left.  What they are doing is endeavouring to cash in on the unpopularity of conservatism in Britain and saying: &ldquo;We must steer clear of any similarity to conservatism and try to gull the young electors&rdquo;. They are not sincere in their promise to implement left-wing policies; they have no intention of doing so.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested there is no alternative means of raising the money which this Finance Bill proposes to raise.  I would remind the Taoiseach it is not so many years since he said in this House that it was not the duty of the Opposition to suggest alternative policies.  That was his answer when in Opposition and when he was asked what his Party would do if in power. The reason I mention that is that it has been the level of debate that has gone on in this House for years: the Opposition have been saying it is not their business to suggest an alternative policy and the Government have been wagering that the Opposition were incapable of suggesting an alternative policy.  What is happening to the country while all this nonsense is going on?  The simple fact is that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are trying to work an outmoded machine.  If Fine Gael were in power tomorrow, they might have a new driver but it is the same system, the same car.  It makes no difference which of them is there.  It is this competition for power that has brought this country to the stage where only a series of general elections can clarify the position as to who is leaning to the left or who can be described as conservative and non-progressive. It is the electors&mdash;not a debate in this House&mdash;who can say that.</P>
    <P>The view we take on this is that it is so important to the country that a decision by the electorate is essential. We feel there must be a general election.  We feel there must be an opportunity for the public to decide whether they want taxes of the nature contained in this Bill.  I have no compunction about voting with any group in this House at present for the purpose of bringing about a general election.  I <Col N="1613" /> do not like the idea of having to spend weeks in my constituency, without any funds, to fight an election but I am prepared to do it.  I am prepared to face an election at any time again, even though maybe within 12 months of an immediate election, we should have another.  However, they are essential.</P>
    <P>I think we shall find that, if the public are as intelligent as I believe them to be, these two major Parties will be on the one side of the House before many moons have passed. Deputy O'Malley may smile.  However, he knows, as other members of his Party know, that the degree of difference between his outlook and that expressed on the benches opposite him is negligible.  Being possibly one of the most capable and progressive members of his Party, he must feel very sick at present in having to sit with the Minister and the group with which he is associated.</P>
    <P>The slogan at the moment must be: &ldquo;Get Them Out&rdquo;: that refers to this Government.  Let the Irish people decide within the next month whether or not they are prepared to allow Fianna Fáil back to impose this taxation. The public are the true judges. The issue is of such importance that it must be the electors who will decide and not this House on the basis of the votes of one or two Deputies.</P>

      <P>Once a man is elected to this House, he is a Deputy of Dáil Éireann and, as such, he should be highly respected. It is scandalous that any group should go to any man's house or send threatening letters dictating to him what he should do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say beyond pointing out that quite a number of people are shouting about this tax.  I know them very well.  If there were a general election tomorrow morning the vast majority of them would vote Fianna Fáil again.  I know they would do that and yet they are the loudest among those who are now shouting.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil may say that if you vote against this turnover tax you are voting for a general election.  I am voting against this turnover tax but I do not want a general election.  Probably Deputy McQuillan does: I do not.  I am voting against this Bill because the vast majority of the people I represent in East Galway are opposed to it.  I am aware that quite a number of them are Fianna Fáil.  I know that if there were a general election tomorrow morning, they would vote Fianna Fáil again because apparrently Fianna Fáil are not now a political Party but more of a religion than anything else.</P>
      <P>One aspect of this turnover tax that has not been mentioned in this House concerns the local rates.  I have not the slightest doubt that this 6d. in the £ will cost the ratepayers 2/- in the £ in local rates.  It is a good many years since I first became a member of a local authority.  I find that every time there is an increase for instance in the cost in foodstuffs for county homes, hospitals, and so on, the rate goes up accordingly.  The result in rural areas will be an increase of at least 2/- in the £ in the local rates.</P>
      <P>Apart from all that, what exactly are we doing and who will pay this tax?  I know who will pay it.  The Parliamentary Secretary will pay his share as well as myself.  The consumer will have to pay.  He always has to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House beyond making that protest&mdash;not that I was asked to do so by either of the Deputies to whom I referred.  They do not need me to protest on their behalf.  They are damn well able to <Col N="1616" /> protest without me.  I despise this tax, but I hope that no political Party is behind protest activities that seek to intimidate any member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I am not on the popular side, and I know it is good business for politicians to be on the popular side.  Before I make my contribution, I should like to quote from President Kennedy's book <i>Profiles in Courage</i> in which he quotes the well-known political commentator, Mr. Walter Lippman.  He is referring to the subject of popularity in politics:</P>
      <P>With exceptions so rare they are regarded as miracles of nature, successful democratic politicians are insecure and intimidated men.  They advance politically only if they placate, appease, bribe, seduce, bam-boozle or otherwise manage to manipulate the demanding threatening elements in their constituencies. The decisive question is not whether a proposal is good, but whether it is popular&mdash;not whether it will work or will prove itself, but whether the active-talking constituents like it immediately.</P>
      <P>I am summing up the whole controversy in this debate by giving this quotation.</P>
      <P>I want to refer first to the barrage of threats, bribes and abuses I have been getting for the past week and which was referred to by the last speaker.  Apart from about 70 telegrams and letters, many of which were threatening and which I have handed over to certain authorities, I had phone calls day and night and I had crowds going in cars hooting around my house. There was an army of people around the Mansion House last night where I expected to be present.  For the peace of the Mansion House, I decided not to go there.  It was not because I am afraid.  I am afraid of no one.  I have had deputations to my own house and to this House.  The pressure has been kept up to the last moment.  I received several letters today.  It would seem all those threats are coming from property-owning and moneyed people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>You might have read some of them in the paper.  One gentleman wrote and said he would use his five cars to make sure I was not returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Imagine, this millionaire is going to use his five cars to see I am not returned.  I could speak for an hour on the work I have done for certain people in this city; yet this man is going to see to it that I will not be allowed to do that any more because I am trying to take part of his fortune away from him.  We are told we are to have an army of cars around the Dáil on 3rd July.  I understand they are mobilising all over Ireland.  You will probably see a million pounds worth of cars passing, the owners of which will represent £80 million to £100 million worth of property and money.  They are going to march by protesting.  It will not be like the old days when we saw the old age pensioners parading.  It is extraordinary that the Labour Party are in the same lobby as those gentlemen.</P>
      <P>Why are those people organising and threatening?  Surely they are not doing so because the worker is going to pay too much for his food?  Surely these people are concerned about themselves?  You know propertied people do not give the poor a kind look.  You know very well they get their property perhaps through a lot of &ldquo;fiddling&rdquo; at the expense of the poor, apart from legitimately getting it.  Those people will not shed a tear for the poor.  Surely they feel they are going to lose something?  Someone has told me they will not be able to &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo; in income tax.  I have been told they are going to lose substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they are going to lose, how can the people lose?  They both cannot lose.  If they are going to lose, the people are going to gain.  I questioned those people when the top brass came here to make their case.  I asked them straight: &ldquo;If you can put this on, will you not get your money back?  What are you complaining about?&rdquo; They said that they could get their money <Col N="1618" /> back, but that they did not like the tax.  They did not like the procedure. They did not like this business of inspectors.  Why are they so afraid of an inspector coming in?  We have a saying here when penalties are mentioned in the discussion of a Bill relating to criminal matters that the innocent do not have to worry, only the guilty.  What are they worrying about?  Those people are trying to cover up something.  One thing is certain: they will not shed a tear for the man in the street.</P>
    <P>It has been said, even by members of the Opposition, that I must be afraid of an election.  We all have a bit of savvy.  If you follow that up, you can see that I could be a very big man today if I wanted to vote against this tax.  The Mayoralty was put in my lap last night by two groups who could have put me in.  I said no.  I could be in the Mansion House with my chain and £3,000 a year.  I could have the Mansion House as my election headquarters and thousands of cars at my disposal, but I said no. Why would I be afraid of an election? That is the one thing that would make me.  I would be hailed as a hero for putting the Government out.  I have ambitions and hopes like any other man, but I am satisfied with a little.  Money does not buy me.  If it did, I would be a rich man today, but I think I am the poorest Deputy in the House.</P>
    <P>Why do I support the Government? For years we have heard the Opposition demanding that people on social benefits should get more, that the Old IRA should get more, that the State pensioners should get more.  All last year we had private motions asking for things that would cost millions. There was a deficit in the Budget this year.  How can anyone get anything this year if there is a shortage in our finances?  How could they get anything next year?  The question has been asked why a tax is not put on this and that.  I accept the Minister's word that he could not get a quarter of what he wanted by putting a tax on alleged luxuries.  If they think £10 million can be got that way, why do they not convince me of it?  I am <Col N="1619" /> willing to vote against the tax tonight if I am convinced, but so far I am not convinced.  Let them give me details of how much they will put on this and on that and how much it will realise. I want to tot it up.</P>
    <P>I know what the Government are going to do: I know they are putting on 2½ per cent.  I know all the lies and distortions and everything else but I do not know what the Opposition are doing.  If I am to put the Government out and have a general election, then there will be a Coalition proposed and we shall have to face this Budget and get in money.  What will be taxed? Be honest.  I know what the Government are doing but I do not know what the Opposition have up their sleeve.  But they want an election. What sort of an election?  A packed election?  I have &ldquo;savvy&rdquo; and imagination. Some Deputy over there tried to make out that I had not the standard expected of an able representative. I have more &ldquo;savvy&rdquo; than he has.  Many better people had not great education.  From my study of history, the people who mattered were all simple men, not the people who claimed to have the letters after their name.</P>
    <P>I shall vote against this tax if I am given details of the alternative but I am not going to buy a pig in a sack such as was sold to North-East Dublin. For what am I supposed to put out the Government?  If the tax is not imposed, how can the people get increased social benefits?  How can the demand be met? There must be some new form of taxation. I believe that if the ordinary people are asked to make a little sacrifice&mdash;and it is only a little one&mdash;it will be in their own interest and that of their kith and kin because they will become old age pensioners and widows. This tax will bring in the wherewithal to give the substantial increases the Opposition are always shouting&mdash;but only shouting&mdash;about.  That would justify the tax to me.  Do people not give a little to be buried, give a little so that when they are sick, they can get it back?  They are only asked to make a little investment <Col N="1620" /> now so that perhaps all those social benefits will jump considerably in a year or two.</P>
    <P>I am convinced they will jump&mdash; perhaps not so much next year, but perhaps substantially in the following year and the year after that.  That is the one thing I keep in mind.  The tax will provide the wherewithal for these increases which would not otherwise be available.  I am convinced I am doing the right thing.  I know politics better than anyone here.  When I came into public life on Dublin City Council, all I could hear were proposals to reduce differential rents.  They were all codding the people because I found within six months of being elected, having studied the housing situation, that Dublin City Council had no power to reduce rents.  None of the others who were in office for five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is the same thing. The people are being codded.  I told the people not to mind the others, that they had no power and that it was only the city manager and no one else who had the power to vary the rents.  The others never told the people that but I told them.  Even on the eve of the last municipal election, one political Party advertised: &ldquo;Elect us and we will reduce your rents and it will cost the ratepayers nothing.&rdquo; How could that be done?  I challenged that in the Press.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to point out how this business of politics is a lying sort of game and most of what has been said about this tax is lies. Only a little is being asked of everyone and if, as I told RGDATA headquarters, the traders are honest, the people will lose very little.  That is what the people are worried about&mdash; will the traders be honest?  I have had a letter from the West Finglas Tenants Association and their worry was that the traders would rob them.  It will cost very little if the traders are honest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the Minister did not handle this Bill very well.  I do not <Col N="1621" /> object to its principle but he left the people in fear of being robbed.  That is why I spoke about small coinage. The Minister should make up his mind to have farthings and half-farthings because these coins would help to prevent the poorer classes being robbed. It is no use asking for sixpenceworth because if you give a halfpenny tax, you are being robbed.  I have inquired about this and I have put it to small shopkeepers who said that even though our system of money is not suitable, they thought if we had farthings and half-farthings, it would meet the situation. The Minister should seriously think of this.  They fear they will lose hundreds of farthings every week.</P>
    <P>If the tax is applied honestly all round, there is little to fear.  The wherewithal will be there and, as I see it, the promises of the Opposition will be redeemed by the Government. That is why I have faith in the tax, although it is a bit confusing.  If there is any hardship in the Bill, I hope the Minister will make amendments between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Nobody likes to make enemies but we are making enemies, largely, I believe, due to misrepresentation and vested interests.  I have walked through my constituency and I do not think three people protested to me about the tax.  The only protests I got were from those with flashy cars.</P>
    <P>I was looking over the history of the introduction of income tax during the week and it was much the same story, controversial like the turnover tax.  It was introduced during the Napoleonic wars to pay for the cost of the war and was opposed at all stages.  In 1816, there were 400 petitions against it.  Twenty-two thousand people signed a petition against it.  It was because there was no income tax that there were no social benefits or amenities for the poor in those days.  That is why people died in workhouses.  The money was not there and it was only when supertax was introduced that they were able to give old age pensions in 1909.  Read about the Famine and you will find the reason people starved on the roadside: they starved because there were no relief works, because there was no money coming in by way of rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> One must have money in order to do certain things.  The reason this proposal is before the House is that we must have money for certain things. I know people object to handing over money.  I have had my little experiences as a councillor.  People want houses.  If you tell them they are not eligible, then you are no use. If you tell them the truth, you will suffer.  Cod them.  Say: &ldquo;Yes, I will do my best&rdquo; and you are OK. People in public life have to try to avoid making enemies and the best way to do that is to avoid telling too many truths.  Public life is a funny game.  Individuals are honest decent people, but public life is a &ldquo;hookey&rdquo; sort of business.  You cannot afford to be very honest in it.  At least, if you are honest, you will not be believed.  That is why the Opposition are having a field day at the moment; they are able to put it over that everyone will be robbed.  But there is very little truth in that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the debate. It would be much easier for me to walk into the other Lobby instead of on the Government side tonight.  I would be cheered by simple people. But simple people do not understand and simple people should not be asked to make a decision on vital policy of this sort because they are not able to understand it.  This is a matter that should be decided here where people are not so simple.  In fact, if anything, they are too cute.  One cannot ask simple people to decide an issue of this sort.  It can only be decided in time when people have had a chance to know the effect of it.  It is only when it comes into operation and people realise that both sides have adjusted in such a way that there is not much of a loss really that they begin to realise that money is being accumulated for a good cause.</P>
    <P>The money is, in my opinion, being collected for a good cause.  Even if it is an evil&mdash;it is not so much an evil really as a nuisance&mdash;it is the lesser of two evils.  That is the way I look at it.  Let it be a nuisance; let it be an evil.  In my opinion, and because of my experience, I believe it is the lesser of two evils and I would rather vote <Col N="1623" /> for this Government and keep this Government in office for another year or two to give them a chance to operate this and see what they can do. Even if I am sneered at and jeered at, I prefer to do that than to have a Government here consisting of several different Parties, blackmailing one another for office and ratting the moment something unpopular looms on the horizon.</P>
    <P>Why is there this wholesale objection to this tax?  What about all the taxes the Opposition Parties put on, with the support of the Labour Party? People would in time see the hopelessness of it, but then it would be too late. They would be in office for perhaps five years.  It has been argued that because this tax is a nuisance or an evil, the Government are standing with one foot off the ground and the wise guys say they could easily be knocked over.  I admit all that.  I believe if there were an election tomorrow, the Government would lose 12 seats and the Coalition would be back in office for several years.  I think that would be a calamity because the decision would not be based on knowledge of both sides of the case.  It would be a pig-in-a-poke decision because many people would be voting unaware that they would be victimised within a month of the election.  That is why I say an election would be deceptive.  It would be a crime.  It would be a shame.  The time to have an election is 12 months from now when we will be able to see what the real position is instead of having before us, as we have now, a distorted picture painted by vested interests who hope to gain personally by this uprising&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the most distressing aspects of the entire debate on this measure to date has been the growing feeling amongst the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, and those who support them, that once they get <Col N="1624" /> into this House in a position of power, the ordinary man in the street has no protection whatsoever against them. When I hear the Minister for Justice describe the almost unanimous protests by people like RGDATA, the NFA, the trade unions, the chambers of commerce, the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party, and the various other organs of public opinion in the country, as artificially fomented hysteria, I begin to feel that the Fianna Fáil Party have come back to something from which I thought they had got away: no matter what the Irish people say, all the Fianna Fáil Party have to do is to look into their own heart to know what the Irish people want.</P>
      <P>When I hear Deputy Sherwin growing annoyed and describing the action of one of his constituents, who wrote to him and said he was going to use his cars against him the next time, as threats and abuse, I begin to feel that when an ordinary Deputy gets into a position of power, he begins to think the Irish people have no right whatever to make their views known and felt in between general elections.  Above all, when I hear the Leader of the Government threatening a body like RGDATA, I feel the situation has got almost completely out of hand.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands put his finger on the gravamen of the trouble when he here, about half an hour ago, boasted the Government wanted more money because the Government were going to spend more money.  He pointed over to this side of the House and he criticised us.  He criticised us because he felt we might be prudent in the use of the money collected from the people.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that he regards Government spending as a major weapon to be used. So do we.  We regard Government spending as a major weapon to be used in industrial development but we do not regard it as a major weapon to be misused in industrial development, development along the lines to which Deputy McQuillan referred earlier today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when he addressed the House last Thursday, accused the <Col N="1625" /> Fine Gael Party of being fiercely critical down through the years of Fianna Fáil proposals for industrial development.  He said the measures we took to criticise amounted to black-guardism. We of the Fine Gael Party only behave in the reactionary manner indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands in his speech here today when, time and again, the Fianna Fáil Party have boosted industrial doodlers, encouraging them to engage in industry at the expense of the consumer; we have had to criticise that type of industrial development.  We will continue to deplore tactics which savour of the <i>fait accompli,</i> tactics which are used to establish an industry here through the device of an industrial user here, and then point to it and say that so much money has already been spent on this industrial area, or this industry, that we must spend more, if necessary.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the country and the House once more to the <i>motif</i> set by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands when he spoke here. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have increased expenditure.  Of course we will continue to do so.&rdquo; That can be compared and aligned with the statement of the Taoiseach here not so long ago that this was not a time for retrenchment, this was a time for courage. I have never heard a gambler saying anything else but that this was not a time for retrenchment, that this was a time when the gambler's lucky streak might be struck and he would throw good money after bad in the hope that something would come off.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands regards that as a conservative, reactionary approach to the industrial development of this country, he is welcome to it.  We on our side of the House have been consistently preaching caution on the part of the Government in the approach to industrial development.  We are not opposed to anything that is good, anything that is productive, anything that will increase gainful employment.  We are afraid, we are fearful, we are anxious that any wildcat scheme that is thrown before the Minister for <Col N="1626" /> Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be accepted, simply because it represents another industry and a Minister can make another speech at another opening or somebody can get up on a platform later and say there were four new factories opened last year or five new factories opened last month.</P>
    <P>That is not the type of industrial development to which we aspire.  It is not the type of industrial development to which the country should aspire.  If the Fianna Fáil Party had already learned their lesson, we might be happy but I gravely doubt that there has been any advent of wisdom to the Fianna Fáil Party in that regard.  Industries have been brought here, have been opened, have been guaranteed by Government loan at a time when similar industries all over the world were languishing and over-producing. When we of the Fine Gael Party got up on this side of the House and indicated that perhaps this was a time for prudence, we were told we were doing no good for our constituencies and no good for the country. We were addressed in terms similar to the terms used by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands today, indicating that we were conservative and reactionary.</P>
    <P>The time seems to have arrived when the Fianna Fáil Party might realise, because of the hard logic of facts, that they have been throwing good money away.  They might realise that many of these industries which were set up at a time when it was imprudent to set them up cannot continue to operate unless they can get further injections by way of Government grants.  I believe that is going to happen.  I am quite certain it is going to happen and I believe that is one of the reasons why the Government have had to come to this House and ask for the penal taxation which has brought about what the Minister for Justice has been pleased to call &ldquo;artificially fomented hysteria&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The so-called artificially fomented hysteria is the reaction of the small man who faces disaster if this tax is passed by this House.  The so-called artificially fomented hysteria is the <Col N="1627" /> informed view of trade organisations which have looked into every aspect of this tax and have come to the conclusion, as they are constitutionally and democratically entitled to come, that this tax is not alone wrong and unnecessary but is ruinous to the small man.  Are these organisations to be threatened that if they continue like that, they will be treated as political organisations, that if they continue like that, they are going to emerge with a bloody nose and if they continue like that, there is a suggestion that the Government will in some way bring further legislation against them?</P>
    <P>I see nothing whatsoever wrong in organisations of that nature, in small men whose future is put in jeopardy, calling to their Deputies, writing to their Deputies, telephoning or telegraphing their Deputies.  If Deputy Sherwin or the Leader of the Government or the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Justice thinks otherwise, I think it is a trend which should be deplored in this House and it will certainly be deplored among the ordinary people whose one anxiety at the moment is to protest by telegram, letter, word of mouth or action within the letter of the law to any member of this House who intends to support the proposals which the Government put before us for support on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I think the wrong sort of industry is being fostered in this country.  Government or semi-Government organisations are not giving the right approach to the right type of industrialist who seeks to assist the industrial development of this country.  I know of one case in Cork of a young Corkman who came back two years ago from America and set up a small factory.  Recently he was ready to give employment to about four times as many people as he had engaged.  He wrote to An Foras Tionscal and received a reply asking him for further details.  He wrote to them again and got a letter back saying that they could not assist him in any way.  He begs that at least he should be given an interview. There was not on that occasion one word of encouragement given to this young Irishman who set up a small <Col N="1628" /> factory and looked for some Government assistance either by way of money or advice which would enable him to participate in the industrial development of this country.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the turnover tax is an equitable tax because it taxes everyone.  That is the most specious argument that has been put before the House.  It reduces all men to the same level.  The millionaires of whom Deputy Sherwin spoke are equated with the unfortunate type of constituent Deputy Sherwin should be representing here, the working man with eight or nine children, because such a man has to pay for bread, butter, tea, sugar, clothes, footwear for those eight or nine children.  Every item of food that he gives every one of those eight or nine children is taxed while the millionaire bachelor of whom Deputy Sherwin is speaking and for whom he seems to hold some brief here today, simply pays the same amount of tax.  I should like members of the House to advert to that aspect of the case when they come to vote on this turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The Government say that the working man is getting the tax back through social measures.  It is notable that £10 million will be collected by this tax and of that, only £4.7 million goes back under social benefits.  If this tax were necessary, we would be glad to subscribe to it but this tax is being imposed purely, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands made clear here today, because the Government intend to have increased expenditure, because the Government feel it is increasingly necessary for the State to intervene in industry by pumping in money to any random person that may come along and ask for it.  That is why this tax is asked for.</P>
    <P>We are asked have we any alternative. I suggest one.  Instead of coming to the conclusion that it is increasingly necessary for the State to intervene, I suggest the Minister should try to encourage the ordinary investor to intervene with private capital rather than with State capital.  It is more than likely that the private investor would be more prudent than the Government. <Col N="1629" /> The Government can get this money from the private investor by way of taxation.  The private investor himself stands to lose.  It is more than likely that if more public issues were thrown open to the public, they would subscribe quite generously on the strength of the performance of the people who looked for the capital. As it is, the Government can, almost anonymously subscribe as much as they like to anyone they like without seeking proof of their <i>bona fides</i>.  If they had to publish their <i>bona fides</i> in the form of a prospectus, the Government would not require the millions they are looking for now; the public would not be asked to subscribe anonymously to organisations of that nature through a turnover tax; and the Government would not be here today, relying on the single solitary support of poor Deputy Sherwin, whose sickly apologia here tonight did not impress anyone.  Deputy Sherwin objects to his constituents showing any scintilla of self-interest.  I know, the country knows, and his constituents know, that it is self-interest, and self-interest alone, that has dictated Deputy Sherwin's approach to this deplorable measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put to the House just one question.  It is quite obvious that the Opposition Parties do not see eye to eye in regard to this Finance Bill.  The Fine Gael Party has put down a motion which condemns the Bill in <i>toto</i>.  The Labour Party has put down a motion which accepts the Bill in part, but objects to one provision in it.  Both Parties, I take it, base their attitudes upon their outlook on the future of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand, we have the old reactionary Party which includes Deputy Barrett who, at the beginning of his speech, condemned, root and branch, the policy which this Government have followed in the past in promoting and developing our economy. He said their approach would be more prudent: the prudent approach which, for instance, sabotaged Aerlínte in 1948; the prudent approach of the Leader of the Opposition who boasted that he would live to see the day when <Col N="1630" /> rabbits would gambol on the runways in Shannon; the prudent approach of the Leader of the Opposition who boasted that one day the shares of the Industrial Credit Company would be used for wrapping bars of soap.  The fact of the matter is that whenever Fine Gael have had any influence in the councils of this State, the economy has been paralysed and all development has been immobilised.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party do not share that view, I take it, from the terms of their motion which are very striking and which, I feel, were dictated by the fact that they approve of the policy which the Government have been pursuing for the past seven years.  They have good reason to do so.  That policy is set out in the various items of expenditure on the various services in Table 3 which was circulated with the Budget. There you see that, since 1957, expenditure on education has been increased by 50 per cent; expenditure on health has been increased by 38 per cent; and expenditure on economic development has been increased by 56 per cent.  All that is out of the current Budget.  None of it is represented by borrowed money.  It is financed out of revenue collected from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The point which now arises on this motion is: if, by any chance, the Government are defeated on this stage of the Bill, if they are defeated because of the fact that the Finance Bill includes provision for a turnover tax, what will be put in its place?  No person has answered that question.  As I have said, the Labour Party have quite clearly dissociated themselves from the attitude of the Fine Gael Party in this matter because they have said in their amendment that while they are willing to support reasonable taxation proposals to maintain the public services, including proposals in the Finance Bill, the Dáil should decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill unless and until the turnover tax is deleted.</P>
    <P>Assume we could accept that motion.  Assume it were possible, within the limits of our existing taxable capacity and tax structure to dispense with the turnover tax, what is it proposed <Col N="1631" /> to put in its place?  You cannot rely any longer&mdash;and this is the crux of the matter&mdash;upon what were formerly the pillars of the Exchequer: beer duty and spirits duty.  Both were increased in the Budget of 1962 and produced very disappointing results. The fact of the matter is that in relation to those two taxes&mdash;and shortly in relation to the tax on tobacco&mdash;the law of diminishing returns is beginning to assert itself.  Therefore, you cannot replace the turnover tax by increasing the taxes on beer and spirits. Even if you did, these would not produce for you the £12 million or £14 million additional revenue which will be required next year, in the year 1964, to maintain the present economic trend in this State, to continue to provide better social services for our people, and to continue to invest larger and larger sums in our economy in an endeavour to carry out the industrial development which has been so signally beneficial to the people of the country for the past seven years.</P>
    <P>If you cannot rely on taxation from beer and spirits, are you to rely on the income tax payer?  Consider that. There are approximately 300,000 income tax payers in this country.  Of those, less than 1½ per cent. are in the surtax class.  One shilling in the £ on income tax produces £6 million.  As I have said, next year, in 1964, £14 million will be wanted.  Are you to increase the standard rate of tax by 2/-?  Remember, the income tax paying class now is very largely, is to a preponderant degree, the workers, tradesmen, small farmers, civil servants, garda, the man in the building trade, the dock labourer, officers of the Defence Forces &mdash; the white collar workers.  Those are the people who are paying income tax now.</P>
    <P>The question which has to be answered after this debate when Deputies go into the division lobby is this: If you are going to dispense with the turnover tax, to delete the turnover tax, are you going to increase the standard rate of income tax by 2/- in the £?  If you do increase it by 2/- in the £, then the incidence of that tax will fall most heavily upon that large <Col N="1632" /> class, at least a quarter of a million people, who come within the PAYE scheme.  They are not surtax payers and they are not wealthy people.  They do not buy mink coats or drive Jaguar cars.  They are people who are trying to bring up their family properly.  They are trying to give their children a decent education.  They are trying to buy houses, to make some provision for the future, trying to save a little and perhaps to invest in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>What is the alternative to the turnover tax?  One alternative is to increase the standard rate of tax and I dare any member of this House to go out to any middle-class district in this city and say he voted against the turnover tax because he thought that to increase the standard rate of income tax would be a satisfactory substitute. Of course, somebody will say: &ldquo;We shall not tax the small man.  We shall not tax the worker or the tradesman. We want to get after the surtax payer.&rdquo; The number of surtax payers in this country is about 4,500 and the total amount collected from them in tax is approximately £2,200,000.  The rate of the tax ranges from 2/6d. to 7/6d. that is to say, a person who is well into the surtax class but not above the middle level may pay approximately 8/10d. in the £ of his income.  The man who is in the top rank may pay 13/10d.  But supposing the rate is increased by approximately one-third, so that the aggregate of surtax and income tax ranges from, say, 11/9d. to an upper limit of 18/6d. in the £, how much would be got out of it?  A sum of £700,000 would be collected, not a penny more, and most probably a good deal less.</P>
    <P>Again there is no use in saying that public services can be provided and financed on their present scale and at their present standard and at the same time, that the turnover tax can be dispensed with.  As I said, you cannot tax beer any more; you cannot tax spirits any more.  You can, if you like, raise the rate of income tax but if so, you will hit the middle-class, the tradesman, the small shopkeeper and the manual and clerical workers.  You cannot get any more from the surtax <Col N="1633" /> payer because if you increase the surtax rates to the level I have mentioned, you will get less than a paltry £700,000. The consequence indeed would be that many of those surtax payers would take themselves and their taxable fortunes away and would cease to contribute any longer to the revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in this year that we are providing for education 51 per cent more money than was provided in 1957-58.  This is the year in which we are providing 38 per cent more money for health services.  This is the year in which we are providing 66 per cent more money for agriculture, 67 per cent more money for industry, 31 per cent more for transport and 92 per cent more for forestry and fisheries.  It is to meet that expenditure that we want this increased revenue from taxation.  Therefore in order to get money in this year, we have to make the corporation profits tax retrospective.  It has been said that you can tax corporation profits lightly because you are taxing the big companies.  Of course, you are doing nothing of the sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it stands now, in order to get the money to provide these services which the Labour Party want, which I think, many of the Independent members in the House want&mdash;some of them are not satisfied with the level to which we have raised them and want them to be expanded still further&mdash;you must do <Col N="1634" /> that.  One of the reasons why we have had to abolish the already low exemption limit for corporation profits tax is that we have had to find this money for essential public services in this year.  Of course, we could adopt the attitude of Fine Gael and say that expenditure must be frozen.  We could say that we shall allow the country to stagnate as it stagnated from 1948 until 1951, as it stagnated again from 1954 until they were driven out in 1957 and as it would stagnate again assuredly under a third Coalition if such a thing were ever again to come into being.</P>
    <P>We could take up the attitude of the Fine Gael Party and leave educational services at the present level.  If we are to improve the educational services, if we are to do more for the workers, do more for the tradesmen, do more for the children of the middle-class in the way of education, to open up and make available to them the highest level of education in this land, it must cost money.  We could say: &ldquo;No, we cannot do that.  We shall freeze expenditure,&rdquo; as Deputy Sweetman said on the general Resolution, as Deputy Anthony Barry said on the Second Stage of this Bill: &ldquo;We will freeze expenditure at its present level.&rdquo; You cannot freeze expenditure at its present level and retain the existing public services because if we were to freeze expenditure at the existing level it would not pay for the existing public services on the scale to which they have been developed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, whether you think we are going too fast, as Fine Gael obviously think, or that we are not going fast enough, as the Labour Party prefers to think, there is one thing certain, that in order even to maintain the services at the level of last year's standards, taxation must still be increased because there was a deficit on last year's Budget which must be covered in this Budget. The members of the House cannot delude themselves into thinking that if we were to freeze expenditure at its present level, we would not still have to increase taxation.</P>
    <P>I was speaking about corporation profits tax.  We must have money to carry on essential public services. Nobody will deny that and if we are <Col N="1635" /> to improve the public services we must have more money.  It has been necessary in this context to tax every incorporated company whether it is a private company or a public company.  It has been necessary to tax the family companies. If somebody thinks it is an easy matter to increase corporation profits tax, as apparently in some quarter of the House it is thought to be, this must be remembered: every small family company will now pay tax ultimately at the rate of 1/- in the £.  There are, it is true, certain alleviating conditions which will defer the full impact of that tax for a couple of years, but, we must remember that the person who is paying that tax in a family company is also paying his income tax at the standard rate.  The standard rate is 6/4d. in the £ and if he happens to be, as he may be, in the £1,500 class he is probably paying very close&mdash;I have not made the exact calculation&mdash;to the full standard rate and at the same time, called upon to pay in this case 2½ per cent in addition, another sixpence in the £.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the alternative to the turnover tax is not to be found in increased corporation profits tax.  In fact, corporation profits tax brings us in comparitively little.  It is necessary, I repeat, that we should get the money in this year in order to pay for the current services and to make provision for the increased expenditure next year which will inevitably follow from the provisions we are making for the social services in this year and for the improved standard of educational services.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Barrett indulging in what has become the chief misrepresentation in relation to this tax. He said that the turnover tax will produce £11 million.  Yes, it will, in a full 12 months.  He said we are imposing this tax which is going to bring in £11 million in order to provide for an increase in the social welfare services and the increased aid to agriculture amounting to £3½ million.  The fact of the matter is that for the four or five months during which it will be in operation in the current year, it is <Col N="1636" /> expected to bring in only £3½ million as against an increased expenditure on agriculture, social welfare and public pensions of £3.78 million.</P>
    <P>Some people have said that this is a most oppressive tax.  It is not; it is an equitable tax.  It falls most heavily on the greatest spender and to the extent that large spending may arise in family circumstances, the impact is very heavily cushioned indeed by the increase in the children's allowances. It is one of its advantages that the tax does fall on the heavy spender.  It falls on the person who buys the mink coat or the Jaguar car.</P>
    <P>And, of course, it falls on the person who buys the box of matches.  Because it does, a great deal of humbug has been talked here about the difficulty of levying the 2½ per cent tax on a box of matches.  Here is a simple fact.  The standard box of matches contains 42 matches; discard one of those matches and serve 41 matches to the box and you collect your 2½ per cent.</P>

Pearse: &ldquo;If one man redeemed the world, one man can free a people&rdquo;?  It seems to me that Deputy Sherwin now believes that he can free or save a Government. I listened to the Minister for Justice this afternoon stating that if he had been a candidate in the Dublin North-East by-election, there would not have been the same result.  I do not know whether that is correct or not, but I was impressed by the result of that by-election.  Indeed, I lost money on it because I considered that Dublin North-East was the best organised Fianna Fáil section in the city and realising the organising abilities of the Minister for Justice, I thought it would be almost impossible that they would not get the seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated, and I believe, that this 2½ per cent tax was responsible for the result in Dublin North-East. I wonder if the Minister for Justice or the other Ministers are so divorced from the ordinary people that they cannot understand that the man with six or seven children is not going to gain anything.  Apart from <Col N="1638" /> his expenditure on the ordinary necessaries of life, he will find that this week Johnny has to get a pair of boots and next week Mary has to get a dress for her First Communion or for her Confirmation and the increase in social benefits will mean nothing.  I am very close to the people and after the wage earner has settled his PAYE tax and then this additional tax, any increase which he is now getting will be absorbed.  It should not be taken that I am against a purchase tax.  I know that a purchase tax works very successfully in other countries.  If the Minister could not make up the leeway by eliminating food and household commodities, then I must say I am losing confidence in our Minister for Finance.  I do not think the last speaker, the Minister for Health, when he was Minister for Finance would have had much trouble.</P>
    <P>I am very perturbed about the fact that Deputies apparently are using the privileges of this House to refer to people outside and apparently there is no protection if a Deputy, through the Chair, charges that bribes have been offered to him.  Surely if that is true, something should be done about it.  We still have not repealed our bribery and corruption legislation and I hope that before this debate concludes, in the same way as the Taoiseach contradicted a statement made by the same Deputy on a previous occasion that he had been invited to join each of the Parties, and as the Leaders of Fine Gael and Labour also contradicted him, his suggestion during this debate will also be contradicted and disowned.</P>

      <P>In the course of this discussion and of the discussion of the Budget proper, there have been frequent references to what has been described by the Government as the holdup by Dublin Corporation of the building of houses and to the inability of potential housebuilders and purchasers to secure loans.  I asked the Minister for Local Government today at Question Time to give me the numbers of houses and flats built and the amounts of money advanced by the Corporation in certain years and I want to <Col N="1639" /> quote those figures now so as to put the record right for the benefit of those who may be seeking the truth later.</P>
      <P>If you take advances to borrowers by the Dublin Corporation, you find that in 1954-55 they advanced £1,700,000, giving round figures.  In 1955-56 £1,790,000 was advanced; in 1956-57 the amount was £1,070,000; the following year the amount dropped to £495,000; in 1958-59 it was £704,000; in 1959-60 £774,000; in 1960-61 £1,106,000; in 1961-62 £945,000, and in 1962-63 £929,000. You can see from those figures that in fact the highest advances made by Dublin Corporation for the building of houses were during the period that the inter-Party Government were in office.</P>

      <P>Let us come to the housing side.  I asked the Minister for the number of houses and flats built during the periods.  I will take the figure for 1953-54 first.  The number of houses and flats built in that year was 1,353.  In 1954-55, the number was 1,922; in 1955-56, it was 1,311; and in 1956-57, 1,564.  The following year, the year we left office, it dropped to 1,021.  Then look at the trend: in 1958-59, 460 houses and flats were built; in 1959-60, the number was 503; in 1960-61, 277; in 1961-62, 392; and in 1962-63, 643, showing that the largest number of houses and flats built by the Corporation were built during the period of the inter-Party Government.</P>

      <P>These are the answers to Questions Nos. 33 and 34 furnished by the Minister for Local Government at Question Time this evening, and I hope they will at least insulate us from the malicious figures used here to distort the housing situation in the city. The best period for advancing money for the building of houses and flats in Dublin was the period of the inter-Party Government.  The present Minister for Local Government says that is so; here are the figures and I am satisfied to rely on them.</P>

      <P>Discussion on this Bill has very largely swung around the introduction for the first time in this country of what is known as a turnover tax.  It is quite clear to anybody who looks at the daily papers, and listens to what is happening generally, that the people are seriously perturbed at the Government's introduction of a turnover tax, because the purpose of the turnover tax is to get out of the pockets of consumers this year £3½ million, with the promise to the consumers that if they live for 12 months they will pay not £3½ million but £10½ million or £11 million next year.  In other words, it is a simple operation through which the Minister for Finance will transfer £11 million, which ordinarily would be in the consumers' pockets, into the Exchequer and the consuming public have got to pay that by means of a turnover tax on food, on clothing, on fuel and every conceivable thing they have to purchase in order to maintain civilised living here.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach entered the controversy on this tax a few days ago at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party at which he said:</P>
      <P>An Opposition Party may legitimately oppose particular provisions in the Finance Bill, but to seek to prevent its enactment altogether by defeating it on the Second Reading motion would represent the very acme of irresponsibility.</P>
      <P>That was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 13th June last.  It represents what the Taoiseach says was an act of irresponsibility. What he did not think of mentioning to the simple people he had assembled around him was that in 1954 he moved an exactly similar motion on the Finance Bill introduced that year by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was irresponsible to do it this year because he and his colleague, the worthy Tánaiste, sit on the front Government benches, but it was a perfectly legitimate and statesmanlike thing to do in 1954.  Those of us who have sat here for a long time will not deny the Taoiseach credit for being a wily and crafty politician, skilled in <Col N="1641" /> the art of chancing his arm, particularly if he can get away with political dividends by doing so.  This time he forgot all about what he himself did in 1954 and picked out some muscular words to condemn the Opposition as irresponsible for doing what he himself did in 1954.  If it is irresponsible now, it was thoroughly irresponsible then, and he is the person who presumes to advise the people on what is good for them and what is good in connection with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I often think that if the Taoiseach were not the Prime Minister of this country, he ought to seek some kind of sheikdom or sultancy in some coconut island where nobody would question any edict issued by him.  If the Taoiseach does not like any criticism that may be made of his proposals, then there is no language bad enough to describe it.  If you recommend a particular course and the Taoiseach does not like it, then you are either dull-witted, or something, or you have had a double dose of original sin, not to be able to see the matter with the clarity with which he sees everything.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is used to getting unquestioned obeisance to himself and thus he indulges in all these muscular and thoroughly unjustified phrases when people attempt to challenge either the accuracy or wisdom of the things he says.  It is a bit unfortunate for him that so far as this country is concerned, the electorate are intelligent and capable of appraising taxation proposals and judging whether or not such proposals are in their best interests.</P>
    <P>It is a bit unfortunate for the Taoiseach that the electorate of this country do not swallow unquestioningly all he says to them.  That is one of the hazards he has to put up with for living in this country.  Our people are entitled to take their own view of taxation proposals and to judge for themselves what is best for their own economic and social benefit.</P>
    <P>The biggest issue in this Bill is the turnover tax.  I want to ask a few simple questions.  From where did we get this proposal?  Where did this thing come from?  What member of <Col N="1642" /> the Cabinet made this proposal and sold it to the entire Cabinet?  This turnover tax was not even mentioned at the last general election.  There was not a murmur of it.  No hint whatever was given to the people at the last general election that a vote for Fianna Fáil was a vote for a turnover tax. The people were deliberately kept in the dark.  Not a single thing was said to them about a proposal to introduce a turnover tax.  They would never have voted for a turnover tax.  They never got the opportunity of voting for or against it.</P>
    <P>Less than two years after they were elected a minority Government, this Government&mdash;not feeling any hesitation in that their title deeds are a bit faulty because they do not command the confidence of a majority of the electorate of the country; feeling no inhibition of that sort whatsoever&mdash; come along to this House and introduce a turnover tax for which not a single elector voted because not a single elector was told Fianna Fáil were cooking up that piece of medicine for them.  Now, these simple people are being asked to pay £3½ million turnover tax in the current year or £10½ or £11 million in 12 months.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I am entitled to ask at this stage.  The Tánaiste seemed to think the public were &ldquo;lepping&rdquo; to pay this tax, that everybody was enthusiastic about it.  I think I am entitled to ask on what evidence do the Government rely when asserting that the people are prepared to accept this tax.</P>
    <P>The new tax has not been the subject of any test by the people.  The only test that one could say was applied to it was in the North-East Dublin by-election. If one judges the result of the North-East Dublin by-election, then the figures clearly indicate that this turnover tax has been rejected by an overwhelming majority there.  I concede that perhaps some of the vote there was influenced by the type of speech which the Tánaiste was let out to make about 48 hours before polling day.  But, on the whole, the North-East Dublin by-election result was an overwhelming defeat for the Government and, in the campaign, the turnover <Col N="1643" /> tax was the main subject of discussion.</P>
    <P>Does any other body say they are in favour of this tax, or anybody else? Not a single body that I know of in the country has indicated any support for this tax.  If you look at the reports of meetings in the papers, it seems to me that these are protest meetings. Maybe the Tánaiste thinks they are meetings to celebrate.  Maybe he thinks the people are celebrating the turnover tax.  In so far as I can judge of their language used at the meetings, and the tone of the meetings, these are protests by the people&mdash;by traders, by consumers&mdash;against their being expected to pay this turnover tax.</P>
    <P>What about the deputations that have gone to the Minister for Finance? Are these deputations bringing gifts to the Minister for his kindness in introducing the tax?  I rather suspect that these are not pleasant deputations.  I rather suspect they consist of people who are protesting against having to pay this tax.</P>
    <P>Therefore, whether you judge it by the result of the North-East Dublin by-election or by the constant pilgrimages by deputations to see the Minister for Finance or by the demonstrations in the streets or by the reports of meetings up and down the country, I think you can arrive at only one conclusion and that is that the people do not want this tax.  It is being forced through without any authority whatever from the people and without a single vote having been cast for it at the last general election.</P>
    <P>Some efforts were made in the early stages to try to give the impression that this tax would be paid by the shopkeepers and that the consumer would not pay at all.  The Minister for Finance, I think, threw that notion overboard very early on when he said, when asked who would pay&mdash;whether the shopkeeper or the consumer&mdash;he did not know.  All he did know was that he had to get the money.  That attitude from a person in his position is quite understandable.</P>
    <P>A Government speaker sought to <Col N="1644" /> cast confusion on the matter by saying that the consumers would not pay, that the shopkeeper would pay.  I do not know a single person on the Government benches who is likely to be so simple and so mentally atrophied as to believe that the shopkeeper will pay this 2½ per cent.  He will do no such thing.  So far as the shopkeeper is concerned, he is already arranging to mark up his prices and he will pay the levy out of the higher prices.  This Government will sit by and allow that to happen because the Minister for Industry and Commerce has already declared that the Prices Bill passed by this House and by Seanad Éireann is pigeon-holed, never to be used except in case of emergency.  There is no low prices Act.  There are no fixed prices now.  On 1st November next, the shopkeeper can mark up his prices, with this levy before his eyes, and he will get these prices or the customers will have to do without the articles they require.</P>
    <P>It is an over-simplification, it just does not happen, that a new spirit of bountifulness will induce the shopkeeper to pay this tax at the end of November.  We can see clearly that that notion had no justification whatever.</P>
    <P>I met a Deputy here this afternoon who spoke to a person engaged in the footwear trade.  That Deputy had already spoken in this debate; otherwise he would have quoted the story he told me.  He said a footwear trader showed him a letter he got from a footwear factory today telling him that the factory had received his order; that the shoes in question which had cost 69/- on the last occasion would cost more on this occasion; that their price had been jacked up so as to give the retail trade a little more profit and so as to allow him, also, to pay the 2½ per cent tax, if he wanted, when it came into operation.</P>
    <P>There is a boot factory already taking steps to ensure that its products will be increased in price to the consumer as a result of this tax. The match trick will not work there. That idea should be patented.  This scheme of separating the one match <Col N="1645" /> from the 42 might come in useful one of these days.  You could make a fortune out of it in a mental home.  The footwear story makes it clear as far as the consumer is concerned that he has already been earmarked to pay in higher prices what the shopkeeper has to pay as a levy under the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>We have been told on this Bill and by the Tánaiste this evening that this Budget will provide for improvements in social welfare services.  To the extent it does and to the extent this raises taxes for doing it, we are prepared to support the Bill.  But let it not be assumed we do not know how to add up simple figures.  As I judge it, in a number of years the additional social welfare services will cost something less than £4 million.  The people, however, are going to have to pay £10½ million in taxation.  As a matter of fact, the increase in surtax, the measures to tighten up income tax evasion and other taxes of that kind would give us sufficient to increase the social services as provided for in the Bill without the necessity of having to impose this turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Our record in respect of social welfare expenditure is undergoing a change.  As a percentage of tax revenue, the amount we spent on social welfare in 1957-58 was 22 per cent.  The next year it was reduced to 21.5 per cent; in 1959-60 it was further reduced to 20.9 per cent; in 1961 it was reduced to 20 per cent; in 1961-62 it was reduced to 18 per cent, and in 1962-63 it was reduced to approximately 18 per cent.  I believe when the calculation is made, as a result of this year's financial expenditure, the percentage on social welfare will be less than 18 per cent of our tax revenue&mdash;all indicating that, notwithstanding the fact the Minister may try to play with figures, our total expenditure on social welfare services for dealing with the classes entitled to those services is falling rather than expanding.</P>
    <P>When you get discussing this Bill and its main provision&mdash;the levying of a tax on everything the consumer purchases&mdash;your mind flies back immediately to the substantial change which <Col N="1646" /> has taken place in the past 12 years. In 1951 we were spending approximately £14 million a year on the subsidisation of food and other necessaries of life in the food category.  In 1952 the Party opposite abolished about £9 million of these food subsidies.  They did that after promising in the election of 1951 that they would not touch the food subsidies at all.  They said they were not so foolish or so stupid as to fiddle with the food subsidies, that they would stand rocklike when Fianna Fáil got in.  Just 12 months afterwards our redoubtable friend, the Minister for Finance, introduced a Budget which abolished more than half the food subsidies.  If anybody goes to the trouble of looking up the Dáil reports of the time, he will find that we were expected to believe, even though there is not a tangible reference to it, that our bodies and souls and national life would be cleaner and that we would be all the better for having got rid of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The food subsidies remained on some articles of food until 1957, when again the Fianna Fáil Government abolished the remainder of the subsidies.  While we had food subsidies in force up to 1952 and had them partially up to 1957, they are all gone now and we are facing in exactly the opposite direction.  All food subsidies are gone. Not a pound has been spent on them today, but instead we have a tax on food, which within the past six years was carrying a subsidy.  The food subsidies went in 1957 and in their place this year we are going to get for the first time a tax on the people's food. We were told the same old fallacies, the same old misbeliefs, when the subsidies were going as we have been told today as we put our hands out for the handcuffs of the turnover tax. I hope the majority of the House can be induced to believe there is no solution for our people's problems through the medium of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the tax proper.  The tax is to be at the rate of sixpence in the £1.  Or take the more spectacular method of collection: taking one match out of a box of 42, and then you discharge your responsibility to the State.  Is it not clear as daylight that, <Col N="1647" /> even if you fully investigate and understand the match problem, after all the research carried on in taking a single match out of a box of 42, that when a person goes into a shop to buy 6d. worth, he will not be charged the 2½ per cent?  Will he not be asked to pay an extra halfpenny?  Is there any protection, if he is asked?  It will be more than 2½ per cent.  There are no farthings in circulation.  By and large, up and down the country I wager a lot of people will be paying not at the rate of 6d. in the £ but at the rate of at least 10d. in the £.  That may even be worse in some circumstances.  If you spend your money, as the needy people must spend it, in small sums instead of pounds, you will not be paying 2½ per cent but something more like four per cent to five per cent.</P>
    <P>What seems to me to be the most vicious principle of all in this question of the turnover tax is that if three people go into three different shops&mdash; one to buy a fur coat, one to buy a motor car and one to buy bread and butter&mdash;it is understandable there might be different prices for those commodities, but taxation in countries where there are good Governments has always been based on the principle that the tax is equated to the ability of the person to pay.  What we are doing now for the first time is saying that if you buy a motor car, a fur coat or bread and butter, the rate of tax will be the same.  That is the most vicious principle underlying this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I think the public should be consulted on this matter. They are going to pay this £10½ million or £11 million next year.  Once we start this it will go on like a forest fire.  It will be availed of and resorted to every time there is any need to get money.  In the long run it will be a very heavy impost on a large number of relatively poor people.  Surely the people should get an opportunity of expressing an opinion?  Is there any reason why we should not have a referendum?  We held a referendum to satisfy nothing only vanity on the question of abolishing proportional representation.  Nobody wanted PR <Col N="1648" /> abolished until the thing was dreamed up and blown up and distorted in such a way that it was made a first-class issue by the present Government.  They had to have a referendum because a referendum was required in order to amend the Constitution.  Is there any reason why we cannot have a referendum on this?  It would be much cheaper for the people than to allow this provision to go through in the Finance Bill.  The proposal does not go into effect until November.  What is the difficulty in having a referendum and allowing the people to say whether they want this tax and are willing to pay it?  There is plenty of time for it and we would all co-operate in having the referendum and then we shall know the people's view.</P>
    <P>I expect there will be no referendum because the Government know perfectly well they could not carry this proposal in a referendum.  As the Fianna Fáil candidate said in the North-East Dublin by-election in explaining why his vote was less than he expected it to be : &ldquo;I was carrying too much weight.&rdquo; What he meant was the turnover tax.  I think the Government will not risk a referendum on this, but they ought to have it because they have no moral authority to introduce this provision in the Bill.  It has not a majority in this House.  They never mentioned the matter to the electorate.  They are completely devoid of any authority for what they are now doing.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach spoke on the Bill on Thursday, June 20th, at column 1404, he used this language:</P>
    <P>If the Government are defeated upon the Finance Bill there will be a general election forthwith.  I confess that I like elections.  I like the personal challenge which they present. I like the excitement.  I like even the uncertainty.</P>
    <P>These are very becalming words for Deputy Sherwin.  The Taoiseach went on:</P>
    <P>When Opposition Parties call for an election, every personal feeling of mine prompts me to accommodate them but I have given the Dáil and I have given the country an undertaking <Col N="1649" /> that I will not ask for a dissolution, unless the Government are defeated in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Imagine the condition of a battle of the apocalypse&mdash;almost&mdash;going on in the Taoiseach's breast on this Bill. Here he is bursting for an election&mdash; or at least he was on the 20th June&mdash; for the glorious uncertainty about it all and the prospect: &ldquo;Will we win or will we lose?&rdquo;; the challenge to him, the means of discomfiting his opponents. He must be under great restraint at the moment not to call a general election.  In case one of the Independents who are going to vote with the Government is kidnapped, I think he ought to be kidnapped by the Government and held by them until half past ten so as to make him vote in this division.  These are the people for whom this sort of stuff is produced.</P>
      <P>What are the facts?  Nobody asked the Taoiseach for an undertaking.  The country did not ask him for any undertaking. Nobody cares when he dissolves the Dáil.  Nobody asks him not to dissolve the Dáil except it was a private pact between the Taoiseach and the gentlemen who now keep him precariously in office.  It may have been done then to make their tenure of office a little more stable than it looked at the beginning but nobody else asked him for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the free Parties in the House are concerned, those without a ball and chain on them, we are all willing to exempt him from any undertaking which he gave not to dissolve the Dáil.  Everybody is quite willing to allow him to do so and we release him from any undertaking he gave when nobody asked him for it.  I suggest that if he has feelings, on this Tuesday night, anything like he had last Thursday night, in order to put an end to the stress and tension going on within him, when the Dáil adjourns to-night, he ought to go to the Park and get a dissolution and then we can have a vote on this turnover tax or <Col N="1650" /> have a referendum.  In any case we can get a solution some way by allowing an expression of the people's views.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Taoiseach was in a warlike mood the other day and referred to some trade organisation which he had helped to establish and accused them of being a political body because they did not all cheer the Taoiseach for taxing them to the extent of 2½ per cent.  Then he announced that if people like that get into politics they must expect to have bloody noses. Is that not nice language for the Prime Minister to use to a handful of shopkeepers throughout the country: &ldquo;you will have bloody noses if you challenge anything the Taoiseach says&rdquo;?  He wants his word to be accepted all the time.  The latest Fianna Fáil policy on the physical side is that if you do not accept what the Taoiseach tells you, you will have bloody noses&mdash;a most elegant sort of warcry.</P>

      <P>I have no further comment to make except to give the Taoiseach the advice that everybody will relieve him of any obligation he feels not to dissolve the Dáil and that he ought to go to the Park and get a dissolution and bring his three Independent friends with him. If he does that, we will have an election and that is the last we shall hear of the turnover tax and of taxation of every item that people consume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was on the Budget that the Taoiseach made a speech in which he said the time had arrived for a turn to the left.  Since he made that statement, we have had the pay pause and a rise in unemployment compared with last year.  We are to have a tax on everything that people consume and we have this threat of bloody noses for any who question anything he does. If these are the characteristics of moving to the left, it seems to me to be a quite sanguinary performance <Col N="1651" /> and, before the Taoiseach has made any move at all, I suggest to him that he ought to stay where he is, and not move to the left, because these characteristics of his move to the left are all menacing, all ominous.  I think the people will be glad if the Taoiseach stays just where he is for the moment until such time as the people have a chance of dealing with the Government Party at the next general election.</P>

      <P>Sir, when this Government were negotiating in Brussels, or said they were negotiating in Brussels, to enter the Common Market, we thought they were doing the right thing and we supported them.  When the Government now seek to enact the Finance Bill at present before Dáil Éireann, we think they are doing the wrong thing and we are going to oppose them with all the resources of which we dispose.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance appears to know little, and to care less, about either the consequences or the contents of his own Finance Bill.  We had to rely on the Taoiseach to give us the true philosophy underlying these proposals, which he did in as hysterical a performance as I have ever listened to in this House.  There is one strange thing about Fianna Fáil; they are never at their best in adversity.  When they are riding high, wide and handsome, they are arrogant and triumphant but, when the winds of adversity begin to blow, they grow angry and threatening.  The Taoiseach's hysterics laid down his policy in two well-known propositions: you cannot accumulate if you do not speculate&mdash; the catchcry of every three-card-trick merchant that ever stood on a flapper racecourse.</P>

      <P>Secondly, if you disagree with me, you can, as Deputy Norton pointed out, look for a bloody nose&mdash;the war cry of every rundown public-house pugilist challenging the world.  But, stalking the philosophy of these brave and thundering words, like the death's head at the feast, is the <Col N="1652" /> inescapable fact of an adverse trade balance for this country of £105,702,000 in the past 12 months.  No amount of public house pugilism or of three-card-trick promises avoids the fact of that situation and of the inevitable consequences that must flow from it, if a responsible Government in this country have any regard to its underlying causes.</P>
      <P>I find myself to-day in this position : I find myself confronted by a Government drawn from a Party which calls itself the Republican Party.  But it is the Republican Party that was afraid to declare the Republic; the nearest they ever got to it was the dictionary Republic.  I find myself confronted by a Party that calls itself the poor man's Party, but it is the first Party in the history of Oireachtas Éireann since this State was founded which has ever proposed to tax the poor man's food, the poor man's fuel and the poor man's footwear.  I find myself confronted with a Party which describes itself as the industrial Party, but it is a Party which appears to believe that industry employs only employers and thinks nothing of the problems of redundancy which shatter the industrial workers' lives.</P>
      <P>I claim that Fine Gael is simply an Irish national Party which believes that all our people are the responsibility of any Irish Government, from whatever Party or Parties it may be drawn.</P>

      <P>I remember the Taoiseach laying down the principle on behalf of his Party in the course of a <Col N="1653" /> general election in 1956.  He said that it is no part of the duty of an Opposition Party to tell the Government how to run its business; that is a matter for the Ministers and, if they do not know how to do their work, then they should get out and let someone who can do it in.  Yet, we sat here today listening to the lamentations from the Tánaiste, who gave us a dissertation on how to balance the Budget by boxing the matches, that he has not heard any equally fruitful proposition from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Now I want to say that there is one matter which too many people, not only in this country but outside it, are prone to forget.  There is a strange etymological metamorphosis going on in the world.  We are all familiar with the fact that three centuries ago the word &ldquo;queen&rdquo; meant a harlot but, by the metamorphosis of etymology, it has come now to mean the consort of a king.  In 25 short years, I have seen the word &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; change from the threat it is to freedom into a kind of sacrosanct remedy for all our human ills.  I want to say quite clearly that I believe inflation to be the principle of financially robbing the defenceless and passing the experts in the manipulation of money by; it is the broad highroad so pleasant to travel until it reaches its destination of an anarchic breakdown and the collapse of money as a store of value.  Then, indeed, the famous Fisher's equation operates to destroy the foundation of a free society until, in the ensuing anarchy, people turn to authoritarian forms of Government to arrest the breaking up of society, and all too often the society discovers too late that inflation has destroyed freedom and that the price paid politically to restore stability has been the surrender by free men of their birthright of freedom with the prospect perhaps of generations of struggle, and perhaps bloodshed to get it back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see in the Taoiseach's philosophy a grave danger of this country starting on that road and I want to protest on the threshold of that departure against the Taoiseach's challenge to all who dare to differ from him that they must expect a bloody nose if they come in collision with him.  That was directed <Col N="1654" /> primarily at an organisation commonly known as RGDATA.  I want the House to know the facts.  I received with Deputy Cosgrave a deputation from RGDATA.  Four members attended. Of those four men, I knew the political convictions of only one and he has been a staunch and stalwart supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party in this city for the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I ask this House do they subscribe to the proposition that under the society so painfully built up in this country, it is no longer permissible for law-abiding men peacefully to demonstrate in defence of their interests in the streets and towns of this country because I say if that claim is made and sustained we are throwing away one of the most precious assets of a free society that our people fought to secure and win.</P>
    <P>It is the hallmark of a civilised and free society that free men may peaceably assemble within the law to make their voices heard.  I have repeatedly said to young people in this country for whom I felt some measure of responsibility that they had a duty to enter politics and to participate in public life so that if any other young people came to them and claimed that they were justified in resorting to violence in order to resist laws from which they dissented, they could be forbidden from those courses on the ground that they had at their hand a far more effective remedy and that was to take out their barrel and stand up at the corner of any street and make their voices heard and if they could gather others around them to make a multitude so great as to carry conviction to the Government in being that it was time to consult the people, then at the ballot boxes they could make a Government answerable for any of their misdeeds.  But, if we are to repudiate that, if we are to say that these courses are no longer available to law-abiding men, how are law-abiding men to seek amendment of the law?</P>
    <P>I want to say that as Minister for Agriculture, I sat in my office and saw Fianna Fáil Deputies lead deluded farmers up to parade 10,000 strong outside the office at a time when I knew their leader, a prominent Fianna <Col N="1655" /> Fáil supporter, had in his pocket the report which he was claiming to be demonstrating because he had not yet received it.  False and fraudulent as I believed that to be, I never challenged his right.  If he could bring a multitude to demonstrate lawfully and peaceably for what he claimed to want, I felt he was entitled to do it.  If he had asked me, I would have been glad to go out and meet them but he took damn good care not to ask me because he knew what was in his pocket and he knew that I knew it was in his pocket.  So I sat where I was.  I think this country was a better country because 10,000 farmers were entitled peaceably to demonstrate in the presence of the Government.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I feel it necessary emphatically to repudiate the Taoiseach's language in respect of this organisation because the facts in regard to it are known to me and I am entirely satisfied that RGDATA made no protest or engaged in no activity that free men should not be entitled to engage in in any country in the world.</P>
    <P>I know how readily Fianna Fáil can glory in their capacity to fool their own supporters.  They ought to remember that so great a man as Abraham Lincoln foresaw the existence of conspiracies of that kind and he forewarned that you can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time&mdash;but do not forget the final sentence&mdash;you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.  When I hear Fianna Fáil blathering in this House about the deplorable failure of the Opposition to present the House with an alternative Budget, it is time to say that only a fool or a knave demands that an Opposition should formulate a Budget without access to the expert advice and statistical services available in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of how are the needs of expanding social services and of every item mentioned in that programme of Fine Gael to be financed.  Remember, it is in black and white, written in ink on paper&mdash;not spoken with different words at every <Col N="1656" /> street corner of Dublin.  That is not a document which says at one street corner that the shopkeeper will pay the tax and at the next street corner, that the consumer will pay the tax.  That is not a document that says in Donny-carney that the Labour candidate is a Communist and says he is a pious Catholic half a mile down the road. That document is there for all to read and credit.</P>
    <P>I want to answer the fraudulent charge that this Party have put before the country a programme for which they cannot conceivably find finance. First, I want to say that I do not accept for a single moment that it is absolutely necessary and impossible to review that this country takes £63 million per annum more to run in 1963 than it did in 1956.  That is a figure I want to examine and want to examine with at my disposal the expert advice which I do not believe the Minister for Finance had because I do not believe they bothered to talk to him, but which I believe the Taoiseach had when he forced this Finance Bill into the hand of the dummy Minister for Finance who presented it to this House.  The proof of it is that when we asked questions about this Bill at any stage of its discussion in the House, he could not answer the most elementary question.</P>
    <P>I want to say this most categorically to Dáil Éireann and to the country.  If it should prove necessary to raise additional finances, I have carefully considered with such advice as I have at my disposal&mdash;it is not all that bad&mdash; all the proposals contained in the published policy of our Party, and I am satisfied that without the Fianna Fáil turnover tax, there are at least three alternative methods, if not four, to which recourse could be had, if necessary, to raise further revenue, and I have excellent reason to believe that at least two of them were considered and rejected by the Government in favour of the tax on the food, fuel and clothing of the people of this country.  If the Government wish to put that public undertaking to the test, they have a very easy means of doing so.  Let us go to the country.</P>

      <P>I want to say a word now about the capital programme of the country.  Let no one conceal from himself in this day the vital importance to this country of the Government's capital programme.  I want to compare the capital programme for which our Government, the inter-Party Government, were responsible when in office, with the capital programme of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I was delighted to hear Deputy Norton recapitulate to the House today the figures which I consider to be one of the principal glories of the inter-Party Government.</P>

      <P>I rejoice again that on the day we left office there were too many houses in Dublin for the people to go into them.  We were delighted because we were in a position to say: &ldquo;There are empty houses and the people are housed.  We cannot get applicants to take them.&rdquo; How glorious a boast that is, compared with the decrepit panic of the present Government, rightly cast down and shame-faced before the House at having to report in the presence of the world: &ldquo;We must admit that the poor of this city have been suffered to die in the crumbling houses from which they had no refuge.&rdquo; If I had to make that admission, I would be ashamed to show my face in this House, but, thank God, I never had to.  If we were derided and abused by lunatics and ignoramuses, it was abuse and derision which we could smile our way through in the certainty of ultimate vindication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to amplify the figures provided by Deputy Norton.  I want to amplify them from the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> published by the Government. In Table 254, we find &ldquo;Details of <Col N="1658" /> Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation&rdquo;. Every time I meet the faceless bureaucrats who give their lives to the discipline of statistics, I am battered and bewildered with &ldquo;gross domestic fixed capital formation&rdquo; and unless they have their gospels in their hands, very often they cannot remember what the heck the words mean.  Here is the gospel and the record.</P>
    <P>In 1954, gross domestic fixed capital formation was reckoned as a constant of the 1953 price at £86.2 million; in 1955, £89.7 million; in 1956, £83.7 million.  Then we went out of office and the following year it dropped to £70.1 million; in 1958, it was £69.1 million; the following year it was £70.8 million; and the year after, £74.1 million.  One element in that table is dwellings, houses for the people.  The gross domestic fixed capital formation consists of roads, dwellings, other building and construction, including land rehabilitation, transport equipment, agricultural machinery and other machinery and equipment.</P>
    <P>Here is a proud record that can never be forgotten.  In 1954, the figure for dwellings, about which Deputy Norton spoke, was £14.9 million; in 1955, £15.8 million; in 1956, £17 million.  Then came Fianna Fáil and in 1957, it was £11.7 million; in 1958, £9.8 million; in 1959, £10.1 million; in 1960, it was £11.3 million; and then the houses began to fall down.</P>
    <P>We reclaimed the land; we built houses; we fertilised the land; and we built schools.  We rejoice in that record, although Deputy Childers, Minister for Transport and Power, saw fit to go down to Kilkenny in 1957 or 1958 and say that the money the inter-Party Government spent on housing was slush money.  That is how he described it.  If that is his definition of slush money, I glory in having belonged to a Government which spent it abundantly, and gave us the proudest boast we could have, that there was no one in Ireland without a roof over his head, and that there was a house empty to receive him if his dwelling was condemned.</P>
    <P>I remember hearing the Taoiseach thumping his tub and pot walloping in Letterkenny on 15th September, <Col N="1659" /> 1947.  He was a younger man then, and Minister for Industry and Commerce. Speaking for his Party he said:</P>
    <P>We have known hard and difficult times since the war clouds gathered over the world and the next few years will be just as hard and just as difficult.  If our people can face up to that grim reality without flinching and are prepared to do whatever is required then we have the stuff in us that will get us to safety.</P>
    <P>That was in 1947.  Unless the people voted for &ldquo;Lemass&rdquo;, the whole nation would fall down in ruins around us. He was prepared to lead us through, but we put him out.</P>
    <P>I should remind the House that shortly after that speech was made in Letterkenny, Deputy John A. Costello moved a motion in this House, the purpose of which was that the old age pensioners should get an increase of 2/6d. a week.  The Taoiseach rose most solemnly and, recalling the grave words uttered in Letterkenny, and supported by an individual whom we may not constitutionally name, he told us that the nation could not afford that burden on its resources at that time. Three months later they were out and we were in.  We increased the basic rate of the old age pension by 7/6d. a week.</P>

      <P>We drained the land; we built the houses; we reduced taxation; and in 1951, we had it to tell that we had doubled the volume and trebled the value of the exports of this country.  Was that a fair record? They will not listen.  How could they listen and sleep again?  The deficit this year, after adjustments, amounts to about £6.4 million.  We are told it is necessary to budget next year for £13½ million.  Are we to expect no buoyancy in revenue?  Are we to expect no <Col N="1660" /> improvement in world commodity prices to relieve the burden of our present high rates of export subsidy? Are we to expect no reduction in the cost of living?  Are we to assume that there is no economy capable of being made in the administration of the Government worthy of consideration?</P>
      <P>When I look at the Minister for Transport and Power pouring forth his soul at dinners and dog fights throughout the country on how best to cook, where to get the nicest wine and how to sow a seed better than it has been sown before, and then look at our Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, a decent and kindly man, but now so tangled and wrapped up in the telephone wires of this country that they will serve no purpose but to trip him, I often wonder could we not combine these two offices and save some of what we are spending on them.</P>
      <P>Is there no scope for consolidating the labours of the Minister for Lands, who has begun very recently to invoke the law against anybody who black-mails people or forces them into helicopters, with those of our Minister for Agriculture of unprecedented zeal and diligence.  I venture to swear that the weakest potential member of my Government could do more for both those Departments with one hand tied behind his back than those two Ministers have done in the past seven years. The Taoiseach may laugh but is it not a humiliating experience for his Minister for Agriculture to be left discreetly at home whenever he goes forth to negotiate on agriculture?  He may not realise that the neighbours understand the significance of that gesture on his part, but they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this suggestion to the House and I think it would effect a very necessary and vital reform. The time should be gone when protestations would ring about this Chamber as to one Party in this House being more anxious to improve the social services than another.  I do not believe there is any Party in this House more anxious to help the poor, to improve social services, than any other Party.  I believe Fianna Fáil want to do it; I believe Labour want to do it; I believe Fine Gael want to <Col N="1661" /> do it; but there is a difference in our approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>We have consistently believed on this side of the House that what matters in regard to social service payments is not primarily their cash value but their real value.  It is for that reason when we were in office that we spent £9 million a year to keep down the cost of living so that if our circumstances permitted us to add a halfcrown to the old age pension, it was a real halfcrown, a halfcrown that bought something.  What are the facts today? We are paying an old age pension of 32/6 a week.  How does that compare with the pension paid pre-war?  Pre-war the basic pension paid was 10/-a week.  Today it is 10/10d.  That is all the difference.  The pension the old age pensioner is getting today is worth 10/10d. in terms of 1938 money.</P>
    <P>Why is that?  It is because every time Fianna Fáil have got into office they have declared that it is part of their policy and that they believe that the cost of living should be allowed to go up.  They do not think it is right to subsidise foods; they do not think it is right to control prices; they do not think it is right to preserve the real value of money.  Their attitude is: &ldquo;Let it rip but as the inflation grows, we shall scoop a bit more into the Exchequer and dole it out again. Then we can boast that we are the people who want to improve the social services.&rdquo; But the net result of all their operations is that after 25 years, the old age pensioner is, in effect, getting 10d. a week more than he was getting in 1939.  A large part, not all, of that erosion of the value of the social service payments is due to the considered and deliberate policy of Fianna Fáil in letting things rip.</P>
    <P>All of us know that in the war years money values declined all the world over but in this country, with Fianna Fáil in office, the cost of living steadily rose.  Therefore, perhaps there is something we could argue about.  Let us all agree that Fianna Fáil want to improve the social services; let us all agree that Labour want to do it; let us all agree that Fine Gael want to do it.  But let us ask ourselves: are we honestly concerned <Col N="1662" /> to put more effective purchasing power into the hands of the old age pensioner, into the hands of the widow, into the hands of the unemployed and disabled, or are we content simply to keep raising the &ldquo;ante&rdquo; and smirking behind our hands: &ldquo;They think they are getting three times what they did but the real change in 20 years is 10d.&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>There is that difference between us. I think I am right and that Fianna Fáil are mistaken.  I believe that in the march of inflation, it is the poor who suffer and the rich who come scatheless from the fray.  Let us face it.  A person who has to spend all his wages every week, a person who is living on an old age pension, cannot find the time or the opportunity to play ducks and drakes with altering exchanges. But the man who has £10,000, £20,000 or £40,000 in investments can change from one type to another.  He can change from equities to gold and from gold to land or property.  We have seen it done.  What do you think the people who are buying the land from under our feet in Ireland today are doing?  They are not fools.  I said before in this House, and I say it again, the mobile operator wears diamonds around his waist but the stable operator buys agricultural land. He is no fool.  He knows the difference between 10/10d. and 32/6.  But the defenceless whose weekly allowance is just enough to keep the wolf from the door must take it as it comes.</P>
    <P>We have always been concerned to mitigate that situation as far as we could.  I think we were right; I feel that Fianna Fáil were wrong.  Mark you, I refuse to accept the growing world philosophy that the ideal to be aimed at is that the State is to take over everything, including all family responsibility.  I believe that in the countries of the Communist philosophy, the purchase price of that kind of care is freedom, but while they may have care from the cradle to the grave, they have it as creatures of the State. I believe that in free societies the desire to attain to that end is operating under our eyes around us in the world to destroy the moral fibres of the people who seek it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> I believe that ours is the better way. I believe our philosophy &mdash; which actuates all Parties in this House&mdash; to be the sounder one, that is, to see that we stand vigilant to protect our people from hardship and that wherever hardship manifests itself, without any doctrinaire solicitude about daft theories, we will go to their aid.  I remember not long ago in this House I had occasion to question the Minister for Social Welfare about the circumstances of a widow.  The Minister answered very fully and I pressed the matter further.  I went out shortly afterwards to have a cup of tea and a well-known columnist from New York came to me and asked me if he could talk to me and I said: &ldquo;Why not?  What do you want to talk about?&rdquo; I thought he wanted to talk about the approaching visit of President Kennedy.  He said: &ldquo;I will tell you.  I am a columnist who has sat in every deliberative assembly in the world and this is the first assembly in which I have seen a Minister brought to answer for the welfare of a widow.&rdquo; I remember saying to him that that was in no way strange to any Deputy in Dáil Éireann and that those were matters with which we were perennially engaged.</P>
    <P>I told him the story of the late Deputy Alfie Byrne who, when a young Deputy came in here, took him aside to give him advice.  One piece of advice he gave was: &ldquo;Whenever you are approached by a widow, whether her case is good or bad, reasonable or unreasonable, receive her with a smile and hear her story and do what you can to help her because she has met enough adversity in the loss of her breadwinner to entitle her to a kind reception if she looks for help.&rdquo; That is a good philosophy and I believe that, fundamentally, it is the philosophy underlying the approach of all sides here to social services.  I believe it is the right approach.  I believe the approach which is conscious in an intimate way of our neighbours' problems and difficulties and feels that it is our obligation to go to their aid in so far as our resources will allow, is a sound approach to this whole problem.  So <Col N="1664" /> far as I know, it is common to every side of this House and I think it is time we stopped suggesting that there is any element in our Legislature which is indifferent to it.</P>
    <P>Now I want to come to the net problem of the poisonous character of the proposals in this Finance Bill.  I want to say with full deliberation&mdash;and I must declare <i>ad interim</i> that I am myself a shopkeeper and have been engaged all my life in the retail and distributive trades and my colleagues are entitled to be expressly informed of that fact; it may give me a personal interest but it also gives me an encyclopaedic knowledge, the benefit of which I propose to offer to my colleagues in this House&mdash;this turnover tax is unjust and inequitable because it makes no distinction between the purchaser of caviare and champagne and the purchaser of bread and tea.  It makes no difference between the customer for a fur coat and the customer for boots or clothing and the necessaries of life.  It makes no distinction between the customer who through his circumstances must spend his entire week's income every Saturday to meet domestic needs, and the customer who is spending perhaps one-quarter of his annual income.</P>
    <P>Is it equitable or just to say that the man whose earnings and family commitments require him to spend all his earnings is to bear the same percentage of tax as the man with an income which enables him to save without difficulty three-quarters of his annual income?  Outside of Bedlam was ever anyone found to defend as equitable and just a tax on such a foundation?  It is unjust.  The consumer must pay it and, mark my words, this is throwing on to the shopkeepers the obligation of collecting it and furnishing monthly returns and paying over that tax without any reference to the profit of the trade they do.</P>
    <P>Surely there is still a sense of justice in this House.  Have Deputies wondered what this tax means; what it means in respect of the law-abiding respectable shopkeeper in this country? In certain cases they are going into the man trading legitimately and <Col N="1665" /> saying: &ldquo;We are going to put a corporation profits tax of 62½ per cent on your profits whether you are incorporated or not.  Of course, you have leave to pass it on to your customers.&rdquo; All my life I have been engaged in the retail and wholesale distributive trades and I want to tell Dáil Éireann what the effect of this tax is going to be.</P>
    <P>It is going to have a double consequence. It is going to wipe out of existence a large number of small shopkeepers and I can well imagine that the faceless bureaucrats who stand behind Ministers for Finance will say: &ldquo;After all, that is a damn good thing.  They are inefficient and it would be much better to eliminate them.  They are surplus and inferior operators and in the name of efficiency they ought to go.&rdquo; I am thinking of the families around me.  Maybe they are inefficient in the terms of economics but they are rearing Christian families; they are educating children; they are maintaining decent institutions and they are the sheet anchor of settled institutions in this country.  I do not want to see them loaded into the tumbrils of economic executions because they do not conform to Common Market standards of efficiency.</P>
    <P>Be damned to efficiency.  We have a right to live in our country without being automatic machines.  If they want this one million per cent efficiency let them put in the automatic machines. They are doing it in Germany; they are doing it in the United States of America; and they are beginning to do it in Great Britain.  They can listen to you now, look at you, talk to you, sing to you, but if they are what the faceless bureaucrats want for this country, be damned to them.  I believe the purpose of government in this country is to allow our people to live in their own way and I do not want to see small businessmen, who have built up their businesses and reared their families on them, swept out of existence in the name of efficiency.</P>
    <P>If that is antediluvian economics, then I am an antediluvian economist and glad to be one.  I might be all the better for it because when I look at <Col N="1666" /> the countries which have decided efficiency is the sole criterion and look at the avalanche of catastrophe that has come down upon them, I view with satisfaction our system of society and congratulate myself that we have not brought all the efficiency of the world down on top of us.  But so surely as you bring it into operation, so surely will you wipe out all those so-called inefficient distributors and so surely will the big boys take over who measure their efficiency by their low margin of profit and they will cut that profit and when they get down to four per cent or 3½ per cent margins, where is their scope to hand 2½ per cent over to the Government?</P>
    <P>Nobody is fooled by the daft economics of the Tánaiste who, when he spoke here today, was preaching what he did not believe.  I believe he was sent in here to give a token of his loyalty, with notice that if he did not, he would be put on a scrapheap with some other candidates for that proposal. I shall not follow the matchbox operation, it is so hollow, so false, but I cannot refrain from saying that if you reduce the number of matches to half, you can cut your price by half and if you leave no matches in the box at all, you can pay the people to take the boxes away.  What a perfect policy for a Government to base their economy on, what pearls of wisdom to throw to us as a test.  Heavens preserve us from the damning folly of men who believe the philosophy of a nation should be to build on such basis.</P>
    <P>How comfortable it is to operate on the racecourses, to play the three-card trick if it is somebody else's money. It is our people's money: it is our people's livelihood we are dealing with; and when we talk about competition bringing us down to three per cent on turnover, does anybody believe Mr. Garfield-Weston will come in here to trade on a profit margin of one per cent?  Does anybody believe any international organisation is buying up property and building pay-as-you-take stores, or whatever you call them, in Dublin and the provinces in order to operate on a profit margin of one per cent on turnover?  In the immortal <Col N="1667" /> words of Eliza Doolittle: &ldquo;Not bloody likely.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I sympathise with my excellent, honest friend, Deputy Colley, who has the fatal weakness that he gets up and thinks aloud and who is too honest a man to go on thinking as crooked as he loyally tries to do.  He gets up faithful to the idea of following the Party line, but then begins to open his heart to us. May I remind the House that so surely as Garfield-Weston's name is Garfield, every cent of the 2½ per cent will ultimately find its way into the Exchequer, and bear in mind that this irresponsible Government do not vigilantly watch to see where the tax will fall but, like Pontius Pilate, call for a bowl of water to wash their hands and say: &ldquo;We do not know where it will fall.  As the shopkeepers have a defenceless organisation, we can do as we like and this tax will ultimately find its way back to us.  That is all we want.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely it is an essential element of sound taxation that a tax should be certain and that its incidence should be manifest to all?  Has anybody in this House ever heard of a tax proposal that had built into it this puzzle: &ldquo;We do not know where it is coming from: we do not know who is to pay it; and we do not know what it will be levied on; but we warn everybody that we must get a good return from it or we will see about it.&rdquo; Take my word, it will be the consumers who will pay for it.  Deputy Colley asks from what other source the revenue could have come.  He said beer, tobacco, all other taxes had reached a point of diminishing return.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Colley paused for he suddenly realised he had let the cat out of the bag.  Here was a tax which had no point of diminishing return. If you could persuade the fish to swallow this little harmless 2½ per cent worm, everything was wonderful.  Next year, the worm would grow to 3½ per cent, the year after to five per cent, then to 7½ per cent, then to ten per cent, and there is no point of diminishing return until the people know hunger so that it cannot impinge on food any more, until our people <Col N="1668" /> know what it is to walk in rags so that it cannot impinge on clothing any more, until our people know again what it is to be cold so that it cannot impinge on fuel any more.</P>
    <P>Thank God, we are a long way from that but what a happy, cheerful vista stretches before us&mdash;that if we seek accumulation by speculation there is no optimum.  &ldquo;Two-and-half per cent this year is excellent profit-he is not gone bust yet; five per cent next year, and if he is cleaned out the next time round I will be old enough to retire with dignity.&rdquo; It is a pretty picture but I do not think the people will buy it. I have seen two practitioners of it in the world.  East of the Iron Curtain, the Cominform taxed food, clothing and boots by simply jotting the price up in the Government stores because they decided it was necessary.  They professed to believe, in support of the proletariat revolution, that it was necessary to exploit the masses for the benefit of the State.</P>
    <P>On this side of the Iron Curtain, it is the favoured instrument of the faceless bureaucrats whose spiritual home is Brussels.  There is not a single person involved in the political administration of the Common Market who has not firmly resolved the time has come to bring the faceless moguls of Brussels to their senses.  I do not believe it is the part of any Government to exploit the masses.  I believe it is the function of a democratic Government solicitously to protect the masses.  But for me, the masses are the ordinary people amongst whom I was born and amongst whom I spent my life as their servant.  Everything I have, I made out of the ordinary people, waiting on them across the counter of my shop.  I am proud of it. I entered public life to be their servant. My understanding of that duty is to protect their interests, not to exploit them so that the State might grow great and that the gambler's hand would be forever gilded with the necessary coin with which to speculate.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to say if there is any country in the world where this tax has been introduced and where it <Col N="1669" /> has not grown.  If there is, I have not heard of it.  New York is in pandemonium at the present moment because, despite the most solemn undertaking by the Governor of the State of New York and the Mayor of New York City that their hand might wither before this tax was ever raised, recently it was raised by 33? per cent. For the people living in New York, with their scale of living, it is a relatively light burden and yet the people there are in pandemonium.  However, if you are living in Ireland, it is not a light burden.  It is substantial, particularly if you belong to that section of our society whose family responsibilities require you to disburse your total earnings every week.</P>
    <P>I want to say&mdash;this is a minor consideration and yet it is of significance to a number of citizens in this State &mdash;that to charge the turnover tax from 1st November on the credit sales of every shopkeeper in Ireland who collects his debts in November and December is an act of absolute madness and must be done by a Minister who has no conception of what he is doing.  There are individuals in this country who will collect £50,000 or £60,000 in November and December in respect of sales made in the previous six months, who will break in on shopkeepers and collect the corporation profits tax on those sales at 2½ per cent without any regard for equality or for their fundamental rights.  I assume the Minister, when he comes to realise the significance of that proposal, will alter it if this Bill ever passes this House.</P>
    <P>I assume that, with the couple of cripples the Government have managed to muster to their flag, they will get this Bill through tonight but they must realise, if they do, that a proposal of that character must be done away with.  I think the retrospective corporation profits tax is an abominable provision, just as I think the proposal, the hangman, imbecile proposal to destroy the confidential relationship between bankers and their customers is idiotic.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to protect the interests of the tax evader but there is no <Col N="1670" /> use in tearing down the whole house round about our ears in order to dislodge a mouse.  I do not know how many people evade tax and stack it away in a Dublin bank but one thing certain is that everybody who wants to do it hereafter will take damned good care to stack it in another bank than an Irish bank.  How will we be better off by that transaction?  So long as it was here, even if we did not get it through income tax, we got it in death duties or succession duties.  But, if it is in London or in Peru, our chances of getting it will be progressively less.  As these deposits flow abroad &mdash; not out of the banks but passing the banks: never going into the banks&mdash;the credit for expansion in this country will continue to diminish.</P>
    <P>In Ireland&mdash;in most countries, for that matter&mdash;all deposits are not significant but in Ireland deposits count.  I heard the Minister for Finance blathering about an increase in the total deposits in the banks.  Who the hell is talking about them?  What will be dislodged as a result of this folly are the traditional time deposits of our people which constitute a substantial proportion of the credit of our country which nobody knows except the banks because the statistics do not reveal them.</P>
    <P>The retrospective corporation profits tax will undoubtedly affect relatively few people in this country.  It is abominable that if a man has paid his tax and cleared his account to the State, and if he has done so honestly, the State can come back to him and say: &ldquo;We did not charge you enough; we want to charge this much more.&rdquo; None of us could be expected to shed floods of tears for the few individuals affected but the principle is wrong. The Government come in here blabbing: &ldquo;We have to get the money. Where will we get the money?&rdquo; Why did they not foresee they would want it?  A year ago they were prancing about this House saying what a wonderful chap and what a genius Deputy Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Finance, is.  Now he is blabbing about being short £4¼ million.  For the first time in the history of the State, he <Col N="1671" /> will have recourse to retrospective taxation.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with this Government is that they are incompetent, unprincipled and ought to go.  I leave the verdict on that proposition most cheerfully to the people.  I will shock some of my friends, I suppose.  The Taoiseach says that he is &ldquo;raring&rdquo; for the fray, longing for the excitement, for the chance to put his fortunes to the test.</P>

      <P>He is thirsting for the opportunity of staking all to win or lose all.  I could not but think of a holiday I spent recently in Baden-Baden and of the number of hot-eyed ladies and gentlemen who brushed in past me, thirsting to stake all, irresistibly drawn back, night after night, to the thrill of staking all to win all or lose all.  Well, I confess that in that company I did not find myself at home and it was something of a disappointment. It suddenly dawned on me that I had not got the gambler's soul.</P>
      <P>I want to say that anyone in the world who yearns for the responsibility of being the head of a Government in a free democracy at this time ought to get his head examined.  I do not care whether it is the vast United States, whether it is Great Britain, in all her trials and tribulations, whether it is a mighty power like France with all her vast resources, or a country like Germany, struggling with her special problem as she is, nobody who did not feel it to be his duty could conceivably aspire to the task of shouldering the vast responsibility of guarding the interests of all his people and that all his neighbours, all those amongst whom he was born, reared and had grown up, rested on his judgment and wisdom and energy and ability.  If there be one who longs for it, I think he is the one least fitted for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do the Taoiseach the credit of not taking that propaganda at its face value.  Nobody bearing the burden he does can honestly believe the rodomontade to which he gave expression. Whoever is Taoiseach of this country, <Col N="1672" /> whoever is Prime Minister of any sovereign, independent, free democracy, is carrying a burden that might well terrify whomever on whose shoulders it is likely to fall.  But if we did not want it, we had no business in public life.  If we were afraid of its impact, if we were called to bear that burden, that is a decision we should have made 30 years ago when we first entered public life.</P>
    <P>When you are in public life, you accept the responsibilities, whatever they may be.  I have not the slightest desire to have those responsibilities thrust upon me for I know their magnitude and appreciate their gravity. But, if the only way to deliver this country from the Fianna Fáil impost that it is at present bearing and from the Fianna Fáil Government whose future is plainly heralded in the types of proposals enshrined in this Finance Bill, is by facing that responsibility myself, I will take it but from the hands of the Irish people truly expressed through the ballot box.</P>
    <P>That is the test we invite the Taoiseach to make.  If the people decide against it, we will accept their verdict. I do not think they would, if they were consulted now.  When the Taoiseach looks around and sees, as Deputy Norton pointed out, from every section of our community the violent protest against the incidence of this tax, the assertion that it is unjust and inequitable and that other ways should be found to meet the fiduciary necessities of the State, that is not an unreasonable suggestion to make.</P>
    <P>North-East Dublin has given you a clear indication from a pretty fair cross-section of our people in a constituency organised by a gentleman whose adroitness the Taoiseach is peculiarly well-placed to appreciate. There has been no lack of zeal on the part of Deputy Colley, Deputy Timmons and on the part of the Minister for Justice.  You spent £1,000 paying a public relations firm to tell your story as best they could on the television of this country.  Deputy Belton, Deputy Cosgrave and I spent what it cost in petrol to bring us out to Montrose.  Your £1,000 performance was based on your insane policy; <Col N="1673" /> our 3/9 performance was based on the policy we put before the people in black and white.  We won by a greater majority than we ever had before.  Is it unreasonable to say to you: &ldquo;Come, let us go to the country and let the country decide&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon gave expression to a lot of inaccurate statements, quarter-truths, half-truths and no truths at all. I took a note of the last one.  I shall deal with it first, and perhaps I shall get to the others later.  He said that for the first time in the history of this State, we have retrospective imposition of taxation.  Every time there was ever an increase in income tax, corporation profits tax or surtax, it was always retrospective.  But that is not going to trouble Deputy Dillon.  He will probably say the same thing next time, because Deputy Dillon has very little regard for the truth.</P>
      <P>Listening to the debate, I began to wonder whether I had made plain in the Budget certain facts relating to taxation and why we were driven to the conclusion that the turnover tax was necessary in the circumstances. I explained in the Budget that we had to meet additional expenditure, that we were providing money for social assistance groups, to help the parents of families and to increase State pensions.  I pointed out that, as a result of that, 1,300,000 people would be compensated for the increase to them as consumers as a result of the turnover tax. When we had relieved 1,300,000 people out of a population of 2,800,000, we had obviously gone a long way to meet the needs of the worst off people in the community.  In all the speeches made here in the past three days, Deputies talked of the incidence of the tax on the people not able to bear it, without any regard whatever for the fact that almost half of the population were being recouped the amount it will cost them in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the way, in all my speeches on the Budget, I had assumed all the time that there would be an increase in costs on the consumer.  If there were <Col N="1674" /> no turnover tax, there could be no additional social welfare benefits this year.  In fact, we will have to drop some of the expenditure contemplated. It was not a question of paying social welfare benefits alone; it was a question of bridging a gap of £8½ million &mdash;disclosed when we came to balance the Budget&mdash;between the expenditure in the Book of Estimates, and the expected yield from the taxes in operation when the Budget was brought in.  To meet that £8½ million was our first objective in introducing that Budget.  In spite of that, Deputy Kyne and Deputy Norton spoke here as if the only thing we wanted to get were social welfare expenditure.  They spoke of alternative ways of getting sufficient to pay for social welfare expenditure. Of course, they did not tell us what they were, and neither did Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>I have to confess that the debate this year has not been very different from the debates of other years.  The Fine Gael Party have never once in their existence made a suggestion of an alternative tax when they were attacking the taxes proposed.  Neither have they ever made a suggestion for cutting revenue in any way.  We have to go back and try to make ends meet.  I see no way of doing it except as we have proposed in this Bill. Deputy Donegan made the suggestion that we could have saved the money on the referendum.  It would not be a very big amount; but it is rather a strange suggestion to make and at the same time, demand a general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very nice of you. The same Deputy sought to denigrate the rates assistance given to farmers last year at a cost of £2½ million.  He said the rates were up as high as ever again this year.  That is another Fine Gael failing.  They make these statements down the country and they are accepted by their followers.  They <Col N="1675" /> make the same statements here by force of habit.  There is no truth whatever in many of these statements made by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Donegan and others.</P>
      <P>The estimated rate to be collected this year by county councils is £100,000 less than the rate collected in 1956-57, the last year the famous Coalition Government were in office, the Government who, according to Deputy Dillon, did so much for the people.  It is £1½ million less than the rate collected on agriculture in 1961-62 but Deputy Donegan said that it was just as high now and he will go on saying that and I shall not be there to correct him.</P>
      <P>Public expenditure has risen in the past five or six years but it has not risen more rapidly than the capacity of the economy, as measured by national production, to bear it. Nobody made the suggestion that we should cut expenditure and I think that even the people, when the facts are explained to them in a proper way, will not complain that any of our expenditure is too high.  The people who understand the position know that they are contributing to taxation in order to build up our national economy which will create new assets which will be immediately beneficial to them and also for the sake of their children.</P>
      <P>Since 1958-59, debt charges, to take one item, have increased by £13½ million. That, as Deputies know, is to pay for money borrowed during that time, and that money was spent on better housing&mdash;the biggest item&mdash; hospitals and schools, improved sanitary services, increasing the productive capacity of farmland by drainage and fertilisers, enhancement of the value of our cattle stocks and the creation of national forest resources and the exploitation of native fuel and power reserves.  I could mention more but these are the principal items that money was spent on.  Again, no Deputy has found fault with us for spending money on these projects and if we spent it we must pay for it and that £13½ million is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> In the same time the amount of money spent on social services, using the term in the widest sense, including health and education as well as social welfare, has gone up by £14½ million. No Deputy is going to find fault and say we spend too much on education or too much on social services or on health.  In fact, every demand that comes from the Opposition, whether Fine Gael or Labour, is always in the direction of more money for social welfare, more for education and for health.  We cannot, therefore, be criticised for the increased expenditure there.  In the case of social welfare itself, while expenditure is going up the numbers are going down because there are fewer drawing unemployment insurance and assistance.</P>
    <P>When we came into power in 1957&mdash; perhaps we had said it before&mdash;we said at that time that we intended to share any improvement in the national economy with the social welfare classes.  In other words, we were not going to be content with giving them an increase to cover the increased cost of living whenever that occurred: we intended to give them a fair share of the national prosperity as time went on.  I think there was only one year since 1957 when we did not give some increase to these classes.  That was also enshrined in our policy in the White Paper on Economic Expansion and I do not think there was a dissenting voice from Fine Gael or Labour on that.</P>
    <P>As regards education, we are now spending 50 per cent more than in 1958-59.  That is a very big increase. A speaker&mdash;I forget who&mdash;said that we were not doing anything for education by way of increasing expenditure. We came to the conclusion some time ago that education is most important, that we must have extended scope in post-primary education in order to equip our young people with sufficient technical education later to become technicians and take charge of our growing industries.  The Minister for Education some time ago announced that he was preparing a comprehensive plan for post-primary education.  That plan will take some time to come into operation and it will be a long time <Col N="1677" /> before it can be extended over the whole country.  At any rate, the plan is being prepared and this Government have agreed to face the necessary expenditure.</P>
    <P>National development, better social benefits, improved educational opportunities&mdash;all these things cannot be financed out of thin air.  The Taoiseach said in Limerick on 21st February that we cannot have economic expansion and improvement of living standards by just wishing for them.  Labour and Fine Gael think you can but since we must provide the money&mdash;and we do provide it, we provide it in opposition to the other Parties.  We have never got any co-operation from the other two Parties in finding the money for these desirable objectives.  In order to do so on this occasion we had to include in our Budget a turnover tax which is at the rate of two-and-a-half per cent on turnover or sixpence in the £.  So far as that is concerned 1,300,000 people are being compensated for the increased cost under that tax.  The Government are confident this tax will be workable and will be a successful form of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Opposition do not want the tax. That is about the only consistent view expressed by them in this debate. When they went further than that, various views were expressed but no Deputy who spoke suggested what we should do instead.  Deputy Corish, for instance, said he wanted an increase in income tax.  Deputy Dillon did not like that.  He is on record as having said, as reported in Volume 174, at columns 515 and 516 of the Official Report, that relief of income tax provided a necessary stimulus to profit-earners by giving them the feeling that if they work hard they will be allowed to obtain the benefits they worked hard to secure.  Deputy O'Sullivan is on record as saying: &ldquo;We think that income tax bears very heavily ... that it is a disincentive&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we had brought in an increase in income tax we should probably have Fine Gael voting against us and perhaps Labour voting for us. Deputy Corish said he would have voted for an increase in income tax or other taxes.  That would be a rather happy change in Labour Party policy. <Col N="1678" /> Last year we brought in a tax on spirits which was voted down by the Labour Party.  We brought in a tax on beer which was voted against by the Labour Party.  A tax on cigarettes was opposed by the Labour Party. Of course, Fine Gael also voted against it but I do not mind that as they are an opportunist Party who will do anything that comes into their heads.  Labour voted against all three. They were out as far as Labour were concerned.  Deputy Corish said they would vote for increased income tax.</P>

      <P>When we brought in a very big increase in social welfare benefits in 1952, we had to put a tax on certain things in order to give those increases.  We put 1/- on income tax, and the Labour Party voted against us. The Labour Party are on record all through of voting against increases in income tax, voting against an increase in tobacco tax, voting against an increase in the tax on beer, voting against an increase in the tax on spirits. I should like to know for what they would vote.  Nothing obviously as long as we are here, but, of course, when the Coalition were here and they were here, everything was all right then; they could vote for 5d. on the packet of cigarettes, as they did in 1955.  If we had put 5d. on the packet of cigarettes, we would never have <Col N="1679" /> lived it down, but there was no outcry when the Labour Party put 5d. on the packet of cigarettes.  I must admit I am not very impressed when I hear Deputy Tully say we should be with the Fine Gael Party.  We were never with Fine Gael, but Labour were.</P>

      <P>From the White Paper, the Sixth Report.  Some speakers said that the Government had admitted for the first time on 19th June that the turnover tax could not be borne by the trader but must be passed on to the consumer.  That is a very unjust statement.  It was Deputy Sweetman who made it, and I am being very polite in putting it that way.  I said in the Budget Statement that: &ldquo;Although the tax will be low, the Government realise that as food and other commodities come within its scope certain sectors of the community should be given some relief.&rdquo; That meant that I realised that consumers were going to <Col N="1680" /> pay the tax.  I said also: &ldquo;It is not contrary to equity that those members of the community who can afford to spend most should pay most, as will be the position secured by the new tax.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;The retailer will pay the tax on his turnover and it is for him to decide how he is going to recoup himself.&rdquo; Afterwards a Government statement was issued in which it was pointed out that the trader was quite free to pass on the tax.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers said this was a hastily thought up tax.  In my Budget Statement on 10th April, 1962, having dealt with the various taxes that were imposed, and also mentioning that we were coming nearly to the end of our tether as far as they were concerned, I said that, in the circumstances, I thought it well to ask the Revenue Commissioners to study the technical questions which would be involved in the adoption of various forms of broadly-based taxes on expenditure.  On 21st November, 1962, answering a question here, I said the Revenue Commissioners were, at my request, examining the technical questions which would be involved in broadly-based taxes on expenditure.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Limerick on 21st February, 1963, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;It is becoming increasingly clear that the financing of the functions of Government is becoming dependent to an undue extent on a small number of commodities ...  This development suggests that the course of prudence is to devise new forms of taxation of a more suitable nature.&rdquo; In answer to Deputy Mullen on 27th February, 1963, I said that we had not reached a final decision &ldquo;but the Government are at present disposed to believe that a broadly-based sales tax would be the most suitable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had been preparing the way as far as we could over the past 12 months and there was nothing very hasty as far as we were concerned about the imposition of this particular tax.  When we pointed out that some of the socialist Governments of Europe had adopted this tax, some Deputies, particularly Labour Deputies, said it was easy to impose the tax in Europe because there you had the decimal system.  I do not know if that is very <Col N="1681" /> important.  Perhaps it is of some importance, but I was in New York last September and I remember going into shops to buy things; there was a three per cent tax and, when you got your bill, you got three per cent added on, and you paid it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is four per cent now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>America has the decimal system.  The cent is worth about four-fifths of a penny so the decimal system is not of very much use from the point of view of this tax as far as they are concerned.</P>
      <P>Prices have gone up before and the shops were able to deal with them.  I do not think traders put a halfpenny on the box of matches, or anything like that.  They were able to deal with the increase in prices.  Deputy Dillon talked about when they came in in 1948 and what a fine Government they had until 1951.  I will take the Coalition period.  In February, 1954, when they came in for the second time, the cost of living went up by 11 points between that time and February, 1957. Now the shopkeepers had to deal with that from time to time during those three years.  They did so quite easily. They never put a halfpenny on the box of matches.  They dealt with the problem as it arose.  They will deal with this problem, too, as it arises. The Coalition Government are always talking about stable prices; if the cost of living went up 11 points during their three years, that is the equivalent of putting a 7½ per cent turnover tax on all items, instead of 2½ per cent.  There is nothing, therefore, very terrible as far as this 2½ per cent is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kyne this evening, and other speakers earlier in the debate, said this particular tax would favour the supermarket as against the small trader. Deputy Dillon said the small traders would all be wiped out.  Why, I do not know.  The supermarkets do not think so as far as I can see because at that famous meeting in the Mansion House held by RGDATA, which set this thing going, the most bitter speech and certainly the most inaccurate speech was made by a managing director and part-owner-not whole owner &mdash; of a supermarket company. <Col N="1682" /> He evidently did not think so.  I do not know that he was talking altogether in favour of the small men.  Evidently he did not like it.</P>
    <P>I noticed in an article in the paper the other day that these trading stamps, as they are called, are being bought by certain shopkeepers all through the country and it was calculated that they cost about 2½ per cent on their turnover.  They are not doing that to benefit the State.  They are doing it to cut one another out. It is intertrade rivalry.  That is all they are getting out of that expenditure.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that these traders could come along, as some of them have come along, and we had a talk; that they went to see the Revenue Commissioners and the Revenue Commissioners have arranged for some of these people to have talks with manufacturers and wholesalers to see if prices could be adjusted.  In all of that, they are getting over their difficulties to some extent in any case.  I would not say they are over all the difficulties yet but they are getting over the difficulties in these discussions. Deputy Cosgrave thought that that was against the principle of the Fair Trade Commission.  We asked the Fair Trade Commission whether there was anything in that point or not and they said that the action that might be taken under paragraph 15 of the white booklet on the turnover tax is in order from their point of view.  There is no objection whatever to traders, wholesalers and manufacturers talking about the price that should be charged.  There would be an objection if they had to charge that price and no less but they are not bound to do that.</P>
    <P>I pulled out my notebook and my pen and got ready when Deputy Dillon said that there are three alternative ways of raising this tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then he stopped.  He did not tell us what they were.  So, I had to leave a blank.  He says that the Government considered them and rejected them.  I do not know where he got that information.  Between ourselves, it is not true.  I have no idea <Col N="1683" /> what he has in mind.  He has some idea in mind all right but he is not going to tell the people about it.  No, he is not going to tell the people about it.  He is going to say to the people: &ldquo;I have various ways of solving this problem.  Put me in and then I will do it for you.&rdquo; He will not tell them what it is.  We, at least, are telling the people what our taxation proposals are while Fine Gael are going to ask them for a mandate without telling the people what their programme might be.</P>
      <P>There is one question which Deputy Dillon will be asked, I am quite sure, if there is a general election.  He will be asked does he intend to form a Coalition Government.  What answer will he give?  He knows that if he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, he is finished.  In spite of his praise for all that the Coalition Government did for the people, he knows that the people do not agree with that.  He knows very well that if he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; the people will say that he is out, that they will not vote for him because they got enough of that Coalition and do not want to see it again.  He will not say he is out for a Coalition.  Of course, he knows that if he says &ldquo;no&rdquo; he might as well not go up.  I do not know how he will answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan said that Fianna Fáil were hoping to get through this Bill at the present time, that they would pull away then until the next Budget when they would have a good Budget and then would be in a great position to face the people any time they liked after that.  We will paraphrase that.  Deputy Donegan thinks that if Fianna Fáil get through this they will pull away nicely until the next Budget and then have a good Budget and Fine Gael can never touch them again.  So, the whole idea with Fine Gael is to knock Fianna Fáil now before the people know what this tax will be like.  They know that when this tax is brought in and when the people have experience of it it is not going to be so terrible at all as Fine Gael and Labour too are trying to make out.  They know that and are afraid if it is tried and the people get <Col N="1684" /> an opportunity of trying it out they will see it is not so bad as they were told by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>I want to correct something the National Farmers Association said. They had a meeting a few days ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Deputy Dillon will never get a bloody nose anyhow.  There is no doubt about that.  He will not put himself in the way of getting one.  The National Farmers Association said that the co-operative clauses in this Finance Bill were a further deliberate reduction of farmers' incomes.  They said that it was designed to worsen the position of the small farmer.  They said that it provided a tax on pig development co-operatives, that they should be taxed and privately-owned pig development units would not be taxed.  They made these four statements. It is not a deliberate reduction in farmers' incomes.  It is not designed to worsen the position of the small farmers&mdash;I know they are speaking objectively there because the small farmers do not belong in that organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pig co-operatives will not be taxed if they are certified to be really co-operatives by the Minister for Agriculture and there is no mention of privately-owned pig farms as far as this Bill is concerned.  So, in everything, they are wrong they are inaccurate.  They have published that condemnation without knowing what the facts are.  I suppose it is another bit of hostility to this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan said the other night that it was Fine Gael policy not to allow the Revenue Commissioners to ask banks to disclose interest, etc., paid.  I asked him at the time if that was Fine Gael policy and he said yes. I was surprised.  The Leader of the <Col N="1685" /> Fine Gael Party made that clear to-night.  He made it plain, as far as he was concerned, as Leader of the Fine Gael Party, he would not stand for that particular clause in this Bill.</P>
    <P>From the time I became Minister for Finance, I have always said that as far as I am concerned I will try my utmost to get everybody to pay whatever taxation there is, that there will be no evasion as far as I can prevent it.  I do not know why Fine Gael are always trying to shield these tax evaders.  They have adopted that attitude all the time.  Why should these people be permitted to have their money hidden away, to have dividends either drawn or accumulating to their account and not pay their fair share of taxation?  Why they should be shielded by Fine Gael, I do not know.</P>

      <P>According to many speeches made here by Fine Gael Deputies, democracy operates properly only when Independents vote Fine Gael, that if Independents vote Fianna Fáil, it is a denial of democracy, that that should not be; that if we are depending on the votes of Independents we should say, &ldquo;No, you had better vote with Fine Gael if you want to be democratic.&rdquo; That is Fine Gael's definition of democracy.  On the occasion of this turnover tax their followers throughout the country began to send in telegrams to Independents and others expressing their dissatisfaction with the turnover tax.  That was not too bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite admissible to send a telegram saying you do not like it, but the next thing was that they began to say to the Independent Deputies: &ldquo;If you dare to support this Bill in the Dáil, you are out, and we will see to it that you are out at the next election.&rdquo; That was a bit of a threat, but not satisfied with that, they began to send telegrams from every trader.  I know one Independent Deputy who got about 55 or 60 telegrams, all in the very same words.  They purported to come from traders, but I do not know whether <Col N="1686" /> they did come from traders.  At any rate if they did come from traders, is it not perfectly obvious that it was not a spontaneous movement but that it was organised by Fine Gael and others who want to do harm to the Government?</P>
    <P>It was not a spontaneous movement but a well organised movement.  Of course, Fine Gael are old hands at this sort of thing.  The next thing was the organisation of this motorcade, or whatever it is called, in order to intimidate a Deputy and frighten him so far as they could into voting with the Opposition against this tax.  That was going a bit too far.  Deputy Dillon deprecated the whole thing, but he criticised the Minister for Lands for talking about it.  I think that was going too far, and democracy in this country will be destroyed if that sort of thing is allowed to succeed.</P>
    <P>If those people succeed in their intimidation in this instance, it will be very difficult in future to run a democratic Government here, because every pressure group will know they can get what they want by using pressure.  They will always have a weakling Party like Fine Gael to support them.  Instead of supporting them, Fine Gael should have condemned them in the interests of democracy, if we are to have a true democracy here.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael always appeal to the lowest instincts of the people.  They always appeal to cupidity.  During the Economic War, they said to the farmers: &ldquo;We will get you a better price for your cattle.  Leave the Government and come over to us.&rdquo; They are now appealing to the selfishness, cupidity and greed of some of the consumers and shopkeepers.  As I say, back in 1933 when we were fighting the British Government for what we believed was due to the country, they organised the Blueshirts as a pressure group; they appealed to the farmers to throw us over and said they would make a settlement with Britain and everything would be all right.  Luckily enough, they did not succeed.  They failed at that time.</P>

These people are saying that if this law is passed, they will not obey it, they will refuse to carry it out, and Fine Gael are behind them saying: &ldquo;Go on, boys; you might get them out if you stick at it.&rdquo; That is their interest in democracy, after the beautiful speech on democracy and the rights of man we heard from Deputy Dillon this evening.</P>

Tourism is a very important industry.  It brings in £40 million, and those who are in charge of tourism were of the opinion that we had to have more high-class hotels in order to attract more tourists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that when these hotels were built, they would employ about 1,500 people.  If they are supported by tourists, that will bring in a great deal of money.  Everyone will agree that the man who goes to a luxury hotel that costs him £6, £7 or £8 a day will leave more money here than the man who goes to the guesthouse.  I am not despising the man who goes to the guesthouse, but we want the well-off man, too.  When the Government decide to do a thing like that which will bring in a great deal of money, which will do no harm to anyone, which will give employment and be useful to the State, there are some cynical Fine Gael people who will say: &ldquo;Luxury hotels.&rdquo; That is the type of mentality of some of the people on the opposite side of the House.</P>
      <P>During this debate, many Opposition speakers talked about the failures of the Government.  The solid achievements of the Government have been overlooked and I want to mention some of them.  This country is much better off than ever before and I shall tell you now why I say that. The volume of national production over the past four years was higher than that achieved in any comparable period in the past.</P>

      <P>The average rate of growth of almost 4½ per cent per year was no less than eight times as good as the progress from 1954 to 1956 under the Coalition Government to whom the people were so grateful.  Our rate of growth compares well with that of the more highly industrialised countries of Europe.  It is a sustainable growth under conditions of relative stability.  In regard to our external account there was a very slow growth from 1954 to 1956, inclusive, one-eighth of what it is now and the balance of payments deficit had gone up by £56 million over the three years, whereas during our six years the total increase was about £13,500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress has been made on a broad front.  Exports, for instance, were 60 per cent higher than in 1956.  There will not be exports unless there is production. Industrial production over the last four years went up by 7½ per cent per annum; that is one of the best rates in western Europe.  Industrial employment has grown accordingly. In the December quarter of 1962 there were 22,000 more employed in manufacturing industry than in the December quarter of 1956.  The rate of growth of agricultural output, not as high as we would have wished, was 5 per cent more in 1962 than in 1956. Unemployment of insurable persons in mid-December, 1962 was 5.7 per cent as compared with 9 per cent in mid-December, 1956.  Emigration in 1962 amounted to 20,800 or less than half the figure of 42,800 for 1956, with the result that for the first time there is a sustained increase in population. During the three years from the end of February, 1954, to the end of February, 1957, 149,000 people left this country.  During the six years from 1st March, 1957, until 1st March of this year the figure was 216,000.  It is a very much better average.  The average with the Coalition Government <Col N="1690" /> was between 49,000 and 50,000 per year and now it is 36,000; but there is a good trend; it is down to 20,000 in the last year and 24,000 the year before.  Therefore, as far as emigration is concerned we have made very good progress.</P>
    <P>In regard to earnings&mdash;I am taking the basic figure of 100 in 1953&mdash;in the December quarter of 1956 earnings were 115.3 and in the same period in 1962 they were 164.4.  In money terms there is an increase of 42.6 per cent but in real income terms it is 20.4 per cent.  Therefore, after allowing for the increase in the cost of living the wage earner and the salary earner had 20 per cent more to spend than they had in the 1956 period.</P>
    <P>I mentioned here before that the yield of income tax has been improving. Everybody knows we do not collect income tax until the person has an income.  In 1956-57 we collected £22 million; in 1962-63 we collected £33.9 million when the rate was 1/2d. in the £ lower.</P>

      <P>All these statistics go to show that progress has been made in 1962 and we believe it is possible to continue increasing real wages and incomes, provided, of course, as we made very clear already, that incomes and production are kept in relation to each other.  As the Taoiseach said when he was speaking a few days ago, all these figures go to show there has been a spirit of confidence in the economy which was sadly lacking when the previous Government were in office. The people lost complete confidence at that time; production went down; unemployment went up and things were in a bad way.  Some Deputies sought to establish that this year is not as good as last year.  As a matter of fact, it is better so far.  There is no truth in the suggestion that the economy is slowing down.  All the indications point the other way.  Exports, for instance, show an expansion 10 per cent greater in the first five months of this year than in the <Col N="1691" /> corresponding period last year.  Imports are higher, too, but exports are the main criteria of what we produce for ourselves and what we can spare over and above that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial production is rising at a faster rate than in 1962.  Expansion in manufacturing industry was 5.6 per cent in the March quarter of 1963 as compared with a rise of less than 5 per cent in the March quarter of 1962. In building construction there has been a very big expansion.  The rise in cattle stocks and cattle exports give ground for great optimism about our agricultural output and our agricultural exports during the present year. As I said already, emigration continues <Col N="1692" /> to decline.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in its recent review of the Irish economy predicted a rise in real production of the order of 4 per cent in 1963 as compared with 2½ per cent in 1962 and there is every prospect of this being fulfilled.  In the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which is now in the course of preparation and the first part of which will be issued, I hope, in the course of a few weeks, we plan to continue this progress up to 1970 when we hope to have achieved the target of a 50 per cent increase in production over 1960.</P>
