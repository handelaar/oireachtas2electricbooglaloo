    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy O'Sullivan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few other points to which I want to refer.  Deputy Kyne referred to the fact that the standard of our social welfare payments is low compared with a number of other countries.  It is true that our social welfare payments are not as high as would be considered desirable, <Col N="1650" /> but they are not as bad as Deputies seem to take pleasure in saying they are.  The Government have shown a keen awareness of the fact that there is need for an improvement in our social welfare standard, and practically every year some improvement has been made.  It is the declared policy of the Government to effect further improvements.</P>
      <P>When the lowness of our social welfare payments is criticised, it is never mentioned that the proportion of the State's contribution to insurance benefits in this country is higher than it is in any other country anyone can mention.  The aim here is that the State should pay 33? per cent of the total cost of the insurance benefits, but in actual fact, over the years, the percentage has worked out considerably higher than that.</P>
      <P>I have here the figures from 1953 to 1961-62.  Over that period, the average State contribution has been 38.5 per cent.  One year it went as high as 43.6 per cent and it is still considerably higher than the 33? per cent at which we aim.  That compares very favourably with the position in any other country of which I am aware.  In Great Britain, the average contribution of the Exchequer towards social insurance for the years 1954-55 to 1960-61 was 16 per cent, whereas here it was almost 40 per cent.  A fact that is never referred to is that the State here plays a much more important and direct part in providing money for social insurance schemes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish referred to seasonal fishermen and share fishermen in relation to unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  That question is under examination at the moment.  I must agree that when a person earns practically his total income for the year over a comparatively small period of the year, it is rather harsh to assess that income in the same way as an income earned weekly.  That question is being looked into, as is also the matter of making share fishermen eligible for unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish also referred to the reports of the Workmen's Compensation <Col N="1651" /> Commission, and the alleged long delay in dealing with those reports. While it is true, as he says, that it is a long time since the commission was set up, it really is not such a long time since the reports became available.  In fact, printed copies were circulated only in February, but, as I have said on a number of occasions, I have now completed my examination of the reports and I hope to be in a position to indicate what the Government's proposals are in the reasonably near future.  I suppose it would be too optimistic to say that there is any prospect of the legislation being ready in this session.  It is likely that there will be legislation.  It will probably take some time to prepare it.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am aware that the maximum amount that can be paid by way of workmen's compensation is £4 10s. and that this does result in hardship.  When the Government's decisions with regard to the future of workmen's compensation have been decided upon, it may, if it appears that the necessary legislation will be protracted, be necessary to decide on certain interim changes in the scheme which could be made more rapidly. I should like to avoid that, if at all possible, because if you make interim changes in the amount of compensation to be paid, they will obviously give rise to changes in the premiums to be paid.  However, if the legislation is likely to be very protracted, we may have to consider doing that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne referred to the form of application for blind pension.  He seemed to imply that because that application form did not indicate that medical evidence would be necessary, there was a long delay.  My information is that, immediately on receipt of the application, if it is found that the answers to the questions on the application form indicate that the person is otherwise qualified for the receipt of a blind pension, a further form is sent out immediately to the person on which he or she submits a report from some doctor in connection with his or her eyesight.</P>

      <P>Is that a new regulation?</P>

    <Col N="1652" />
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That goes out straight away.  Three questions are asked which are necessary to establish whether or not the person is otherwise qualified: how long he or she has resided in Ireland since the age of 10 years; if he or she is unable to do work for which eyesight is essential; and if he or she is able to carry out his or her ordinary occupation.  It is felt a person should reply to these questions before going to the expense of getting a medical report.  I think there has been some delay in getting the Department's medical officer to verify certain cases but that was due to the retirement of one doctor and to a certain amount of delay in appointing his successor.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish asked about the proportion of the State's contribution to the cost of the social insurance schemes.  He inquired whether it is still 33? per cent.  In fact, it is quite considerably more than 33? per cent. That is due, at least partly, to the fact that while the benefits for agricultural workers are the same as those for other workers, the rates of contribution are smaller.  I do not know exactly how much that would amount to in the year but I feel that the amount by which the contributions from agricultural workers falls short of what it would be if they were charged at the same rate as those for other workers should possibly be included in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture because it is a subvention towards agriculture.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish also asked what percentage of total tax revenue represented expenditure on social welfare. My estimate is that social welfare expenditure represents 20.1 per cent of total tax revenue.</P>
      <P>The question of long delays on appeals was mentioned.  The position in that regard has been very much improved lately.  There are not excessive delays at the moment in dealing with appeals.  If there are any cases which Deputies have in mind, I shall always be pleased to investigate them and to see what has given rise to delay.  There is usually a fairly good reason.  However, if I find there is any unreasonable delay, I shall have the matter rectified.</P>

      <Col N="1654" /> Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>In subsection (2), page 9, line 9, after &ldquo;objects&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;save such as belong to the owner of the land and are used by him or any member of his family otherwise than for the purpose of gain or profit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Deputy Jones.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress on the last day, I was dealing with Section 3, with particular reference to subsection (2) (b) (i).  I pointed out that the growth of caravanning in this country had been rapid and widespread and that a great many families nowadays use caravans.  Some families use their own caravans but a business has developed in the leasing or letting of caravans.  Some of these caravans are based at seaside resorts.  Others are available for touring purposes.</P>
      <P>As the section stands, subsection (2) (b) (i) reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of <i>subsection (1)</i> of this section and without prejudice to the generality thereof&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  where land becomes used for any of the following purposes:</P>
      <P>(i)  the placing or keeping of any vans, tents or other objects, whether or not moveable and whether or not collapsible, for the purpose of caravanning or camping or the sale of goods,</P>
      <P>the use of the land shall be taken as having materially changed.</P>
      <P>That would mean that such use of the land would come within the terms of development, requiring the permission of the planning authority when this Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>Our amendment seeks to preserve the rights of individuals to use their property for their own purposes and to keep a caravan for their own purposes. Therefore, we have suggested that after the word &ldquo;objects&rdquo; in that part of the section there should be inserted:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;save such as belong to the owner of the land and are used by him or any member of his family otherwise <Col N="1655" /> than for the purpose of gain or profit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I can readily understand that it is desirable, indeed necessary, that there should be control in regard to the disposal of caravans but I believe that the section goes too far and that the individual who owns a caravan and places it on his land, say, during the winter or at any other time, when not using it, would find he would have to obtain the permission of somebody to keep his own property on his own site.</P>
    <P>Equally, the generality of the subsection would preclude him from permitting a brother or other relative of his who would wish to spend the night or a few nights, or any short period of time, with him, to park his caravan on his site.  Here we are imposing on the individual the obligation to apply to the planning authority at that stage for permission to do these things.  This is a most unreasonable generality to include.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts the amendment, he will strengthen the section and at the same time provide for the right of the individual in the circumstances I have mentioned to keep his own caravan or to allow a relative to use his property for the purpose of keeping a caravan for a short period of time.  We do not seek any lessening of control where there is any question of gain or profit.  The amendment is confined in terms to cases such as I have mentioned.  I would suggest that the Minister ought to accept the amendment as being not only desirable but necessary if there is to be respect for this planning Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the thought in the mind of Deputy Jones in approaching this matter as he has but at the same time I feel that he has not taken into consideration the situation that would arise if his amendment were accepted.  The situation would then be that effective control of this type of use, or abuse, would be nonexistent, inasmuch as it would be possible for any person to buy a few perches of land anywhere, in one of our beauty spots or elsewhere, and as a registered owner of that land, in conformity <Col N="1656" /> with the terms of the section as they would be if the amendment were accepted, would be entitled to keep his or her caravan on those few perches of land, regardless of the controls in any other direction.</P>
      <P>In addition, the situation could also develop, if the amendment were accepted, that all sorts of unsightly objects could be placed on land and left there indefinitely on the pretext that they belonged to the owner of the land.  I know that is something that Deputy Jones and the other Deputies are not advocating and would not wish to see.  That is, roughly, the other side of the picture of what could arise if the amendment were accepted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones has outlined the difficulties and what would appear to him to be the unreasonableness of the situation if the amendment is not accepted.  What I feel about it is that the amendment should not be accepted and that, in order to cover the type of genuine situation described by Deputy Jones, the owner, his relative, his friend or his family could be catered for in those genuine circumstances by exemptions which it will be possible for the Minister for Local Government to make by way of regulation. In fact, we have a brief outline ourselves so far, but it is not really final, of what these regulations in regard to exemptions may be.</P>
      <P>We propose to exempt by way of regulation the placing, keeping, or storing of a single caravan, provided the caravan is not used for the sale of goods or for the purpose of any business undertaking.  That is just one part of it.  We also propose by way of regulation to exempt the use of land for the purpose of camping for not more than 21 days in any calendar year, provided the land is not used for the sale of goods or other business purposes and further, for what use it may be, in those circumstances we would also exempt the use of land as a caravan site, of course, if it were approved by the sanitary authority in accordance with the general conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a little further elaboration, which I shall be quite happy to apply if we can find a formula by which to <Col N="1657" /> do it, I feel that the first two proposed exemptions would cover the genuine cases and that we would retain the law as we propose in the section, without the amendment, so that we do catch those who are not entitled, who have no genuine, good case and who would merely be abusing the situation if we were to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>That is the way in which we have tried to do it.  If we accept the amendment, it will be too general; there will be abuses; and it just would not give us the effective control that is desirable.  So we are looking for greater control in these circumstances and where genuine reasons and genuine cases exist such as outlined by Deputy Jones, we exempt those under the regulations which the Minister will be empowered to make.  In that way, we can have the best of both worlds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's approach and I can see the force of what he has said.  The regulations the Minister will make will go a long way to meet the point of view we have been putting forward.  Perhaps the Minister would inform us, too, how he proposes to deal with the caravan that moves about the country: these people have no permanent abode and they move from place to place and park their caravans for a night or two, or perhaps a week, or a couple of weeks.  Possibly this matter has come under consideration by the Commission dealing with the problem of itinerants, but will this section cover that type of caravanner?  Will the local authority have power to direct these people as to where they can park or prohibit them from parking altogether perhaps? There are a great many people who remain permanently in winter quarters and then move out in the spring and summer.  What about the circus and the travelling show?  Are they covered?  Road shows and circuses are very popular in the country. Sometimes they spend a week, or more, under canvas in a field.  How does the Minister propose to deal with that situation?  Will these people have to apply in every case to the local authority for permission?  I should <Col N="1658" /> like the public to be aware of the situation in regard to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the preliminary regulations, the intention is to exempt temporary structures.  That exemption would cover all these movable, collapsible and other types of structure erected not less than 50 feet from any road and connected with some sporting or recreational activity and retained in a particular area for not more than 14 days in any calendar year.  If there are any suggestions in relation to either elaboration or construction of that preliminary regulation, we will be quite happy to hear them, but this is the manner in which we hope to cope with the situation outlined by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a great many people, as the Minister knows, who go around the country, staying in a place for just one or two nights.  I am referring to itinerants.  They devastate the piece of ground on which they camp.  They leave an insanitary, unsightly and dangerous mess of bottles and so on behind them.  I do not want to be too hard on these people but I do not see why they should not keep the law as well as anyone else.  I am under the impression that county councils have apparently no powers because they never do anything.  Have we any powers?  If we have not, is it the intention in this Bill to cover the situation I mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the roadside lands, margins and verges are concerned, these are the property of the local authority.  Under the 1948 Sanitary Services Act, the sanitary authority has power to control any such objectionable use of their property. The situation is already covered.  There is, of course, the fact that the Commission has not yet reported and it is possible that local authorities are awaiting that report before they take positive action.  That may explain the laxity in some areas and I think there is laxity.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the caravanner who moves around from area to area, spending a couple of days in each area, He could be a workman of a specialised type.  We hope to exempt such people.</P>

I have been deluged from time to time with complaints from small and big farmers about the appalling damage done by certain of these people and the shocking condition in which they leave the places where they camp.  The farmer dare not do anything.  I was under the impression the local authority had no power.  I am glad to hear it has.</P>
      <P>There are quite a number of very decent people who travel around, horse trading, or dealing in one thing or another.  They are not all black sheep, but the majority are, I am sorry to say.  There are people who travel around in caravans who work on farms, and so on.  There are workers who work for contractors and who live in caravans in order to be near the site of their operations.  I am glad the Minister is providing for these.  I should not like to think anything we do here might bear too heavily on people securing a livelihood.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 9, to delete line 16, and substitute &ldquo;such use shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a material change&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A cardinal principle of justice has always been that a person shall be adjudged innocent until proved guilty. The fact that something may happen which may appear to be a transgressing of this section ought not be taken as being a transgression without giving the person involved an opportunity, if he so wishes, of appealing on any ground by way of setting out that he does not consider that what he has done is a material change in the use of the land.  The fact that somebody <Col N="1660" /> on the planning staff says that the use of the land has been materially changed is the opinion of an individual as against that of the person who is affected by the decision.  It would be much fairer to say that it shall be regarded as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a change and to give the person the right to appeal if he feels aggrieved in regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is undoubtedly to give protection to the owner of property and with that we cannot disagree.  At the same time, the amendment would bring about uncertainty where we want to avoid it, if at all possible. The Deputy said he would like to uphold the principle that until a person is proved guilty, he is assumed to be innocent.  On the other hand, the fact that he may be accused of committing an offence does not in itself imply that he is guilty.  There is that difference of approach in regard to this matter. That may not have been clearly understood to be the case but that is the case and would be the case in any such circumstances as these.  The mere suggestion that the man is responsible because he is the owner of the land does not copper-fasten his guilt.  The matter must be gone into and if it can be shown by the landowner that he had no hand, act or part in the transgression, he will not have committed any offence and therefore will not suffer any penalty.</P>

    <P>The Minister is well aware, as a rural Deputy, that in this country when it comes to the time for the father of a family, the owner of property, and his wife to make what is known as a family settlement, generally a document is drawn up which preserves the right of the old people to have a room or rooms in that home set aside for themselves as a separate entity and they retain that right to themselves.  The young couple and the old couple then have two separate residences within the same building and they may even have separate entrances to such a building.  Indeed it is not so long since a case which originated not far from my own constituency, an action for breach of covenant in regard to one of these family settlements, was decided in the courts in that fashion.</P>
    <P>When we legislate here, we are legislating for the generality of cases. The Minister is thinking in terms of buildings which might be used as flats though, in the ordinary way, there could be a situation where a large house might be divided between two people of the same family and one structure might then become two dwellings instead of one.  That would contravene subsection (3) and the local authority would have to decide whether it could be permitted under the code we are now seeking to enact. I suggest to the Minister that the subsection is unreasonable because it does not make provision for the type of case I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Jones in his contention and I would ask the Minister to have regard to the sentiments he has expressed.  As I understand the Bill, the conversion of a single dwelling into flats is directly controlled but the provision, say, in a house which has already two or three flats of a larger number of smaller flats or bed-sitting rooms is not controlled. <Col N="1662" /> That is a serious defect in this measure and I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment so as to ensure that the use of a house is not restricted in the matter of providing extra accommodation by way of flatlets or otherwise.</P>
      <P>It seems we are placing the owner of a single house in an invidious position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the owner of a house which comprises a number of flatlets and I would ask the Minister instead of allowing the words &ldquo;as a single dwelling&rdquo; to stand, to agree to the insertion of an amendment such as &ldquo;as a lesser number of dwellings&rdquo;. That, I believe, would be an adequate safeguard for the people we have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall be dealing with change of use later but to answer the Deputy, what he says would constitute a change of use.  As regards Deputy Treacy's point regarding the conversion of a number of flats in an existing house into flatlets or bed-sitting rooms thereby causing a multiplication of dwellings, that is in fact now covered.  Amendment No. 17 related <Col N="1663" /> to a structure or part of a structure and it covers what Deputy Treacy referred to.  The multiplication of dwellings within existing flats cannot be allowed to take place without the appropriate permission, if everything else is in order.</P>
      <P>In regard to this amendment and what Deputy Jones said, the position is that this subsection has been put in to avoid any doubt.  The principle involved in this subsection is already incorporated, so far as I am aware without any real objection, in Section 11 of the 1948 Housing Act.  It is something we must have.  I can quite see Deputy Jones's point as regards family settlements and arrangements and I agree fully with him on that but we must have control of the creation of flats and there is a general tendency at the moment to create flats.  There is nothing wrong with that, provided they are created in such a way as to conform to the building by-laws, the sanitary regulations and the planning laws.  We cannot have a position that will lessen the certainty that flat creation will have planning control</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly these exceptional cases mentioned by Deputy Jones would also be covered but it is possible for us, and indeed it would be our wish, if no alternative offers, to include these cases as exemptions in regulations which we also propose to make under powers taken in earlier sections of the Bill.  We may find that that is the only way of dealing with these cases where family settlements are involved, where legal documents are, or are about to be, drawn up, and where serious repercussions would ensue if they could not be proceeded with.  If necessary, the regulations will provide for exemption of that type in the case of the creation of two or three dwellings in an existing structure which in the ordinary way would have to be subject to planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if cases must come for planning permission it does not follow that they must be refused.  Only the odd case would have to be refused.  Therefore the number of exemptions would be very small.  Even if we never had the section and merely operated on the <Col N="1664" /> reconstruction grants code in regard to the provision of flats in existing houses, wherever planning has been in operation, my Department, and I think all Departments making grants for purposes of this kind, require planning permission documents to be submitted with the application before it is seriously considered.</P>
    <P>That in itself would require planning permission where planning operates but under this Bill planning permission will have to be got, no matter in what area the applicant is in future.  Every area will have planning control in operation and therefore the Departments would insist on planning permission being furnished with the grant application.  I would certainly be prepared to take any steps open to me to provide for exceptional cases in which family arrangements might be upset to an undesirable degree and such provision could be made by way of regulation exempting certain categories of alteration consequent on family settlement and the drawing of a legal document which exists or is to come into existence in the future.</P>
    <P>The overall reason for this provision is&mdash;and I think the House will agree&mdash;that it is absolutely essential that we should have control of the creation of flats where that is taking place to prevent the multiplication instanced by Deputy Treacy of undesirably  small, cramped and insanitary types of dwelling eventually leading to the return of tenements.  If the provision impinges on the rights of individuals, I am prepared to deal with genuine cases of that kind by way of exemption.  If there is no other way, I am prepared to make such exemption by regulation in the type of hardship cases Deputy Jones has outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is common in seaside places&mdash;and there are many seaside places in Donegal&mdash;that people let rooms.  Sometimes when they have their families reared and have a few rooms vacant, they let these rooms.  It is not like the creation of flats.  But under this Bill they would be creating two dwellings because it would involve a material change.  I do not think these <Col N="1665" /> people should be deprived of the right of making up their minds, if there is an influx of visitors in July, to let rooms, if they wish.  Under the Bill they would have to apply to the local authority.  They would have to be inspected, and goodness knows when they could let the rooms.  The Minister would be leaving people out in the street.</P>
      <P>There is also the case of people who let rooms to young married couples. There is no structural alteration of the house.  I know the Minister has control where people apply for reconstruction grants to make four or five self-contained flats.  That is good.  But where there is a structural change and where people want to let one or two rooms, they will not be allowed to do so under this Bill.  The Minister should either deal with this matter by regulation or accept Deputy Jones's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we are all in agreement that the purpose of this subsection is to prevent the multiplication of flats in one building.  Consequently, that is something to which the planning authority are entitled to have regard.  But there is the danger that in trying to do a good thing, we are in fact doing far more than we mean to do.  If you read subsection (3), it can be read to mean that nobody can take a paying guest hereafter without reference to the planning authority.  I do not think the Minister intends or wants to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people in this country whose circumstances deteriorate. An elderly lady takes in another lady.  The neighbours never inquire whether the lady has come in as a companion or as a paying guest.  It would be a possible cause of embarrassment to the old lady in question to reveal that her circumstances were now such that she had to take a paying guest.  There are many people who take a lodger.  It is a very good thing to do.  I am continually thundering up and down the roads of Monaghan, urging the people in Monaghan, now that we have improved the fishing amenities here, there and everywhere, to receive a guest in their house for the fishing <Col N="1666" /> season, pointing out to them it is a very desirable and beneficial source of supplementary income.  I suggest to the Minister that certainly in regard to the first class of persons, it could be said that the introduction of a paying guest on a quasi-permanent basis was substantially the conversion of one dwelling into two dwellings.  I do not think we want to have that.</P>
    <P>The case raised by Deputy Jones is well known to all of us familiar with rural Ireland.  To anyone not familiar with rural Ireland, I recommend Arensberg's book, <i>The Irish Countryman.</i> I commend it to the Minister and to all those associated with him as a very valuable sociological study of rural Ireland.  Arensberg refers to the well-established custom in Irish rural society of the west room, a custom to which Deputy Jones also referred.  When the old people resolve to hand over the place to the son on the occasion of his marriage, they ordinarily retire to a room.  Sometimes there is a written agreement; sometimes there is not.  The room to which they ordinarily retire is traditionally in the west end of the house. I do not believe anybody in Dáil Éireann wants to interfere in the intimate domestic affairs of any family in rural Ireland and ask them on such an occasion to repair to the county council's offices and say: &ldquo;We are going into the west room now and Tom is taking over.&rdquo;  As the Minister fully appreciates, these are very intimate family arrangements that are not freely discussed in rural society.  I do not want to make the case for a moment that I think the Minister is trying to poke his nose into the intimate affairs of rural Ireland.  In fact, I am quite satisfied from the course of our discussion that we have a common purpose here.</P>
    <P>I want to make a concrete suggestion to the Minister.  Would it carry us too far if we confined the proposal to operate in cities and towns?  You do not have the multiplication of flats outside cities and towns.  But the problem is there in even relatively small cities.  I am bound to admit, however, I do not think the exclusion of areas outside cities and towns <Col N="1667" /> would meet the case of the paying guest.  If the Minister accepts we are all agreed we do not want to interfere with the family settlements associated with what Arensberg calls the west room, that we do not want to restrict a person in taking a paying guest and that our sole purpose is to prevent the conversion of individual dwellings into flats, or two flats into four or five flats, without the prior consent of the planning authority, I am sure between now and Report Stage the Minister could find some device to give effect to our common purpose.  I should be glad if the Minister would say (1) whether he shares with us our anxiety not to interfere with what I shall call the west room, and (2) that he does not intend to place any restriction on the practice of taking a paying guest.</P>

      <P>I think this subsection is an excellent one.  Frankly, I do not entertain the same fears as Deputy Dillon.  I can appreciate his fears, but it seems to me this subsection does nothing to support him.  I cannot see anything in it which will prevent anybody from taking in a lodger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>A single dwelling would be in the nature of what is represented to be a self-contained flat.  One takes in a lodger who is treated as one of the family and who has access to all the amenities of the dwelling.  It is still a single dwelling.  The Minister is trying to prevent the indiscriminate setting up of what are described as self-contained flats.  Frankly, I admit these are confined mainly to the cities and towns. But I do not see how these people who fish in Monaghan or on the Slaney and who want to lodge in houses can be prevented from doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is cut off, the Minister and his advisers, not under this piece of legislation perhaps, should endeavour to ensure that the ordinary amenities will be available in the west room, that part of the house referred to by Deputy Dillon.  The Minister should endeavour to provide that sanitation and the other amenities will be provided.  This is the first time I have heard the expression &ldquo;the west room&rdquo;, but if my wife and I or Deputy Dillon and his wife, are to be confined to the west room, surely we will be given the run of the house as well.</P>
      <P>My purpose in speaking on this section is to try to make the provision more watertight.  The subsection says:</P>
      <P>For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that for the purposes of this section the use as two or more dwellings of any structure previously used as a single dwelling involves a material change in the use of the structure and of each part thereof which is so used.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not covered a house which on the date of the coming into operation of the Act has been used as a two or three-dwelling, so that legally one who has used a house as a two or three or a six or seven-dwelling is not covered by this section.  I should like to have the Minister's comments on that.  I hope that if he thinks it necessary, he will introduce an amendment to cover this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already indicated his willingness to accept a legal document when it can be produced in a family settlement.  I am concerned here about cases where families make such settlements without legal documents and I should like to hear the Minister say that such cases are safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was probably too <Col N="1669" /> limited in my outlook when I referred to legal documents.  I was really referring to what the legal position would be rather than cencentrating on the actual production of a document.  It is the circumstances I am concerned about rather than the method.  A certain number of the fears expressed here are groundless.  As I have already said, and as Deputy Corish said, the subsection is provided so as to avoid any doubt, or at least to lessen doubts that might exist as to what is covered.  All that we have talked about is already covered by the section or in the various other sections.</P>
      <P>In so far as the lodger is concerned, the taking in of paying guests and the use of country houses for that purpose is a development I am all for.  It is one which has been a practice in my own county for many years, one which I hope will spread and which I believe is in fact spreading.  It can be of very great assistance in supplementing the incomes of small farmers in particular through a build-up of the tourist trade. In Donegal, we knew this practice years ago, long before there was this great talk about tourism, and I am glad to see that County Monaghan, among others, has made great strides in this direction.</P>
      <P>There is no question whatever that the taking in of lodgers or paying guests in the country or elsewhere will in any way conflict with what the House feels should be done through the medium of this Bill.  Whether they are termed lodgers or guests, whether they are paying or not, is immaterial. The fact that they are in a house will not materially change the user of the house, will not create an additional dwelling within the house and therefore will not be caught in any way under this legislation.  It is my wish that those situations should be not only outside the scope of the section but that every possible encouragement should be given to this type of enterprise throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned that on the date of the coming into operation of the Bill any house being used as more than one dwelling would not be caught under the terms of this section. <Col N="1670" /> Possibly before the Deputy came in, while still speaking on this section, I mentioned that amendment No. 17, accepted by the House, would bring about a change, making it absolutely clear that such cases as he envisaged would be caught.  The section refers to &ldquo;Structure or part of structure&rdquo;.  That ties in any or all existing multiple dwellings or dwellings which it might be proposed to convert into such structures in the future.  They will be in the same category as a single dwelling in so far as this provision is concerned. The Deputy need not have qualms in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested confining this provision to the cities.  By and large, that would meet the case but there are important exceptions.  For instance, if we were to try to do something like that in the city of Dublin, we would have to have some predetermined limits in order to recognise where it would or would not apply. If we took the city boundary as a limit, we would have a great part of suburban Dublin in which this type of development would be just as objectionable as it would be inside the boundary.  We would free those people from these obligations and enable suburban Dublin to become what I might call tenemented by the multiplication of homes within homes.  Therefore Deputy Dillon's suggestion, which seemed to meet the vast majority of cases, would be objectionable in that respect.</P>
    <P>Cork is another example where the perimeter is rather restricted.  Over the city boundary there, they have quite a lot of building.  It would be impossible to define Cork city other than by reference to the existing boundary.  If we were to adopt the suggestion, therefore, we would be leaving ourselves open to the type of abuse to which I have referred on the perimeter of a city, but outside the boundary, where they would not be caught by this section.  While I shall certainly have a further look at this between now and Report Stage, I do not hold any great hope for the implementation of this suggestion.  In the meantime, I can assure the House that if there are any genuine cases where hardship would be created <Col N="1671" /> through the operation of the provisions of this section, they will be considered.</P>
    <P>That power can be used if we find some cases which should not be caught.  I intend to utilise that power to make regulations exempting such cases as have been outlined by Deputies, and any others that may occur to a Deputy now or at a later stage. The House need have no fear that we are putting in anything that is unnecessary. Our purpose is not to try to harass people.  The whole idea of our planning code is to make the general atmosphere better and the community more livable in.  If we are, in a sense, treading on the toes or the rights of certain individuals, it is for the common good.  We are trying to get a balance of rights rather than trying to harass people and seek to make them toe the line and obey regulations.  The whole idea of this town planning is to help everyone to enjoy what we have more fully in our community, our own homes and our own countryside.  We are trying to preserve and improve what we have.</P>

He has said that he will look at the point raised by Deputy Dillon between now and Report Stage.  He might consider whether a list of towns in the First Schedule might not meet the point in some degree.  He would not then be confined to Dublin, Cork and Limerick.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), to delete paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f), lines 29 to 46.</P>
      <P>The exempted developments are set out in this section.  Paragraph (a) deals with the use of land for agriculture, forestry and afforestation; (b) with development by the council of a county in the county health district; (c) with development by the corporation of a county or other borough; (d) with development by the council of an urban district; (e) with the carrying out of work on the construction and improvement of roads; and (f) with development consisting of the carrying out by any local authority or statutory undertaker of any works for the purpose of inspecting, repairing, renewing, altering or removing any sewers, mains, pipes, cables, overhead wires, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any good reason, in principle, why a local authority should be exempt from the controls which are being imposed on citizens?  Surely the local authorities should be setting an example?  If the Bill is passed as envisaged here, it will require citizens to submit themselves to controls, and controls which will be rigid and, in <Col N="1673" /> some cases, extreme.  Is it reasonable then to assume that the local authorities should have the right to be exempt from complying with any direction which may be given?</P>
    <P>When a plan is made, the town planners know, or they have a composite idea in their minds, what they intend for a particular area, or for the layout of roads, sewers, cables, and so on.  Indeed, it is very desirable that in future planning the local authorities should have regard to that very necessary type of work.  As was mentioned earlier, such planning should obviate the necessity for the erection of overhead wires, and the tearing up of roads for a second time for the supply services which are necessary on building sites or industrial sites.</P>
    <P>To say at this stage that those who conceived the plan for the town or the area should not be subject to the same measure of control as an individual citizen, is conferring a right which I think is much too wide.  The approach in this section seems to be that the individual, John Citizen, may be wrong and possibly is wrong in many cases, but that an official cannot be wrong or ever make a mistake, and that the planning authority can never make a mistake.  The fact that we are providing in this legislation that there shall be a review of town planning for an area every fifth year assumes that changes may be necessary.  I suggest that, since there will be a review every fifth year, it is reasonable to impose the same control on the local authority and the people who plan for the local authority as is imposed on the citizen.</P>
    <P>Is it to be said, for instance, that the local authority can park their machinery, rusty tar barrels, obsolete machines, and so on, in a green or make a dump wherever they might decide to do so, whereas citizens may not do these things at all?  The Minister will have to justify his exemption of the local authorities from this type of control.</P>
    <P>Over quite a number of years, there has been a good deal of controversial discussion in regard to things done by local authorities in this regard.  I am <Col N="1674" /> not offering any opinion but I cite the case of what is known as &ldquo;The Thing&rdquo; on O'Connell Bridge.  It is one matter on which, perhaps, a number of citizens of Dublin city would have strong opinions.</P>
    <P>Travelling around the country from time to time, I have seen old machines scattered in places close to towns where machinery yards of the local authority are sited.  I remember some years ago in Castlebar noticing the very beautiful green there.  With the county council offices on your left&mdash; a stately row of houses&mdash;and the church on your extreme right, in between there is an old machinery yard of the local authority facing across the green.  Surely the local authority will not be free of any control in this matter. The county engineer, for instance, may decide to locate his machinery yards at any particular place while the citizens of the towns and county in general will be controlled by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest the Minister should reconsider this matter from the point of view of the desirability of uniformity of control.  The local authorities are every bit as liable to make just as many mistakes as the citizen and indeed they may offend just as much in regard to aesthetic taste as any citizen might.  I think a departure from principle is involved.  Is there any good reason, in principle, why the local authority should be exempted in these cases when the citizen is being confined?</P>

      <P>There is a great deal of what Deputy Jones has said that I would applaud.  Nevertheless, I do not think it adds up to the fact that the amendment should be accepted.  We could all criticise, and rightly so, what would appear to be the neglect of certain of our local authorities in matters such as these.</P>
      <P>Whether or not we criticise the planning authority in so far as planning control is concerned, as envisaged for the future, in each case, in respect of its own territory, the body will have designated and drawn up its own plan and, in due time, will have accepted that plan for a period of five years during which time it may and in fact must review it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1675" /> My inclination at first was to have them not excluded but I think the arguments against the principle underlying the amendment are pretty strong. Any of these planning authorities will have prepared their own plan and gone through the whole procedure of bringing their plan into operation, with its stated objective, and so on.  That we should then oblige that same planning authority to apply to themselves for permission to do this, that or the other, within the terms of the plan, does not make a great deal of sense when we realise that if they contravene the terms of their own plan they are in fact in trouble.  They may not contravene in any material or substantial way that which is laid down and accepted by them as their plan for a number of years ahead.  When we take that into consideration and realise that we are really excluding only the things that are permissible within the plan as adopted and published and known to public, we see the folly of having them apply to themselves formally and, in turn, just as formally, make a decision on their own application.  I do not think it adds anything to what is there, nor will it correct any waywardness that may be apparent in any of our local authorities in this or indeed in any other matter.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, a local authority, as distinct from the members of the public, are very much more controlled in what they may or may not do, as every Deputy knows, indeed to his annoyance at times.  There is very little a local authority can really effectively do in the sense of building, taking down or putting up anything without Ministerial sanction and Departmental approval, the provision of moneys, the approval of loans, agreement of plans, and so on.  Therefore, the dangers that would appear evident in the first instance of a council's doing the wrong thing without let or hindrance are very much less than would appear at first sight.</P>
    <P>I started off on this section very much of a mind with what was expressed by Deputy Jones.  However, when I fully considered it and heard all the arguments why we should <Col N="1676" /> exclude them from this unncessary waste of time of applying to themselves for permission to do something in their own area merely because we thought they should be obliged to go through the same performance as a member of the public and, in turn, that it might have the effect of preventing them from doing something that would be wrong, I felt that, if a council is bent on doing something that is not in conformity with their stated plan, if they are bent on doing something which would appear to be not in the best interests of their community, to oblige them to apply to themselves for permission to do that something will not prevent them from doing it.  They are the people who have a mind to do it.  They apply to themselves to do it in the belief that it is right.  Naturally, they will grant themselves permission if they thought it was right, to start off with.  So, it just does not make a great deal of sense.  That would be the rather nonsensical part of it, if you like.</P>
    <P>However, outside that, there are the safeguards I have mentioned.  They may not contravene, in a material sense, their own plan as adopted and passed by the elected members of the council and which would have been published three months prior to that for objections, and so on by the public.  Furthermore, inquiries and investigations would have been held before the plan was adopted.  Having adopted that plan, that local authority really may not infringe its terms.  If they should do, then they are open to <i>mandamus</i> proceedings by the Minister for Local Government or by any member of the public.  If that should not seem to be the handiest way of dealing with them, the Minister can always abolish them, if the matter were serious enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be quite clear about this.  Here we are talking about local authorities being allowed to run riot, to do something that is wrong. It is only if they are going wrong that any such query or question should <Col N="1677" /> arise on this section at all.  If they are wilfully going wrong, if they are materially going wrong, if they are going to do damage by going wrong and if <i>mandamus</i> proceedings would not seem to be the way of dealing with them or would not be the most effective way, in the last analysis, there would be the other way, namely, removal from office.  That is the entire background, middleground and foreground of the situation.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I started out with exactly the same views as Deputy Jones in the consideration of this Part of the Bill.  I finished up, as the House can hear, completely convinced and hoping to convince Deputy Jones and others that I was wrong and that, in fact, he now is wrong, and that we would be better to leave it as it is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly true, as the Minister says, and as I think Deputy Jones concedes, that in the general development of their own areas, local authorities will be guided and, I suppose one can say, strictly bound by the plan which has in fact already been approved by them&mdash;the general plan to provide for the development, planning and erection of houses, the construction of roads&mdash;all those things that would be covered by the general development of the town.</P>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the Minister's point of view that the members of the local authority, being representatives of the people, are the best judges as to whether or not the local authority through its officers was going to engage in work that would be offensive to the general character of the town or would cause inconvenience to the inhabitants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have a little more respect for the elected representatives of local authorities than the majority of people have but I can visualise work undertaken by officers of the local authority over which the members of the local authority cannot exercise an effective check.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me whether in respect of this section and the various subsections in it, the ratepayers or any individual ratepayer has the right to appeal to the <Col N="1678" /> Minister against a decision of a local authority, whether through the elected representatives or through its officials, to engage in a certain type of development? I have a sort of thing in mind.  I know a borough engineer who erected a waterpower pumping station in a most ridiculous place. Everybody agreed that it was in a ridiculous place.  It blotted out a view from a number of houses.  It looked ugly where it was.  It seemed as if the members of the local authority themselves had not any effective power to prevent the erection of the structure in that place and, indeed, had no effective power to insist that it be taken away, apart from the fact that it would cost too much.</P>
    <P>It is the small things that I would be interested in.  I am at one with the Minister when he says that the local authority will act generally in accordance with the plan which they themselves have adopted but, again, we know many examples of silly and stupid work done by officials of a local authority through the engineers. I know one borough engineer who decides, in order to save himself maintenance of roads, to make footpaths about five times the size they should be.  Is there an appeal against that sort of thing?</P>
    <P>Members of a local authority are voluntary representatives.  They cannot be expected to behave in the same way or to take the same day to day interest in the activities of the local authority as, say, Deputies are expected to take in respect of Departments. An individual may have a certain point of view that may not be represented by any of the members of the local authority.  That person's point of view should be heard.  If the local authority&mdash;in the majority of cases through its officers&mdash;decides to develop, to build, to change or to alter something in any way and a citizen takes offence at this or thinks it should not be done, has the citizen the right of appeal to the Minister or have any body of the ratepayers the right of appeal to the Minister against any work undertaken within the functional area of the local authority and to which they have a decided objection?</P>

      <P>I have always taken the line that the local authority should have as much power as possible but this is a time when I would change my course.  I would be in agreement with Deputy Corish.  In this Bill the Minister has brought in State companies such as the ESB, Bord na Móna and other such organisations who were previously exempted.  They are not exempted now.  The local authority would be exempted, meaning the local authority's engineers.  I agree with the Minister that from now on State companies such as Bord na Móna and the ESB should have to make application to the local authority because I have seen the frightful eyesores they were permitted to put up all over the country and which legally they could put up.</P>
      <P>I have seen the defacement of the beautiful quays of Waterford.  Alongside the town clock, there is an ugly ESB kiosk.  That is an example of a mistake being made by an engineer. A local authority engineer could make a similar mistake in future.  At the end of the quays in Waterford, there stands in all its beauty Reginald's Tower, one of our greatest ancient monuments. There is one of these ugly kiosks near it.  The Minister is ensuring in this Bill that the ESB will not be able to do such things in future and it would be a good thing if the Minister were to put into the Bill that local authorities themselves would not be allowed to deface the cities or the country with what they might consider to be useful structures.  This amendment is a good amendment and I would ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could clarify this a little.  It is proposed to exempt local authorities only in so far as their proposals do not conflict with their own accepted draft plan, as passed by them, consequent on its publication, and so on.  We are exempting them only in the case of matters which conform with what has been accepted by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this on an earlier occasion.  The only sensible arrangement is for them to have regard to what is in the plan.  The planning authority, apart from Ministerial control on money, loans and so on, are more restricted after the draft plan has been accepted than is the private individual, because the latter may appeal to the Minister.  There is no appeal where the planning authority is concerned.  If they wish to make an alteration or a change, they will have to go through the initial procedure all over again.  There is that fundamental difference.  The individual may in certain circumstances appeal to the Minister and his appeal may be upheld.  The planning authority has no right of appeal whatsoever.</P>
      <P>There would be no purpose in making provision for the planning authority to submit to themselves all over again a proposed departure from the plan already accepted.  Such an exercise would be an absolute waste of time.  There is enough time wasted at the moment and if we could drop some of the clutter, it would be no harm.  If the proposed development or construction conflicted with the plan, then the Minister or any member of the public may take <i>mandamus</i> proceedings restraining the planning authority from doing what is proposed. Making them subject to their own control in such a situation would amount to a mere formality because they would be asking themselves for permission.  It would not help in any way, but it would add to the paper work and that would be no great benefit.</P>

The Minister mentioned at the time that he was endeavouring to preserve the beauty of Georgian or other period houses, squares, and so on.  We all agreed with him.  We suggested from this side of the House that we had no objection to his putting it into the Bill that these places be defined, that such places in this city be scheduled by the Dublin Corporation and that the same done in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and <Col N="1683" /> other places.  We were legislating for the whole country and nobody can alter any structure or any building or any part of it without going to the local authority.  I pointed out to the Minister that this would create a whole jungle of applications and a great deal of bad relations between the public and the local authority.  Would there be any danger that we are overlapping here and that we are legislating for the whole country again?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this is the appropriate stage to mention again a matter that I think has been already mentioned, that is, the protection of venerable buildings from disfigurement by an irresponsible owner.  The procedure envisaged in the Bill so far is to make general regulations subject to certain exceptions.  These general regulations are designed to apply everywhere a planning authority exists.  I wonder are we travelling the right <Col N="1687" /> road in this matter?  I understand the practice on the Continent, certainly in France and Italy and, I think, in Germany, has been for the planning authority to take the initiative and say to the property owner: &ldquo;Your house or building is a historic one and for that reason, alterations may not be carried out in the fabric of it without prior authority from the planning authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Unless such a notice is served, there are no restrictions on the adaptations of buildings.  I believe some provision similar to what we have in mind here operates in Britain.  Certain architects of standing there carried out operations in defiance of the planning regulations and were challenged in court where it was alleged by the planning authority that the alterations they had carried out by way of painting and decoration on the facade of the building had disfigured the building.</P>
      <P>They went into court and said that that was a matter of opinion and that they thought their opinion was better than that of the authority and that they staked their reputation against the authority's reputation.  The planning authority had to put up their architect and the court listened.  The court also heard the independent architect and finally the verdict of the court was that the independent architect's opinion was a better opinion than that of the planning authority.</P>
      <P>I wonder if it might not have been wiser&mdash;perhaps the Minister would give it further consideration&mdash;to abandon this whole procedure of forbidding anybody to make a change in the facade of his premises unless with the prior consent of the planning authority and to put on the planning authority the obligation of scheduling historic buildings which are subject to control of this character, leaving everybody else free to make any changes they like?  Perhaps before we finally dispose of this section, the Minister might say a short word on that question?</P>

      <P>This matter came before us previously on another section. I wish to support Deputy Dillon's <Col N="1688" /> request that these buildings should be scheduled or zoned.  I told the Minister on a previous occasion it was not just a case of advertising the fact that such a street was zoned, but that notice should be served by the local authority by registered post on the owners of such property telling them that under this Act they cannot make any alterations to the fronts of their buildings.  I pointed out that we are actually legislating for the whole country, that anybody in a town or village who wanted to change the front of his house would have to apply to the local authority. We appealed to the Minister not to legislate in general, but to legislate in particular.  He told us the idea was to preserve the great Georgian squares and terraces in various parts of the country.  We fully agree with that.  I again support Deputy Dillon's suggestion that these places should be scheduled or zoned by the local authority.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 10, line 23, after &ldquo;High Court&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or in the case of land the rateable valuation of which does not exceed £60 at the option of the owner of the land the Circuit Court&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this section as it stands, there is a right of appeal to the High Court. If the right of appeal is only to the High Court, I suggest you are limiting the right of appeal by reason of the cost involved.  An appeal to the High Court can be costly.  The people in rural areas are often concerned with small quantities of land.  We must remember the type of small holding we have and the number of them. Although these people may have a legitimate cause of appeal, the limiting <Col N="1689" /> factor may be finance if the appeal is to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court generally operates within the county area, which is the area envisaged as the planning authority area under the Bill. Generally the principal office of the county council is in the principal town of the administrative area of the local authority.  It is there the Circuit Court sits.  Therefore, the individual is not put to as much expense in prosecuting his appeal there as if the appeal lies to the High Court.  It might be understandable in the case of large property, where the valuation would be higher than the figure we have mentioned, that it would be desirable for an individual to make his appeal to the High Court; but in the generality of cases a more reasonable approach would be to allow the individual the right of appeal to the Circuit Court. It would avoid expense on the appellant and, equally, it would avoid expense on the planning authority since its officials would be close to the court on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister this is a reasonable thing to do, to give not alone the right of appeal to the individual but to make it possible for him to prosecute his appeal without any undue burden on him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the High Court is the appropriate court to deal effectively with the matters likely to arise under this section because, in the vast majority of cases, they will be dealing with points of law.  That the appeal should be to the High Court is only in keeping with precedent.  A good example of precedent in that regard is the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  Furthermore, the High Court decision&mdash;whatever it might be&mdash;would be binding throughout the country.  We do not envisage an appeal to the High Court merely for the sake of an appeal, but rather to ensure that we get an authoritative and uniform interpretation of the law.  I am completely in the hands of my legal advisers who tell me that it is the appropriate court in such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the quoting of precedents for going to the High Court is, in <Col N="1690" /> addition to my advisers' advice, secure and good ground as to why we should make it and keep it the High Court rather than the Circuit Court, even though the costs would be less in the lower court.  The question of costs alone is not of the greatest importance in these cases. Decisions from the High Court can determine for a long time to come certain other cases that come to our eyes.  If we get a clearly defined judgment from the High Court in a particular case, it is likely to settle for a considerable time to come other cases of a similar nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is an inappropriate approach to the question? The Minister talks about matters defined by judicial decisions which could be used to define future cases. He says that here the words have been defined by the High Court and are therefore useful in that we have a definition of them, but to my mind, it is all a matter of how you approach this question.  Surely we must approach it from the point of view of the person who feels he has a grievance because the Minister has given a decision which the person feels is contrary to justice? That person wants access to the courts on the ground that our system of government provides an independent judiciary to stand as arbiter between the humblest citizen and the most powerful Department of State so as to ensure that the humblest citizen will get his rights under the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we in the House want to say that if a large property owner or a very small property owner wants to appeal against the Minister, though the Minister has no hard feelings, he insists that this should be determined to the public advantage and that we are going to throw the appellant into the High Court because in that way we will get a definitive and final determination of the law.  That is not the purpose of subsection (2) of Section 5.  Its purpose is to ensure that an ordinary person will have access to an independent judiciary when he is dissatisfied with an executive decision. It is always open to the Minister, if he feels the appeal raises a matter of substance, <Col N="1691" /> to appeal to the High Court from the Circuit Court decision, and a reasonable Minister will not exercise that right to the detriment or disadvantage of an appellant unless he feels there is an important point of law involved and about which there is some ambiguity.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible for the Minister to say in the High Court that though he has the duty of appealing, he does not want the costs of the appeal to be borne by the appellant.  In that manner the appellant could be relieved of the burden of costs.  It is quite open under the amendment proposed by us for a large property developer, or a big corporation dealing with a large block of property, to initiate proceedings in the High Court so as to get the matter settled expeditiously and authoritatively.  If, on the other hand, the grievance arises in Ahabawn in County Monaghan, or in Belmullet in County Mayo, it seems unreasonable to suggest that proceedings by way of appeal should either be initiated in the Four Courts or in the High Court on circuit which, I understand, sits two or three times a year.  In addition, I think it is true to say that one must go into the High Court with senior and junior counsel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Two senior and one junior.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  Surely one senior?  Manifestly, that is not a desirable practice to impose without option on ordinary appellants, and I suggest to the Minister that the sensible course is to accept our amendment in the light of the fact that where the Minister thinks it is necessary, for the purpose of due administration of the law, he has the alternative of going on to the High Court and, within his discretion, bearing such part of the expenses and costs as he thinks would be fair and equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants this provision in operation, I think it would be preferable that there should be no appeal from the Minister's decision, because with the exception of fairly wealthy property owners, most ordinary owners could not afford in <Col N="1692" /> the first instance to employ two senior and one junior counsel.  Despite what Deputy Dillon has said on that point, my information is that it is necessary to have two senior counsel in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Give us a chance.  It is one senior counsel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My information comes from somebody who claims knowledge of the subject.  Quite apart from that, however, it would be quite impossible for most ordinary people to have access to the High Court.  For that reason, I would urge the Minister to make it an appeal to the Circuit Court.  As Deputy Dillon has said, if the Minister is dissatisfied with that decision, he has the right of appeal to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be clearly understood that these appeals to the High Court or the Circuit Court could arise only after the Minister has given his decision and when that decision is questioned as to its validity under the law.  This procedure is, in fact, in operation in regard to the functions of my Department for land acquisition by compulsory purchase procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a person has to appeal under a somewhat similar set of circumstances to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  In fact, you can have quite small parcels of land taken from small landowners under the operation of the compulsory purchase procedure.  In such a case, after that decision has been arrived at, it is only on an alleged error in law made by the Minister that an appeal will lie.  It is not an appeal in the general sense; it is an appeal on an alleged error in law made by the Minister who came to the decision.  As I say, a compulsory purchase acquisition appeal is to the High Court on much the same sort of grounds.  Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, it is also the High Court to which this type of appeal may be sent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked whether an appeal against the decision of the arbitrator went to the Circuit Court.  It goes to the High Court. I do not agree with the idea behind the amendment that it should be recourse to the Circuit Court rather than the High Court, and to make the approach to the Circuit Court open only to those people whose rateable valuation does not exceed £60.  I take it that is because the Circuit Court has jurisdiction only up to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely if we were to consider acceptance of that approach, it would be very difficult to determine how we should set about deciding on the land?  Would it be land proposed to be taken or used?  Would it be the whole of the rateable valuation of the parcel of land, or part of the <Col N="1694" /> total valuation of the land holding? Would that conform to the £60?  That might be putting to one side the benefit that might flow from trying to get in under the £60 umbrella of the Circuit Court jurisdiction, and particularly trying to get in under it with a view to going easy on people who you feel can least afford to have recourse to the court or any of the courts?  It is not at all clear that the amendment would, in fact, relieve those who can least afford it.  There is no assurance that that would be so.  Nor is the point about the land clear.  Would it be all the land, the whole farm?  Would it be on a rated certificate or a demand note, or what would it be?  That does not seem to be clear.  It would seem that if we were to give serious consideration to the matter that, in itself, would create untold and unknown difficulties which we might not be able to get over.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, I should like to hear more reasons why it is felt that the Circuit Court should now be the court for this type of case, whereas in the past on matters just as serious, if not more serious, questions of law were determined by appeal to the High Court.  My advice is very strongly that the High Court is the appropriate court for such definitive decisions and questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all a matter of approach to this whole question.  Are we not all agreed that, as a general rule, where the freedom of the property of an individual citizen is concerned, <i>vis-à-vis</i> State action, it is eminently desirable to interpose an accessible and independent judiciary so that we can say to the humblest citizen of the State: &ldquo;You are in exactly the same position as the President or the Taoiseach or any other person in the State, because if anyone tries to infringe your rights in your person, liberty or property, you can walk into the courts, unattended by counsel or solicitor or anyone else&mdash;that is, in theory&mdash;and claim the protection of the court&rdquo;?  The nearer we get to that ideal situation I think the better our legislation will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not much use saying that in <Col N="1695" /> theory you can walk into the Four Courts and hail the Chief Justice and say: &ldquo;I want justice.&rdquo;  In fact that is possible, but there is no use in telling a man in Belmullet he can do that. What we want to do is bring that remedy effectively and honestly within his reach.  Here the issue to be determined is whether a development is or is not a development within the meaning of the Act, or whether it is or is not an exempted development.  I suppose I might say that in 98 per cent of the cases, there will be no difficulty and I think it is probably true to say of the two per cent who will dissent from the proposition of the planning authorities that they are cranky men.  One of the glories of a free society is that you are entitled to be cranky in a free society.</P>
    <P>I submit to the House that the whole concern of legislation ought to be to ensure, in so far as it is practicably possible, consistent with the public welfare, that our neighbours will not be left under a sense of grievance.  A cantankerous man may feel he has a grievance and appeal to the Minister. The Minister may decide the planning authority is right and the aggrieved person is wrong.</P>
    <P>If I am Minister for Local Government and the complainant is a cranky supporter of Deputy Burke, he will be around to Deputy Burke in the morning to say that &ldquo;James Dillon is after doing me down because I voted for Deputy Burke and said so at the last election&rdquo;.  If the Minister is Minister for Local Government and the cranky complainant is a supporter of mine in Monaghan, I will have a letter the following morning saying it is well known that he was turned down because he stood at the table for me at the last election.  If I am in a position to say: &ldquo;There is no need to suffer under this alleged injustice; if you are not satisfied with the Minister's decision, you can go to the Circuit Court in Monaghan&rdquo;, and if Deputy Burke can say: &ldquo;You can go to the Circuit Court wherever it sits for Balbriggan&rdquo;&mdash; whether his complainant is a spinster or a widow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Justice will be done and Deputy Burke or I have the right to say to the complainant: &ldquo;The courts are there available to you.&rdquo; I think that that is what is important&mdash; not that the law should be authoritatively defined for inclusion in the files of the Department of Local Government or the planning authorities of the country at large.</P>
      <P>I can see, from the point of view of an administrator anxious to get an Act to work smoothly, the allure of the proposition that any net point which is taken on appeal from the Minister should go to the High Court where there will be a written judgment.  I can see the duplicators going into work in the Custom House and the note: &ldquo;Let a copy of that go to every planning authority in the country to be put on their file.&rdquo;  I admit that if I were in charge of town planning in all its complexity in the country, that is the sort of thing I would yearn for.  But I am not.  I am in this House and I submit we should be thinking of the cantankerous man and woman in the country.  Will they feel that substantial justice has been done?</P>
      <P>Looking on it from that point of view, I suggest we can serve both purposes effectively by allowing access to the Circuit Court.  If the appellant first goes to the Circuit Court and the Minister wants a definite decision on the net point raised he can always go from the Circuit Court to the High Court on appeal.</P>
      <P>The Minister raises the point as to whether the drafting of this amendment is or is not defective.  Of course, it probably is defective.  All amendments submitted by an Opposition may have in them defects of uncertainty, or what not, in the eyes of the official draftsman.  That is what he is for.  He takes long enough, very often, to come up with his own version of the Bills that come before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any reasonable amendment the Minister may suggest to the terms of our amendment, to make it more precise or effective, will be most acceptable. The net point is whether we can <Col N="1697" /> devise a means by which a small appellant from a ministerial decision can go in the first instance to the Circuit Court.  Draft your amendment any way you like, if you can devise a plan by which that can be done.  We hold strongly that that ought to be done, not by any means discounting the weight of the view expressed by the Minister that in matters of this kind, if the matter is one of substance, what you want is a High Court decision which can be circulated amongst all planning authorities as the law. I suggest that in 95 per cent of the appeals from his decision, no legal point of substance will be raised.  If one man thinks the case can be made that this is an exempted matter, or is not a development at all, as a general rule, as the Minister well knows, in the vast majority of cases, the Circuit Court will sustain the decision he has already given.</P>

The day when that can no longer happen, the day when a small person can be brushed aside and told: &ldquo;Your business is of such little consequence that other affairs must take precedence even though you suffer minor injustice&rdquo; will be a disaster for the country.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that you ought to give access to the closest available court to a small person who is concerned to contest the Minister's decision.  The Minister may say to me: &ldquo;If you say that, why do you not give them access to the District Court?&rdquo; Under our system of law as it is administered, the District Court is debarred from determining questions involving matters of title.  It is universally understood throughout the country that in a matter involving title, the lowest jurisdiction to which you can appeal is the Circuit Court. Our suggestion is that in a matter of this kind access to the lowest court of competent jurisdiction should be available to a person who wishes to appeal to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to Deputy Dillon.  I am at one with him on the point that every citizen should have the right to appeal to a court.  Suppose the Deputy were a member of a local authority and he were being pushed around by A, B, and C, as Deputy Clinton and I are being pushed around in County Dublin by people who want houses, I wonder what he would say.  We spend not alone days but weeks going around the district endeavouring to see how something can be done.  Let us say the engineer in the town planning office has decided that a certain place is the most suitable place and we agree to that.  We go to housing meeting after housing meeting and we find that John Jones, for instance, refuses to give the land, notwithstanding the fact that we are all for giving him the market value of his land. There may be 20, 40 or 50 applicants for houses in the district, all needing to be housed.  A compulsory acquisition order is made and then the owner of the land goes to the courts.  That <Col N="1700" /> entails another delay of a year or perhaps longer.</P>
      <P>In this Parliament, we must weigh what is justice.  I agree that the owner of the land should have the right to go to court but is it just that when he is paid the market value in compensation for his property and a number of people are waiting to be housed, matters should be held up in that way? That position has obtained in respect of the city and county of Dublin. Court proceedings were involved.  This is a very serious matter.  While I am in agreement with Deputy Dillon in regard to the constitutional rights of every citizen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there are two points which can be argued.  Where the common good is concerned, when the individual gets reasonable market value in compensation for his property, in my estimation, that is justice.  I believe in leaving an option in the Bill.  The experience in Dublin Corporation especially is that acquisition is too slow.  It is very difficult to proceed with the building of houses because of this difficulty.  In respect of the city and county of Dublin, acquisition is held up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I am merely giving the example of the slowness of acquisition and the difficulties experienced by local authorities.  Even the Minister has often been blamed here for not getting ahead with the building of houses in this city.  We are up against the position that for two and even three years, we have been trying to secure sites in County Dublin and it has been seven years in the case of the city of Dublin.  I am referring now to the taking over of derelict property.  This is a very serious matter.  As members of public bodies, we have had this experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far, in dealing with this amendment, the Minister has not given even one good reason for not accepting it.  He has complained that the amendment as worded is open to a number of interpretations but at least he will agree and accept that the intention is quite clear, namely, to give the same right to the small property owner, the poor man, as is given to the big property developer.  It is no great hardship on a big property developer to have to go to the High Court but the Minister has not told us what he will do about the poorer, small property owner who feels aggrieved and who, because of lack of financial resources is denied the opportunity of recourse to the appeals machinery provided in the Bill.  It is a serious thing to say that such a man must go to the High Court while there is no indication that his expenses will be met, even in part.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke dealt with the difficulties experienced in County Dublin in the matter of land acquisition.  I agree.  I think this amendment would probably expedite acquisition.  Circuit Court proceedings would certainly be much more expeditious than High Court proceedings.  When this Planning Bill becomes law and when throughout the country there will be development plans, it is normal to expect that there will be a substantial number of appeals under the legislation.  This Bill cannot be compared with existing Acts where it is provided that an aggrieved person must go to the High Court because in the case of those Acts the number of appeals would be considerably less than the number that might normally be expected to arise under this new legislation which will be applicable to the country as a whole and to quite an amount of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few misunderstandings about the whole purpose behind this section.  The first thing that was brought out here very clearly by Deputy Dillon is that where the State is carrying out some operation or other, it is only right that the court&mdash;the independent judiciary is the way he put it&mdash;should be interposed between the public and the State institution. <Col N="1702" /> That is all very well as a sort of platitude but it does not hold water strictly in this case, for the simple reason that the public we are dealing with here will have been dealt with by their local authority.  It is the local authority on the advice of their executive, that will have come to a decision with which an individual property owner may disagree and, arising from the terms of this Bill, the property owner so aggrieved may then appeal to the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government then, with the assistance of his advisers, both legal and technical, will after due consideration and having heard all that there is to be said, both from the council's point of view and the individual's point of view, reach a decision on the appeal.  If that decision is to be further queried, it is not on whether it is a good decision in the sense of whether the man feels he has got justice or has not got justice, whether he has got his way or has not got his way; it is purely on the question of whether the Minister for Local Government in exercising his rights in determining that appeal has acted in accordance with the law, and the strict letter of the law.  What would go to the High Court in such a case would be only the question as to whether the Minister could be said to have made an error in so far as the law was concerned. That would be after the legal advice the Minister would have available to him and only consequent upon the local authority also having made a similar decision, which they would have made in these circumstances with the advice of their legal adviser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the two sets of legal advisers, completely unconnected and unrelated, would arrive at a similar wrong conclusion is not likely to arise very often and if and when it should arise, the court which is by precedent established as that which gives the definitive verdict on matters of law is the High Court, by precedent established as such, and I see no real good reason why we should depart from it and step back to the Circuit Court which we have been told, on the one hand, would be less costly than it is alleged High Court proceedings would be and, on <Col N="1703" /> the other hand, as we are told at the heel of the hunt of this discussion, would be much more expeditious.</P>
    <P>I think it was my colleague, Deputy Burke, who put this into Deputy Dillon's mind by mentioning a case in the courts that lasted for seven years.  Actually that case was before the Circuit Court, not the High Court, and it was not, of course, the court which was at fault.  Several adjournments were sought.  Now this will not be a suit brought by the people; it will be an appeal to the Minister from a decision of the local authority and the decision of the Minister can be queried only on a point of law.  The £60 valuation limit in the case of the Circuit Court does not create a situation in which those who are poor go to the Circuit Court while those who might be described as rich go to the High Court.  A person with a much lower valuation than £60 might in fact have to go to the High Court.  Deputy Tully made a very sensible suggestion, but it is one which is contrary to both the section and the proposed amendment. He suggested we cut out the two courts altogether and allow the Minister's decision to be final.  There is a good deal to be said for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, the Minister has over-simplified his argument.  We have defined development as the carrying out of any works on, in or under land, or the making of any material change in the use of any structure or other land.  We have been discussing exempted developments here this morning.  Now a local authority may decide that a certain thing is a development.  Individuals affected by that decision may feel aggrieved.  They can appeal to the Minister.  The Minister can decide to send down one of his officials to take oral evidence.  That official will come down to say, Limerick and hear the views expressed. He will report back to the Minister and the Minister will decide on the evidence submitted to him.  The individuals may still feel aggrieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This might be a case of a small portion of land and a direction from the local authority in regard to the <Col N="1704" /> use of that land or a development proposed in respect of it.  Nominally, the Minister is the deciding authority on appeal.  Is the Minister, in fact, the deciding authority?  He will be guided and fortified by the evidence collected for him by his official.  The individuals concerned, still feeling aggrieved after the Minister's decision, want to appeal from that.  I do not want the terms &ldquo;rich&rdquo; and &ldquo;poor&rdquo; to create the impression that we are dealing here simply with money value.  I am concerned with the quantity and quality of the land an individual may hold.</P>
    <P>The generality of holdings in this country are very small.  Because of that, the valuations are small.  A small portion of land might be very valuable in an urban area and a large tract of land might be relatively of very little value in a rural area.  I am thinking of the individual whose valuation does not exceed £60.  In Limerick there are 22,000 holdings roughly, 17,500 of which are under £15 valuation. In Limerick, 17,500 landowners would be affected by the decisions of the planning authority.  Any one of them might feel aggrieved and, instead of having recourse to the Circuit Court in Limerick, where the officials of the county council have their offices and the court sits at regular intervals, he would be compelled to come here to Dublin to the High Court or wait for the High Court on circuit.  Perhaps the amendment is ambiguous but I hope we have conveyed to the Minister what it is we want to protect: the right of the individual in the first instance, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the decision of the planning authority, which affects his property.  He can appeal to the Minister but, even after the Minister has decided, he may still have a sense of grievance.  It is then he should have the right of recourse to the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jones may feel I oversimplified but he, in turn, has oversimplified even more.  Only one per cent would ever be involved in something that might be a point of law and, if it is a point of law, that one per cent would have the right to go to court.  The fact that a person <Col N="1705" /> merely felt aggrieved would not necessarily constitute a legal basis for a court action if, in fact, the decision conformed with the law.  It is only if a legal point is involved that an aggrieved person can have recourse to the courts.  That would be the only reason for going to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Why would he not have the right of appeal to the court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because that is the way it is.  That is the way it is in the Land Acquisition Bill and also the other Bill I mentioned, the Social Welfare Bill; in other words, the effective appeal is to the Minister for Local Government against a decision of the local planning authority.  It is only in the case of a point of law arising from a decision that there is an appeal to the High Court or any other court.  It it not on what the aggrieved person feels that an appeal can be made.  If he goes to his solicitor, he might be told he had a good case in respect of a point of law but the number of these cases will be infinitesimal, despite the fact that there will be quite a large number of appeals to the Minister.  Under the Social Welfare Act, where there is this recourse to the High Court on points of law, going back to 1952, I do not think any case has arisen but certainly there would be very few.</P>

      <P>The local authority makes a decision and the person concerned makes an appeal to the Minister who turns it down.  His solicitor tells him that legally the Department and the Minister are wrong.  However, the Minister now puts this very high fence up to him, that he must in such a case go to the High Court.  Immediately the man drops out because he is <Col N="1706" /> afraid to go to the High Court on account of the cost.  In the amendment we mention a valuation of £60.  That was not just for the sake of the poor man as against the rich man because a limit of £60 will not define whether a person is rich or poor.  It was put in because only up to that amount would it be legal for the Circuit Court to give a decision.  This is a very reasonable amendment.  If a man is poor enough, we should legislate for him. Even though he might be aggrieved, he would be afraid to face the High Court but he would not be afraid to face the Circuit Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of costs, I should have said that from similar cases in the High Court in the past, all the indications are&mdash;although it is not obliged to do so&mdash;that the High Court does take into consideration the wealth, or lack of wealth, of the appellant regardless of the actual outcome of the case.  That has generally been the case, that they are going in that direction.  In regard to this Bill when such cases come up they will, I feel sure, although I cannot say more than that, they will take the means of the person concerned into consideration and allow him the costs even if he loses the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the person had not the right of appeal to the courts.  I should like to clarify my position in this regard.  In the Town and Regional Planning Act of 1934 and the amending Act of 1939, there were three forms of appeal allowable. First, the resolution of a local authority which decided to make a planning scheme under Section 29 of the 1934 Act was subject to a confirmation order made by the Minister which was laid before each House of the Oireachtas. In addition to that, the property owner affected by a planning scheme had a right under Section 31 to apply to the High Court for an annulment of the whole of the planning scheme or part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also a right of appeal under Section 5 of the 1939 Act for the annulment of a resolution by a local authority to make a planning scheme upon the grounds that the <Col N="1707" /> resolution was invalid.  This particular relief would not in the normal course be very important but once the planning authority have resolved to make a planning scheme, then there could be no dealing with property without first obtaining the permission of the planning authority.  That was provided for in Sections 57 and 58 of the 1934 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 59 of the 1934 Act provided that any person aggrieved by the decisions of a planning authority during the period of interim control, that is, during the period between the passing of a resolution to make a planning scheme and the coming into operation of the planning scheme, could appeal to the Minister and the Minister could confirm, revoke or alter the decisions of the planning authority as he thought proper.</P>
    <P>That is the only right of appeal in relation to the granting or refusal of permission by a planning authority which was vested in the Minister for Local Government in the 1934 and 1939 Acts.  Once the planning scheme was made, the right of appeal against decisions of the planning authority was to the District Court.  Section 45 provided that where a planning scheme contains a provision conferring on the planning authority power to regulate and control the design, colour or material of structures any person aggrieved by a decision of the planning authority could appeal from such decision of a District Justice, and the District Justice had power to confirm vary, reverse or annual such decision.</P>
    <P>There was power in subsection (2) of Section 45 of the 1934 Act to set up a special tribunal of persons of special knowledge or practical experience, and while that tribunal could exercise the same powers as were vested in the District Justice, every decision of this special tribunal was appealable to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Section 52 provided that whereever a planning authority had served on any person a notice of their intention to exercise in relation to any structure or land the power conferred upon them by Part 6 of the 1934 Act that person could appeal to the District <Col N="1708" /> Justice for an order quashing the notice.  Here the Minister says that the person may not have an appeal to the courts on this type of grievance.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, an appeal to the courts is provided for in Sections 5, 21, 34, 51 and 81.  I shall deal with these later. As against the five occasions in this Bill when a person may appeal to the courts to assert certain rights, we have a large number of sections where the appeal lies only to the Minister. Only because the Minister says that the individual has nothing to appeal about do I raise the point at this stage.  I hold that in dealing with the question of development the right of the individual to his property and to whatever use he might desire to make of it may be interfered with by the planning authority.  In Sections 18, 26, 27, 29, 30, 33, 36, 37, 44, 45, 46, 48, 56, 65, 83, 86 and 87, we are told the appeal is to the Minister.</P>
    <P>On this section with which we are dealing at present, if the question arises, if the Minister lays down the principle that the person has nothing to go to the courts about, I cannot see the validity of his argument.  The Minister says this is a factual decision of the Minister but that decision affects the individual in the first instance.  He feels that he has been interfered with in the right to use his property in a way in which he thinks is not at variance with development.  I think this is the first instance where a person's right to seek the protection of the courts in this matter is being challenged.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say it was in the 1934 and 1939 Acts.  That is why I referred to both because in both cases there was only a very limited appeal to the Minister.  We are now reversing the process so that the appeal rests in the main with the Minister and not the courts.  I believe my point is valid that the development plan made by an authority may aggrieve somebody; that the Minister's determination on that may still leave the individual with a grievance and the logical thing to do is to allow the individual access to the courts at that stage.  I suggest that he should have access to the Circuit Court in his own area where the valuation <Col N="1709" /> of the land is not above the sum laid down for that court.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 10, line 24, to delete &ldquo;six weeks&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The appeal here may be taken any time within six weeks.  As the section now stands, it states:</P>
      <P>Where a decision is given under this section, an appeal to the High Court from the decision may be taken at any time within the period of six weeks after the giving of the decision or such longer period as the High Court may in any particular case allow.</P>
      <P>We suggest the period should be extended to three months and we think that is not unreasonable.  Circumstances can easily be envisaged in which six weeks can be a short time. For instance, a solicitor acting for an individual could become ill or the client himself may fall sick.  Equally, there could be a question of death. There could be a question arising of the determination of next-of-kin or administration.  I think I am right in saying that in regard to the acquisition of land, in the Housing Acts and even in the Derelict Sites Act, the term was three months.  I should like to know why the Minister feels he should move from that precedent of three months to six weeks?  I suggest this amendment would help us to feel that Parliamentary democracy, as it operates here, is an effective instrument and that when a reasonable point of view is put forward, we should legislate for every case that could conceivably arise.  I have instanced such cases and I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The consideration that guided us here was the Housing Act of 1931 and the Act of 1932.  Section 17 of the 1931 Act provides for six weeks and a somewhat similar section in the 1932 Act actually reduced that time to three weeks.  In the Local Government Act of 1960, land acquisition <Col N="1710" /> procedures were more or less consolidated and brought into line, all of them with a period of six weeks. Really, that is our precedent and that answers the question as to why we are going from three months to six weeks. Six weeks has been the established period.  However, I am not terribly concerned about this, and I will not fight with anybody who wants to make it two months or three months, but I would not go beyond three months.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer again to the fact that we seem to be by-passing the rights of the individual in regard to his property.  We seem to have here a clash of opinions as to whether or not a person has the right of appeal to the courts.  The Minister advances the idea that this appeal of the individual shall only lie to the High Court in cases where the Minister is argued to have been wrong in the interpretation of the law as it applies in this Bill.  He does not envisage that a person will have the right of appeal in regard to being aggrieved by the proposed development or curtailment of development.  This departure is one that we do not accept.  We on this side have already mentioned that we do not for a moment accept the principle that a person should be limited in his right of appeal as to whether the Minister contravened the law in respect of what is or what is not development, in regard to whether something should be exempted or not exempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe the substantial right of the individual to have recourse to the courts of the country to determine whether in fact his property, or the use of his property, is being affected in a serious manner by the action of the <Col N="1713" /> planning authority is a fundamental right of a property owner.  You cannot contravene the fundamental rights of the individual in regard to the use of his property.  Yet that is what we are doing here.  I do not wish at this stage to deal further with it, beyond saying this is a section that could find itself, on its present interpretation, declared as unconstitutional.  It is moving dangerously close to a denial of the rights of the individual to exercise his rights to the use of his property.  It is a principle we should be very slow to impose on the individual.  We say it is a very dangerous principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to associate myself very emphatically with what Deputy Jones has said.  We have provided under the Constitution the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  We have made provision in addition, in relation to title, that the District Court shall not have jurisdiction, that where a question of title arises in the District Court, there shall be a stay for decision by the higher courts.  Now, Section 5 of this Bill draws a distinction between the individual and the State in matters relating to trespass.  Anybody can go in on another person's property to prevent that person doing what he has a legal right to do, and if he persists in that, the appropriate remedy is an action for trespass.  That action should lie in the first court of competent jurisdiction to which the complainant has access.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why we should have Circuit Courts or High Courts at all in this country according to the implications of this section.  It would be perfectly permissible to say the only court operating would be the High Court.  But the Oireachtas has long ago decided that if substantial justice is to be done, courts of competent jurisdiction must be more readily available than the High Court normally is.  We have tolerated the scale of costs obtaining in the High Court only because the vast bulk of the people transact their business in the Circuit Court and the District Court, where the burden of costs is relatively low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any conceivable reason <Col N="1714" /> why, if the Executive is the trespasser on my property by controlling or saying I cannot do this or that in relation to the use of my own property, I should not have the same remedy against that trespass by the Executive as I have against my neighbour?  The case made by the Minister is that that would not be convenient.  If he only got a Circuit Court decision, that would be of relatively little value for the purpose of determining the true meaning of the law.  I want to put it to the Minister that that is not the important thing at all.</P>
    <P>If in any case a point of substantial or general application of the law arises the Minister should have the right of appeal to the High Court for an authoritative decision, if he thinks it is in the public interest to do so, but ordinarily the man who believes a trespass is being attempted upon him by the Executive should have access to the nearest court of competent jurisdiction.  If we depart from that principle&mdash;and I warn the House that I have seen this happen time and time again&mdash;we will be told next year or the year after in connection with some other Bill that there is provision for further exemption for the Executive from the ordinary process of law.</P>
    <P>It will be said this is being done only in accordance with the precedent established in Section 5 of the Local Government (Development and Planning) Act, 1962 which was, it can be said, exhaustively discussed in Dáil Éireann.  It would be perfectly true that it was exhaustively discussed but what will not be in the minds of Deputies is that the discussion consisted of loud and emphatic dissent from everybody in the House, bar the Government Party.  This will be dressed up with all the grandeur of a precedent established by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I press on the Minister, not the detailed terms of our amendment but the principle of it, which is simply that if a person has such a grievance as is envisaged by the appeal procedure provided in this subsection, he should be given access to the most proximate court of competent jurisdiction available to him, the Circuit Court.  Do not let us <Col N="1715" /> accept the illusory belief that this is a matter of relevant insignificance.  It is not.  It goes to the root of the whole question as to whether we believe, as between the Executive and the private individual in this country, the independent judiciary should be effectively interposed.  It is no use giving people theoretical remedies if they are not enforceable.</P>

      <P>The only privilege they have is that they accept responsibility to take up the barley crop at a certain time and a certain price.  Not only do <Col N="1720" /> they take on that responsibility but they have the further responsibility of having the price at which they will dispose of it to the user until the following summer determined for them. If you take the price of £23 5s. at 31st December, and see the scale of prices at which they must dispose of the barley until the following harvest, you will see that that aspect of the problem has to be considered too.  I have said before that I am personally satisfied that this is the best arrangement that can be made.  Of course, you will always meet the person who will say: &ldquo;Why should I not have the opportunity of importing maize?&rdquo; But to give them that opportunity of importing maize without accepting a much more costly responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy wants me to repeat it?  In the first place, there is one rural area in West Cork that has not been developed, that is, Dunbeacon.  The work on that will be completed in about a month.  In the remaining areas, the ESB have sent out canvassers to get agreement from as many persons as possible to take supply so that prices will be as low as possible and there will be the fewest number of extra service charges and so that the work can be done at once.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained on several occasions that as a result of the passing of the last Electricity Supply Bill, the subsidy was raised.  It placed the consumers not yet joined to the network in the position that there are 77,000 out of 112,000 consumers in the developed areas who can secure connection with the network without paying any extra service charge and 23,000 can secure it by paying up to 50 per cent of the extra service charge.  Then there are some people for whom the cost for connection would be as much as £200.  As the cost of joining those people to the network was regarded by the Government as almost prohibitive, they were offered, as an alternative, a bottled gas subsidy.  In about 10 or 15 years, we expect that 95 to 96 per cent of all rural consumers will have joined the network, which we regard as satisfactory by comparison with other European countries.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that in West Cork we did not hear about this Section 15 (1) until the early part of this year?  To quote a specific case, a small farmer with a total valuation, land and buildings, of £7 who during the course of the previous year received £150 from the creamery in respect of milk supplied, was debarred from benefit even though he has a wife and six children and who could easily manage his small farm and take employment if it were available for him.  Does the Minister think it is fair to deprive this person of his rightful benefit when he was qualified and when no further employment was available to him from the local council?  Does he think it fair to deprive this man of benefit by invoking Section 15 (1)?  This is a small farmer with a valuation of a few pounds who has five poor quality cows.

I presume the answer in respect of the years 1958, 1959, 1960 and 1961 would be that there were no cases. The information would be quite easily ascertainable in the Minister's Department. It is when the benefit was increased this year that this section was invoked and I believe wrongly invoked. The Minister will also agree that there is not uniformity of application. I do not know who is responsible in the Department&mdash;possibly it is not the Minister, personally&mdash;for invoking such regulations to deprive such a person as I have mentioned of his rightful entitlement to benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the specific question of access to the most proximate court of competent jurisdiction, I think there arises on this section also a further question.  Under this section, the appellant appears to be confined to the net legal question as to whether the Minister has correctly advised himself as to whether the work contemplated by the property owner is or is not a development or is or is not an exempted development.  Where a man proposes, for instance, to erect a summerhouse in his garden and the planning authority says: &ldquo;That is a development for which you will have to get permission&rdquo; and the appellant does not raise the preliminary question as to whether or not it is, in fact, a development, but simply says: &ldquo;Very well; give me permission then to put up my summerhouse&rdquo; and the planning authority says: &ldquo;We will not&rdquo;, is there any provision under any other section giving that property owner the right to go to the court and say: <Col N="1732" />&ldquo;This is a wholly unreasonable exercise of the powers of the planning authority in refusing to allow me to build my summerhouse&rdquo;?  If there is such a provision under some other section, I should be glad to have my attention directed to it because I have the uneasy feeling from such perusal as I have been able to make of the Bill, which is both long and complex, that there does not seem to be the same degree of consideration for the rights of the property owner in this situation as there was under the previous Acts of 1934 and 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Dillon's question, nothing in this Bill proposes to take away from the individual any existing right he has under common law.  He will still have his normal rights under common law to have recourse to the courts in the normal way.  We are restricting ourselves in subsection (1) of Section 5 &mdash;he may go to the court if he wishes for other reasons, but without any hope of success&mdash;on the basis of whether what he proposes to do is a development or an exempted development.  It would be on that net point that he would hope to succeed. If he is foolish enough he might, of course, go on other grounds and not succeed.  I should like to emphasise again that any rights he enjoys as of now under common law will remain and nothing in this Bill proposes to whittle them down in any way or remove them.</P>
      <P>Under Section 80, we shall be dealing in a more general way with appeals under various sections of this measure and possibly the questions that are being raised on this particular section could be more fully debated on that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to let this section pass without some clarification. I have had the answer given to me before that &ldquo;this Bill does not purport to abridge any existing common law right.&rdquo;  I do not know what these common law rights are. Does the Minister mean the right to proceed by way of writ of <i>mandamus, certiorari</i> or <i>quo warranto</i>?  I do not know what rights one has against a <Col N="1733" /> planning authority which says: &ldquo;We declare under Section 5 of this Act that the building of a summerhouse in your garden is a development within the meaning of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1962, and we serve you with notice that we prohibit the erection of such a building&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister says you can go to the court and argue that the building of a summerhouse is not a development at all and you can get a declaration under Section 5 that the Minister and the planning authority misdirected themselves in that matter and you are free to go straight ahead because their jurisdiction in the matter has been completely ousted by the decision of the court that the building of a summerhouse is not a development. Suppose, however, you get a decision from the court that it is a development within the meaning of the Act, admitting the power of the planning authority to control a development, I want to argue that it is an unreasonable use of such power to forbid me to erect a summerhouse in my own garden.  Have I access to the court for the purpose of that argument and, if so, where have I it under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister replies that I may not have any specific remedy set out in this Bill but I have my common law rights and there is nothing in this Bill that abridges them.  I do not know what my common law rights are against a planning authority constituted by statute and I have never heard of common law rights against a body created by statute unless I can establish that the body in question is doing something for which the statute made no provision.  This statute does make provision for a planning authority to declare a development to be in conflict with its plan.  This statute gives a planning authority power to make a plan and one of the provisions in that plan is, let us say, that they will not allow anyone to erect a summerhouse. I look in the same statutory instrument for a provision giving me the right, as an individual, to make the case before a court of competent jurisdiction that the planning authority has acted in a capricious or unreasonable <Col N="1734" /> way.  I find no such provision in this Bill and I know of no remedy at common law level to meet that situation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Quo warranto, mandamus, certiorari</i>&mdash;all these envisage an authority doing something they had no right or statutory authority to do and the court is invoked to deter them from proceeding with something the statute does not authorise them to do.  That is not my purpose.  My purpose is to deter them doing capriciously, and for insufficient reason, something the statute gives them the power to do.  I think the illustration I have given is a fairly good one; if I seek to build a summerhouse in my garden, the planning authority should not have the power to say: &ldquo;We do not allow summerhouses any more and we will not let you build a summerhouse.  That is a Victorian kind of thing today.&rdquo; I think that makes the point clear. I do not think the planning authority ought to have that kind of power.</P>
    <P>I can imagine a planning authority coming into court, and saying: &ldquo;We are prohibiting the erection of a summerhouse in that spot, not because it is a summerhouse but because it is essential, in view of the contemplated road widening which will take place in this area over the next 20 years, that there should not be a building within ten yards of the existing road boundary.&rdquo; That to my way of thinking might be a perfectly valid answer to my allegation of capriciousness on the part of the planning authority, but suppose the situation arose in which the planning authority came into court and said: &ldquo;Look, it is a silly thing for people to be building summerhouses in this day and age.  No one has time to sit in a summerhouse now.  It is a waste of money and it will look absurd.  We have decided there will not be any more summerhouses.&rdquo; I think the ordinary citizen should have the right to say: &ldquo;I like summerhouses and, if it is interfering with no public interest, I have a perfect right to build myself a summerhouse.&rdquo;  I find no such remedy here and I think we ought to have it.  Naturally graver matters will present themselves than the question of the erection of summerhouses but I <Col N="1735" /> have simply taken that one instance in order to illustrate the general principles with which I am concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Capriciously, as he has said.  Section 26 is a section&mdash;there are other sections and subsections which give added weight to this&mdash;to which the planning authority must give full consideration.  They must have regard to the criteria laid down at some length in Section 26 in arriving at a decision. If they depart from the rules laid down in Section 26, then there is recourse to the courts by way of <i>certiorari</i> because they would be acting capriciously and unreasonably.</P>
      <P>The other question put by Deputy Dillon was what would be the position of a property owner who indicates to the local authority that he wishes to build some structure or other on his property and, having communicated that information to the local authority, they say: &ldquo;No, you may not do this. This is development and it is not allowed.&rdquo;  The property owner in such circumstances could then say: &ldquo;I do not agree with you that it is development and I do not abide by your decision.&rdquo;  He would then have recourse to the courts.</P>

      <P>Yes, the planning authority would be out but if the reverse were the case and the planning authority were still in, the procedure again would be that the property owner would and could go back to the local planning authority for their agreement and if he did not get that, he then would have recourse by way of appeal to the Minister and if the Minister backed up the local authority, then the property owner could have recourse to the courts again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see, as the Minister says, that under subsection (3) there is an appeal to the High Court with reference to a question of law.  I am suggesting to the Minister a perfectly genuine case where the appellant has exhausted questions of law and has got an adverse decision. This is a development and it is not an exempted development and is within the jurisdiction of the planning authority, and the appellant says: &ldquo;Very well; I apply to the planning authority for permission to erect a summerhouse or a range of bee hives.&rdquo; He gets an order in correct form from the planning authority saying: &ldquo;We shall not permit you to erect the summerhouse on the ground that we consider summerhouses to be unsuitable.&rdquo; Where is there in this Bill a proviso that that decision of the planning authority, which is not <i>ultra vires</i> and is therefore not open to <i>certiorari,</i> can be challenged on the <Col N="1737" /> ground that the planning authority is acting capriciously and should not interfere with the free use of property by a person who proposes to use his property in a way that is not inimical to the amenities of the district or of his neighbours' premises or in any other way in conflict with the public good?  I know of no remedy&mdash;I do not know if Deputy Colley can help me here&mdash;under the common law to meet that situation.</P>
      <P>What little legal training I have leads me to feel that you cannot look outside the statute creating this authority and limiting its jurisdiction for any right to bring its decisions before the High Court.  As evidence of that, I would point out that the Bill is full of sections of which it can be said: &ldquo;But this matter can be appealed to the High Court&rdquo;.  I suggest to the Minister where there is a decision envisaged by the statute in which there is no express proviso for appeal to the High Court, I am entitled to apprehend that, in the absence of such an expressed proviso, I will not get to the courts at all and that the limit of my remedy is to appeal from the planning authority to the Minister, in the knowledge that if the Minister confirms the decision of the planning authority, I have no other recourse.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that a person's right to the enjoyment of his own property should be dependent on decisions other than judicial decisions because, imperfect as our institutions are, their purpose and principle is to ensure that the humblest citizen of the State will have interposed between him and the Executive an independent judiciary. That is the best safeguard we can provide. Like all other human institutions, it is not 100 per cent perfect but it is as good as we can make it and having it there, we should not forbid by statute any person having recourse to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the argument is made by the impatient reformer and administrator that this constant reference to the courts, as that eloquent, farseeing Deputy, Deputy Burke, has said, is too much of a blooming nuisance.  He recognises in principle that it is a most <Col N="1738" /> admirable thing but when widows, spinsters or others proceed to implement it, he believes in stoking up the steamroller, rolling down the road and flattening them out and getting on with the job.  I can understand the enterprise of so enthusiastic a soul as Deputy Burke but I am obliged to raise the red flag in front of his steamroller&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, mine is a minatory flag to check Deputy Burke's precipitate desire to sweep aside the claims of lesser men and to tell him that his steamroller must go back because we intend to preserve intact the right of people to have access to the court.  I do not think there is any common law remedy.  If there is, and I am wrong, I am quite prepared to be instructed.  I believe there is no statutory remedy expressed in the Bill but if there is and I have not found it, I am open to correction and if I have failed to find what is in fact there, I shall apologise to the House for unduly delaying them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are probably getting back to the main discussion on Second Reading on the question of where the courts come in and the Minister goes out.  The right of access to the High Court is there, whether stated or not in this Bill, and points of law may be put to it.  The actual merits &mdash;I think this is where we are somewhat confused&mdash;of a proposal under the planning legislation would fall to be dealt with on appeal not by the courts but by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes clear the division of the two functions: points of law for the High Court and merits of a proposal for the Minister.  In some sections as has been pointed out, the Bill states that you have the right to appeal to the court and in other sections where it appears you should have the right, it is not so stated. Where the right of appeal to the court is stated, it will also be noticed that a time limit within which such appeal should be made is laid down.  It is precisely for that reason only&mdash;to put <Col N="1739" /> a time limit on the period of appeal &mdash;that the High Court is specifically mentioned.  Where we are not concerned about the time limit, we do not mention the right of appeal but that does not say the right of appeal does not lie.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to subsection (2), I can understand the planning authority having particular powers in regard to examinations of tourist potential, interest and need and also in regard to land use surveys.  It would be a reasonable thing that a planning authority would make a survey of an area and the use to be made of it.  I take it the Minister has in mind when the planning authority comes to deal with a particular area under the scheme envisaged in the Bill, they will allocate different areas for different purposes &mdash; residential, industrial or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to paragraph (c) of subsection <Col N="1743" /> (2), could the Minister say what powers the planning authority will have in regard to sociological and demographic surveys?  Demographic surveys have been carried out recently by such bodies as Muintir na Tíre within a limited area.  Does the Minister envisage at this stage the use of such surveys to provide the planning authority with information to enable them to determine where they shall site residential areas, industrial areas or otherwise?  In regard to the sociological survey, in its widest implication, it could mean inquiries into the possible needs of the people and their social status.  When they get down to the question of social status, the local authorities may find themselves moving on to very dangerous ground.  I can understand sociological surveys if it means the alleviation of the conditions of the less well-off sections of the community.  In giving these powers, however, how far will the authorities carrying out these surveys be subject to the authority of this House if they decide to apply them to all strata of society in every portion of their administrative area?  I should like to hear more from the Minister in regard to these two matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The written statement which we hope will accompany the draft development plan should contain observations on the population trends.  For these purposes, graphic sociological and demographical surveys could be of very great assistance.  By and large, the value of these surveys would be more related to a region rather than a county.  For instance, they could consider the population shift into the east of the country.  On the other hand, the movement out of the west could be considered on a regional basis rather than on an individual county basis.  We would be thinking of surveys on a regional basis rather than on the restricted basis of the local town or even county boundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also possible that a feature of future planning will be that certain areas may be decided on as centres for expansion into a larger community. <Col N="1744" /> It is difficult to define here precisely in what way these surveys can be of use in the future in planning for possible changing circumstances, changing outlook indeed, where we may be restricting the growth of certain places, yet designating other centres for increased growth.  That is only a general mention of the need there might be for surveys such as these.</P>
    <P>What may have been in the mind of Deputy Jones when he mentioned the sociological aspect, the interference with the rights of the individual, need not cause us any fear because we do not intend to give to planning authorities any more power than local authorities have at the moment in their investigations into housing needs of particular localities.  We do not object to those powers because we know there is need for such inquiries, that they are carried out in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister as giving me an assurance that the power provided for here will operate in the same way as that conferred on local authorities in respect of inquiries as to housing needs?  We have had in the past a type of sociological, indeed demographic, investigation by people who come in from abroad and make surveys involving questions to individuals.  I hope the Minister does not envisage planning authorities being permitted to go so far in this respect.  I would not like to have power conferred on somebody to carry out surveys requiring individuals to render accounts of their affairs, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand that there is a desire, perhaps a need, to make studies of such things as movement of population. That is one of the things that have been interesting people not alone here but in other countries&mdash;the fact that the population move in certain directions.  We have here movement from the west to the eastern sectors of the country; we have movement of the rural population to the towns.  If the surveys are to be of the type that will convey some information which might be useful in determining reasons for such moves and applying remedies, <Col N="1745" /> I can see the sense of it.  We have on the continent, particularly in places like Holland, a small country intensively cultivated, a movement from the land to groupings of villages.  That is something that has grown naturally.</P>
    <P>As I say, if that is the type of survey the Minister has in mind for the planning authorities, then I can see the sense of it.  I am merely expressing a fear in regard to this matter without prejudice.  If the provision is aimed at removing any doubt that the local authority will have the right to carry out this type of survey, then I am with the Minister; but if it is to confer on somebody within the planning authority a power to make public matters involved in a survey, which might entail the disclosure of personal information in regard to individuals or families, I do not think it is a desirable trend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is no such intention.  The purpose of giving them the powers we talk about here is to enable them as planning authorities to incur the expenditure necessary to carry out proposals without let or hindrance by the auditor.  This would merely give them power to raise the money but nothing in the section entitles them to get the answers to the questions they may ask. Section 9 deals with the circumstances under which obligations lie on individuals to answer questions and any fears the Deputy may have in this respect would properly arise on that section.  This merely enables the local authority to be on the proper side of the ledger.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (d), page 10, line 53, to delete &ldquo;so&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;so&rdquo; after &ldquo;authorised&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (6), page 11, to <Col N="1747" /> delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; in line 24 and substitute &ldquo;must&rdquo;; in line 25 and in lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;either before or after&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;before&rdquo; in each case.</P>
    <P>In this section the Minister proposes that certain notices will be given.  I might have asked this on the last occasion : what notice does the Minister propose shall be given under this section?  There is a question of notice being given under Sections 31, 32, 33 and 35.  For instance, in Section 31 (a) we see, &ldquo;...serve on the owner and on the occupier of the land a notice under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our amendment proposes writing into the subsection that a dispensation must be given under the foregoing subsection.  As drafted, the subsection reads:</P>
    <P>A dispensation under the foregoing subsection may be given either before or after the time when the notice or copy would, but for the dispensation, be required to be given and either before or after the doing of any act to which the notice or copy would, but for the dispensation, be a condition precedent.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister if I am correct in regard to the notices I mentioned.  A person might be out of the country and the notice might not reach him very readily.  I know the Minister makes provision in that regard.  A person might be dead and his representatives might not be easily found, and certain things could happen to which I should like to refer after I hear from the Minister what are the notices in this section.</P>
    <P>We also want to delete &ldquo;either before or after&rdquo; and make sure it is &ldquo;before&rdquo;.  A local authority might decide to do a certain thing to a person's building and say they served notice on him.  We know that in this Bill there is reference to such things as unauthorised structures.  A local authority might serve notice on an individual that they required him to take down an unauthorised structure. They might go so far as to move in <Col N="1748" /> and take it down of their own accord. Afterwards, the authority, finding there was a grievance, could apply for a dispensation from serving the notice. As the subsection stands, it says that the dispensation may be given &ldquo;either before or after&rdquo;.  We want to preclude the business of &ldquo;before or after&rdquo;.  As I said earlier to-day, local authorities can make mistakes just as readily as an individual.</P>
    <P>I referred to the case of a person who may be out of the country.  Someone from the local authority may put a small notice on the sill of a window, or he may stick a small notice on a pole or a fence somewhere on the property.  It might be that the owner of the property is dead and his representatives not yet determined.  The new owner might come back and find that his property had been removed, taken down or interfered with, and the planning authority could ask the Minister at that stage for a dispensation.  Having already done the damage, they could seek the dispensation.  I am not inferring that the Minister would give it, but they could seek it from him &ldquo;either before or after&rdquo;.  Why should they seek a dispensation afterwards for something which they have done? Why should it be that they may seek it?  We think it should be that they must seek it when the notice or the copy would require to be served.</P>
    <P>A person's property may be interfered with to the extent of demolition under another section of the Bill.  Not only could the demolition of a person's building or structure be involved, but he could be charged for that demolition. I think the Oireachtas should make very certain that the individual is given every opportunity to defend his rights.  It seems to stem from the type of philosophy which says that the local authorities can make no mistakes.  The citizen can make mistakes and can do things that are not correct and are not in accord with the law but the philosophy here seems to be that the local authority and the planning authority set up under the local authority which, in the long run, boils down to some official, cannot make <Col N="1749" /> any mistake.  But, if he did make a mistake and did interfere with the property of an individual and found himself confronted with that, he might then appeal for this dispensation that somebody forgot to serve the notice or that it was not effectively served on the individual.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister the reason for the words &ldquo;may be given&rdquo; and why the option is being given of &ldquo;either before or after&rdquo;.  I submit the amendment is reasonable.  If somebody seeks a dispensation from serving this notice he must make application to the Minister before doing something which may affect the property of a citizen in any way.  He must make this appeal to the Minister before taking any steps which might interfere with the property of an individual.</P>

      <P>Subsection (5) enables the Minister to dispense with certain notices.  These notices mainly, I think, would deal with the matters contained in Sections 21 and 25 and would not operate in the cases outlined by Deputy Jones and about which he has expressed fears &mdash; enforcement notices, and so on.  I should also say, further to allay the fears of anybody who may have such fears, that the provisions of this subsection have been in operation for a considerable time under other enactments, principally, as far as we are concerned, Section 15 of the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1939, and Section 45 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931.  While the dispensations under the terms of those specific enactments have been used not infrequently, my Department is unaware of there being any complaint whatsoever over these 30 odd years from anyone who feels that any wrong was done him as a result of the operation of these similar sections or subsections.</P>

      <P>We come back again to the point where a person has the right of appeal to the court on this question.  Is it to be a question of determining whether the Minister has or has not been right in law in regard to this matter?  This is not getting over the essential difficulty which I see in it in regard to the individual himself. For instance, if the planning authority does or does not serve a notice in a certain way&mdash;which, indeed, the individual might easily miss&mdash;am I then confined in regard to the person's right to appeal?</P>
      <P>Only recently, we have had examples where notices were supposed to be exhibited bringing certain things to the notice of the public.  It was alleged that these notices may not have existed at all or were so small as not to be legible.  Such set of circumstances could arise and evidently did arise recently.  I think it was discussed in this House recently in regard to another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> If such a notice were served but had not been brought to the attention of the person, is the right of the individual to appeal in that instance confined to a mere determination of whether the Minister's interpretation of the law was or was not right in this respect?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said at the outset that the real purpose of this subsection is to get over technical errors that may have taken place and which, nine times out of ten, are not discovered until after the event.  It is mainly after the event that they are discovered.  It is vital, therefore, that we should retain the subsection in its present form rather than in the form proposed by Deputy Jones and which he is putting to the House.  I say that because its greatest use is in rectifying the situation created by technical errors discovered usually only after the event and not before. Therefore, the insertion of &ldquo;before&rdquo; in this rather than &ldquo;either before or after&rdquo; would lessen the use and the advantage&mdash;and this subsection is really an advantage&mdash;and the value of the subsection if we restricted it only to that which went before and did not give ourselves an opportunity of utilising it for errors discovered after.  I am told that most of the errors are discovered after rather than before.  If they could be discovered before, they would be corrected in time.  Often they emerge only after the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point.  It is desirable, I suppose, for the planning authority to have this power before and after.  However, certainly it is not desirable as far as the individual is concerned.  What about the notice which will be served on a person that he may not do this or that?  Some official in the local authority may say later: &ldquo;I forgot to serve the notice. I forgot to affix the notice to where this person was last known to be.  I forgot to insert the advertisement in the local paper.&rdquo;  Somebody discovers it is a technical error afterwards: it is a technical error in so far as the local authority is concerned.  They may say it was a technical error that somebody <Col N="1752" /> forgot to do this thing but, in forgetting it, the individual whose property is affected by one of these orders is then presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i> Something has been done to his property at that stage and he has been unaware of it, due to the fact that somebody did not serve him with a notice. The result is that the individual is affected.  The planning authority is affected by the fact that somebody forgot to give the notice and may decide to apply to the Minister for dispensation afterwards.  The individual cannot so apply.  He cannot apply before the time when the notice would be required to be given because by reason of the fact that he was absent from home, or some other circumstances, he cannot be served with the order. Afterwards he finds a situation has developed, that the property which he owns has been affected by the implementation of the order and he has no redress at that stage because the authority has applied to the Minister for a dispensation under subsection (5).</P>
      <P>We want to make the Bill work and the only way it can be made to work is by creating genuine respect for it so far as every individual is concerned. If an individual feels that his rights can be affected in his absence by an omission on the part of some public official who is paid not to make mistakes and that he has no redress, there will not be the respect for the Bill that there should be.  This is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>Under the sections I have mentioned and the other sections which the Minister mentioned, property could be affected and the failure of the planning authority or some official of the planning authority could be got over on the ground that it was a technical slip and they could apply for dispensation to the Minister to cover them after the event rather than before the event. If the application were made before the event the Minister would be aware of what was likely to happen and of the circumstances.  It is a fatal provision in legislation that they can apply to the Minister for a dispensation after the event.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy and the <Col N="1753" /> House are probably aware, local authorities frequently experience difficulty in contacting persons who may be interested in a bit of property and in getting their names.  Quite frequently, it is a case of the owners not wishing to make themselves known until they have to or until they are going to lose something by not doing so.  It very frequently happens that it is only when the CPO is made that certain owners and people purporting to have an interest in the lands in question appear on the scene whereas if you were chasing them for ten years before that you could not find them.  It is not for the want of trying to find them that they are not found. In my experience, it is that they do not want to be found until there is a danger of their losing something or they are not quite sure whether it would be to their advantage to remain unknown as the owners or to claim ownership.  It is only definite action such as the making of a compulsory purchase order that usually flushes out some of these people.  They may come along and say that they saw a notice in the newspaper.  Notice may not have been served on them because they were not known or were not registered or, if registered, the address may have been incorrect, not necessarily by mistake on the part of the local authority.</P>
      <P>These matters do not emerge before the event.  The tendency is for them to emerge after the event.  To substitute the words &ldquo;either before or after&rdquo; by the words &ldquo;before&rdquo; would lessen the advantage available through the operation of this subsection, an advantage not to the local authority or the acquiring authority, but to those who are otherwise interested in any given property.  It would reduce the value of the subsection to all and sundry who might be concerned with a compulsory acquisition or some such procedure if we were to limit it to action taken in respect of that which has gone before the event rather than to cover what may have gone before or after the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer to the fact that the provisions in subsection (5) are exactly similar to the provisions contained <Col N="1754" /> in the Planning Act, 1939, and the Housing Act, 1931.  Despite the fact that such provisions have been in existence for all these years and have been used not infrequently in the interval, no real complaints have come to the knowledge of my Department which would indicate that someone is being done down or wronged.  After years of operation the Department are not aware of any of the complaints which the Deputy fears might arise. We are not aware of any bad points arising.  If the provisions had the bad points the Deputy fears, they would surely have emerged since 1931 and certainly since 1939.</P>
    <P>We can see nothing wrong with the provision.  Experience shows that it is all right, that it serves its purpose and is doing no damage and inflicting no injury on any party.  Therefore, we feel it should be left there.  Experience is very much on our side in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reference to the fact that over a number of years nothing has happened which would justify the fears I have expressed.  There have been the 1934 and the 1939 Acts which, admittedly, have not been put into operation.  The fact that this Bill is before the House is sufficient indication that those Acts were not in operation and, consequently, some of the things I have suggested might happen could not have happened and did not happen in the interval.  But, in this Bill it is proposed to take stringent measures to deal with development and so on, and to give pretty wide powers to the planning authority.  For instance, the planning authority may decide that a person is living in an authorised building.  I take that as one example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual concerned will then be served with a notice telling him that this is an unauthorised building and he must alter it, demolish it, remove it, or something else.  At that stage the notice ought to be served on him.  There is provision made in the Bill for the serving of notice in a certain way, in a paper circulating in the district.  I shall have something to say about that at a later stage.  The Minister has <Col N="1755" /> referred to things that may not happen. The previous subsection provides that:</P>
    <P>Where the Minister is satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for dispensing with the serving or giving under this Act or under any order or regulation made thereunder of a notice or copy of an order, he may dispense with the serving or giving of the notice or copy and every such dispensation shall have effect according to the tenor thereof.</P>
    <P>The following subsection says:</P>
    <P>A dispensation under the foregoing subsection may be given either before or after the time when the notice or copy would, but for the dispensation, be required to be given and either before or after the doing of any act to which the notice or copy would, but for the dispensation, be a condition precedent.</P>
    <P>My argument is that notice must be given, and before.  I am concerned for the fact that even one individual might find himself, because of the failure of someone to serve this notice on him, suffering a loss.  The Minister says my fears may be groundless.  But this could happen.  It may not happen.  I hope it will not happen.  When we legislate here we should provide for the type of case I have mentioned and it should not be open to an official to say at a later stage that he forgot to serve notice, or failed to serve notice for some reason, on the individual concerned and that he should then be in a position to seek the Minister's dispensation after the event.</P>
    <P>I think I have good grounds for asking the Minister to have another look at this.  I cannot accept that, because something did not happen under the 1934 and 1939 Acts, it will not happen under this Bill when it becomes law. Under the earlier Acts there was no obligation, but the Minister is ensuring that this Bill will be implemented and will be adopted.  He will ensure that local authorities will make a plan.  They will have no choice in the matter.  The section, as it stands, will come into operation.  I believe it is only reasonable that officials who have an obligation imposed on them to serve <Col N="1756" /> notice should serve that notice.  I believe there should be no loophole to enable them to say that, through a technicality, notice was not served, and then seeking the Minister's dispensation for non-service after the event.</P>

      <P>Many difficulties have arisen from time to time because the person on whom it was desired to serve notice could not be found.  Many developments have been held up and many wrongs have been perpetrated.  It was impossible to right these wrongs because of the impossibility of serving notice.  I appeal to the Minister, however, to find another way out of this difficulty other than by writing into the subsection the words &ldquo;either before or after&rdquo;.  I am sure there must be another way of overcoming the difficulties Deputy Jones feels might arise under this subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, is it not a very grave thing when, dealing with property rights and laying down statutory conditions to protect these rights, you come to the kind of case to which Deputy Clinton has referred and under subsection (5) invest the Minister with a very exceptional and special power to be exercised only under his personal supervision to dispense with the service of notice when, in fact, service has proved impossible, and where a whole scheme is being held up because the local authority and the Department have come face to face with a problem that no amount of ingenuity can surmount?  I think we should be very slow ordinarily to adopt subsection (5), but I think the Minister can make a case for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience has taught us that a situation can arise in which you simply cannot get a job done unless this exceptional power exists.  Suppose we go so far with him and say: &ldquo;Very well, if that is absolutely essential, but strictly subject to the conditions that it is a matter to which the Minister will give his personal attention before exercising his discretion, we are prepared <Col N="1757" /> to go so far in the abridgment of property rights&rdquo;.  But is it not an immense step to ask us to say that, suppose somebody slips up and forgets to give notice that should have been given, and this slip up is pleaded by someone who belives his property right is gravely prejudiced by his failure to receive notice, the Minister should have power <i>ex post facto</i> to say: &ldquo;I admit you are gravely prejudiced, and I admit failure to serve notice was not as a result of impossibility but of understandable oversight, and I propose to dispense with service retrospectively and sign an order accordingly&rdquo;? Immediately the aggrieved person's case for relief falls to the ground because suddenly, by an executive order, the ground of appeal has been swept away <i>ex post facto.</i></P>
    <P>Surely that is an immense step to ask the Legislature to take?  I think these slips-up do not take place all that often and it is not unreasonable to say that, if they do take place, you had better go back to the beginning and start all over again.  If we do not adopt that rigid line the Minister will find he has forged a weapon for his own undoing.  If any administrative machine, however excellent, is fixed with notice that there is really no need to be all that careful and, if anybody slips up the Minister will sign an order under subsection (5), it will be extremely difficult to ensure reasonable and proper precautions are taken to see that everyone entitled to receive notification will get it.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is an unreasonable sanction to maintain, in respect of private property rights, that if a Government Department has not done what it is bound by statute to do, that Department must be answerable to Parliament for that default.  What would happen is that if a default arose in this particular instance, a Deputy representing the constituency would ask the Minister the reason for the delay and the reason why the job was not being done, and the Minister would be under the embarrassing obligation of coming in here and saying someone slipped up and did not notify the person entitled to notification and &ldquo;I am sorry to say we shall have to start all over again and there will be <Col N="1758" /> a delay of three or four months&rdquo;.  If the Minister is constrained to do that once or twice, if I have any knowledge of the working of Government Departments, it is highly unlikely he will be constrained to do it a third time, because heads will fall in every direction, and it is a salutary thing that they should fall.  The administration of Government Departments is a complex and difficult thing but their glory is that they are administered with scrupulous care.  There is a long tradition, especially in the matter of private property where they are required to proceed with special care.</P>
    <P>Suppose a situation does arise in which the Minister will be challenged in the House about the delay and his officers say: &ldquo;Of course, Minister, if you sign this order, you can go into the House and say everything is lovely in the garden and you can go straight ahead&rdquo; or if the order is not signed, they may say: &ldquo;You had better tell them you slipped up and the thing will have to start all over again.&rdquo; Cross his heart and hope to die, what Minister out of nine or ten Ministers would not have signed an order under subsection (6)?  From such an order there does not appear to be any appeal at all.  The only person who could shout is the person who has a sense of grievance and apparently his only remedy is to write a letter to the <i>Evening Press or Evening Herald.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister should acknowledge that if Deputies give consent to subsection (5), they should not be asked to go the distance of subsection (6). I do not want to be associated with a proposal to give retroactive effect to an order of dispensation such as that envisaged in subsections (5) and (6) and I do not think the Minister should ask us to do it.  If the Minister says this power existed before, I must say at once I have not the faintest notion whether it did or not.  If it did, it should not have been there.  We should not have put it there.  If no difficulty has arisen, I think that is very largely due to the reason mentioned by Deputy Jones, that the Planning Acts have not functioned because if they had, there would be no necessity for a Planning Bill in 1963, and it is <Col N="1759" /> notorious that they have not.  Does the Minister feel that subsection (6) is a subsection without which it is impossible to administer the Act?</P>

Having said that, may I point out that I shall give further consideration to this matter between now and the Report Stage in order to provide something to the effect that the dispensation shall not be given unless the Minister is satisfied that no injury was suffered or wrong done to the person on whom the notice should have been served?</P>

Might I draw his attention to the fact that in Section 7 (1) (d) there is reference to the affixing of this notice in a conspicuous position &ldquo;on or near such land or premises&rdquo;.  We know in the country that would not be a very permanent fixture and it might be a question of &ldquo;Gone with the Wind&rdquo; or perhaps young people going home might take a fancy to it and take it off at the first go.</P>

He has gone part of the way to meet us in this matter and we are grateful for that approach.

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 11, line 31, after &ldquo;area&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;affected by this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (1) provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  A planning authority shall keep a register (in this Act referred to as the register) for the purposes of this Act in respect of all land within their area, and shall make all such entries and corrections therein as may from time to time be appropriate in accordance with this Act and any regulations made thereunder.</P>
      <P>We have had a discussion on the area which would fall to be administered by a planning authority.  For instance, in regard to the city of Dublin and the borough of Dún Laoghaire, there might be one planning authority.  The city and county of Limerick, considering that the areas run into each other, might have one planning authority.  It could be equally so in regard to Cork borough and the county of Cork.  What we want to ensure by this amendment is that the area which is being defined in Section 8 shall be the area which is controlled by the planning authority, where that planning authority is the planning authority for one or more administrative areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke earlier of the necessity for this type of co-operation as between two contiguous areas and I am sure it is a desirable thing that the development and planning of such an area should be done by the one planning authority.  The power is there under the Act, as we envisage it at <Col N="1761" /> present, where there can be one planning consultant to deal perhaps with two areas, so co-ordinating his plan as to apply the development envisaged in it to two areas, the area, for instance, falling under the control of Limerick Corporation and the area under the control of Limerick County Council.  We want to ensure by this amendment that the planning authority for Limerick county will be the elected members of Limerick County Council and the planning authority for Limerick city will be Limerick Corporation. The plan must be adopted by the planning authority.  We do not want a single consultant to incorporate in a plan covering two areas something that has not the approval of the authority in one area.  It should ensure that the area controlled by the planning authority <i>qua</i> local authority is the area dealt with.  I invite the Minister's comments on that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (4) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  (a)  A document purporting to be a copy of an entry in the register and to be certified by an officer of the planning authority as a correct copy shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the entry and it shall not be necessary to prove the signature of such officer or that he was in fact such officer.</P>
      <P>(b)  Evidence of an entry in the register may be given by production of a copy thereof certified pursuant to this subsection and it shall not be necessary to produce the register itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1762" /> (c)  Where application is made to a planning authority for a copy under this section, the copy shall be issued to the applicant on payment by him to the planning authority of a fee of ten shillings in respect of each entry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment, although it seems substantial, merely provides that the register kept in local authority headquarters of permissions granted under the Act, will not have to be produced in court as evidence and that if a certified copy of the relevant extract is produced in court, it may be accepted as a proper record.  We do not want to be carrying around this register which will probably become a bulky affair and, secondly, it is required to be available for public inspection and it could not be where it should be if it were being taken around to courts.  Instead, we are providing that a copy of an extract from it, certified, probably by the manager or the planning officer, shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>

      <P>When somebody requires an extract from the register, I think the fee of 10/- is rather high, if that person wants to know if his property is affected or wants a document to confirm that it is affected.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in these days tracings or drawings should be available to the applicant if a 10/- fee is being charged. There is no reason why a photostatic copy should not be supplied.  A document describing a piece of land bounded by A or B does not convey the same information as a photostatic copy of a sketch plan or map.  Such documentation will be much more valuable if accompanied by a photostatic copy of the relevant map.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common practice now in local authorities to have photostatic facilities <Col N="1763" /> which are used to produce matter for official use or for the use of members.  Therefore, it is only reasonable to assume such a copy would be available from the register it is proposed to establish.  It should be something which would convey to the individual looking at it the boundaries of the property he owns and which is affected by the development plan.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it can conceivably happen in small towns and villages that people do not know the limits of their property.  The Minister has mentioned this frequent difficulty, and I know from my own experience of people who could not point out their own boundaries.  If the local authority go to the trouble of making sketch plans covering property under the authority, these sketch plans are valuable documents and should be available to the citizens whose property is affected at a reasonable fee.  The fee of 10/- for an ordinary written statement is much too high but 10/- where a photostatic copy of a map or sketch delineating the property is supplied, is reasonable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jones probably expects this register to be more comprehensive than is intended when he talks about the difficult problems of people in many cases not being able to point out the limits of their own property.  I know that difficulty exists. I am afraid this register will not be of any assistance to them, because it will not purport to be a register of property with sketches attached.  It will be a register of applications for planning permission, together with the actual decision, adverse or otherwise, reached on them.  It will be kept so that interested parties may be informed of what is being sought, granted or refused.</P>

It is not a register of property as such.  We may be confusing it with the map accompanying the draft plan which may indicate regions for this purpose or that purpose.  It will be an index in which people such as county councillors or urban councillors can see what has been decided and how it has been decided. It should be of great assistance to them.  If they have strong views about it, or their neighbours have strong views about it, they can convey to them that such a decision was made on such a date and that something should be done to prevent its going through.  This register is to enable the appeals procedure to function within the time limit of 30 days.</P>
      <P>In addition to the register, we hope by way of regulation that it may be possible to find some other way of disseminating the information contained in the register over a more widely dispersed area than the headquarters of the county council or urban council.  We are trying to find ways of making this information more readily accessible to members of the general public who may have a particular interest in it.  However, we are dealing only with the register on this section.</P>
      <P>The map mentioned in subsection (2) is only the sketch map dealing with the proposed development for which planning permission was sought.  It would not necessarily delineate the adjoining property.</P>
      <P>As far as the 10/- is concerned, we believe that only persons with a real interest in what has been decided will apply for an actual copy of the decision, together with any appropriate sketches.  If it is worth their while to apply at all, they will be getting very good value by paying 10/- for it.  I do not think it is an unreasonable figure, in view of the cost of services of any kind these days.  I do not think the 10/- will be an obstacle if they are interested enough to apply.</P>

      <P>What does the Minister envisage the applicant would get for <Col N="1765" /> the 10/-, somebody in the area who would be affected by the planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He would get the entry in the register, which would outline in brief terms the decision reached on an application received, and he would probably get a little site or location map.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there has to be a little site map to make what is in the register intelligible, I think he must also get whatever it is necessary to have with the register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that where a person is going to get something more than a written document&mdash;some kind of little sketch map or plan that will indicate to him more clearly than the written document the information he requires&mdash;the 10/- would not be exorbitant. I was thinking in terms of a written document which would indicate a particular entry from the register without conveying the information graphically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Except for some specified legal purpose or for the sale of land, he need not have this at all.  He can go in and see the register for nothing.  If he wants the documentation however, we say he should pay 10/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I have in mind.  There will be people disposing of property which will be affected by planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would arise very much in that case.  It could be of real use and value to such a person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 11, lines 52 and 54, and in page 12, lines 2 and 6, to delete &ldquo;or other land&rdquo; where they occur in those lines.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of this section states:</P>
      <P>A planning authority may, for any purpose arising in relation to their functions under this Act, by notice in writing require the occupier of any structure or other land or any person receiving, whether for himself or for another, rent out of any structure or other land to state in writing to such authority, within a specified time not less than fourteen days after being so required, particulars of the estate, interests, or right by virtue of which he occupies such structure or other land or receives such rent (as the case may be), and the name and address, and the estate, interest, or right (so far as they are known to him) of every person who to his knowledge has any estate or interest in or right over or in respect of such structure or other land.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete the words &ldquo;or other land.&rdquo;  I should like to direct the attention of the Minister and the House to a type of title not uncommon in Ireland which has come to be known as squatter's title.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. Wednesday, 22nd May, 1963.</P>
