      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether any discussion concerning the expansion and liberalisation of trade between Ireland and the USA took place during the recent visit of President Kennedy to this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3 together.</P>
      <P>My discussions with the President of the United States of America were of a general nature and consisted of an exchange of views on current world affairs, including our own.  As it is not customary to give details of such discussions, which are of a confidential nature, I do not feel at liberty to elaborate further on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May we ask the <Col N="148" /> Taoiseach whether he had any discussion, without disclosing any details of it, on the issue of Partition with the President of the United States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned that the discussions related to all current affairs, including our own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it, in any case, be correct to assume that the discussions were of no great substance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy means that specific propositions were not considered, that is correct, but the discussions were of considerable importance, and of interest and value to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the short time the Taoiseach and the President were together, I think it is reasonable to assume the discussions were of no great substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it the discussion did encompass military, political and trade matters?  Further, may we have from the Taoiseach an undertaking that no fundamental change in policy in regard to any of these matters and in particular, in relation to military matters, will take place as a result of discussions with the American President?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly there is no change of policy arising out of these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it that Government policy as stated by the Minister for External Affairs in the United Nations, that Ireland will not be tied to any power <i>bloc</i> or cold war <i>bloc,</i> still stands?  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has no reason to assume any changes of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Taoiseach has said, can we take it that there was no, let us call it, secret agreement or arrangement arrived at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This gets funnier every minute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the usual procedure that the House be informed of the nature of discussions between the Taoiseach and the head of a foreign Government, that some <Col N="149" /> details of the discussions should be given, instead of secrecy?  Surely that is the position obtaining in Parliaments all over the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite the contrary. It is obvious that discussions between members of the Irish Government and other Government on matters of general interest must be regarded as confidential; otherwise, they will not take place.  It would be quite impossible to expect heads of other States or members of other Governments to discuss these matters freely with us, if everything they said were to be reported to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach must remember that in discussions with the head of the British Government and with the Italian Government, there was a communiqué issued.  Nobody wants the Taoiseach to disclose all these secret things that were discussed but the Taoiseach could have&mdash;it is too late now&mdash;issued a communiqué.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These discussions to which the Deputy refers were related to specific objectives which they had in view and to which the communiqués related.  The discussions I had with the President of the United States were of a general character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's view that no information whatsoever should be given to this House relating to discussions between himself and members of a foreign Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view that no information should be given to this House regarding confidential discussions of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that if the Taoiseach does not give the information, it is quite likely a wrong interpretation will be put on what took place?  In view of that fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (for the Minister for Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question refers to that portion of the Cork Health Authority area known as the Cork West area.  The number of applicants for dentures in the Cork West area in the years ended 31st December, 1961, and 31st December, 1962, were 115 and 364 respectively. During the period from 1st January to 30th June, 1963, the number of applicants was 168.  There are at present 72 persons on the waiting list for dentures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that men employed on rural improvement and minor employment schemes are seeking a five-day working week; and whether he has considered this case with a view to bringing their working conditions into line with those of county council workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Some representations have been made to have the five-day working week introduced on these schemes and the matter has been considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out, however, that because of the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act which limit the daily number of hours to be worked, the introduction of the five-day week would involve a reduction in the number of hours worked weekly, <Col N="152" /> which is 48 at present.  It is felt that such a reduction would have an impact on the conditions of employment of agricultural workers who are conditioned to a 50 hour week and it is considered essential to avoid any interference with the conditions of such workers.</P>
    <P>The 48 hour week remains the standard throughout the country for workers employed by other Government Departments and it is regretted, therefore, that it is not possible to concede the five-day week to workers on the schemes in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not consider that it would have been more courteous to reply to the trade union with which negotiations had been taking place before giving that information in reply to any question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that on 18th October last the Minister for Finance directed a letter to the trade union concerned giving the Government's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the matter was discussed within the last week with me as the general secretary of the trade union dealing with the majority of these men and would it not have been more courteous to give that information to me when it became available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if it is proposed to publish the Report of the Tribunal established to consider salaries and wages of Electricity Supply Board staff; when the Report will be published; and what action it is proposed to take on the Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a recent decision of the ESB General Employees Tribunal on claims for increased salaries for certain ESB officer staff.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice of the tribunal to publish their decisions but the decisions are furnished by the tribunal to the parties concerned.  I am informed that this has been done in the present case.  It is also the practice of the tribunal to circulate their annual report to trade unions and employers' associations and other parties who may be interested.</P>
      <P>As required by the terms of the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> and envisaged in the reply to a Parliamentary Question addressed to the Minister for Finance on 6th March, 1963, the ESB brought the terms of the award to the notice of the Government.  The Board was informed that having regard to the likely consequences of granting the salary increases as proposed it was the considered view of the Government that the ESB should await the completion of an objective study of the progress of the national economy before arriving at a decision regarding the implementation of the present award of the General Employees Tribunal.  I understand that the Board has since communicated with the staff associations concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been negotiations for some considerable time, since July, 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say now that the terms of the White Paper are to be applied to the ESB when these negotiations started as far back as July, 1962?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>All the relevant factors had to be considered.  The fact that the claim was originally made before the issue of the White Paper does not mean that it would not come within the Government's decision as conveyed in the White Paper, <i>Closing the Gap,</i> requesting State companies to postpone the granting of increases.  The fact that the claim was made before the Government's decision does not invalidate the Government's decision. It is a most complex matter and it would be impossible to go into details in regard to it.  The Government's decision was set out in the White Paper which also states:</P>
      <P>It is not envisaged that conciliation and arbitration procedures should be put in suspense but rather that the findings should be considered in relation to their possible reaction in other sectors and, if necessary, not applied until this can be done without damage to the national economic interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that before the report was published, the ESB had considered the admonition given through the White Paper but still considered that increases should be made?  What the Minister has now said is that the Government have, in fact, imposed a wage and salary standstill as far as these employees are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB took into account the nature of the claim and also the Government's attitude which I have just indicated.  The question of the implementation of it was considered in conjunction with the terms of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not said that the Government's decision is that these increases should not be conceded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The tribunal had <Col N="155" /> regard to that portion of the White Paper which clearly indicated that negotiations could take place and awards made.  The postponement of the award relates to the improvement of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <P>With the permission of An Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that all rural areas in County Cork have already been developed under the Rural Electrification Scheme, with the exception of Dunbeacon, where work is at present <Col N="156" /> in progress, and Doonpeter, where work is about to commence.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated in reply to previous questions, the Electricity Supply Board, following the increase in the subsidy for rural electrification, are arranging to re-canvass all rural areas, and any householders who did not accept supply on the occasion of the initial development of their areas will be given a further opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>The board are unable to state an order of priority for the re-canvass of individual areas.  Interested persons should get in touch with the appropriate district office of the board, which, in the case of South-West Cork, is at 113 Patrick Street, Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of present subsidy policy is to secure that families living in unfit or unhealthy houses will have a prior claim on the attention of the housing authority.  To encourage this approach, the higher rate of subsidy is made available specifically in association with the statutory operations of the housing authority such as the demolition, closure or repair of unfit dwellings, the relief of overcrowding and rehousing on medical or compassionate grounds.  As I indicated in reply to previous questions, the present subsidy structure is being examined with a view to establishing whether any changes are justifiable, but I can give no indication at this stage what the final outcome of this review will be. In the meantime, it is open to housing <Col N="160" /> authorities to avail themselves of the normal rate of subsidy towards rehousing persons of the categories referred to by the Deputy, but I would stress that housing authorities are expected to encourage persons of these categories to rehouse themselves by making available to the fullest extent the grant and loan facilities and developed sites authorised under the Housing Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent weeks, there have been considerably more calls dealt with successfully than at any previous time.  At the same time, there has, of course, been congestion on certain routes and in certain areas.  I fully and freely admit that and I am taking every step open to me to deal with the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be news to the Deputy to know that I have also received several letters complimenting me on the service provided.  It is, of course, an easy and a simple matter <Col N="166" /> for Deputies to highlight local deficiencies or focus public attention on local deficiencies and faults.  The telephone service is a universal one.  It is a highly technical service and it is another matter to assess the general defects of the service and the requirements necessary to eliminate those defects.  It may be of interest to the House to know that the equipment now being used to increase the circuits was ordered in 1960, and since 1960, we have been finding it increasingly difficult to get deliveries of the orders placed with the manufacturers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What has happened over the past two months is not due to a huge boom in trade.  Things have reached such a pass in one area that, if a phone is picked up, one can hear two conversations going on; surely there must be something wrong when that happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot deal by way of question and answer here with specific instances raised without notice. All I can do is to direct policy and provide the necessary capital.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a matter of which I have given you, Sir, notice. I have also communicated to the Taoiseach my intention to mention it. We held here, on Friday, 28th June, for the first time since the State was founded, a joint session of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann by <Col N="174" /> Resolution adopted by both Houses. Since then, the unrevised Official Report has reached Deputies.  I want to submit that in its present format, it does not correctly reproduce what transpired and it does not do justice in its format or content to the unique and historic occasion in which we all participated.  I want to make it quite clear that, in my submission, the occasion was historic for the attendance of the President of the United States of America, but it was also historic because the Oireachtas of this State elected, as a unique gesture of respect and admiration for the President, to hold a joint session of Dáil and Seanad.</P>
      <P>I think these facts ought to be adequately recorded in a suitable record which would be available to the members of both Houses and which I believe many citizens of the State would wish to acquire as a memorial of this exceptional occasion. I do not think I can elaborate here and now on the form and contents of the report that would be appropriate to what actually transpired but I would suggest that the matter be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Dáil and Seanad, with a view to consulting with the officials of the Houses and directing as to the form of the record we wish to have made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The purpose of these amendments is to amend subsection (1) by amendment No. 139 and also to insert a new subsection by the terms of amendment No. 142.  The section, as it stands, and particularly subsection (1), is too restrictive.  We propose to elaborate on it by the insertion of a new subsection and also by making the appropriate deletions in the existing subsection (1), thus making these powers less restrictive and the section more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 142 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>To insert the following subsection before subsection (3):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A notice under this section may be served on&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the person who commenced the development, or</P>
      <P>(b) any other person who has carried out or is carrying out development authorised by the permission,</P>
      <P>as the planning authority may decide.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This might involve other people.  Take, for instance, a building contractor who has been instructed to carry out some work for pay.  His failure, then, to comply with this direction would make the matter an offence as far as he is concerned.  Surely it would be much better to place the onus, in respect of compliance with any notice, upon the <Col N="176" /> person who gets permission in the first instance?  He gives the appropriate directions to the contractor or whoever will do the work.  If the new subsection will place the onus on some other person, the interpretation could be very wide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection is intended to deal largely with the situation that we have and deprecate, namely, the unfinished estates particularly around Dublin city and some of our other cities and towns.  At first glance, it would appear that what Deputy Jones says would be quite appropriate, that is, that the person who gets the permission should be the person after whom the powers would go in order to get things done.  Permission could have been given to any person may be last year or the year before, and so on.  When it comes to actual construction, it need not be the person to whom the permission was granted who now has anything to do with the development.  Therefore, there would be no point in following that original person.  A contractor would merely be acting as agent for whoever would be responsible: he would not be at fault.  It would be those for whom he was doing the work.  Therefore, the fear Deputy Jones has expressed is not a real fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in that sense.  With regard to sub-paragraph (b) of this new subsection (3), our thinking, as a result of our experience, is that, for instance, a builder could get a lease of the property which he is proceeding to develop.  He would then be acting and regarded as acting on his own behalf.  Then, as the lessee, we would <Col N="177" /> go after him&mdash;but not as a building contractor acting for somebody else.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with the question of bringing in the courts to decide between the planning authority and the landowner.  The previous legislation was the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, which laid down the procedure for dealing with contravention. Section 52 of that Act stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the responsible authority has served on any person under this Part of this Act a notice of their intention to exercise in relation to any structure or land a power conferred by this Part of this Act, such person may, before the date stated in such notice for the commencement of such exercise of such power, apply to the Justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district in which such structure or land is situate and on notice to the responsible <Col N="179" /> authority, for an order quashing such notice, and thereupon the Justice, unless he is satisfied that circumstances exist entitling the responsible authority to exercise such power in relation to such structure or land in the manner indicated in such notice, may make an order quashing such notice.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we have taken away in most of the sections the courts and substituted for them an appeal to the Minister.  The Minister has justified that by saying that under town planning an appeal should really be to the Minister rather than the court.  I cannot understand why at all stages we are reluctant to allow the right of appeal to the court.  If the planning authority are to be always right&mdash;and the sections suggest that would be the case&mdash;why would it not be a good thing to have that established in the courts in public?</P>
    <P>The Minister may reply by saying he is not going to ask the courts to decide what is or what is not good planning.  But that does not fall to be determined at all under this section. This is a question of fact within the planning scheme.  In other words, has the development been carried out in conformity with such permission as has been granted?  That is the issue in this case and not the question of whether it is good or bad planning.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that in this section there is not even the semblance of an appeal to the Minister.  If the planning authority can be held in all circumstances to be right, there is no reason why that fact should not be established in a public court and the justification for that planning vindicated in the court.  We should not lightly take away from the individual his right of appearing in the court in regard to the question of whether he has kept within the terms of the permission given to him.</P>
    <P>I submit that this is a reasonable amendment.  No harm can be done to the planning authority's case by this procedure, whereas it would give the individual the right to take the matter before the courts.  If he is wrong, it is not a question of bad planning but the <Col N="180" /> fact of his not keeping within the terms of the permission given to him.</P>

      <P>While the arguments used by Deputy Jones in this case would appear to be relevant, they are to a great extent purely academic inasmuch as the plan under the 1934 Act never came into existence.  In fact, that is one of the reasons why we have this Bill before us at present.  But assuming that the plan did come into operation, the parallel drawn by the Deputy does not work out.  The recourse to the courts envisaged in the 1934 Act was for the purpose of referring matters to the courts for an interpretation of the law.  What Deputy Jones seeks to have referred to the courts in this Bill is the question of determining planning merit and policy. There is a clear distinction there.</P>
      <P>I should like to reiterate that questions of planning policy and merit are matters not for the courts but for the administration and ultimately for the Minister for Local Government, who is responsible to this House for his actions.  I put it to the House that this section is paralleled by those we have already agreed and having accepted the principle that planning merit and policy are not matters for the courts but for the Minister and this House, I suggest the section should be allowed to stand as it is, bearing in mind that I have agreed to bring in an amendment on Report Stage in regard to reference to the court of any dispute on the right of entry following an enforcement notice, which will apply to this subsection.</P>
      <P>In the case of the circumstances envisaged in subsection (5) of Section 35, there probably would have been a challenge to the right of entry of the local authority and the court would have granted an order enabling the local authority to act.  This merely says that whatever may be the expense incurred, it becomes an ordinary contract debt.  This provision is a standard one in many of our laws at present and is not a new departure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a good principle in matters like this to ensure compliance with the provisions, but I do not think that the threat of a continuing fine is the best way of doing so.  I suggest if there is failure to comply with the court's order, it should be left to the ordinary court procedure to deal with the situation.  The courts have power when an order is not complied with to hold persons in contempt.  To leave that to the courts might have better <Col N="182" /> effect and secure speedier compliance with the planning authority's notice. The proper way to get compliance is not by threatening a continuing fine but by using normal court procedure and allowing the court to use its own machinery to secure that compliance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite agree. If I felt Deputy Jones's proposition would be more effective, I should be all in favour of it, but I do not think that would be the case.  The idea of a continuing fine is not only a standard one in this Bill, as we already have it in several other sections, but it is one that would make it rather unprofitable for anyone to continue to offend against the terms of the enforcement notice.  Therefore, I think we should leave it as it is rather than bring in court procedure which in some cases might be more effective, but in others, might not be effective at all. As the law stands, you will at least have the continuing fine which can become very substantial if the matter goes on for a considerable time.  That would make unprofitable almost any undertaking which should not have been there in the first place.</P>

    <P>This section applies to structures which were erected before the appointed day or after the appointed day and within five years of its erection.  The same arguments as I advanced previously hold on this section.  They are that one of the first principles of natural justice is that nobody who has an interest in a case should take to himself the powers of justice in that case.  While there is an appeal to the Minister in these cases, the Minister will not be personally hearing the appeals.  They will be heard by an official from his Department.</P>
    <P>I have already put the point to the Minister that in these cases the persons who will be determining the facts are individuals who have been in touch with all this question of planning in the Minister's Department.  I am not suggesting that that would render them less competent to be judges of fact but I am suggesting that we do not seem to give the citizens who are appealing the same status as the planning authority in this matter.  It may be that I am attributing to the individual who will hear the appeal a bias in regard to the course he might take on the case submitted by the individual who is on appeal.</P>
    <P>In natural justice, we ought to lean over in favour of the citizen who is making his case.  We believe that the courts are judges of facts and it is for that reason that we have submitted these amendments.  This amendment is in keeping with the amendments we have put down to this Bill on several occasions.  I want to put that principle to the Minister, that on this question of appeal he is not putting the citizen on the same plane as the officials of the planning authority.  The planning authority officials are officials of the Department of Local Government, even if they are at local level, and it is from <Col N="184" /> that point of view that I feel that if the ordinary citizen is to have a fair crack of the whip, it would be more equitable to allow him to appeal to the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Jones raised this issue in the way he did.  It is my wish and my anxiety to give the citizen a fair crack of the whip and we do, in fact, lean over backwards to make it easier for him. The situation will be that under this procedure there will be much less formality and much less cost attendant on these hearings which we propose to be held by an inspector who will be sent down the country than there would be through the normal procedure of the district court.</P>
      <P>The idea of these officials being employees of the Department is not true.  Sometimes I wish they were, but they are not, and I think they never will be.  I might add that in our limited experience in operating the interim control of planning, in one out of every three cases appealed, we have decided against the local authority officials.  Even with the somewhat inadequate appeal arrangements of to-day whereby no oral hearing is available, the odds are not loaded in favour of the officials as against the citizen.  In one case out of every three, we have knocked the officials and upheld the appeal of the citizen as against the views expressed by the local officials.</P>
      <P>I think the proposal for an oral hearing in the locality itself is a much better and cheaper procedure than going through the courts.  We have no reason to believe that our past experience of ministerial appeals gives any cause for concern that the rights of the citizen will be thrown overboard in favour of the directions of the executives of the local authorities. Indeed, I feel that our proposed arrangements will further strengthen the rights of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that when an inspector is sent down to hear an appeal, he will not be sent down to make a decision, to judge his case on one statement as against another.  He will be sent down to bring back a report <Col N="185" /> on all that has been put before him, for and against.  It will be only from that evidence that a decision will be arrived at over which the Minister will have to stand and for which he will be answerable to this House.  That is a fairly decent attitude to take on these matters.</P>

      <Col N="188" /> This is in keeping with our general approach.  We wanted to ensure that the onus in regard to the main plan would be on the planning authorities, that they would approach their responsibilities under this proposed legislation from that point of view and that the Minister would not interfere in any way with them and that he would leave the job to them.  We mentioned earlier that a case could arise where the Minister might have strong ideas in regard to some matter and give a direction to the planning authority for the carrying out or non-carrying out of some proposed development.  I made the point that if the planning authority refused to do these things, the Minister is empowered to order the works or development to be carried out.  I asked the theoretical question: what would happen if the planning authority were not going to carry it out?  The Minister would want it to be carried out and I could not see there was to be any appeal to the Minister, if he determined that it was to be carried out. Our approach is that the planning authority should be the primary body and should accept their responsibility without too much reference to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Under subsection (15), Section 2 of the 1939 Act, there is provision for inserting in a newspaper notice of permission given by the manager for the erection of new buildings. We never see these advertisements. I am not here trying to make <Col N="190" /> a case for every old crank in the country but there may be structures which may offend and I think the public should be capable of informing themselves of the intention to erect such structures.

      <P>I move amendment No. 169:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where an order under this section is proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are dealing with amenities as they may exist throughout the country. An amenity area may include a very large tract of land.  It seems essential that the Order provided for here should receive the prior approval of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps the Minister will ask why the Oireachtas should have the right to pronounce on the Order. The subsection as it stands says that the Orders made under it shall be laid before the House as soon as possible after they are made.  Here the Order is made by the Minister and requires a Resolution within a certain number of days to annul it.  We suggest a more appropriate way of dealing with it would be to bring in the draft Order and lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  At that stage, <Col N="191" /> if there is not a Resolution annulling the draft Order, then the Order can be made.  Why are the Oireachtas not given the right here to examine the draft of the Order before the Order is made?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of Order relevant to this subsection is one in regard to an Amenity Area Order which would specify certain types of construction that may or may not be carried out in that area.  That, in the first instance, would have been agreed by the elected body, by the elected representatives of the people.  Secondly, if opposition followed on its publication, a public inquiry would have to be held and it is only subsequent to that that the Minister would come to make the Order.  After all those safeguards, I think coming to the House would be unnecessary.  I suggest that in this case the right of annulment is more than adequate to meet the circumstances likely to arise from Orders such as this.  The local elected representatives will have had a first go at it; then there is a public inquiry; and then comes the Minister, answerable in person himself. Finally, when the Minister has made the Order and laid it before the House, within 21 days the House may take steps to annul it.  I think that is quite safe and does not call for the procedure suggested here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the safeguard is there.  The Minister brings in the Order here and if the Order is challenged, it may or may not be altered.  If a draft Order is challenged, it is the same thing.  It still does not carry much force and the Oireachtas, when reviewing it, are dealing with a draft Order rather than an Order by the Minister.  I suggest the Minister's Order should not be turned down by the Oireachtas but a draft Order might be amended.  I take it that the Minister's Order would be made on the best advice and would not be likely to be out of court.  If the Minister comes in with a draft Order, it puts the Oireachtas in the position of approving the draft Order which then becomes an Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we need <Col N="192" /> have any great worry about this.  The situation in this case is rather peculiar. I think it has not a parallel with any of the other provisions for which we may have similar powers or seek them. Even after the 21 days in the case of a ministerial Order, after which it has the force of law, there is nothing sacrosanct about it.  The Minister may, if he thinks fit, afterwards go against the provisions of that Order by a decision on appeal. I think it would be akin to being somewhat discourteous to the House if an Order were brought in and had positive approval and at the same time it meant no more than that it was a good guide for the moment in that the terms could be changed by the Minister on an individual appeal thereafter.  Therefore, it will be seen that this is not of the nature of the Order the Deputy has in mind.  It is not as definite a document as might be an Order which we normally refer to the House for prior approval.</P>

      <P>In many places in my constituency, large estates were planted in the past, and these lands, which lent charm and beauty to the area, have now come into the possession of the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands.  Certain types of trees do not come to maturity for 150 years.  These lands were a wonderful amenity, even before the State had anything to do with them.  If the Department of Lands can act independently of the planning authority in this matter and cut down trees, we are placing them in a position different from that of the ordinary citizen.  I do not wish to suggest that there would be ruthless destruction of our woodlands, but there is every good reason why any Department of State should not alone comply with the law but set the example in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking of places in my constituency such as Adare and the green wood in Kilfinane, about which Canon Sheehan wrote in <i>Glenanaar.</i> We also think of Killarney, where the Department of Lands have a large interest in the National Park, and the area around Killaloe.  If trees were to be removed in these areas, it would interfere very much with the amenities there.  It would be disastrous if the planning authority could not insist on some kind of co-ordination by Departments of State.  Any Department of State is merely a collection of individuals exercising their own judgement in these matters.  I am not prepared to agree that their judgment would be superior to the judgment of the experts of the planning authority.  I am rather disappointed to hear that Departments of State are not being brought within the ambit of this legislation.  If that is not done, will semi-State bodies seek <Col N="196" /> the same type of exemption?  Will they seek to carry on in their own way without reference to the planning for each area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Government Departments as a whole are out and semi-State bodies and so on are in.  This Bill, if passed by the Oireachtas, will, in effect, be a statement of Government policy on future planning.  Each Minister will have collective responsibility to ensure that the planning legislation is adhered to.  The Department of Lands are one of the prescribed bodies. There will therefore be liaison between that Department and the Department of Local Government on the matter of amenity conservation.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Jones that afforestation or deforestation can have a great effect on the amenities of an area.  We are not unaware of the need for the greatest harmony between the two Departments on this matter. When the Bill is enacted, there are to be further discussions with the Minister for Lands with a view to establishing the proper type of liaison between the Forestry Division and the planning section of my Department.  So far as the removal or planting of trees by the Forestry Division is concerned, there will be the closest co-operation between the two Departments.</P>

      <P>Close co-operation between the two Departments might not be sufficient.  I have in mind a case in my constituency of a magnificent grove of trees running down to a cove. The land changed hands and the new owner applied for permission to the Forestry Division to cut down the trees.  The whole place was denuded and is an eyesore.  It would be well if there were provision whereby the forestry authorities in various areas would communicate with the local authority and ascertain if there was any objection to cutting certain trees in that area.  There is always the danger that a nice grove of trees will change hands and that the new owner will apply for permission to cut them, saying he will plant so many trees instead; that he will get permission or, in the event of getting no reply, assume he had permission and cut the trees. <Col N="197" /> That is a situation we should be very careful about.  I think the authority should be in a position to serve an order on such a person telling him to stop.</P>

      <P>In certain limited areas, the planning authority may, in the first instance, suggest and agree that certain types of birds may not be killed at all or that no type of bird may be killed. We must remember that this would be done because it is felt by the planning authorities that this is a general amenity and in the public interest that a type of bird might be preserved or that there should be a bird sanctuary in a particular area.  This confirms the power of a planning authority to initiate such a scheme.  The arguments that can be made for and against it on the basis of the rights of individuals will naturally come to the surface where such a measure is proposed and there can be discussion and inquiry before an order is actually made.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We wax hot and cold on the rights of local authorities, their elected representatives as distinct from managers.  Here we have permissive legislation which will repose in the hands of the elected members of a planning authority the right to initiate some such conservation as has been mentioned.  If they do so, there is first the right of appeal by an aggrieved party with provision for oral hearings at which the whole story can be told regarding the injustice or the loss the landowner may suffer.  If the appeal is rejected, the scheme goes ahead, but if it is a serious matter, compensation will be payable to the landowner for the loss he sustains in being prevented from shooting game on his own land, game which he would say were feeding on his lands.  It is not easy to prove what birds feed on what land.</P>
      <P>We must remember that this will be done rarely but we should have the power to use in certain circumstances. Its operation by the elected representatives will be the greatest possible safeguard. They will be the people who will initiate and approve of this in the first instance.  If they do not do that, the matter will not arise at all and if they do it, and if there are aggrieved parties, there will be an appeal and an oral hearing.  If the appeal is thrown out, there will be the right of compensation if the person can show that he will sustain a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision is not likely to be used for the wholesale prohibition on <Col N="200" /> the shooting of game.  I would rather envisage that it will be used in regard to a particular type of bird in a particular area, a type of bird that is peculiar or unique to our country, a type of bird that is in short supply and that is getting less because of the depredations of sportsmen or of its natural enemies.  It may be found that this particular type of bird is something that should be preserved and therefore the areas which the birds frequent will be created conservation areas in order that this particular attraction will not be wiped out for ever and always.</P>
    <P>It is along those lines that this provision will be used.  Its initiation will stem from the elected members of the councils and will not be at the direction of any single individual officer or executive.  It will have to come from the elected body before it gets off the ground at all and then there will be the right of appeal and the right of compensation.</P>

      <P>I have to speak on this matter again because it is not properly a function of a planning authority at all.  I think we are entering a completely new field, a field that is not within the ambit of local government. I can see a case arising where these powers could be extended to include a herd of deer.  We could have a herd of deer trampling a farmer's crops all over the place.  I have some experience of the destruction that can be done by a herd of deer and how this matter can be a proper function for the Department of Local Government beats me.  The question of game sanctuaries and game preservation belongs to another Department and has nothing to do with town planning.  I think we are including powers in the Bill which were never envisaged by the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I think the real danger in the Bill is that this section, which has nothing to do with town planning, gives these powers to the elected representatives.  The proper preservation of game is not a matter that interests everybody.  The majority of county councillors or urban councillors will have little knowledge and <Col N="201" /> less interest in these matters but they are often subject to the opinions of various crackpot individuals who know even less than the public representatives themselves.</P>
      <P>The best snipe bog in Ireland is in county Louth.  If we go out on a Sunday morning to shoot snipe and one wounded bird falls on the road, there would be an outcry from some people.  They would say that the poor little snipe did not have a chance although only about one in every five snipe shot at is hit.  Yet the members of Dundalk urban council, not one of whom shoots, could demand that shooting be forbidden on this bog.  I am being eaten out of house and home by the pigeons of Drogheda and the only reason I have not had five or six men in shooting them is that there would be some woman to say that we were brutes, unfair and cruel.  That is the only reason I have not been shooting pigeons in Drogheda for the past five years.</P>

      <P>I know it would affect my votes.  This is not a function of the Minister for Local Government. The preservation of game is a function of the Minister for Lands and now this provision gives power to local authorities in relation to game matters. There are only two lines of thought about game matters.  One is that of the owner of land who decides whether he wants it shot over and if he will charge for the shooting rights on it and the other is the point of view of the person who wants to shoot over the land. These are the only people who have any interest in this thing.  Here we are to have members of local authorities badgered by people who know nothing about the matter and they are to have the right to have game birds declared inviolate and untouchable.  From what I have heard the Minister say, he does not know much about it.</P>

      <P>There are county councils in the country the members of which might know something about this matter.  Can you imagine the rebellion which would be started if these county councillors decided that they were going to thin out the flora and fauna of a particular estate or on a particular farmer's ground?  They might decide that they were going in on his land to shoot his deer or pheasants.  They might even come along and say that he had some shrubs on his land which he should not have, tear them up and take them away.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that I am all in favour of giving power to the public representatives but this is one matter on which I would warn him to be careful.  I suggest to the Minister if he wants to make this provision a good piece of law he should leave it to the Department that has been dealing with game preservation and should strike this out of this Bill altogether.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a misunderstanding here, as if we were talking about nothing but game birds. That, in fact, is unlikely to be the subject of this development at all.  We are rather more likely to be dealing with rare birds that are not designated as game and dealing with rare fauna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Golden eagles, if we have them.  There are also two examples of rare fauna, one called the natterjack toad and the other known as Cole's char.  Deputy Lynch's suggestion that we should leave them to the Department which was minding them in the past does not hold because nobody was minding them.  To Deputy Clinton, I would say that this matter of the protection of the flora and fauna has come to be regarded as a matter that impinges on amenity and amenity is the very essence of planning.  As such, it is appropriate that it should be dealt with by this Bill and not by some other Bill.  Somebody might suggest what Department or what Bill should look <Col N="203" /> after them.  The suggestion was made that the Department of Lands should do it but, in the first place, I do not think they would want to and in the second, there is no reason, just because they control the time for shooting game birds, they should be made responsible for this as well, especially since this type of Bill is much more the medium through which this conservation can be done.  There is nothing new about this, in that it is regarded as part of our amenity to preserve that which is rare and worthwhile.  It is being done in other countries.  It is new to us but not in the sense that it is something outlandish which has suddenly come down from the skies. Deputy Donegan referred to the Minister as not knowing what he was talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We can, but do not forget that at the moment, in so far as game bird protection is concerned, you can be stopped or restricted whether you are on your own or anybody else's land, from shooting particular birds at particular times and in fact from shooting some birds all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that there is the attempt made to restrict shooting of particular birds between certain times and yet that is accepted as a good thing.  Why, then, is there all this objection or opposition to this?  It does not relate to game birds in the main and is unlikely to deal with them, but it deals with rare birds which could be something we would be proud to <Col N="204" /> preserve in the future, something that would give us pleasure and might attract people to come here to see these birds in their natural surroundings.  In the last analysis, if it can come to the point that a farmer or landowner can be said to be at a loss by rearing and feeding these birds at his own expense on his own land, and then by an order which originated from the local authority, he is denied the right or pleasure of shooting these birds, and if that can be shown, then there is provision in the compensation section of this Bill to have him compensated.  I cannot see anything wrong with that.</P>

The Minister should put into the Bill that he is mainly concerned with rare species of birds which need to be preserved and he could mention golden eagles.  You could have a whole lot of &ldquo;boyos&rdquo; who could use this to suit themselves.  When the Bill is going through the House, that is the time to make things clear.</P>

      <P>I am seriously concerned that this type of legislation is leading us back to the position in <Col N="205" /> which the farmers were before we put the landlords out, when it was treason to tread on a traneen, and when a farmer could not fire a shot on his own land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>But they bought their farms, knowing they had not got the shooting rights.  We are setting out now to take the right from the man who enjoys it.  In a big town or city, there may be a large number of people who have no connection with land but are interested in shooting.  A particular farmer may have no interest in their anxiety to shoot but he is compelled to provide pleasure for them by conserving game which he does not want on his farm.  That is what we are asking for in this Bill.  There is something wrong about reducing the rights of farmers on their own property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's comparison of this legislation with the law about open seasons is puerile.  We all know that in regard to game, open seasons are related to breeding seasons and in respect of individual birds which are becoming scarce. There is a particularly short season for partridge.  The power of elected representatives of local authorities to decide that any particular place within their local jurisdiction shall be a game sanctuary is a power I could not agree with and although I am only one Deputy out of 143, I will dissent from this section of the Bill.  I shall stay here until this debate ends and will still dissent from it.  I suggest that the Minister undertake to the House to have another look at this before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Let us look at subsection (1):</P>
      <P>for prohibiting (subject to any exemptions for which provision may be made by the order) the taking, killing, or destroying of flora or fauna except with the consent of the planning authority ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, a local authority may decide the habitation of the ordinary mallard is of such amenity value that <Col N="206" /> the people who for generations have got enjoyment from watching them breeding and all the rest of it are to be prohibited from so doing, or from shooting them in season.  I sincerely urge the Minister to do something about this provision between now and Report Stage because obviously this is the work of some nut in the Custom House, somebody who knows nothing about shooting or sport of any sort. I would not be worrying if this power had been given to the Minister or his successors but here we will have local authorities declaring God knows what to be of special amenity value and depriving local people of the right to enjoy something they have enjoyed for generations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton's case was based largely on a landowner's rights over his land.  It is quite a valid argument and one which the Minister should also examine between now and Report Stage.  I wonder if the Minister listened to the speech of the Minister for Lands, his colleague, when he spoke of the rights of landowners?  I can assure the Minister, and I am far from wishing his early demise or anything like that, that these rights will be enjoyed long after him.  I may have been a little too energetic in my arguments and perhaps there is therefore a temptation for the Minister to say to us on this side: &ldquo;Go to blazes,&rdquo; but I feel the Minister should undertake to have another look at this section.  I can tell him now that I shall stay here until 10.30, if necessary, without my tea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Just about.  It is quite evident from the last few remarks of the Deputy that he has not been here because if he had been, he would be fully aware that there has not been so far any argument for argument's sake.  I do not propose to follow the Deputy's lead because I want this Bill <Col N="207" /> dealt with properly and I do not want to have a town fair about it.  The subsection says:</P>
      <P>It is expedient in the interests of amenity to make provision for the protection of any flora or fauna of any area.</P>
      <P>There you have the two qualifications before you get off at all.  That statement is contained in lines 9, 10 and 11 of the very first subsection of Section 46.  Despite the fact that Deputy Donegan has suggested we might have another look at this and that one would be inclined to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; because he asked for it in that tone of voice, I will say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and will between now and Report Stage endeavour to provide here further qualifications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I can, I shall make every effort to have it provided for Report Stage and come back here with a greater safeguard by way of further elaboration.  Having said that, I must point out this is not a power being thrown to the elected bodies.  However, if it were being thrown at them, I would throw it to the elected bodies before I would give it to any other group.  Of course here we are not talking about urban councils because they have very little to do with birds, at least not the kind of birds we are talking about here, even allowing that their perimeters extend considerably.  This will be in the hands of county councils and can anybody seriously suggest that the members of any county council in Ireland are so bereft of commonsense as to take action on the lines feared by Deputies Donegan and Clinton&mdash;that they would trample on the rights of landowners, of country people?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely nobody can seriously suggest that 26, 24 or 21 men drawn from rural parts of a county would be guilty of any of the actions in respect of which the Deputies have expressed fears here, that they would take away the rights of landowners? If there is any group in whose hands I <Col N="208" /> would leave those powers in the knowledge that they would do nothing wrong, it is a county council.  I would leave such powers with them safely and without question because it would be far beyond them to injure the farming community.  In fact, are not many of the members of county councils landowners themselves?  If, by any mischance, something should come about, there is an appeal to the Minister and the Minister in this matter will be guided in his consideration by the best experts we can procure from whatever part of the world we may have to get them.</P>
      <P>This matter will not be dealt with lightly and certainly if there is an appeal, if a council have made a mistake and treated unduly lightly the rights of a landowner, thus negativing his rights over his land, no Minister for Local Government who wants to remain, not alone a Minister but a member of this House, will stand over such action.  As I have said already, I shall have another look at this section with a view to providing further qualifications which will make for a less easy way through, lest injury might be caused.  The whole idea of the Bill is to improve things for everybody as best we can.  It would be a complete negation of the whole spirit of the Bill if the powers given under it were, by their use, made to interfere with any considerable number of people and their enjoyment of life.  I shall certainly have a further look at the terms of this and I shall be only too glad to put in any other qualification I can get.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Minister for taking it in that spirit.  I have the greatest sympathy with Deputy Clinton's argument, being a farmer.  However, I am talking now for the shooters.  In any local authority area, you will find the shooters in a very great minority.  Representations to members of local authorities would be far greater from those who might conserve birds in a given area than from those who would want them, in proper sporting fashion, for shooting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister rather implies that talking about the urban area means shooting pheasants in O'Connell Street. <Col N="209" /> It is true that at estuaries, where urban areas are along the sea, and at other such points, there are shooting amenities within urban areas.</P>

If an individual will be prevented from doing certain things having regard to flora or fauna in his area, is there any good reason why he should not be compensated at that stage in regard to it? Consider, for instance, the imposition of a condition on a Department of State: We would not interfere with their rights.  Even if it is admitted it is in the interests of an amenity, is there any reason why an individual should not be compensated if the local authority act in a certain way?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 178:</P>
      <P>To delete subsections (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Where a planning authority are of an opinion that there is need for a public right of way over land, they may apply to the Minister for an order creating a public right of way over the land but the Minister shall not make an order creating a public right of way over the land until he has caused a public local inquiry to be held and has considered any objections to the making of the order and the report of the person who held the inquiry.</P>
      <P>( ) Where a planning authority apply to the Minister for an order under subsection (1) of this section, they shall serve a notice of the application for such order on every person who is the owner or occupier of any land over which a public right of way is sought to be created.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing now with land compulsorily <Col N="211" /> acquired.  The normal procedure in that instance is to hold a public inquiry before acquisition. Under subsections (2) and (3) of Section 21, there is the question of protection of a public right of way. Is there any reason why a similar protection should not be afforded here in respect of a right of way?  While compensation is payable under Section 62 to the owners of land, the compensation payable for land acquired under the Assessment of Compensation Act, 1919, is never adequate.  The arbitrator who assesses the compensation under the Act has to operate within very narrow rules.  The general view is that landowners seldom get the compensation from public authorities which they would get if they were running a similar facility voluntarily. Therefore, we submit that the Minister should not make this order until the inquiry is held and the objections of the persons concerned are considered.  Where the planning authority propose to make this right of way, they ought to give notice beforehand to the occupier of the lands.</P>

      <P>In connection with this section, Deputy Sweetman asked me whether the sum represented by the maximum to which we now propose to raise the limit of the moneys provided for CTT had any capital content. After the Deputy left yesterday, I explained to the House there is no capital provision in the funds provided under this Bill or the last Act for CTT. The limit that has already been imposed was £1 million, of which sum £850,000 had already been spent.  That £850,000 was made up as follows: 1959-60, £97,000; 1960-61, £266,000; 1961-62, £241,885; 1962-63, £245,000, making a total of £849,885&mdash;all voted moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that all the sums paid to CTT so far had been voted on Supply Services Estimates. I did not understand why, when they were being paid on annual Estimates each year, there was an overriding limit.  It is not usual to have an overriding limit when it is voted on <Col N="213" /> annual Supply Services Estimates instead of being expenditure out of the Central Fund.  If there is expenditure out of the Central Fund, there is always an overriding limit.  The Minister will remember that before he shrugged off the ESB that was the position in relation to them and in relation to CIE.  In relation to voted Supply Services it is not usual to have the limit referred to.  On that account I thought there was a segregation of the annual voted amounts of grants for capital purposes, such as the buying of property envisaged in Section 4.  Do I understand from the Minister that the £850,000 is the total of all voted moneys, whether used for the transient purpose of a stand at the Dusseldorf Fair or for the purpose of buying premises in London or elsewhere that will endure for the next 20 years?  How do they hold their offices here in Dublin, for example?</P>

    <Title>Committee On Finance. - Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1962&mdash; Committee Stage (resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete subsections (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Where a planning authority are of an opinion that there is need for a public right of way over land, they may apply to the Minister for an order creating a public right of way over the land but the Minister shall not make an order creating a public right of way over the land until he has caused a public local inquiry to be held and has considered any objections to the making of the order and the report of the person who held the inquiry.</P>
    <P>( ) Where a planning authority apply to the Minister for an order <Col N="216" /> under subsection (1) of this section, they shall serve a notice of the application for such order on every person who is the owner or occupier of any land over which a public right of way is sought to be created.&rdquo;&mdash;Deputy Jones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I moved to report progress on this amendment which is designed to ensure that the normal procedure for the compulsory acquisition of land would hold in this case. As Section 48 is drafted at present subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to the planning authority that there is need for a public right of way over any land, the planning authority may by order create a public right of way over the land.</P>
      <P>Under Section 21, the existence of a public right of way can be made the subject of an application to the circuit court and is there any less valid reason why a similar protection should not be afforded in the case of the creation of a right of way?  While compensation is payable under Section 62, the amount of the compensation is never quite adequate.  The arbitrator who assesses the compensation has to operate within very narrow rules and the view is generally held that landowners seldom get a compensation from public authorities that they would get if they were giving similar facilities voluntarily or in private transactions.</P>
      <P>I referred on Second Reading to the provisions of the 1919 Act regarding the giving of compensation and I pointed out that in the famous legal case of <i>Comyn v. Clare County Council,</i> it was held that was not the way in which compensation should be awarded.  It was decided by judicial process on that occasion.  We are concerned here with the procedure whereby a right of way is being compulsorily created.  The section gives authority to the planning authority to create a public right of way by making an order.  I cannot see any valid reason why the same procedure as is adopted under the compulsory acquisition of land, the holding of a public inquiry, should not operate where there is this creation of a right of way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="217" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section, we envisage a situation different from that of acquiring land to make a roadway. We do not envisage the acquisition of the soil; rather do we envisage the operation of an easement so as to enable the public to pass over the land. That is the distinct difference between the approach to the two things.  As far as going to the circuit court about an existing right of way in concerned, you go to the court to establish whether such a right of way does exist.  In this case, there is no argument that a right of way exists.  A right of way is being created.  There is no need to determine whether there is a right of way because a right of way is being created in the first case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones is probably looking at this matter from a different point of view from that from which I have approached it.  He would appear to look at it from the point of view of the landowner, whereas I am concerned with ensuring that amenities such as a good beach or bathing place or a riverside walk may not be cut off from the public by a change of ownership&mdash;cut off from the public who have enjoyed it in various ways without any right of way.  For instance, if someone buys a stretch of foreshore which has been open to the public for generations, we may find that wires go up, gates are made and locks go on, and suddenly a nice beach is denied to the public and particularly to the locals who have enjoyed it undisturbed for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such a situation, I envisage the planning authority stepping in and creating a right of way to that beach or that riverside.  In that case, there will be an appeal to the Minister but not to the courts.  It is in order to facilitate the enjoyment of amenities that can be got at only by passing over lands that we are giving power to planning authorities to create a right of way.  It is to make it possible for the public to enjoy these amenities even though no right of way did exist or no definite pathway that we are doing this, even if the public have to go over acres of land.  Suddenly those acres of land are no longer open; they have been fenced in, and we want to ensure that because they have been fenced in or a gate <Col N="218" /> erected to prevent access to them, the rights people have enjoyed will not be denied to them.  Under the present law, they would not have a sustainable case to ensure that.  It is on those grounds and from that angle that this should be approached.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider the point I was making previously? When a special oral hearing is about to take place in regard to the creation of this right of way, the public in an area, not alone a restricted area but a larger area, could have an interest in such a determination, and would he consider that the planning authority should publicly announce that such an inquiry was to be held and do that by way of notice in the paper?  In that way, the public would know that the inquiry was to take place.  The public could have a great interest in the type of inquiry envisaged here in the matter of creating <Col N="221" /> rights of way and I think it should not be restricted to owners of the property involved.  I am talking about people who may have enjoyed the right of access to a beach, for instance, and over which the creation of a right of way is now involved.  Since the public would have considerable interest in it, they ought to be given an opportunity of attending oral hearings and, if they want to do so, of tendering evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 180:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), page 40, line 12, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after giving at least three days' notice to the owner or occupier of land affected&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that the owner of land will be given reasonable notice by the planning authority that they propose to enter on his land.  We have already dealt with the type of objection which the owner of land might have to entry by the public authority, and in this instance, I would ask the Minister whether, if the owner of land intends to resist the right of entry, he will be given notice of the planning authority's intention to enter.  Does the Minister intend under the amendment he proposes for Report Stage to cover the opposition of an individual who intends to resist the entry of the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to cover it for the very good reason that we have this section, and for the same reason that I am not accepting this amendment.  If, as will be the case in regard to a right of way, the local authority are responsible for its maintenance and a cavity appeared or a rabbit burrow collapsed on <Col N="222" /> the right of way and somebody injured himself as a result, the local authority would be liable for any damage so caused.  It is too restrictive and too unfair to the local authority to suggest they should give three days' notice before going on to the land to repair the right of way. In the meantime, somebody could be hurt and claim heavy damages for the council's negligence in failing to maintain the right of way.</P>
      <P>Since there is a right of way, anybody can go across that land.  The situation is not so serious if the local authority can go in and repair the surface of the right of way: it is not quite the same thing as encroaching on another man's land because already any member of the public may cross that right of way.  It is, in fact, necessary that the local authority should not be restricted from carrying out repairs except after the expiration of so many days' notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily see that point of view but I feel sure the Minister will concede that if the planning authority created a public right of way on, say, the head of a cliff or along the foreshore by the seaside, and that through a storm damage was caused and somebody hurt, the planning authority would need to move in quickly.  In such case, grave hardship could be caused to the property on which the right of way has been created.  Take the case of a landowner who has planted a crop right up to the right of way.  In this we are giving the right to the planning authority to drive over that crop.</P>

      <P>They are not entitled to do it, with or without notice.  This relates to Section 49 which has to do with the maintenance of existing rights of way.  It is restricted to that section and to that section only.  With or without notice, the authority are not entitled to drive through a crop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but by no provision of this Bill.  You would obviously rely on the time-honoured common law to retain the rights of the individual.  If a landowner can show he was injured by trespass, there is no doubt about the question of compensation.</P>

      <P>Initially, in the laying out of the right of way, compensation would be payable arising out of the provisions of this Bill.  On the question of subsequent happenings and damage arising as a sort of side-effect of their operations of repairing or maintaining some defect in the right of way, we do not regard it as necessary to state it here or to try to provide a section to cover it as well as the common law would at the moment cover such an eventuality. Unless we had a great number of sections, and so on, if we tried to do so, we should probably fall short of what the rights are at the moment under common law.  He has his rights under the common law and would succeed, if injured, without any doubt.</P>

Local authorities will not assist people to do something just for themselves and for their own benefit at public expense. This is an all-embracing and enabling <Col N="225" /> provision so that local authorities may encourage a private group effort rather than an individual effort to do things which the local authority believe are good and constitute an improvement in the locality and are an amenity or improvement of the amenities of the locality.</P>

      <P>I would&mdash;but I would not require other people to put up with it: that is the difference.  The restriction on the right to complain to a minimum of three ratepayers residing within the area is bad.  Take a person with the right to clothing, support and maintenance in a house&mdash; which is very common in rural Ireland &mdash;but who, at the same time, is not a ratepayer.  What would be the position of such a person.  Take an elderly <Col N="226" /> person living with relations.  He or she is not a ratepayer.  It is very desirable that there should not be provision for the crank who would abuse the right to complain.  This amendment seeks to provide that the court would have knowledge of the whole background of the interference.  We agree the section is entirely desirable.  However, in regard to confining it to the three ratepayers, I have instanced cases where adult citizens would be prevented from making a complaint, although they might be disturbed.  Our amendment is designed to ensure that adult persons would have this right no less than ratepayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 183:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (5) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 78 of this Act an offence under this section may be heard and determined by a District Justice upon the complaint, verbal or otherwise, of a member of the Garda Síochána or any adult person having his permanent residence in the area where the offence is alleged to have been committed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we want to do in this amendment is to ensure that the individual will not be held up to any opprobrium by reason of having to make a complaint in regard to disturbance.  A nuisance can be a great nuisance and everybody may complain about it, but people do not like to proceed against their neighbours, because their neighbours may be all right in every other way.  By this amendment, we have to convince the Minister and the House that it is more desirable that the Garda, who are primarily concerned with the peace of an area, should act on behalf of the community.  If the area is being <Col N="229" /> disturbed persistently, the Garda will certainly be aware of it.  Since they have the responsibility of maintaining the peace of an area, it is only reasonable to assume they ought to have the obligation of proceeding for the abatement of nuisance.  That would avoid the invidious situation of neighbour proceeding against neighbour and also the inherent risk of the individual who proceeds losing the case and having costs awarded against him.</P>
    <P>Since action was taken in the first instance in the interests of the community, if costs are to lie, I suggest the community should bear them.  That would be done by the Garda proceeding against the individual concerned. The State interferes at present in many ordinary rights of individuals and it is not invidious that police officers should have this power which we seek to give them in this amendment.  They know the procedure required in maintaining peace and law and order.  They know the procedure of taking a person before the court.  If the evidence is not sufficient and if costs are awarded in an action taken by the public interest, the community should bear those costs rather than the individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The section does not preclude the Garda coming into this and initiating legal action.  I cannot see the point in the amendment because subsection (4) says:</P>
      <P>A person who contravenes this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.</P>
      <P>If a Garda officer, off his own bat, becomes aware of such an offence, it is up to him to take appropriate action. If the matter is brought to his notice under the section, it is still up to him to take action.  What is in the amendment is I feel adequately covered in subsection (4) as I see it.  It did not clearly emerge from reading the amendment what was intended but so far nothing has been advanced to make it appear that subsection (4) does not give all that is intended to be added by the amendment.</P>

But subsection (1), both (a) and (b) in fact take in the question of premises so that Deputy Jones is right to the extent that under subsection (4) a Garda cannot, on his own initiative, take proceedings even <Col N="231" /> though a complaint has been made to him in respect of premises coming under subsection (1) (b) unless the notice has been served?

I should have thought the Derelict Sites Act would have contained it but I discovered that it did not.  It is this question of litter and other organic matter that prompts me to refer to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is leading into the town of Bray a new road called Killarney Road which replaces an old road. There is one section of that road there in a kind of loop forming portion of <Col N="233" /> the old road and there is a very fine house off the old road.  I think the owners of the house are the only users of the road to get in and out of their property but this section of the old road has become now completely disused and is used principally, as far as I can see, as a tinkers' camp and general refuse dump.  I know the council there are most anxious to do something about it and the owners of the property are also anxious that something should be done about it.  However, my inquiries indicate that the difficulty is that there is one person who might have rights through it whose consent has not been obtained.  I should like to know from the Minister if under this section or any other section of the present Act, an area such as that could be saved from becoming a nuisance to the residents of the area and also a nuisance to the local authority.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section shall not apply where the advertisement is temporarily exhibited for the purposes of a public meeting.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This subsection is designed to deal with the advertisement which is temporarily exhibited for the purpose of a public meeting.  Subsection (1) by its terms effectively prohibits the display of the customary advertisements of an election meeting.  It would certainly impede the democratic process if such advertisements were to be prohibited and, in any event, it is certain that even if the subsection were to prohibit such advertisements, it would not be observed. As the section stands, it would even prohibit the laying of a cardboard advertisement against a wall or roadside. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there will be no infringement of this democratic right in relation to election meetings.  The exercise of the democratic right of individuals to submit themselves to the electorate should not be hindered in any way.  In this amendment, we seek to ensure that that right will be preserved.</P>

      <P>Under the section, as drafted, it would be an offence for an election candidate to cause a poster to be put on an ESB post.  The Minister says he proposes by regulation to exempt such practices.  I am wondering just where he gets that power to make such a regulation.  Would such a regulation be <i>ultra vires</i>?  The Minister says he has power under Section 4, but, in fact, subsection (2) paragraph (a) of Section 4 provides that &ldquo;The Minister may by regulation provide <Col N="237" /> for any class of development being exempted development for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;.  The regulations the Minister will make under Section 4 will be regulations dealing with exempted development.  There is nothing which gives him power to make regulations exempting any person or organisation in regard to any practice under Section 53.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest difficulties may arise in this regard.  The Minister says he has power under Section 4 and he refers me to the definition of exempted development. Exempted development is defined in Section 4.  The closest I can get to it is subparagraph (1) (h) and it might be easily suggested, I think, that this paragraph is not wide enough to cover the particular activity we have in mind, an activity both sides would agree it is both necessary and desirable to have covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that under Section 53 of the Bill as now drafted, it will be forbidden for any election candidate to put a poster anywhere other than outside his own house, or on a hoarding provided by a commercial firm.  The Minister is proposing to take power by regulation to alter that.  I very much doubt whether he has that power, and I think it may be found that such power is <i>ultra vires.</i> We all <Col N="238" /> know what happens in this life.  We all know that regulations of this sort slip through and, with the best of resolutions, things are forgotten.  It is quite easy to imagine circumstances arising six months after the regulations are made where this is not adverted to, where regulations go through, and we are then saddled with something that will not permit the ordinary democratic process to take place.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would ruin the Minister's Bill if he agreed to the amendment.  It is a reasonable one, and an important one.  There may be other things that will be exempted under Section 53.  If he has power, let the Minister exempt them by regulation. This is not a small, unimportant matter.  It is an important one.  We all know from our experience in the heat and tussle of an election campaign that when people wave Acts and say: &ldquo;You have no power to do this&rdquo;. there is not much use in saying that regulations were made at some time by some Minister.  It would be better to have it in the Act.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2) of Section 4 the Minister will have power to make special exemption regulations. In section 53 there is a clear illustration of an exemption and that is, that while I may be exempted in the sense of putting up a poster and displaying an advertisement on my own door, that exemption would not cover me sticking the poster on my neighbour's door.  My property can be exempted.</P>

      <P>I am sure this is a matter to which the Minister has given considerable thought, but I think it would be worthwhile giving it more consideration.  It seems to me that the Minister is relying on Section 4 to make regulations exempting certain developments.  He says that by regulations one of the exempted developments will be election posters and advertisements of meetings.  If I am prosecuted under Section 53 for putting a notice on an ESB lamp-post, how will I be able to say I am not guilty of an offence under Section 53.</P>

If I am prosecuted for putting a poster on an ESB lamp-post during a general election, even though it may be an exempted development by regulation, what answer will I have in the District Court to the Garda who says: &ldquo;You have not got the permission of the ESB.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I still am not clear as to the relative significance of Section 53 and Section 24.  Section 24 provides that, &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, permission shall be required under this Part of this Act&rdquo; to develop one thing or another. Section 24 is in Part IV of the Bill, and Section 53 is in a completely different Part of the Bill, Part V.  To an ordinary person, it would seem that Section 53 lays down that in one set of circumstances an offence is committed, and in another set of circumstances no offence is committed.  I understood the Minister to say that no <Col N="241" /> matter what is stated in Section 53 it goes back to Section 24 and that, irrespective of what is stated in black and white in Section 53, you must still get permission under Section 24 or you commit an offence.</P>

      <P>There was one other point I wanted to put to the Minister.  The section says &ldquo;... who is not the owner, occupier or person in charge...&rdquo;  How does that apply in the case of a public road?  Who is regarded as the occupier or person in charge of a public road?  I am thinking of the ordinary case where there is fly-posting done in election time or where dance bands put up posters on trees along a country road.  Who is the person in charge there?  Is it the council or the occupier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We all regard ourselves as the owners of the road when it comes to posters at election times. Where property adjoining the side of the road is concerned, the owner is the person responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the widening of roads, fences are frequently moved back and quite often we find occasional trees left in a group in the roadway or in a lay-by.  It sometimes happens that quite large areas are taken into the roadway.  These are not within the ownership of the estate bounding the road.  They would form part of the road and who is responsible in that instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>We have confined this matter to the question of public meetings and we have been talking about election times but public meetings can be held with regard to many other matters besides election meetings.  We have bodies posting temporary advertisements outside churches or on roadside trees inviting people to meet them with regard to such matters as group water schemes.  We can have posters with regard to the annual meeting of a hurling club or with regard to the Fianna Fáil national collection.  Is there any reason why we should not allow that democratic right to continue?</P>
      <P>In dealing with elections we would be dealing with the people of the country as a whole but in country districts you have appeals to people to get together for many purposes of interest to the locality.  Is there any reason why people should be prosecuted for carrying out that democratic process?  I think it is unwise and I would have thought that the Minister would have accepted this amendment to meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware, having been in contact with the matter, of the necessity for calling people together to participate in a piped water supply. That is a matter in which the rural areas are deeply concerned.  Or there may be a meeting in connection with the extension of rural electrification and the general method of summoning people together to partake in these meetings is not by sending notices through the post but by putting up a temporary notice in a prominent position that a public meeting is to be held.  Is there any reason why the people who put up such notices should <Col N="243" /> be prosecuted for doing something that, up to this, they have been perfectly free to do?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should accept this amendment.  It does not interfere with the Bill and does not narrow the power given by way of regulation.  The Minister can make regulations with regard to elections. He controls the holding of elections, their timing and the length they will last but he cannot indicate when any particular hurling club will hold its annual meeting, or when a meeting of the local Red Cross will be held, or when there will be a meeting in support of the Freedom from Hunger Campaign.  I do not think it is a good thing that these people should be subject to the risk of prosecution for doing something in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I appeal earnestly to the Minister to accept the amendment.  By doing that he will observe the democratic process but by doing otherwise he would be inviting people to break the law.  People will put up these temporary advertisements irrespective of who tells them that they are not to do it.  The Minister should not make a law which is immediately going to invite its own breach.  That would be an unwise thing to do and the public have had the right for many years of summoning people to meet in this manner.  I deprecate the type of fly-posting which is sometimes indulged in during an election but I would invite the Minister very earnestly to accept the amendment which will in no way detract from what he has in mind.</P>

      <P>It is the intention to exempt the matters which Deputy Jones rightly points out are enjoyed by the public for the purposes of summoning local meetings.  However, what we never had a right to do was to deface other people's property and we are saying that that may not be done in future.  We are exempting the facilities that have been enjoyed by the people in this matter but, at the same time, we say that you may not deface other people's property.</P>

      <P>This is a most unsatisfactory section.  It prohibits any person other than the owner of a place or the occupier in charge from putting up any kind of poster.  I am against indiscriminate flyposting all over the country but we are asking the Minister <Col N="245" /> to do this by legislation and not by regulation.  Bill posting is very important and I am satisfied with what the Minister told me so far as it relates to people like ourselves during an election but I want to go over what my colleagues said.  All through the year, in every part of the country, there are groups of people such as the Red Cross, the ICA, the Freedom from Hunger campaign, who want to appeal for funds.  One of the best means of letting people know that they intend to hold a collection is by putting up a poster in a parish.  This section is a little too drastic in that regard.  The Minister should give us more hope that this section will be recast and that he will be prepared to accept an amended amendment from Deputy Jones.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputies have taken too much to heart some of the remarks which their less well-informed colleagues have made.  Entertainments will be exempt; local meetings will be exempt; and auctioneers' posters will be exempt; but while they will be exempt, the fact will remain that these posters may not be plastered on anybody's property without his permission.  Is that not fair enough? We are talking about standing up for the rights of people and surely the person who owns a doorway, a wall or a tree or anything else that lends itself to use for the display of posters, should have his property safeguarded. That is what is being covered here. These exemptions will be made by regulation.  As years go by, things may change and there might be a need for further exemptions.  If we were to confine ourselves to exemptions written into the law, there could be no change, whereas if it were done by regulation, changes can be made by the Minister to suit circumstances.</P>

      <P>Section 66 provides that in disputed cases compensation shall be determined under the Land (Acquisition) Act, 1919.  There is an amendment to that Section&mdash;amendment No. 227&mdash;which seeks to provide for an appeal to the Circuit Court from the decision of the arbitrator.  Under the 1919 Act, there is no appeal from the decision of the arbitrator on entitlement to compensation or the amount awarded.  Where compensation would run into thousands of pounds it is altogether too important a matter to leave it to the decision of one person. A grave injustice, that could not be remedied, might arise from such a position.  Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that there should be an appeal in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind an individual who was looking for higher compensation. The officials of the public authority argued before the arbitrator for a lower sum in compensation.  The individual suffered a loss of £3,000 on a claim of <Col N="250" /> £7,000 even though the officials of the local authority were agreed among themselves that the higher figure would have to be given.  That would not have happened if the matter could have been argued before an independent tribunal.</P>

      <P>This could be grossly unfair.  Our amendment seeks to remedy the injustice that could arise in this case.  Take a man who bought property with a view to turning it into, say, offices.  He would be entitled to no compensation for refusal of permission to develop it whereas, ten years later, because of a change of circumstances, the planning authority might allow the area to be used for office accommodation.  There is no good reason why compensation should not be paid to the individual in those circumstances.  Within reason, the planning authority should be able to envisage what lies ahead.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  in respect of the refusal of permission to develop land if the reason or one of the reasons for the refusal is that development of the kind proposed would be premature&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  by reference to any existing deficiency in the provision of water supplies or sewerage facilities and the period within which any such deficiency may reasonably be expected to be made good, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  because a road layout for the area or part thereof has not been indicated in the development plan or has not been approved of by the planning authority or by the Minister on appeal,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to make it possible for the planning authority to defer the granting of permission to a developer until such time as he presents a proper comprehensive overall plan and for the purpose of deterring him from developing piecemeal the same parcel of land.  It is to ensure that, even though he may be only building part of what he proposes, he <Col N="252" /> will show his intention in regard to development spread over eight or ten years.  The amendment is to ensure that the planning authority will not be obliged to make decisions on piecemeal proposals.  They will be empowered to refuse permission and to tell the developer he must outline his intentions properly, show where his roads will ultimately lead and where he intends disposing his streets and terraces.  He can then come back and a decision will be given.  I believe this provision can work not only to the advantage of the planning authority but to the advantage of the developer as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the type of development the Minister envisages here.  It is desirable that the developer should present a comprehensive picture to the planning authority when he submits his plan in the first instance.  We mentioned previously the question of final determination of roads and other amenities that ought to be provided for in any developer's plans.</P>
      <P>I take it the planning authority would exercise the powers given by this amendment reasonably?  In other words, if an individual submits a plan which looks desirable from every point of view, he would not be unduly delayed in regard to the giving of permission?  I know the authority can impose conditions on him.  I presume at that stage the intent is that such type of permission would be entered on the register?</P>

      <P>The private developer will be made comply with planning legislation.  What will be the position of the planning authority, which is the local authority, in regard to development in its own area?  Will the planning authority have to submit their plans for the development of their own area?  Will their type of projected development be entered on the register, and will they have to comply with the same conditions as will be imposed on the private citizen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed extensions to our towns and villages will be a homogeneous <Col N="253" /> type of development.  For that purpose the planning authority will have power to acquire land and make layouts.  I want to ensure that they, no less than the private citizen, will have to make clear their intent in regard to the development they envisage for the area under their control, so that everybody would know the type of development they have in mind, particularly in regard to the provision of housing and amenity service.  It would be of considerable help to the people who live in the local authority area if they knew the intent of the plan in respect of the area in which they live.  For instance, if they knew that roads would be laid in a particular area at a particular time or that sewerage pipes would be laid in a particular area, that would certainly be very valuable information for them.  It would help a great deal in promoting the proper development of villages and towns in our rural areas.  Does the Minister envisage that the local authorities would have to comply equally with the type of regulation he proposes here for the ordinary citizen?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only do I envisage that they would be expected to do so, but I would expect that they would spearhead this whole idea of comprehensive planning.  I would expect that all the social amenities and developments proposed in the future would be indicated on their development plan, particularly in respect of the rural areas where they would be responsible for the larger part of the development likely to take place.  Since they have all the resources of personnel and technical assistance, I would be disappointed if they did not do very much better than the ordinary individual.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), to delete subparagraph (v) of paragraph (d).</P>
      <P>This is designed to extend the compensation provisions.  Under Section 55 we provide for compensation and in this section we say it shall not be payable in certain circumstances.  When we come to (d) (v) it states that compensation shall not be payable in</P>
      <P>matters in respect of which a requirement could have been imposed under any other Act, or under any order, regulation, rule or bye-law made under any other Act, without liability for compensation.</P>
      <P>We think this paragraph extends the restrictions on compensation too far. Might I ask the Minister what are the orders, rules, bye-laws and enactments referred to where compensation will be refused?  How will the ordinary individual know of these?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="255" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Typical examples would be the Public Health Acts, the Fire Acts, food and hygiene regulations, Milk and Dairies Acts, building bye-laws, regulations covering the storage of petrol, and operation of cinematographs and so on.  On public health grounds, for instance, a structure might not be permitted in a certain location&mdash;a slaughter house or abattoir. What we say is that if that is so, the refusal of planning permission does not entitle the owner to compensation. He is losing nothing by being refused planning permission because the Public Health Act debars him from doing what he seeks to do.  The same applies in the case of the other enactments and it is only reasonable that should be so.  If a person is prevented for a very good reason from building on a particular site under some other Act, he may not then seek planning permission and, on being refused, rely on other sections of this Bill to get compensation for something which if there was never a planning Bill he would not be allowed to build.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that a number of cases exist where there are breaches of the Public Health Acts and of the Milk Acts. There are still premises that should not normally be used if the law were strictly observed.  There is no very serious objection to these at present but there will be more emphasis in future on the type of structure that will pass the test.  If the planning authority request the removal of these structures, as they could under this Bill, would no compensation be payable to people who, in order to continue to make a living, would have to erect a new structure to comply with the regulations that will be imposed in the future, in order to carry on their business? I am not defending the defective buildings but I suggest that in limiting the narrow provisions for compensation in the case of something which has existed for a time, we are limiting the compensation too much. Would the Minister consider that a reasonable point of view?</P>

      <P>This amendment is consequential on the amendment about the advertisements we discussed on Section 36.  The effect of it is that the planning authority may impose a life on advertisements; in other words, permit them to continue for two, three, four or five years and at the end of that stipulated life, the advertisement would go without further compensation.  It may well happen that a certain amount of investment has gone into an advertisement and that if it had to be taken down immediately the amount of use and benefit that would have been got from it would be a poor return for the expenditure.

      <P>Section 56 provides that compensation will be payable where permission is refused for the erection of a new structure which substantially replaces a structure demolished or destroyed by fire, or otherwise, within the two years preceding the date of application for permission.  The section also provides that every dispute as to whether a new structure replaces a demolished or destroyed structure shall be determined by the Minister.  The Minister cannot really determine that a new structure substantially replaces a demolished or destroyed structure unless he is satisfied that the cubic content of so much of the new structure as would be or is above ground level would be or is at least equal to so much of the demolished or destroyed structure as was above ground level and the superficial area of the ground floor of the new structure would be or is at least equal to the superficial area of the ground floor of the demolished or destroyed structure.  For one reason or another it could be in the interest of good planning to change the form of the building, expanding or contracting the floor area, or raising or lowering the height of the building.

The Minister desires greater freedom in the interests of good planning.  If a house is burned down, will the owner get permission under this section to replace that house?  Will he have to apply for permission and will conditions be imposed upon him?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 202:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (4).</P>
      <P>The subsection which it is proposed to delete provides that a condition prohibiting development of a specified part of land shall be treated as a refusal of permission for developing that specified part of the land.  That provision would create confusion where conditions are imposed reserving open spaces in housing or other developments and the Bill generally will provide that a condition may be imposed requiring reasonable open space to be reserved, regard being had to the number, class and character of structures in any particular development proposal.  Unless this subsection is deleted, doubt could arise as to whether the reservation of reasonable open space would be a condition that could be imposed without liability for compensation.  If the permission for development requires a reasonable open space to be reserved, I should say that that condition does not involve liability for compensation by virtue of the terms of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of Section 56.</P>

      <P>To delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>This amendment is consequential on an amendment already made to Section 36.  Perhaps the House will recall that we discussed the principle involved at that stage which had to do with advertisements.  In the context of this section as it stands, without amendment, any advertisement which had been in existence for a period of five years or more would not, under any circumstances, be entitled to compensation if it was required to be removed. The amendment makes it possible for compensation to be paid even in cases where a structure has been in existence longer than the five years period. It is in conformity with the earlier amendment to Section 36 which was an easement of the imposition which would fall on the owners of advertisement structures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it could have been taken down outside of that without compensation.  The effect of the amendment of Section 36 and of this amendment will be to enable compensation to be paid in cases where, under the original proposal, it would not be possible to pay it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot follow the section.  As I understand the amendment, it provides for compensation if the structure is taken down after five years.  If it is an authorised structure after five years, has the owner not the right to say it is an authorised structure? I should like the Minister to clarify that position for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The real effect of the amendment, together with the earlier amendment, is that we no longer differentiate between advertisement structures and other structures.  It is an easement of the position of the owners of advertisement structures who were being more harshly dealt with than the owners of other structures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter we should consider very carefully.  I know several small farmers who have permitted big trusts to put up enormous signs in their fields.  For these, they get a substantial sum of money which is a great help to them in paying their rates.  I have been told that some of these people make a deal with the advertisers for a period of five or ten years.  They get a lump sum for that period instead of being paid annually. The Minister should look into that matter.</P>

      <P>Ordinary structures for which planning approval has not been secured could be removed and compensation paid, that is, in cases like in the three counties which did not adopt the original planning control.  Do I take it that the same procedure is being applied to advertising structures as is being applied to those structures? If advertisement structures do exist in those areas and are not required to be removed, they would now be entitled to compensation in the same way as any other unauthorised structures.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 47, line 48, after &ldquo;as&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;these expressions had&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The intention of this amendment is to make clear what the section indicates. Section 11 repeals the whole of the 1934 Act, if we look at the Second Schedule on page 66.  How can a word or expression have the same meaning as in an Act that is being removed from the Statute Book?  I suggest that it is undesirable to have legislation by reference in this instance.  It seems illogical that we should be referring to an expression in a statute that is being removed from the Statute Book.  We believe that where it states the general permission, special permission, special prohibition, planning scheme and work have the same meanings as in the Act of 1934 it should read &ldquo;had the same meanings&rdquo; as in the Act of 1934.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2) (a), page 48, line 5, to delete &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to ensure that the time lag between the passage of the Bill and the date on which it comes into effective operation will not be too short. We feel that 12 months is too short and there is a danger that the implications of the Bill might not be fully understood.  To ensure that everybody concerned with town planning, or who will be affected, will have ample time to get to know the measure effectively, <Col N="272" /> we think the time should be two years. As the Minister and the House are aware, this is a complicated measure and it will be some time before its contents are known and understood, even by the legal profession.  I suggest that 12 months from the appointed day is much too short and the period of two years is reasonable.  I am sure the Minister, from his drafting knowledge, appreciates that this is a very complicated type of measure.</P>
    <P>It would be unreasonable and unfair to expect that everybody who will be affected by the Bill will have digested its contents or know how it is to affect them within 12 months from the day the Minister declares the Bill to have come into operation, the day nominated for the particular area.  We therefore suggest in the amendment that the period should be extended, that instead of 12 months from the appointed day, it should be two years within which a person will be entitled to compensation.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1934 is well behind us and its various implications and lack of implications for a great many people were not properly understood. With this type of complicated legislation, 12 months would be too short regarding the appeals that would fall to be met.  All we are doing here is seeking to give the right to an individual within a period of two years from the appointed day to sustain legally a claim for compensation, if he is affected by the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made it fairly clear earlier on in the Bill that its coming into operation will be given adequate publicity and that this particular section will in a very special way be publicised as widely as possible.  That being so, it is inconceivable to me that 12 months should be regarded as too short a period in which claims could in fact be made. Were it not for the fact that the 1934 Act gave a period of 12 months, my own feeling about this would have been that half the period would be adequate, but in order to conform to the intentions and terms of the 1934 Act, we left in the 12 months.  I thought it was more than ample but <Col N="273" /> whatever about its being more than ample, I am suggesting that it is quite long enough.</P>
      <P>There is of course another side to it.  It is not just a case of considering the individual.  We have also to look to the local planning authority.  If such claims were allowed to be made for two years after the coming into operation of the legislation, then until the end of those two years, until the very last day, local planning authorities would not be in a position to judge the cloth from which they must cut their suit in the following period and from the point of view of the authorities that would be unfair.  If it were really necessary to sustain the rights of individuals, I would say let the local planning authority suffer if somebody must suffer, but in this case the rights of the individual are more than adequately preserved and to extend the period in which individuals could make claims would be to place an unnecessary burden on the local planning authority.</P>
      <P>Reverting to the real matter at issue, I think that with the publicity about the legislation, with particular reference to this section, 12 months is a more than ample period for anybody to make his claim and we should be very slow to extend it to any degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I could understand the Minister's objection to this if it were a question of postponing the coming into operation of this or of hindering or hampering development under the Planning Act, but all we are seeking to do it to ensure that individuals affected by it will not be ruled out 12 months from the appointed day.  Does the Minister, for instance, envisage when this piece of legislation comes into operation, that every conceivable type of case that will fall to be reviewed will be dealt with within a period of 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the number of claims facing a local planning authority will be known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose some of these things do not come under their notice <Col N="274" /> for a period of 18 months after the appointed day and at that stage it is brought to the notice of the local planning authority that an obstruction of some kind exists and they decide to have it removed, is the owner debarred from receiving compensation because he is not making a claim within 12 months of the appointed day?  Is it not reasonable to assume that he should be able to put his case for compensation and that he should not be limited to this period of 12 months? In a number of these cases, the Minister envisages in earlier sections that those affected would regularise the structures which are held to have been legally constructed.</P>
      <P>What I have tried to convey by way of this amendment is that despite the publicity given to this piece of legislation, whether large or small, regarding its passage through the House or the type of publicity a planning authority would give to it when it came into operation in their area, there would still be a large body of the public who did not think themselves affected.  I do not put it forward by way of making an excuse for it but as a justification for the amendment that under the 1934 Act, as amended in 1938, the various local authorities who were under an obligation to do certain things did not do them and even after a court decision was given against the planning authority at that time, there was a continuing period in which the order of the court was not carried out.</P>
      <P>All I say on this amendment is that we should be reasonable.  While admitting the Minister's facts regarding publicity, I still believe that we are not doing the planning authority any great harm and that in justice we should give that period of time to people to claim compensation.  It is not an undue burden on the planning authority whether they know it within one or two years.  I certainly think, and I am sure the Minister will agree, that the financial implications of this will certainly not be determined in 12 months or in two years, or indeed in five or in ten years.  They will be widespread as far as the local authorities are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While not saying that Deputy Jones is confused, I think he is considering something that may not at all arise under this provision.  What we intend to deal with, and the claims we are thinking about here, are matters arising as a result of the operations of the 1934 Act on the assumption that a plan under the 1934 Act had in fact been in operation.  It is wrong to say that 12 months is a short time.  There may be people who were refused permission as long ago as 1935 and they have a claim for compensation.  To say that they are restricted to 12 months after the coming into operation of the Act is therefore wrong, since they have had a claim as far back as 1935.</P>
      <P>It is that type of claimant to compensation that this Bill deals with.  We will not be dealing with new applicants who will be refused permission under the new legislation.  What we are proposing here is to maintain the <i>status quo</i> of the people who at this moment feel they have a claim arising out of a refusal perhaps of this year or perhaps of 20 years ago.  Even though no plan was ever taken on or put into operation, nevertheless if it can be established that compensation would have been payable if a plan had been put into operation, all we want is that a claim in that respect will be put in within 12 months after the appointed day.  All we are saying is: &ldquo;If you have a claim, we want you to enter it within 12 months.&rdquo;  I think that is lightly different from what Deputy ones has in mind.</P>

      <P>I follow that, but will every individual affected by this section, on the passage of this legislation, be under notice in regard to a structure &mdash;will it be from the appointed day, from the passage of this legislation?

      <P>They are not the group with whom we are dealing in this section.  In fact, it is almost the reverse.  It is not so much where buildings exist: it is more likely to arise in cases where permission is refused and, as a result, no buildings were erected, or it could be a case where a building does exist but does so in such form that it would have to be made to conform to what was a rather penal restriction.  It is in that type of case, where there is no building or where there is restricted building, that this question of 12 months arises.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2) (b), page 48, lines 22 and 23, to delete &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;arbitrator or the Circuit Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our object in this is in keeping with previous amendments.  The intention is to give to the applicant the right of appeal to the arbitrator who will be dealing with compensation, or to the circuit court, and not alone to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Having discussed the principle of this already in some detail, I repeat that the substitution of the arbitrator or the circuit court would, to my mind, cut across the whole basis on which this section was drafted.  I do not think I need add anything to that, having said it once already, if not twice or three times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I put this point to the Minister, I do not want to be taken as reflecting on him.  This section&mdash;and this is true of other legislation where appeals lie to the Minister for Local Government or, in health matters, to the Minister for Health&mdash;does not lay down any time within which the Minister should give his decision.  Particularly in relation to town planning appeals, while I appreciate the difficulties of the decisions that will face the Minister, I would point out that often there is an element of urgency.  Under the present code, there is, in fact, no time limit within which the Minister is required to give a decision.  I know from practical experience that the Minister's Department, in dealing with these appeals, go very carefully into questions put before them and examine the matter very thoroughly but, in the course of that examination, time is being consumed.  If it is a case of an interested person objecting to a general permission, for example, which is being granted, both the objector and the people to whom the permission is being <Col N="278" /> granted are left hanging in the air often for very considerable periods.</P>
      <P>There is this disadvantage about any kind of arbitration proceedings that, notwithstanding the delays said to be associated with the law, at least you do come to a final point which can be seen by both sides&mdash;a particular date on which you will get a decision.  I do not know whether it might not be possible for the Minister, before this Bill is finally passed or in any regulations under it, when enacted, to incorporate some type of machinery which will require him to come to a decision within a particular period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not unaware&mdash;I have said it before&mdash;of the shortcomings in so far as the delays have been occurring all too frequently.  We have been seeking ways and means, even under present laws, of speeding up the process of these appeals.  I fully appreciate, particularly if the parties are private people, that both can be greatly inconvenienced, the longer the time elapses.</P>
      <P>In so far as the new order of things is concerned, without any doubt whatever I think the establishment of oral hearings will greatly facilitate the early and more speedy processing of these applications.  Certainly, they will avoid the frustrating exercise we all have to go through at the moment of writing to the local authority, receiving their letter in reply, sending it on to the other party and asking for comments, then getting their reply, sending a memorandum to the local authority, and so on, and nobody knows quite when it will end.  With one sitting of oral hearings, we can dispense with all this tape with which we have become bound up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the permission regulations mentioned earlier will lay down certain rules which those making application and those dealing with them must follow.  They shall try to short-circuit and compress as far as possible the procedural approach to a planning decision and appeal.  That, together with the undoubted requirement which exists in my Department and which we hope to have sorted out in the near future&mdash;additional technical staff, which we are in the process of getting <Col N="279" /> at the moment&mdash;should bring about a vast improvement in the new order of things, if we make this law, as against the present situation which is not at all satisfactory to me or to anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says the oral hearings will speed it up?  If the number of appeals likely to come in should be very great, unless there is quite a substantial staff, surely they would tend to slow it up rather than anything else?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that if there were any suggestion that we should be expected to go all over the country to hear appeals orally, with only the same staff as has been doing it up to the moment, there would be absolute chaos.  The technical staff must be such as will enable a complete coverage of the entire country to be made and quicker determinations given than has been possible under existing circumstances up to the present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 225c:</P>
      <P>Before section 66 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Regulations may provide for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the form in which claims for compensation are to be made,</P>
      <P>(b)  the provision by a claimant of evidence in support of his claim and information as to his interest in the land to which the claim relates,</P>
      <P>(c)  a statement by a claimant of the names and addresses of all other persons (so far as they are known to him) having an interest in the land to which the claim relates and, unless the claim is withdrawn, the notification by the planning authority or the claimant of every other person (if any) appearing to them or him to have an interest in the land,</P>
      <P>(d)  the information and documents to be submitted with an application for an order under section 58 of this Act,</P>
      <P>(e)  the information and documents to be submitted by a planning authority in relation to an application for an order under section 58 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This provides that regulations may be made to provide forms for various purposes such as claims for compensation and other matters appertaining to the measures in this Bill.</P>

      <P>These are regulations which the Minister is to make?  In regard to paragraph (c) of the amendment, what type of obligation does this impose on an individual?  How far may a person be presumed to know these things?  I remember a case in my constituency concerning the erection of a building for parochial purposes.  We made all the inquiries that could be made at that stage.  We approached the landlord and obtained permission.  The legal people dealing with it prepared the necessary documents.  Then we learned of the existence of somebody in <Col N="282" /> Dublin who had a head landlord's interest in the property.  In regard to the phrase in (c) &ldquo;as far as they are known to him,&rdquo; how wide is that going to be?  Will an ordinary, simple statement by him that he believes he owns this property irrespective of any other interest be sufficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Will he have to produce evidence of the discharge of equities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that would be quite sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to get that clear.  That is the kind of thing that could be very burdensome in rural areas.  People are inclined to let things run and do not deal with them until such time as a settlement has to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister would not envisage that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Paragraph (c) is really intended to ensure that any person who has a claim for compensation will be given an opportunity of making his statement.  It is trying to protect people who have an interest and not trying to discover who is or who is not the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Land Commission acquire the property of an individual, they publish a notice saying it appears to them that the ownership of this property vests in such a person and inviting anybody else who may have an interest to submit his claim within a certain period.  In the type of regulation the Minister envisages here, when an individual claims ownership of the property and submits his claim in writing, it would be for the protection of anybody else who might claim an interest that such type of notice be published.  Would it be recorded in the register which will be kept?  Would it be open to people to inspect the register and find that certain people would be claiming on a certain parcel of property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the smaller rural towns where a landlord's interest exists in the buildings, would it not be desirable that publication should be made of the fact that somebody was claiming compensation in order to preclude any secondary claims to compensation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to be too specific on what we will and will not include.  We will have to give this a fair amount of further consideration. Here we are merely asking for the power to enable us to do these things by regulation.  If I gave an assurance at this stage, I might not be able to adhere to it later on.  The whole purpose is to enable us to deal with the matter in the best possible way.</P>
