      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Before the House adjourned on Tuesday evening, I was dealing, among other things, with the question of the <Col N="682" /> transfer of portion of a rate collector's district in Fethard to the district of another rate collector and was taking the Minister to task for sanctioning that transfer.  I found it necessary to criticise the Minister's action for sanctioning the transfer of a collection area from the district of one rate collector who was paid on a salary basis to another rate collector who was paid on a poundage basis and allowing the former rate collector the same salary as he had been enjoying, thus imposing an extra burden of £120 on the local authority rates.</P>
      <P>The matter is rendered more objectionable when one beneficiary of that transfer was appointed by the Fianna Fáil Party and one was a son of a Fianna Fáil councillor.  I think the Minister departed from the high principles of his office in being so weak and supine as to yield to pressure from the Fianna Fáil hierarchy in South Tipperary in sanctioning that transfer.</P>
      <P>I dealt at the same time on Tuesday evening with the question of two gentlemen employees of ours in South Tipperary, two relieving officers, one of whom has been with us for ten years and the other about five years. Both were appointed on the basis that when a vacancy for a cottage rent collector occurred in their districts, they would secure the appointment.  These two gentlemen have been deprived of what I believe is morally their rightful due during the past 12 months.  The Minister has now had some months to consider the matter, and I submit he is thinking out some new technique to deprive those men of their rights.  I think it would be of interest to the House to learn the terms of appointment, the advertised terms, of those two men:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duties shall be those of Assistance Officer and of Rent Collector as provided for in the regulations made from time to time by the appropriate Minister, and such other duties as they may be instructed to carry out from time to time, or such duties as the County Manager or the Council shall instruct from time to time to be carried out.  Initially the post will be that of Assistance Officer only, but the person <Col N="683" /> appointed will on the occurrence of a vacancy for cottage rent collector within the Assistance district take over the duties of rent collector in addition to those of Assistance Officer.</P>
    <P>Those were the terms of appointment of the two men and they have been so far deprived of what is lawfully theirs.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday I also dealt with the question of conciliation and arbitration.This is a matter we can approach with a greater degree of unanimity on all sides of the House because it is a matter of particular importance to every Deputy and every Minister.  I will not cover again the general observations I made on the last occasion, but I will say that there is substantial objection to the conciliation and arbitration scheme as shown in the booklet circulated by the County Managers' Association.  These objections stem largely from the professional organisations whose members are employed by county councils up and down the country.  The first suggestion of the county managers is that only staff associations recognised by the County Managers' Association should be eligible to take part in the scheme. They also state that all associations who wish to participate must make application to the County Managers' Association.  I would have thought that the recognised unions or associations would, <i>ipso facto</i>, receive adequate recognition without having to go through this procedure of making application to the County Managers' Association.</P>
    <P>They also state that any staff association representative of not fewer than 25 local authority officers to whom the scheme applies should be eligible for recognition.  It is feared that some professional organisations with only small numbers but of some importance might not qualify.  The staff panel drawn up by the County Managers' Association is from named trade unions.  The majority of professional people are not members of these unions.  They are catered for by their own associations or unions to whom they are amenable <Col N="684" /> and they feel that their problems could be best presented by the unions and associations to which they belong.</P>
    <P>The county managers also wish to exclude all civil servants from the arbitration board.  I cannot profess to be a lover of civil servants, I do not know who is, but no adequate reason has been advanced as to why civil servants should be excluded from this machinery by the County Managers' Association.  It is suggested that the County Managers' Association wish to exercise exclusive control over the machinery.</P>
    <P>Regarding the format of the arbitration board, the professional organisations think that the chairman and secretary of that board should be appointed by the three employment interests concerned.  They regard these as the Minister for Local Government, the General Council of County Councils or, in the case of borough corporations, the Municipal Authorities Association, and the County Managers' Association.  I think that is fair enough.  The County Managers' Association say that they alone should make these appointments.  I think you will agree that this is an endeavour on the part of the County Managers' Association to exercise absolute control.</P>
    <P>There is fairly general agreement between the two bodies as regards the conciliation procedure but as regards the arbitration procedure there is a wide difference of opinion.  The professional bodies believe that at arbitration hearings the interests of the employer should be presented by three advocates, one for the Minister, one for the General Council of County Councils and one for the County Managers' Association.  The County Managers' Association want the employers' interests to be presented solely by two local authority officers to be appointed by the county managers themselves.  They could be two county managers.</P>
    <P>Here, again, it is felt that there is an effort by the county managers to ensure that the advocates of the <Col N="685" /> employers' interests should be nominated by them to the exclusion of the Minister and the General Council of County Councils, and thereby to the exclusion of the public representatives. Here, again, there is a wide divergence of opinion and my view would be on the side of the professional organisations.Their approach is better and more democratic and the approach of the County Managers' Association is more dictatorial and tends to take absolute power for themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a further objection which I have heard to this arbitration and conciliation scheme, that is, that in Dublin and Cork we have a large number of people employed in our voluntary hospitals, nurses and such people, who, under the arbitration and conciliation scheme as drawn up by the County Managers' Association, would be excluded from staff panel membership or representation.</P>
    <P>There is a final criticism to be made of the county managers' plan.  As far as one can judge, the arbitration procedure as envisaged by them would, apart from the submission of a report to the appropriate Minister, stop there. The professional bodies advocate that the findings of the arbitration board should be submitted to the Minister, to the Government and to the Dáil so that they might be treated at the highest level and thereby command the highest respect and the highest observance.I believe that unless from the beginning you can secure the confidence of the people participating in any conciliation and arbitration machinery, it will not work.  I may say that this system as advocated by the professional bodies is similar to what is already available to the vocational teachers.  They are asking for nothing more than what, practically, is already available to vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>When this matter was being discussed by our local county council, it was explained to us by the manager when he was looking for money to finance it that he looked for £200 this year.  I expect a similar figure, in proportion to the rateable valuation, is being discussed at every county council <Col N="686" /> in the country.  It was explained to us that this machinery would have to be financed and that secretarial help would have to be provided.  On discussion, it transpired that what is meant by secretarial help was a highly-qualified, experienced negotiator commanding a salary of perhaps £1,500 or £2,000 a year and, as I have mentioned already, this particular secretary to this new arbitration board that was envisaged would be appointed by the county manager.  If you have a high-powered secretary like that, an experienced man, he, naturally, will have to have staff and if he has to have staff, he will have to have a building; and he will be appointed by the County Managers' Association.  Have we here now the beginning of a Kildare Street Club for county managers and have we here a new job being created admirably suited and admirably tailored for retired county managers?</P>
    <P>There is only one other small matter that I wish to deal with but it is a matter of some importance, again, to every public representative.  Some months ago at one of our county council meetings, there was an item on the agenda and there was some doubt in the official view as to whether this item was in order or not.  It was deemed expedient, and the council agreed, that a barrister's opinion should be sought. Opinion was secured from Mr. Rory O'Hanrahan.  Subsequently that legal opinion on the matter which was still on our agenda was read for us at a county council meeting.</P>
    <P>Our particular manager sticks to the letter of the law as he interprets it, that no information is given to a county councillor, except to the county council as a whole and to the chairman.But, this being a matter which had been dealt with publicly and in the presence of the Press.  I asked could I have a copy of this counsel's opinion which was contained in a lengthy, involved document which, naturally, I could not assimilate at one meeting and I considered it desirable that I should have a copy of it.  The manager refused to give me a copy.  I then wrote to the Secretary of the Department of Local Government explaining the situation to him.  It was <Col N="687" /> quite a nice, polite letter asking could he help or advise me or give me any guidance as to what to do as I felt I was entitled to this copy and wished to know my position.  I thought he was the appropriate man to write to.  I regard him, so to speak, as the county manager's senior executive officer.  I received no reply whatsoever from the Secretary of the Department of Local Government.  I wrote a second time to the Secretary, giving, again, a summary of the position.  Again, I received no reply whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I do not expect that a particular Civil Service official can answer every question I may choose to ask him but I do claim, and insist on, the right of any public representative at least to receive an acknowledgment of his letter.  I do not know whether the Secretary of the Department of Local Government was alone responsible for this but I have no evidence to the contrary.  If I find it necessary to stand up in this Dáil and publicly rebuke him, I am doing so subject to the reservation that he may not be entirely responsible for this grave discourtesy to me.</P>
    <P>I am not personally troubled about a personal discourtesy.  I can take it. But I am very seriously disturbed by the fact that any bureaucrat anywhere in this State should see fit to deny simple guidance or information&mdash; reasonable information and reasonable guidance&mdash;to any public representative. The whole essence of democracy is based upon that right of public representatives and if that is once allowed to pass, unchallenged, then the very foundations of the liberty which we enjoy here are placed in jeopardy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fitting that I should follow Deputy Hogan because my primary purpose in speaking on this Estimate today is to draw to the attention of the Minister and the House the most unsatisfactory state of affairs which prevails in South Tipperary in respect to the housing of the people there.  Before dealing with the local aspects of the problem, I want to say that I was deeply interested in the <Col N="688" /> debate which has gone on here for the past few days in respect to housing generally in the country.</P>
      <P>In my contribution to the debate on the Estimate for Local Government 12 months ago, I stated that there were thousands of families in this country living in condemned, squalid, rat-infested tenements and hovels and that that was a serious indictment of the Minister and his Department as well as of the local authorities concerned.Many people may have felt that that statement was, perhaps, an exaggeration.  Indeed, my political opponents would seek to infer that it was an irresponsible statement.  The evidence revealed here on information from the Minister himself has proved conclusively that that statement was only too true.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his statement to the House, has admitted that there are 25,000 unfit dwellings in this country. The figures have been gleaned as a result of a housing survey that has been carried out.  Of the 25,000 unfit dwellings, 20,000 are in rural areas. In this city alone there are at least 5,000 persons crying out for immediate rehousing and deemed to be in urgent need of rehousing.  It is not an easy matter to be deemed to be in need of rehousing.  There is a detailed examination by the county medical officer of health and his staff and there is a decision of the county manager who has the sole responsibility for housing.  A person must be in a very bad way before being deemed to be in urgent need of rehousing and declared by the housing authority to be an approved applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who get priority in that regard are people who are living in overcrowded circumstances with very large families, whose homes are in many instances bereft of proper sanitation and running water, whose homes are damp, dark and dilapidated and, as has been borne out by the tragedy in this city, whose homes are in real danger of falling down, with resultant loss of life.  This then is the criterion by which one is deemed to be in need of rehousing.  There is, of course, too, <Col N="689" /> the overriding factor of the health background of the family concerned. There was a time when TB-affected families got preferential treatment in this regard.</P>
    <P>The plight of the homeless is not confined to Dublin, Cork, Limerick or other cities.  It is evident in practically every small town and village.  Certainly it is true of the constituency I have the honour to represent.  There is, too, resulting from the inability, it would seem, of the Minister's Department to grapple effectively with the housing problem of the nation, a problem to contend with which is tantamount to the exploitation of these unfortunate people by slum landlords in this city and in many other towns and cities throughout the country.  There is rearing its head a type of Rachmanism, the activities of the slum landlord who battens on the unfortunate people who cannot get homes.  This is done by the exorbitant rent charged for flats which could not be called homes in anything like the real sense of the word, tenement flats, lacking the ordinary amenities, many of them in a crumbling condition dangerous to the tenants.</P>
    <P>People are so desperate that they will take anything offering nowadays and accordingly, by reason of the demand, they are exploited by unscrupulous slum landlords, owners of the slum tenements in every part of this country.  I do not know what the Minister can do to arrest this sorry situation where young people about to get married are obliged to pay £1, £2 or £3 a week rent for such wretched accommodation as is being offered to them today and where young married couples are condemned to a long purgatory in these appalling housing conditions before the local authority sets about rehousing them.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that 50 per cent of the 25,000 unfit dwellings to which I have adverted are occupied by one or two persons.  It would seem then, in the main, that it is the young married people who are being exploited most.  It is no wonder that there is evidence of these young married people being so utterly frustrated in the matter of getting a decent house that they are, in conjunction with the contemplation <Col N="690" /> of marriage, deciding to emigrate, and many of them have emigrated because of the insecurity in regard to work and also the major factor of the inability to secure a decent flat or house in their native town.</P>
    <P>If a house does become available, there is evidence everywhere of exorbitant amounts being demanded for the sale of that house and, more than that, by way of what is known as key money.  Key money is bedevilling the housing situation.  There is evidence of key money, counted in hundreds of pounds, being demanded for houses that should be scheduled, and are in many instances scheduled, for demolition.I know perhaps there is legislation whereby one can go to the courts to have a fair rent determined.  The vast majority of these people are in such a bad way for houses that they have no time to consider their rights in this regard.</P>
    <P>I must place the full blame for this sorry state of affairs on the Minister and his Department.  We seem to have housing authorities, managers, officials and members of housing authorities, who are indifferent to the needs of our people, who may be said to be reeking with indolence and inertia in relation to this serious problem, and it is high time the Minister stepped in and made them aware of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that newlyweds were entitled to some consideration in respect of rehousing.  Some housing authorities have been considerate in this regard and in every new scheme of houses they have made a percentage available to newlyweds.  That is a very laudable idea, a very humane and Christian attitude, but the vast majority of our housing authorities simply do not entertain that humanitarian ideal. They are preoccupied with rehousing those most in need and the most in need to whom I have referred are those whose houses are crumbling about them or likely to fall down or who live in shockingly overcrowded and insanitary conditions, rat-infested and vermininfested in many instances.  I appreciate the prior obligation of the local authority to rehouse these people in the first instance but, at the same time, we should do something to ensure that <Col N="691" /> the purgatory which is inflicted on newlyweds in this regard is ended.</P>
    <P>I said that my primary purpose in rising here was to draw the attention of the Minister to the most unsatisfactory state of affairs which exists in South Tipperary in regard to the rehousing of our people.  In a recent survey, it has been found that there are over 1,000 unfit dwellings in South Tipperary.  The indolence and inertia of that housing authority are such that those of us who feel we have an obligation to our people in respect of homes are becoming completely and utterly frustrated by the interminable delay in having houses built.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question about housing in South Tipperary, the Minister informed us yesterday of the number of tenders for the erection of cottages there and the number of houses submitted to him for approval over the past 12 months.  I can count only 37 submissions made to the Minister in the past 12 months in respect of new cottages in South Tipperary, at a time when there are over 1,000 people deemed to be in unsatisfactory houses. We are experiencing tremendous difficulty in the county in relation to the building of cottages.  The officials are relying solely on the present system of carrying out a survey to ascertain whether these people are in need of rehousing and having satisfied themselves that they are, of going through the process of acquiring sites; the sites are submitted to the Minister for approval but may very well be objected to and then there is an inquiry. Naturally, that takes time.  Even when the site is approved, we must advertise for tenders.  Time and time again we have advertised for tenders and have got no response, or if there was a response, the contractor was deemed to be unsatisfactory.  We have had also the frustrating experience, having accepted a tender from a contractor, of finding after a lapse of months, sometimes 12 months, that he was no longer interested in building the cottages and defaulted.</P>
    <P>In such a case we must then go through the whole process of advertising the houses for tender in the hope <Col N="692" /> that a suitable contractor will be forthcoming.We have advertised cottages in the Clonmel area not once or twice but four times before a suitable contract was forthcoming.  Indeed, it may be true to say there is still grave doubt whether the present contractor will do the building.  I submit to the Minister that it is making an absolute mockery of the people of my constituency to go through this kind of farcical red tape.  There is an obligation on the Minister to step in and decide for the local authority what they should do in such circumstances.  How long is this farce to continue?  How long are we to have the farce of advertising over and over again and getting nowhere?</P>
    <P>I see that on 24th November, 1962, the Minister's approval was sought for tenders for four cottages in Fethard town in South Tipperary.  There was a dire need for these cottages.  There is a considerable number of people in that town living in appalling conditions.I submitted notice of motion to South Tipperary County Council drawing attention to this sorry state of affairs and to the need to rehouse these people and asking that a survey be carried out, that sites be acquired and homes be built as a matter of urgency for those people.  The Minister approved the contract in November 1962.  The unfortunate people involved had high hopes of being in new homes within a few months, but what happened?After six or eight months, when not a sod had been turned on the site, it was revealed that the contractor was no longer interested and had thrown up the contract.</P>
    <P>On 21st of this month, a new tender for these four cottages was submitted to the Minister.  I can only hope and trust that this contract will be carried out and that these four houses will be built very soon.  This is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.  The Labour members of our council brought forward what they considered to be a solution to this problem.  We asked that these cottages be built by direct labour under the supervision of the county engineer.  We should no longer be placed in the predicament of being dependent on these contractors who <Col N="693" /> seemingly have an abundance of work. The evidence is there that they are not interested in building for our local authority, despite the fact that we increased the price of our cottages to over £1,700.  The House will agree that over £1,700 is a reasonable price for the erection of a utilitarian type of house composed of four walls and a roof, three rooms and a kitchen.</P>
    <P>Despite that, we have not had the response we desire.  The motion to have the cottages built by direct labour was defeated by reason of a long and detailed argument made by the county engineer.  In an epistle-like address, he pointed out the virtual impossibility for him and his Department of building cottages by direct labour.  In essence, as far as I was concerned, it merely meant that the county engineer and his staff did not want to be bothered with the additional responsibility of building houses.  Some county engineers regard it as their primary responsibility to build roads, perhaps to install water and sewerage facilities, but they do not want to be troubled with building houses.  They seem to have no social conscience in regard to the importance of rehousing our people, or the terrible evils inherent in bad housing and the dangers to the health of the inhabitants.</P>
    <P>As I say, the motion was defeated and the sorry situation continued.  A short time ago, we again brought forward the motion and the council, conservative though it may be, saw the need for the acceptance of our motion and by a majority passed it.  Up to today, that motion has not been acted upon.  It has been deliberately circumvented by the officials.  They have no intention of acceding to the requests of the council to build the houses by direct labour.</P>
    <P>We have now resorted to a device of building homes for our people by the new industrial unit method of construction with which I am sure the Minister is conversant.  We had a simple house of this type built in South Tipperary.  We visited it as a county council, together with our officials, when it was completed.  We examined it in minute detail.  We were all extremely pleased with the <Col N="694" /> type of house it turned out to be.  It was pleasing in design and was durable.  It provided all the modern amenities which a family requires nowadays.  It was a modern home in every sense of the word.</P>
    <P>We decided, then, that at least in those isolated areas where cottages are scheduled to be built and where we have experienced the greatest difficulty in getting contractors, we would build this prototype, this type of unit construction.I do not know if it is permissible for me to mention the actual brand of cottage but if the Minister is interested, I can let him have the name.</P>
    <P>We desired very much to build this type of house and we communicated with the firm concerned.  I very much regret to say that the firm concerned seems to be very interested in substantial orders for this cottage and it is difficult to ascertain what price they require.  The fact is that we have been unable to do any business with those people, despite many letters to them, in connection with the proposal.  We are still left with this stalemate of inability to build cottages.  In that kind of situation, I should be failing in my duty as a public representative if I did not say, as indeed I have said many times in the council of which I have the honour to be the chairman, that that council were guilty of utter dereliction of duty in respect of the housing of our people.  They have failed miserably to grapple with this problem.</P>
    <P>It is futile and useless to tell us that the procedure of red tape and the present system are responsible.  We want to see houses built in bricks and mortar and people domiciled in them. It is an indication of the inability of the Minister's Department and of the laziness of the housing authorities that the only solution we can offer today is the provision of caravans for those people.</P>
    <P>Houses fall down in more places than Dublin city.  I have witnessed it in Tipperary&mdash;at Hollyford, County Tipperary, to be precise.  A house there fell down on a wife, a husband and their children.  The county council came to the aid of that family by the <Col N="695" /> provision of a county council van and that is where they are living at present. It is a serious indictment of the Minister, his Department and all concerned that that is the only solution we can offer to the rehousing of our people&mdash; providing them with something which the itinerants and tinkers enjoy today who pay no rates and are responsible to nobody.  They are far better and more adequately cared for than the decent workingclass citizens of our towns and cities.  I suppose the next offer we shall be making to people in such a predicament is to give them some kinds of tents and seal their fate altogether.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to cause an investigation to be held into the housing situation in South Tipperary as a matter of grave urgency.  I, as the council chairman, regret to say that they are guilty of clear dereliction of duty in respect of their inability or unwillingness to tackle this problem and to build houses for our people.  If the Minister does not cause an inquiry to be held, I have no hesitation in saying that I shall call for a public inquiry at a council meeting.  I am sure the Minister will do us the courtesy of holding that inquiry&mdash;and let it be a sworn inquiry, if necessary&mdash;into the action of the county manager and the officials responsible for their clear dereliction of duty in respect of housing.</P>
    <P>We cannot tolerate any longer this absolute farce, this mockery of the sufferings of our people, this pretence at an attempt to rehouse them&mdash;and getting nowhere.  The people I speak for are not people who were deemed to be in need of rehousing last year or the year before.  I speak for people deemed to be in need of rehousing six, seven, eight and ten years ago and who are not yet rehoused: not a sod is turned on the site in respect of their needs.</P>
    <P>The very same situation appertains with regard to the maintenance of council property, especially the non-vested homes of our people.  I appreciate that, first, it is a matter of providing a sufficiency of money in the estimates each year for the repair and maintenance of council houses.  That <Col N="696" /> is a primary factor in this regard.  But, when the officials concerned do not include a sufficiency of money for that purpose, they must accept the responsibility.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that the council has on every occasion given to the manager the sufficiency of money required for the repair and maintenance of the houses of our people.  At the estimates meeting this year, we provided some £16,000 and when that proved inadequate, then, by way of further motion, we provided some £6,000 or £7,000 extra.  But that, in itself, is proving inadequate to grapple with the problem of repairs.</P>
    <P>There is a backlog of arrears of repairs to cottages going back a long number of years.  In the meantime, the houses have rapidly deteriorated.  The minor repairs which were scheduled five or six years ago have now become a major problem of repair as a result of the inactivity and inaction of the local authority in the matter of the repair of these houses within a reasonable time.  In other words, the ship is being lost for the sake of the proverbial halfpennyworth of tar.</P>
    <P>The Minister should see to it that housing authorities carry out their obligation to keep the homes of their people in adequate repair.  The Minister should ensure that an inspection is carried out of all council property, with particular reference to houses, perhaps annually.  The councils concerned should be obliged&mdash;by law, if necessary&mdash;to maintain them adequately.  It is surely unwise and uneconomic that houses should be allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the original estimate is increased out of all proportion as a result of the flagrant neglect of the housing authority to do the repairs within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exaggerate on this matter of repairs to houses but it is true to say that there are houses, cottages in particular, where the rain pours through the roof, where the timber is absolutely rotting, with doors falling down, acute dampness and kitchens filled with smoke.  The general living conditions in these homes are appalling, and county councils seem <Col N="697" /> to be doing little or nothing to resolve the problem.  The tendency seems to be that if you vest your house, you get priority for repairs.  In his speech, the Minister expressed regret that more people are not purchasing their homes. I have always maintained it is a very laudable and desirable thing that people should be the owners of their property.  I believe in this kind of diffusion of private property.  However, I deplore the dictatorial tendency of county councils to foist ownership of homes on people reluctant to accept the responsibility involved.  As I said, preference for repairs is given to those who yest their cottages.  People are in a state of utter frustration and are compelled, therefore, to vest in order to have repairs carried out.  They become unwilling owners of their property.</P>
    <P>That is neither just nor moral.  Let them become willing owners, by all means.  Let us facilitate them in every way, but let us not foist ownership on them.  Let them not be forced to become owners of property which they feel they cannot maintain in adequate repair in after years.  The wheel has turned a full circle in this respect.  By reason of the stupid policy of the county managers, many cottages vested in the past are now showing serious signs of acute disrepair.  The tenants are clearly unable to keep them in a proper state of repair and unable to avail of the various grants for this purpose.When the matter is reported to the county council, the only satisfaction they get is a warning that they signed an agreement to keep the cottages in repair and they are threatened with the law, if they do not do so.  The overall result is that many vested cottages in my county&mdash;and in others as well, I am sure &mdash; have deteriorated to such an extent that they are virtually uninhabitable again and the county council will have to rehouse those people once more.  To allow such a situation to develop is the height of folly.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the manner in which employees of local authorities are treated in respect of their employment.In most county councils, the county council worker is bereft of any worthwhile status, and he certainly has <Col N="698" /> no security of employment.  This is a serious matter inasmuch as county council employees are now in a scheme in which they can qualify for a decent pension on retirement, provided they have worked a sufficient number of years.  The superannuation scheme ordains that they shall work not less than 200 days in each year in order to qualify.  By reason of the inability of county councils to provide employment for their workers, many of them do not get the required 200 days per year and, accordingly, they lose that year for superannuation purposes.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that county councils, county managers and the Minister should strive to ensure that county council employees, that is, county council servants as distinct from officers, should be given some semblance of security, some guarantee of employment each year, which will at least ensure they get the required number of days to qualify for superannuation purposes.  There is a serious anomaly in the law as between the rich and the poor which is manifest in the regulations applying to the pension rights of county council servants as distinct from officers.  The county manager seemingly has power to add years of service in calculating the pension rights of officers of the council but has no right to add even one day to the county council worker for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Surely it is unfair, unjust and extremely inequitable that years of service can be added in respect of a county council official, who most probably will go out on a pension of at least £1,000 a year and probably a lump sum of £1,000 or £2,000&mdash;long years of service have been added in the case of such officials&mdash;while the poor, unfortunate roadworker, who has given the best years of his life to the council, who cannot qualify because of the council's inability to provide him with work, cannot have even a day added in order to qualify him for pension purposes?  Is it not patently unfair that such a worker may have worked 199 days in the year and, because he did not have the extra day to make up the required number, loses that year for pensionable purposes? <Col N="699" />Although years can be added in respect of officers of the council, not even a day can be added in this case.  Evidently, from that kind of thinking, there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.  I appeal to the Minister to remedy the situation. If a concession can be given to one, I see no reason why it cannot be given to the other.  No one will suggest that the county council worker is a second-class citizen or inferior to the officials in the office.</P>
    <P>I want to support Deputy Hogan in his contention that it is deplorable that bureaucrats in authority, be they county managers or county secretaries, should have the brazen audacity to ignore the representations made by public representatives.  Yet that is happening.  As chairman of the council concerned.  I regret to say there is a dictatorial, offhand attitude on the part of the manager in regard to members of the local authority making representations.Common courtesy demands that we should receive a reply to every representation and there is something fundamentally wrong where no reply is offered.  Is it being done just to be cantankerous or discourteous or to conceal something from the public representative and the public at large?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It creates an atmosphere of suspicion in the minds of the public representative and the public generally when their legitimate queries and representations made to public officials are not answered promptly. I deplore the instance to which Deputy Hogan referred.  He is not the only one involved.  I was chairman of the same local authority and I must say that there were hundreds of representations made by me to that authority to which I have not received a reply. I am chairman of that authority and I know I have power under the law to demand evidence, to see documents, to have information furnished to me. I have not as yet exercised that power. I did not think it would be necessary, but that state of affairs has resulted in an element of disunity, distrust and <Col N="700" /> suspicion entering into the minds of my council <i>vis-à-vis</i> the officials, in that they have failed in this primary responsibility to supply information to members.  It has resulted in over-weighty and extremely long agenda which the chairman cannot cope with at any one meeting.  Clearly where members are refused or unable to get information, they must put down notices of motion.  We have agenda to contend with carrying over 100 and sometimes nearly 200 notices of motions at our monthly meetings.</P>
      <P>A strike of engineers' clerks occurred in our county some time ago when these men were obliged to walk the streets to insist on fair conditions.  That strike need not and should not have occurred if the officials concerned had the courtesy to reply to the union's representations on behalf of the men involved.  Surely it is not maintained that it is on grounds of saving revenue or efficiency that they omit to give the information required to members? That kind of effrontery, discourtesy and secretiveness must end, and I ask the Minister to see that it does end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody may suggest that it was because of a notice of motion passed at a previous council meeting that the decision was reached not to give an acknowledgment to representations where the information could be furnished to the representatives immediately.As far as I am aware, my council never agreed to any abridging of our rights in respect of information. Indeed the contrary is true and there have been very many motions since then demanding that the county manager take the necessary steps to have all representations replied to promptly, verbally or in writing.  One does not wish to tax officials unfairly or unnecessarily but we say representations should be replied to within a reasonable time.  We do not even specify a week or a fortnight but it is a serious matter that representations made by me have not been answered after six or even 12 months.  It sows seeds of suspicion and destroys the democratic system of local government to which we all strive to adhere.  It savours of a tendency to set up an autocratic bureaucracy which will do <Col N="701" /> away with all possibility of co-operation between public representatives and management.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered what is the reason for this.  Is it perhaps an attempt on the part of some partisan officials to make it as difficult as possible for public representatives to carry out their duties?  Are officials not going out of their way to retard the work of public representatives?  I question the reasons for it.  Is it done on genuine grounds or to discriminate deliberately against some who are not of the same political colour as the officials are known to be?</P>
    <P>In speaking of the role of the county council and its employees, I must draw to the Minister's attention the precarious situation of temporary clerks or officials of the county council. I know of instances where temporary employees of a local authority carried out extremely important clerical work just the same as the duties carried out by the appointed officials and bore the same responsibility over a lifetime of 20 or 30 years and who were denied any status or sense of security. Allegedly on managerial or ministerial instruction, they are denied 12 months' work in any year.  There is a tendency to lay off those people and they are not given more than nine or ten months' work each year.</P>
    <P>Is there any justification for that? I want the Minister to tell me what order, regulation or statute ordains that the temporary employee of the local authority must be kicked out of his job for two or three months each year?  I know, and I can prove conclusively, that there is abundance of work and that a considerable amount of overtime is being worked by other officials in various departments and yet, perhaps to distinguish the men from the boys, these temporary men are laid off for a number of months.  It is deplorable, it is despicable, that that should happen.</P>
    <P>These temporary clerks are to my knowledge as intelligent and as well qualified as many of the appointed officers.  They work for 30 or 40 years for the local authority.  At the end of that time, they are thrown on the <Col N="702" /> unemployment scrapheap, with no prospects other than the old age pension.  It is bad enough that they should be discriminated against in that way but it is even worse they should be laid off for a few months in every year.  That is unfair.  It is unjust.  I appeal to the Minister on behalf of these loyal and devoted temporary servants of the local authority to give them the same conditions and the same wages as appointed officers.</P>
    <P>I have said that these are without status.  That is clearly indicated by the fact that the wage structure of these temporary clerks is related to the lowest possible common denominator. In some cases it is related to the wage of ordinary county council workers. These temporary clerks have the same duties, the same responsibilities, and do the same work as appointed officers. Yet their wages are grossly inferior. They have no pension rights and they are kicked out for a few months every year&mdash;for what reason I do not know. I submit it is utterly disgraceful to make such class discrimination.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appointment of two rent collectors, I tabled a question yesterday to the Minister expressing my concern about the long delay in his giving his approval to the appointment of these two rent collectors in the Tipperary area.  The Minister's reply was vague in the extreme.  He merely said that the submission of the South Tipperary County Council was receiving attention and, when a decision had been made, it would be conveyed to the local authority.  We are very suspicious of the undue delay involved in approving the appointment of these two rent collectors.</P>
    <P>The submission was made to the Minister some time in May.  Up to now he has not been able to make up his mind as to what to do.  We are bound to ask the reasons why.  The Minister has knowledge that the appointment of these two men was a source of great political controversy in South Tipperary, a political controversy which lasted for a very long time.  The Minister will have knowledge, too, that pressure is being brought to bear by members of one political Party, the Minister's Party, to have the man who <Col N="703" /> is now carrying out these duties appointed or, if not appointed, kept there indefinitely to the exclusion of the men concerned.</P>
    <P>Morally, in equity and in justice, the position is wrong.  These posts were included in the terms of appointment accepted by these two men.  It is only right and just that these terms should be honoured and these men given that which was enshrined in their terms of appointment to our council.  If we destroy that fundamental principle between master and man, worker and employer, where will it lead to?  It is very serious that a man should act in a temporary capacity for such a long period.  Apparently the Minister cannot make up his mind what to do.  We are bringing the matter to his attention again today and asking him, without any further delay, to approve the appointment of these two men.  If approval is not given, there will be serious repercussions, not the least being that these men have a very strong case in law.  Litigation is most likely.  That will prove costly.  We have had senior counsel's advice and we know for a fact that these men will be upheld in law.  Someone will have to pay.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to allow himself to be influenced by political pressure in this matter.  I appeal to him to do that which is right and appoint these two men to the posts to which they are legitimately entitled. Some sought to discriminate against these two men because of the other positions they occupy, the positions of home assistance officers.  Home assistance officer is not an enviable post perhaps; one may incur the disfavour of many people.  It is nevertheless shallow, false and grossly unfair that men should be discriminated against because of the positions they hold or because they do have these other jobs. I have always believed in the principle of one man one job but I also believe in the principle of honouring the terms and conditions of appointment, whatever they are, and I will not see that principle compromised for political purposes.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the creation of <Col N="704" /> a board of conciliation and arbitration for servants of local authorities. As Deputy Hogan has said, this is a bone of contention in South Tipperary. I strenuously oppose the idea that the local authority should be asked to subscribe financially to the creation of this board.  I occupied the position of chairman of a national board of conciliation and arbitration and I am at present vice-president of the board.  I can speak, I think, with reasonable authority as to the manner in which these boards are founded, how they operate, how they are financed, and their purpose generally.  I do not know of any joint industrial council which went to the ratepayers for a subscription towards its initiation and maintenance.It was brazen audacity on the part of the County Managers' Association to ask the local authority to come in and finance a board of arbitration for them and some other employees who decided they would join.</P>
    <P>I have another basic and fundamental objection to the creation of this kind of board.  This kind of board is not representative.  It does not purport to represent more than 50 per cent.  It is not, therefore, representative.Many of the categories involved, such as engineers, members of the medical profession, and others, have to a very large extent opted out; they will have no hand, act or part in it because of its present set-up.  That is their own business, but I do not want to see a small clique, or a junta, impose their will upon the other servants of local authorities.  I do not want to see a junta of 30 county managers created for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the fundamental right to strike, which is enshrined in our Constitution, is, in my opinion, denied to the categories of persons under this joint board of conciliation and arbitration for county council servants.  The right to go to the Labour Court is, I feel, also denied to these people.  They are confined to an autocratic junta which seems to be dominated in the main by the County Managers' Association.  I do not think that kind of set-up can mete out justice to the employees concerned.  Indeed, I am <Col N="705" /> convinced in that regard that the joint board has got off to a very bad start by reason of the fact that one of its first acts has been to discriminate against the women in the service.</P>
    <P>Up to now the female staff officers attached to county councils enjoyed the same status and salary scales as the male staffs.  A precedent has been created by this board in that they have now made a recommendation on salary scales and the offer to the women is less than that to the men.  For the first time, women in the local government service have lost their status, have lost the equality they enjoyed with the men.  That is a disgraceful situation and I hope that the board which discriminates against women to that extent and which seeks to deny them that which the trade union movement has agitated for at all times&mdash;equal pay for equal work, and equality between the sexes&mdash;and which seeks to override that at a time when there was, in fact, equality, does not deserve to flourish.</P>
    <P>I am extremely pleased, therefore, that I opposed the establishment of such a board and I will continue to do so until such time as I am satisfied that it is so organised and constituted as to give fair play to all categories of persons in the local authority service.At present it does not do that. It is the negation of equality and representation and seeks to set up this very dangerous and distasteful precedent of denying women the status and equality they enjoyed heretofore.</P>
    <P>I want to add my voice in support of the Minister in respect of all he is doing to make our roads safe.  Anything the Minister can do in respect of road safety will receive the support and the plaudits of every member in this House.  His ideas for implementing speed limits, driving tests, proper lighting and equipping of vehicles, and all these things, are very laudable and indeed long overdue.  It is, at the same time, alarming that despite all these attempts by the Minister and his colleague in the Department of Justice to restrain irresponsible drivers of vehicles, the death rate on the roads is still rising and has increased in recent months.  It should be brought <Col N="706" /> home to those people in charge of vehicles, be they lorries or cars especially, that they operate a lethal weapon, a weapon which can and does too often destroy human life.  Accordingly, when such irresponsibility, especially in the form of drunkenness, is brought to our courts, it should be dealt with in a very severe manner. We extend to the Minister our best wishes and give him an assurance of all the assistance we can render in grappling with this sad situation of slaughter on our roads.</P>
    <P>One of the contributory factors to the increase in injuries and deaths on our roads has been the confusion which exists for some months past about the legality of the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; signs.  It is to be greatly deplored that the Ministers concerned did not ascertain and prove conclusively the legality of this &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; sign.  It was revealed quite recently that it did not, in fact, have any legal basis.  The result has been, according to a reply by the Minister for Justice to a question some time ago, that since the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; sign has been invalidated from the legal point of view, many irresponsible users of our roads are now showing a complete and utter disregard for such signs and, in fact, crashing through them&mdash;that is quite evident&mdash;thereby creating a very grave danger for people in the area.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance that the confusion which now exists with regard to these signs be cleared up.  If the Minister intends to have them removed, what kind of sign is to replace them? Would he regard it as of extreme urgency that this be done at the earliest possible opportunity?  The flagrant disregard of such signs at present constitutes a greater hazard on the roads than ever before.  I do not know what it would cost to replace it by a more suitable sign, such as &ldquo;Extreme caution&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yield right-of-way&rdquo;.  At all events, the Minister has probably made up his mind on that matter by now.  Whatever the substitute sign is to be, let it be erected very soon.</P>
    <P>The fact that no adequate safeguards were taken to ascertain the legality of the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; sign in the first instance is going to prove a very costly matter for the public and the ratepayers.  I <Col N="707" /> think it is fair to ask what it cost to design, manufacture and erect the countless thousands of such signs throughout our country, and what it will cost to remove them and replace them by a more suitable sign.  I am not concerned about the cost to that extent, but I am vitally concerned to see them replaced by a sign which has a legal basis and which will restrain those irresponsibles who are now treating them with contempt, thereby endangering the lives of others.</P>
    <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to advert to grants as administered by the Minister's Department.  I join with the Minister in deploring the fact that so many local authorities find it difficult, for one reason or another, to pay grants, whether they be new housing grants or repair grants.  I appreciate the difficulty, with limited financial resources, of the small urban councils in paying grants £1 for £1, with what grants are made available by the Minister.  At the same time, it is a grievous disservice to the citizens in these urban and some borough areas that some form of grant is not paid to those people who repair their houses or build new houses.  Some local authorities are extremely generous in this regard and for a long number of years, without any admonition from the Minister, out of the money allocated by him, the borough corporation, which I represent, has been paying repair grants to all applicants, £1 for £1, with what the Department has paid.  We have been paying <i>pro rata</i> for house repair grants for a long number of years.</P>
    <P>We believe that is a good policy. In the first instance, by assisting our people to keep their houses in adequate repair, we are not merely helping them to have a more confortable home but we are, to a very large extent, obviating the real possibility of having to rehouse these people in later years, if the repairs are allowed to go by default.  We are thereby helping ourselves.  In that regard we are assisting&mdash;and every local authority is doing the same&mdash;in improving the appearance of our streets and our <Col N="708" /> towns by making it possible for people to avail of such grants for the repair, maintenance and improvement of their property.  Many of our towns would present a far more sorry picture in unsightliness, ugliness and derelict sites, were it not for these grants.</P>
    <P>Every possible enticement and encouragement should be given to the local authorities, who, up to now, are not paying grants, to encourage them to do so.  It is not good enough that some local authorities pay £1 for £1 while other authorities apply a means test on the basis of income or rateable valuation and urban authorities just pay no grant at all.  They ignore altogether the fundamental principle involved in grants for repair and improvement and grants for new house building.  If it is true to say that the revenue of local authorities is so small as to make it impossible for them to provide money for grants of this kind, then I would ask the Minister to see what he can do by way of making extra grants in these instances or by way of reimbursement or assisting these poor local authorities in respect of any moneys they may make available for this very laudable purpose.</P>
    <P>This time 12 months, in my remarks on the Estimate, I brought to the Minister's attention an anomaly which exists in respect of recent legislation concerning grants.  I refer to the Loans and Grants Act passed here some 12 months ago.  The Minister, in respect of this Act, which has to do with supplementary grants for the erection of new houses, fixed an income of £832.  In other words, he would not make a grant available to an applicant towards the erection of his new house, if the income of the applicant, together with that of his wife, exceeded £832.  I said at that time, and I repeat it here again today, that that income ceiling is much too low.  Having regard, first of all, to the fall in the value of money and to the fact that the skilled industrial worker, tradesman and artisan nowadays has an income of more than £832 a year why fix such a low ceiling?  It precludes a number of people from building new homes.  The kind of means test which <Col N="709" /> the Minister stipulates is rather niggardly.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Minister did very many local authorities a great disservice in deciding on such a figure. He ought to have taken the precaution of consulting the local authorities and ascertaining what kind of test they applied before putting this figure on the Statute Book.  If he did, he would have found out that the borough corporation which I represent, Clonmel Corporation, were in fact making available loans for new house building&mdash; and were proud of it&mdash;to people, whose incomes did not exceed £1,000, many years ago.  It can clearly be seen then that the Minister in this Act, worsened, out of all proportion, the facilities which some urban councils and corporations were making available to the public.  It has caused a lot of annoyance, first of all, in that down the years people with an income up to £1,000 have got the grants and have built their homes but now, despite the fall in the value of money, we are precluded from giving these grants to people with more than £832 a year.</P>

      <P>Might I point out to the Deputy if this change would require the revision of legislation, it is not in order to discuss it on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the legislation requires revision.  I was about to ask if the Minister agrees with me that the ceiling in question is rather low, especially where local authorities were giving grants in respect of the higher figure and if he would indicate by way of circular to these local authorities that they are still permitted to make grants available up to the higher figure where family circumstances allow it.  I would appreciate in respect of my own local authority if the Minister could convey to them that, despite anything to the contrary in the Act, they have power to make grants available for new house building on the basis of the old means test or any new means test. I feel it is no skin off the Minister's nose if a local authority decides to be generous with its own money.  I do not see any reason why the Minister should object, if we decide of our own volition, to pay out of the ratepayers' <Col N="710" /> money by way of grants of this kind at the higher rate.  I would appeal to the Minister not to raise any objection to it.</P>
      <P>The complaints in respect of delay in the payment of house repair grants still come to the notice of public representatives, but, I am pleased to say, not so much as in past years.  There appears to have been an improvement in the whole question of inspection, estimation and approval for the purpose of paying grants in respect of repairs, but there are still a number of difficulties to which I should like to advert.  The Departmental engineers and officials concerned with the examination and inspection of houses for repairs are perhaps too stringent in their requirements.  Indeed, many of them are very exacting in laying down the type of repairs they require to be carried out.  I know of instances where tenants with positive ideas of the type of improvements they need to their houses have been unable to carry them out.  A tenant may want an additional room or the provision of a toilet with running water.  In a particular instance, a tenant required a porch as a protection against the weather but when the Departmental official came along, he required that the house should have overall repairs and presented the applicant for the grant with a bill of costs out of all proportion to his requirements.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the necessity for the Department to ensure that when a grant is being paid, the house will be left in a good habitable state of repair, but where the tenant expresses a desire to have a certain type of repair carried out, I would ask the Minister to prevail on the engineers to meet the tenants' wishes, if at all possible.  Many people have failed to secure grants because of the requirements of the Department's engineers.  Specifications laid down in many instances presented impossible problems for the tenants concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember a Departmental stipulation that a dormer window be included in the gable end of a house.  There were, however, objections by the next-door neighbour and the applicant was involved in litigation and prevented by law from putting in the dormer window in accordance with the stipulation of <Col N="711" /> the engineer.  The Department insisted that the window go in or the grant would not be paid and I do not think the grant was ever paid in that case.</P>
    <P>In another case, a difficulty arose over an applicant's inability to gain access to a yard adjoining his property for the purpose of roughcasting the gable of his house.  Again, there was an objection by the adjoining owner who placed a large amount of material against the gable, making it impossible for the applicant to get near it or carry out the work stipulated by the Department.Because the gable was not repaired according to the specification, a grant was not paid, though all the other repairs were done at a cost of a considerable amount of money to the applicant.</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases of that kind, I think there should be some understanding between the Minister's officials and the people concerned.  Many people get into difficulties through lack of understanding of the Department's requirements.They proceed with the repairs and when the job is virtually a <i>fait accompli</i>, they call on the Department's engineers who sometimes condemn the work, perhaps because a ceiling is not the required height or perhaps because the entrance to the bathroom or the toilet is via a livingroom such as a kitchen.  I know that is perhaps a mortal sin in the eyes of the engineers, but I submit that where the work has been completed at very great cost to the applicant, the engineers should make allowances.  Perhaps the cases I have mentioned are exceptions, but as I have said they occur quite frequently.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the question of accelerating the provision of piped water supplies and sewerage facilities.  I have been a great enthusiast for the extension of such worthwhile amenities and am proud of the progress we have made in my county in that respect.  There, we have embarked on a scheme of piped water which will cost something like £4 million and we shall not stop until every farm, every cottage, every home in that county is provided with piped water, with the exception, of course, <Col N="712" /> of those areas to which it is impossible to extend piped water supplies.</P>
    <P>In such areas we hope to embark on group schemes.  I submit that these group schemes should be restricted to areas where piped water can never be made available and the Minister should see to it that where local authorities have positive plans for piped water supplies, they should not be allowed to proceed with group schemes for those areas because that has caused a lot of annoyance and frustration from time to time.  It is frustrating to find demands for group schemes in areas in respect of which the local authority had plans, some of them in the final stages of preparation and implementation, for piped water supplies.That type of overlapping should be avoided.</P>
    <P>We are concerned also about delays in implementing planned sewerage facilities.  Water supplies and sewerage systems are twins and I would urge that as soon as possible after an area has been supplied with piped water, a sewerage system should be provided. We know there are difficulties in the way; we know that tenants will be required to indicate whether they are prepared to accept the water supplies and the sewerage system and to pay whatever the costs may be, but the two schemes should be synchronised as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to problems in regard to vested cottages in many countries.  I have already adverted to the problem of vesting generally and have deplored the fact that there is an element of compulsion, that many people are unwilling owners of vested cottages, who vest only because of the provision in respect of repairs.  If a person vests he can get the repairs done; if he does not vest, there may be interminable delays.  The result is that many people are unwilling owners of these cottages, many of which are locked up, the people having gone away, some of them to England.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the houses should be taken from such people.  I presume their absence in England is of a temporary nature, that they may be able to return later, find <Col N="713" /> suitable remunerative and secure employment and re-occupy the cottage, but the problem is there of vested cottages being locked up and falling into disrepair.  There is the still more deplorable situation of these houses appearing daily in auctioneers' advertisements, being offered for sale, and in most instances it is not the type of people for whom these houses were built who secure them.  It is not the working classes to whom they are sold at exorbitant prices; it is professional people and large farmers who secure them.  It is the height of folly, that local authorities should build houses at great cost and then allow them to fall into the hands of people for whom they were never intended.  I would ask the Minister to have regard to this.</P>
    <P>My primary purpose in speaking to-day was to draw the attention of the Minister to the sad and sorry state of affairs in respect of housing in South Tipperary.  What I have said has not been said with any ulterior motive, in any seeking for notoriety or for political purposes but as one who is genuinely anxious to see our people rehoused and to overcome the formidable difficulties with which our local authorities are confronted.  If private enterprise cannot assist in the building of houses, if the local authorities refuse to accept the responsibility of building them by direct labour, then the Minister must intervene and set up the machinery to provide the houses in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that so many people should be left in such awful conditions for a quarter of their lifetimes without hope of a home.  The number of houses our council have scheduled for erection is only a fraction of the number required.  There is something fundamentally wrong in the system we are trying to operate.  I am condemning that system and I am asking the Minister to indicate whether he has a solution to the problem.  I would ask him to have an investigation into the clear dereliction of duty on the part of the South Tipperary officials in failing to provide houses.</P>

      <P>May I express my pleasure at seeing the Dáil get down <Col N="714" /> to work again?  Deputies have a job to do for the next three or four years and they should do it.  It is a pity the Minister was not present for all of Deputy Treacy's speech for if one-third of the allegations made by him about his local authority are true, it is the Minister's duty to abolish that body forthwith.</P>
      <P>Of course Deputy Treacy is an ambitious young man.  I like to see ambitious young men, provided they straighten out some time, but when he comes along here and shows such a lamentable lack of knowledge of the powers of local authorities and of the elected representatives, I feel pity for the local authority of which he is chairman.  I suggest that he drop down to his own Party Room and go to school to Deputy Desmond, or Deputy McAuliffe, or Deputy M.P. Murphy.</P>
      <P>Any one of these Deputies would save us from the lamentable tale of woe we heard from him today.  I like to be reasonable but when a Deputy comes in here and says he is chairman of a local authority and does not know the powers of that local authority about managers, all I can do is tell him to drop down to Deputy Desmond who will only be too happy to give him the necessary tips.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy comes into this House, he should learn his job.  He told us that there are from 100 to 200 items on the agenda of his council, the council of which he is chairman.  Do they meet every day of the week and work overtime at night to get through it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with the position of housing in Cork and to say to the Minister that if an official is not doing his job, he should get rid of him.  Last December, a sworn inquiry was held in South Cork in connection with the erection of 24 houses in Carrigtwohill.  These houses were wanted and we are now coming to the November following the holding of that inquiry and we have not yet found out what was the decision of the gentleman who held it.  If I were in the <Col N="715" /> Minister's boots, I would wear the toe of my shoe on that gentleman going out of the Custom House door.  An official is there to do his job and if he does not do it, he should go out just as the people over there will go out when the people get at them if they do not do their jobs.</P>
    <P>It is three or four years from the day on which a council decides to get local Government sanction for the building of 15 or 20 houses to the time these houses are built for the people who want them.  It is not for their sons or daughters they want them.  They want them for themselves and the sooner the officials of the Department learn that, the better it will be for everyone.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the question of the powers of the managers.  Some time ago, the Department washed their hands of some of that power in connection with the sanctioning of grants to individuals who were entitled to get houses from local authorities.  Having done that, I would suggest to the Department that they keep their noses out of the whole business.  Having handed that power to the managers, let them leave it to the managers and not come along now and say that such and such a person is not entitled to the full subsidy.  Down comes a letter from the Department and the whole business is held up.  They should either do the thing themselves or leave it alone and not be turning the manager into some kind of rat who is afraid to do anything for fear of the big stick from the Department.  Let us get down to the job.  We shall be here for the next three or four years and the officials concerned would need to do the job or I shall keep belting them here until they do it.</P>
    <P>There is a regulation preventing the tenant of a local authority house allowing a married son or daughter to live in the house.  If a married son or daughter lives with the parents in a local authority house and afterwards applies for a house, the conditions in regard to subsidy are such that no local authority can build a house for them. I ask the Minister where should these people go.  There is a regulation that no local authority can give a house to <Col N="716" /> a single man.  Thanks be to God, as a result of the development in the country at the moment, there are plenty of young men in decent employment who want to get married and rear families, and who must be housed.  If a boy gets married in the morning, where is he to take his wife?  Is it out under a bush?  According to the Department of Local Government, that is the only place he can take her.</P>
    <P>When a house is condemned and the tenant is moved out of it into a local authority house, the old dwelling must be demolished.  Nobody else can go into it; it is not available for the young fellow.  The young married man cannot go in with the father or mother or, if he does, he will never get a house out of it.  We all know what people-in-law are.  Living with in-laws is not a very happy situation.  Surely, there should be some regulation in regard to that matter?  If the father and mother are decent enough to allow the married son or daughter to live in the house, the young married couple should not be penalised in the matter of getting a house afterwards.</P>
    <P>There will be a by-election soon in Cork.  I suggest to the Minister that after six or seven years, it is time he let us country boys know the compensation we are to get for the last extension of the borough boundary in Cork.  We want the cash for ourselves, not for our grandchildren.  It is seven years since that borough boundary was extended.  It is seven years since there was a disagreement and the Minister's Department were to say the amount of money we were to get for the rates we were losing.  I have asked about 15 questions here about it and have not got an answer yet.  That decision should have been made before any further extension of the borough boundaries in Cork was proposed.  Perhaps tomorrow or the next day some Pooh-Bah out of the Department of Local Government will say that it is a case of our owing money for having the area taken off our hands.  I would not be at all surprised.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion, I drew attention to the anomalies that exist in respect of the purchase of local <Col N="717" /> authority houses.  When the Fianna Fáil Government came into office in 1932, one of the first things they decided was that the worker would be as free and should have the same rights in regard to his own house as the farmer had in regard to his farm.  For that reason, legislation was passed giving power to the ordinary labourer to become the owner of his house.  I have come across most extraordinary anomalies in respect of purchase schemes, for instance, in the town of Cobh.</P>
    <P>The county council had to step in and carry out a lot of building just on the borough boundary of Cobh because the bulk of employment in Cobh is on the island of Haulbowline which is in the rural area and workers in Haulbowline are entitled to be housed, not by the urban authority, but by the county council.  For that reason, starting in 1947, we had succeeded in building some 180 houses outside the borough boundary of Cobh.  The road represents the urban boundary.  The county council built houses on one side of the road; the urban council built houses on the other side.</P>
    <P>There were two groups of houses built in the same year, opened on the same day by the Minister for Agriculture who was then Minister for Local Government.  The houses were identical.  The rents were the same. There is a purchase scheme in operation for both groups of houses which cater for the same class of tenant. The tenants may be working side by side on the same job.  Under the county council purchase scheme, a man paying 11/- a week, on purchase of his house had the weekly payment reduced to 9/-.  On the other side of the road, under the urban council, if a man wants to purchase, he can do so but his 11/- a week rent goes up to 32/6d.  Not alone is it good socially that a man should own his own house but it is good for the local authority concerned inasmuch as they have not to carry the burden of maintenance, which can be a very heavy item, especially for a small local authority.</P>
    <P>One lot was built under the Labourers Act and the other lot under <Col N="718" /> the Housing of the Working Classes Act.  Under the Labourers Act, a subsidy continues on the houses after purchase.Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, that subsidy ceases.  If all the houses that are the property of the Cobh urban council were purchased, the State would not be paying the £1,800 a year it is at present paying in subsidy for those houses.  That is the difference.  Surely the Minister's Department is not so busy altogether.  I hear they are bringing in new legislation.  I shall look for something in the new legislation to deal with that matter.  That is one of the things we set out to do when we came in here first.  I remember I gave evidence before the commission of inquiry set up to consider the ways and means by which the ordinary labourer in the country became the owner of his own house.  It is time the Government brought in legislation to remedy that defect.</P>
    <P>There is a bigger problem still.  If the Department of Local Government are lunatics enough&mdash;and they are capable of anything&mdash;to extend further the borough boundary in Cork, according to the proposals sent in by the Cork Corporation, there are 700 odd tenants living outside that boundary who will be placed in the unenviable position that, on the day they become Corporation tenants, if they want to purchase their houses, the rents will go up from 11/- to 32/6d. and if those tenants are to be placed in as good a position by the Cork Corporation when they take them over, then it will cost the citizens of Cork 11d. extra on their rates to pay the difference in the rents for those tenants.</P>
    <P>Those are the difficulties we are meeting day by day.  Now that it is definite we are to be here for our full term, I suggest the Minister should get to work and clear up these things.  I think Deputies opposite are satisfied. They are sadder and wiser than they were yesterday morning.  However, we have six more jokers to pull out of the bag before we will ask them to pull straws to know which of them will be missing to keep the Government in office.</P>

      <P>At this stage when so much has been said and contradicted about local government affairs and after the strange happenings of yesterday, when the Government's life and the people's agony have been prolonged by two fresh turnovers, I suppose one might be forgiven for feeling a little frustrated.  However, my recollection of the Minister's speech in introducing the token Estimate for his Department is that he went straight in to deal with housing and devoted the major portion of his speech to this important problem.  If this indicates the Minister's order of priority in dealing with Local Government matters we in County Dublin will certainly find ourselves in wholehearted agreement with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great pity that the sudden interest and enthusiasm which are now evident were absent for the greater part of the past six or seven years.  I know the facts about this because I have been a member of the Dublin County Council for the past eight or nine years and I know that, when the Government came back to power in 1957 every county manager and every Government official in this country was just told to go slow.  The Minister in the course of his speech referred to <Col N="720" /> the most recent <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in relation to its future demands on local authority services.I think he could have appropriately referred also to the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> wherein it was specifically stated that it was not sufficient for investment to be necessary, that it must be productive as well.  The Government when they came back in 1957 decided that the building of local authority houses was not productive investment and I hold that because of their influence and intimidation all the housing officers in the local authority had to determine that they would do nothing.</P>
    <P>I have always found the county managers and responsible officials in the local authority to be good sound civil servants.  If the Minister wants something done they will do it.  If he does not want something done they will do everything in their power to meet with his wishes.  It is all very fine to blame the county councils.  A good deal of confusion has been created between the anxiety of the members to get on with the job and the performance of the officials and the various other frustrations that come from the Department holding up schemes.  Without going into detail about our experience, I can say that I know no member of the Dublin County Council who was not extremely anxious to provide for the housing needs of our people.  That goes for all Parties in the House.  The Minister's representatives on the council did not spearhead this but at all times they supported it.  It has taken us over eight years to get sanction from the Department of Local Government for the building of certain rural houses in north County Dublin and in the time that has elapsed, the cost of providing those houses has almost doubled.  That is the contribution the Department of Local Government have made to our effort.</P>
    <P>There was no question that I ever heard of at any time that money was not available.  Our credit in Dublin County Council was always good and the Minister or his officials never wrote to the county council to my knowledge to say that money was not available <Col N="721" /> but they did everything else.  The first thing they required was that a survey should be made of the urgent housing needs in a particular area.  The county medical officer in a very safe and conservative way assessed the needs.  I can give the Minister examples of how he subsequently sent out his assessors and the needs as indicated by our doctor were cut in half.  A couple of years later, we had to struggle on to build the remainder and there is still a need for houses.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that this interference and this obstruction was due to anything other than a wish on the part of the Government and the Minister not to provide the people with the necessary houses.  The change has come only under the pressure of public opinion and unfortunately as a result of several tragedies.  The possibility of a general election might have had something to do with the speed at which certain housing announcements were made recently.  I hope the interest and enthusiasm now apparent will not lapse and that we will not find ourselves again in the position in which we have been for the past six or seven years.  I believe that if the Minister were interested, and if he frequently inquired as to what was happening, what were our requirements and how we were meeting those requirements, we would get a response that otherwise the members of the council will never be able to get.</P>
    <P>Following the establishment of the need, we go out and look for sites.  We have certain difficulties, as every area has, but there are sites available.  We experience difficulties and delays in regard to compulsory purchase, delays which I think could be overcome by the Minister.  It is ridiculous that compulsory purchase should take two or three years.  It is a Minister's responsibility.When we get sites, the experience has been that the sites are turned down by the Department for all sorts of frivolous reasons.  These sites have been examined from the various points of view by the responsible people in the county council, with all the local knowledge they have.  When somebody comes from the Department, he feels that it is his responsibility, and almost <Col N="722" /> his duty, to find fault and turn down sites.</P>
    <P>Having got a site sanctioned, we start to prepare plans and working drawings and specifications and it is here, in my opinion, that the Department have really &ldquo;gone to town&rdquo;. Over all those years, we could not produce a plan that was not too good or too expensive.  Eventually when our excellent, but I would say, innocent, architect thought he had reached an all-time low in housing quality and design, we got a communication from the Department to examine a house which some crackpot architect had designed in Ringaskiddy costing in the region of £800.  This house had a corrugated asbestos roof; it was not plastered and as far as I can recollect, there were concrete floors in the bedrooms.That was the Department's idea of what was good enough for the people at a time when we are talking about progress and economic expansion.Naturally we drew the line at this and we refused to build that sort of house.  I think we were right to refuse.</P>
    <P>Having indicated the various matters which have held up the provision of houses and which were entirely outside the control of the elected representatives of the council, naturally I will be expected to say how this situation could be improved.  There are at the moment certain areas which are recognised as problem areas from the point of view of housing.  I fail to see why officials in the Department who are there to criticise and find fault with the plans and efforts of the local authorities are not seconded to these problem areas to work with and not against the officials of the county council who are endeavouring to prepare plans and decide on sites and designs.  They can find fault as a job is being done.</P>
    <P>This idea of one Department being there to knock down the plans of another will never achieve anything. These officials could move around and visit the various local authorities and watch the progress and not wait until things are finalised to find fault and perhaps cause delay of months or years while all the time costs are rising.  Because of unnecessary delays <Col N="723" /> and a close-down on housing, at least 50 per cent of our skilled workers left the country and, in my view, they have no intention of returning because they have no faith even now in the Government's building programme.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a speech made by the Minister some three weeks ago.  He was referring to cottages and applications for cottages and he said that the future basis of eligibility for local authority houses will be need.  He expanded that later on.  If he had stopped there, I would agree 100 per cent with him, but he went on to say that in future vocation would not come into the picture.  I want to say as a member of a local authority in County Dublin that vocation never really got a weighted preference and that that does not indicate any new departure in allocating houses.  I said that we agreed with the Minister on his order of priority but we still disagree with certain aspects of his policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred to the problems of sub-tenants, or illegal tenants, as they are described.  In County Dublin, we have over 300 such tenants. We have over 300 such tenants because we fail to provide housing accommodation for them when they badly need it. The Minister still holds that we have pressed him, time and again, that these people are criminals: that they are outlaws and not to be considered as a housing problem of the local authority. So long as he persists in this attitude, I do not believe he is trying to get the housing problem in County Dublin solved.  If he wants to get it solved, he will say: &ldquo;Provide houses for those needing houses.  Let need be the basis. No matter where a man finds himself badly in need of housing, that man should be housed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The difficulties that members have in county councils arise in various ways. We have no authority as members to direct the manager to employ certain staff.  We have no authority to direct the manager that certain staff be paid certain salaries.  If the salaries are inadequate, we may get staff temporarily but they will not stay with us, and I believe that has been happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> If the manager himself, for his own reasons, refuses to employ this staff, I think the Minister should step in and say: &ldquo;This job must be done.  We want the people housed and you have the responsibility&rdquo;, I believe we would get the houses built in that way.</P>
    <P>I put in a supplementary the other day to a question about the building of houses on plots of vested tenants.  I know the Minister has indicated that such houses could be built.  This is the sort of thing we meet with.  This is from the Law Agent of the Dublin County Council:</P>
    <P>The Minister's power of suspending for a time the operation of the statutory conditions relating to vested cottages is expressly confined to the statutory conditions as to user.  Statutory conditions as to user are set out in Section 17 (2)...  The proposal to build a second cottage on the vested cottage plot appears to me to involve a breach of the statutory conditions as to sub-division set out in Section...  The Minister has no power to dispense from the operation of that condition.</P>
    <P>That is the information of our Law Agent.</P>
    <P>When we drew the attention of the manager to the fact that the Minister had stated this was in order, the manager insisted that we could not compel him to commit an illegal act.  It may be said that the Minister indicated more or less that we could do it.  We have brought in a section before and it is possible that that may do it.  But that is all a very unpleasant business. The members of a county council do not like doing that sort of thing.  They will do it and do it again but if the Minister used his undoubted influence with the county managers this sort of situation would not arise.  It is not for one or two that we need houses and, therefore, it is not a serious situation with us because we need 1,000 at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne's solution to that is to abolish the county council and the corporation.  That sort of thing gets the headlines but I do not think it gets <Col N="725" /> anything else done.  I was glad to see at least that he paid the tribute to the city and county manager that he is one of the best men the country has ever had to build houses.  I believe that if the influence were there still, he would build the houses.  But certainly the abolition of the county council or the corporation will not lead to anything.</P>
    <P>The point, I think, that Deputy Dunne seemed to me to make was that so long as he was a member of these bodies first-class work was done but the minute he left everybody fell asleep: some extraordinary change came over them and they were no longer effective and could no longer be effective.  He now wants to set up a regional board to deal with the urgent housing needs of the area.  I do not think that will achieve anything.  In fact, far from having this regional set-up, I think we could have in the county a separate county manager and that there should be a separate city manager.  The present position is that the man who is acting county manager has to look three ways before he can make any decision.  He has to look first to the City Hall, then to the Minister and then back home.  It is an inefficient and ineffective way and the sooner we change it the better.  Having regard to the growing demands for the local authority services, I think there is more than a job and more than sufficient responsibility in County Dublin for any manager no matter how good his capacity.</P>
    <P>Another thing that I think is wrong and that impedes progress is the position of the professional people and the relationship with the administrative people in local authorities.  I do not think professional people employed by local authorities get nearly sufficient recognition.  One would think they were writing to each other in different countries.  The county engineer writes to the county manager or the county secretary and he writes back, and so on.  There are files.  It makes work but it does not make progress.  I think that that is something that certainly should be looked into.</P>
    <P>From time to time, we have had a lot of exhortation from other Government <Col N="726" /> Departments about bringing in efficiency experts.  I think there is quite a scope for such efficiency experts, if it is possible to get experts experienced in local authority administration.  There must be a fantastic amount of nonsensical overlapping and records so that nobody can ever be said to have said or done anything that he cannot contradict or for which he cannot produce documentary evidence.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that we have in County Dublin this problem: about 1,000 houses are needed.  We have been pressing the county manager very hard to provide us with a programme to meet these needs within what we consider is a reasonable period.  We thought that three years should be a reasonable period in view of the fact that we have quite a number of sites secured or on the way to being secured at the moment.  But he protests very strongly that that is much too short a time.  Some of these people are long-suffering.</P>
    <P>In my memory, there are people who have been waiting for a house eight and nine years and still have not been provided with one.  I think the Minister is still wrong in insisting on that in a rural area where it is impossible and perhaps too expensive to provide laid-on water and sewerage facilities.  He should allow the house to be built now and follow it up later on, and as soon as the opportunity presents itself, by providing these people with the services.  The main thing is that there is a roof over their heads.</P>
    <P>Various derogatory remarks were made about the provision as an emergency measure of caravans for these people who find themselves on the roadside.  I disagree with that sort of sentiment.  It is always necessary to have limited emergency accommodation available.  We all know what the caravans we see on the roads to-day are like.  They can make excellent emergency accommodation&mdash;comfortable, happy homes.  We have only to compare them with the type of night shelter accommodation that has been available in Dublin.  There was nothing more unchristian than the type of night shelter accommodation we have <Col N="727" /> had.  I have seen families with children of tender age being put out on the roadside at 9.30 in the morning and left there until 6 p.m.  It was a miracle no serious accident occurred, and I was indeed even pleased to hear that the gable end had fallen out of the Mendicity Institute last week.  I was glad to hear that that sort of accommodation was gone forever.</P>
    <P>In view of Deputy Dunne's criticism I should like to give the position in regard to County Dublin at present. The members of the council want greater speed in the provision of houses and we believe that greater speed is possible.  We have a new county engineer and I hope progress is being made at a rate not achieved for some time.  Tenders have been accepted for 132 cottages.  That is what we were informed in a report.  Sites have been or are in course of being acquired for 537 houses.  We have 1,006 applicants, 429 of whom are in unfit or overcrowded conditions.  Then we have over 300 whom the Minister has outlawed. I would appeal to the Minister to look at this again in a common-sense way and regard these people as human beings in need of houses.  He said that in future need would be the yardstick. I hope he meant what he said.  Unfortunately, he qualified that very much later on in his speech.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see that the Minister appears anxious that serviced sites be made available to people who wish to build their own houses.  I come across many cases of young men, perhaps with good jobs in industry, and intending to get married who cannot get a local authority house.  Such a man sees a bare prospect of being able to build his own house.  But because he is looking for only one site, it will cost him the earth.  No landowner wants to break up a field for one site.  If an effort were made to buy a whole field and provide sites for a number of houses many more people would build their own houses.  I often feel sorry for these people when I see the way they are exploited.  They are exploited in the cost of sites, by certain builders profiteering and by the very poor <Col N="728" /> quality of some of the SDA houses being erected at present.  It is a sad reflection that this sort of profiteering is allowed to continue.  Many people in SDA houses have called me in to look at defects and have asked me if I could do anything to have the grant stopped until the contractor came to some sense of his responsibility and put these defects right.  These people are entitled to anything we can give them, and I am glad to see that the Minister appears anxious to help them.</P>
    <P>I wish to pass now to roads.  I regret very much the Minister's decision in the present year to cut the grant for county roads in County Dublin by over £40,000.  The result is that no member of the county council can go to a meeting and say: &ldquo;Here is a dangerous bend on a county road that should be attended to&rdquo; because the answer is: &ldquo;You know the reduction that has taken place in the county road grant. You cannot get any important work done on county roads&rdquo;.  That reduction should be returned to us as soon as possible.  The decision to reduce the grant was wrong and should never have been made.</P>
    <P>It is all wrong to penalise a county for having brought their roads up to standard and having the major portion of them what are called dust-free roads. It is because we have dust-free roads that this decision appears to have been made.  I do not think they will be dust-free for long if the Minister persists in withholding such a substantial portion of the grant.  An enormous amount of work requires to be done on main road development in County Dublin.  It has imposed an enormous strain on the engineering services.  Our position in relation to the engineering staff has not been particularly happy over the past eight or nine years.  We have county engineers coming and going.  I have always felt that the staff should have been considerably augmented to deal with that problem.  Staffing is a manager's problem, but I feel a separate staff should have been brought in to deal with these main arteries because they are a national requirement.  The roads in County Dublin are more than sufficient for the people of County Dublin, but the nation requires these <Col N="729" /> main arteries north, south, east and west.  Therefore, they should be the responsibility of the State and not of the local authority.  It is all right to say that a 100 per cent grant is payable for the provision of these roads, but three times the normal surface of a road has to be maintained.  That imposes an extra strain on the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was advancing towards the position where roads could be classified.  This is something I raised when I first came into the House two years ago.  I hold very strongly that a very much greater proportion of the mileage of the roads of County Dublin are entitled to be classified as main roads and so qualify for the main road maintenance grant.  The sooner that is done, the better.  We should not wait until all the roads in the country are classified before classifying any of them.  That is merely a delaying tactic. A start must be made somewhere. Obvious areas carry the heavy traffic of the country and they are entitled to first consideration.  I should like to hear the Minister say what sort of yardstick he intends to use, on what traffic densities he will base it and what will guide him in his decision as to what are main roads and what are county roads in the future.</P>
    <P>A great deal of expense is caused in every county, but I think mainly in the counties verging on Dublin city, because we have allowed on to the roads lorries capable of carrying enormous loads.  They are simply pulverising the roads which were never made for such loads, loads which should have been kept on the railways until the roads were brought up to an adequate quality and standard.  I see them all over County Dublin in the summer and sometimes in winter carrying such fantastic weights that they pulverise the roads and there is little opportunity of putting them right because of the continuous traffic on all our roads at present.</P>
    <P>Every member of the House regrets the enormous number of accidents, fatal and otherwise, occurring on our roads and we should all be extremely anxious to do everything possible to <Col N="730" /> obviate this slaughter.  I was extremely disappointed during the year when I made one or two requests to the Minister to have a speed limit imposed where the people badly needed it and the Minister refused and assumed responsibility for not allowing a speed limit.  That is a fantastic thing for a Minister to do.  He says there is full consultation with the local authority committee at all times.  I question that. I raised the case of Castleknock and explained why they should have a speed limit because there you have two schools on either side of a busy, narrow road.  The school boundaries are not solid and children can dash through them at any time and we have quite a history of accidents.  I know, because I inquired, that the local Garda were never consulted as to what was the position on this stretch of road.  Yet, we are told there is adequate consultation.</P>
    <P>Surely this responsibility should not lie with somebody from the Department going out to an area and meeting some official of the county council. Surely the local authority engineering staff should be able to say where there is a danger and their opinion should be accepted and the Minister should not have to wait until the end of the year, until he has an accident history and substantial evidence to indicate that a speed limit should or should not be imposed, increased or decreased.  That responsibility could well be borne at local authority level in conjunction with the local Garda.</P>
    <P>In the case of Palmerstown, which is a main artery to the west, there is a 40 m.p.h. speed limit but we have other areas where there is a 30 m.p.h. limit with not a fraction of the traffic in Palmerstown, so that somebody must be wrong.  When these matters are brought to the Minister's attention, they should be attended to.  Part of this traffic danger is school children.  I cannot see why the protection of school children should be the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government: it would be quite normal to have that responsibility transferred to the Minister for Justice.  It is a normal traffic hazard and local authorities have been put to the expense of dealing with it <Col N="731" /> and yet we are not allowed to decide where a pedestrian crossing should exist.  We must wait until the Garda, through the Department of Justice, tell us that a crossing may or may not be provided.  This is something the Minister may well discuss with the Minister for Justice and make it one responsibility and not a joint responsibility.Traffic problems should not be subdivided.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that recreation centres and playing fields are nearly as much a priority matter as housing.  It is dreadful to build housing schemes throughout the country with no recreation facilities for children because that is the start of vandalism.  Greater effort and enthusiasm should go into the provision of recreation centres in built-up areas.  While housing needs are as acute as they are, I am not terribly anxious about promoting swimming pools because talk about swimming pools and things like that, which to some extent are regarded as luxuries, certainly by people living in night shelters and badly in need of houses, distracts attention from the main problem, which is housing.</P>
    <P>We have the enormous task of extending sanitary services in County Dublin and it is enormously expensive. It may be said this problem should have been tackled more vigorously years ago.  I agree, but it has not been tackled seriously until now and it imposes and continues to impose very heavy cost on the ratepayers.  I want the Minister, looking at the overall picture, to accept that we have a special problem in County Dublin because people are moving, and will continue, I believe, to do so, into County Dublin.  We have the sites but not a sufficient area is serviced as it should be and the sooner this is done, the better for the county and the country.  You may say the county is top-heavy but if we are bringing industry to County Dublin, we are benefiting the country.  Many industrialists will not come to the country if they cannot get into County Dublin.  Local authorities generally are not making nearly sufficient provision to promote the establishment of industry in their <Col N="732" /> areas.  That calls for an extra housing effort also.  In their long distance planning, I think sites should be provided adjacent to what are likely to be the housing areas of the county.</P>
    <P>With regard to quarries, we had a deputation to the Minister some time ago.  He undertook to see if anything could be done within the existing law, or if legislation, which he intends to bring before this House, could be anticipated to enable local authorities to move in and take over dangerous quarries.  On that particular occasion, we were concerned with the quarries in County Dublin.  When the Minister comes to reply, I should like him to tell us if he has been able to examine into the possibilities because, while the most dangerous quarry in the county has been taken care of, there are many other such quarries throughout the area.</P>
    <P>Like the majority of speakers here, the aspect of local government which causes me most concern is the provision of housing.  I appeal to the Minister now not to fall back into a sense of false security and decide to carry on in a lackadaisical fashion where housing is concerned.  Housing must be pressed forward with and every local authority, in conjunction with the Department, must do everything possible to provide the maximum number of houses for our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the speakers here so far have referred to the housing problem, either particularly or in the country as a whole.  The fact that the Minister tells us that we need something in the region of 25,000 houses gives those of us who are members of local authorities, and who are vitally interested in this problem, an idea of the task before us.  I understand that some 20,000 of the 25,000 houses required relate to rural areas. The Minister, his Department and those of us who are members of local authorities have a man-sized job before us if we intend to bring about an improvement in the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem we have now was, I think, brought about to a great extent by the inactivity, if I may so describe it, <Col N="733" /> of the Coalition Government during the middle Fifties.  Not alone did they fail to provide money for housing here in the city of Dublin but, in conferences held in the Department of Local Government, they succeeded in brainwashing local authority officials into going slow on housing.  I should not make this statement if I did not know it to be true.</P>
    <P>I shall relate a little experience now that I had in an attempt to relieve the housing position in my county around that time.  I succeeded in getting the council to agree&mdash;I might say that there was no trouble at all in getting the elected representatives to agree&mdash;to advertise for applicants for a housing scheme.  The only stipulation we put in was that applicants should be in a position to provide sites.  We had some 50, or 55, applicants.  As a result of inspections, reports, and so on, by officials, that figure was reduced by two-thirds.  As a result of further delay, with more reports, and one thing and another, in the end some eight or ten of the original applicants were rehoused in the ordinary course of events. Eventually, it was decided we had two people in need of rehousing.</P>
    <P>I happened to be particularly interested in one of them and a member on the other side of this House was particularly interested in the other.  In the Wicklow County Council, we passed resolution after resolution, until eventually we had to implement Section 4 of the County and City Management Act in order to get the county manager to submit a proposal to the Department to provide these two houses.  It was quite obvious to me that he had his instructions.  The unfortunate thing was that they did not seem to have been withdrawn. Something should be done now, I think, in that regard because there is no doubt that local authorities are anxious to do the job; they are, however, stymied in their efforts by the action of officials, who put every obstacle in the way when it comes to building houses in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the two houses, we eventually succeeded in getting approval; the Department agreed we <Col N="734" /> should build these.  Plans had then to be submitted.  They were.  The Department promptly asked us to consider providing an extra room so that a bathroom and sanitary conveniences could be installed later, if necessary. Sooner than hold up the building of the houses, we immediately decided we would do that.  We sent the plans back to the Department.  They were returned &ldquo;O.K.&rdquo; but &ldquo;You have agreed to provide the extra accommodation.Why do you not go the whole way and provide more accommodation for these people.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The county council decided to advertise for a fullyserviced house.  That decision was unanimous.  It proves that local authority representatives are anxious to build.  Eventually, the Department accepted our proposal.  We advertised and I am glad to be able to report that we are building these houses now, after eight years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that the delay was due to the instructions our officials got in the Custom House in the autumn and winter of 1956.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt brainwashing took place in the Custom House and we, as members of local authorities, were unfortunately compelled to put up with it.  We succeeded in getting the houses built.  We let the officials know we were serious. There is no doubt officials can hold things up.  There is no doubt officials are holding up the building of houses in both urban and rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had another experience within the past few years.  I wanted houses built for small farmers.  Here, again, we had difficulty with the officials.  They did not want to build houses on isolated sites, or for one reason or another. We believed there was a problem to be solved.  No one had catered for the <Col N="735" /> small farmer and the county council could come to his assistance.  As far as the members of the local authority were concerned&mdash;representation is diversified&mdash;all were agreed that the small farmer could be provided with housing.</P>
    <P>After all the reports and inspections, the officials found that there were eight or nine people in need of houses. I put down a notice of motion asking the council to provide houses for those people.  It was carried, but again the officials went on their merry way. An architect was sent to report on the sites, and he was what I might call a wet day as far as the county is concerned.He suggested we should not build houses on these people's lands, that we should cart them into villages where they would have the benefits of water and sewerage services.  That gives the House an idea of the mentality of some of those officials.  Of course, we in the local authority did not take any notice of him.  We came to the conclusion that he was not interested in the provision of houses in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The same situation arises in connection with the urban areas in Wicklow, some of which are still in a bad way for housing.  It has been suggested to me that the Minister himself, not his officials, is deliberately holding up a scheme of ten houses in Arklow.  I hope the Minister will be in a position, when replying, to clear that matter up.  I should mention here that since 1960, two or three small schemes in villages in County Wicklow have been approved by the Department, tenders have been invited and accepted and it is now only a question of getting the contractors to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>My personal experience as far as Wicklow is concerned has been that it is not the Department, or the Minister, who are holding up the building of houses.  That is why I should like the Minister to state what the position is in regard to Arklow, because Coalition members of the Bray and Arklow urban councils have been saying that the Minister is responsible for the delays. <Col N="736" />I know that we had an inquiry early this year in Bray for the compulsory acquisition of sites and I should be grateful if the Minister would expedite the issuing of the report because then the council would be in a position to go ahead and build on the sites concerned or seek alternative sites.</P>
    <P>Dealing with housing generally, I take it the Minister's figure of 25,000 houses was arrived at as a result of a survey.  He is the first Minister for Local Government who has taken such a step to ascertain what our present and future needs in housing are, and he is to be congratulated.  In the survey, I wonder did he seek to find out the number of existing houses throughout the country unfit for habitation, and did he go further and find out the likely cost of replacement in the years to come?</P>
    <P>Due to the operation of the grant schemes by councils, we have succeeded in extending the life of many existing houses.  However, they will come for replacement in the next 20 or 30 years.  I am convinced we will have an annual wastage of houses and that the 25,000 house target of the Minister will not solve our problems in this respect for all time.  Houses which are 100 to 150 years old, even if reconstructed and repaired at regular intervals, will reach a stage where they will be beyond repair.  Therefore, both the Government and the local authorities will have a recurring problem on their hands.</P>
    <P>In urban areas throughout the country this problem is likely to arise sooner because, for instance, in my county the urban authorities do not operate either a reconstruction grant scheme or a supplementary housing grant scheme.  That is unfortunate because I am convinced that the supplementary grant schemes help to make up people's minds to reconstruct their houses.  The Minister might accordingly endeavour to get all local authorities to contribute to these schemes.  It may be difficult, because I know an urban authority which can raise only £50 on a penny in the £ on the rates and they do not feel they can afford a supplementary grant scheme. <Col N="737" /> Perhaps they could be helped by being provided with cheaper money.  If they were enabled to provide a scheme such as that, it would ultimately be to the benefit both of the local authority concerned and of the families.</P>
    <P>Our efforts should now be concentrated on solving our immediate housing problems.  Indeed, we could look ahead to providing a surplus of houses in some areas.  In Arklow, Bray and Wicklow, where there are few unemployment problems, I feel sure many young people would get married earlier if they had prospects of getting housed.</P>
    <P>I should like, again, to congratulate the Minister on his new scheme of grants for the provision of houses for the farming community.  He has decided to increase the State grant by 50 per cent in respect of farmers with valuations up to £25 and I understand there are graded scales after that up to a maximum of £40.  I do not know whether it is the Minister's intention to allow local authorities to supplement such grants pound for pound but I would ask him seriously to consider giving local authorities such permission.</P>
    <P>The council of which I am a member is most progressive in that respect as far as reconstruction grants and repair grants are concerned.  At present we are operating a scheme under which anybody with a valuation of up to £40 qualifies for the maximum grant for a new house and we would look favourably on a suggestion that we should contribute pound for pound with the Department under this new scheme under which it would then be possible for a farmer to get grants amounting to £900.  That would encourage many farmers to build new houses and would contribute considerably to easing the housing shortage in rural Ireland.  The increase in loans from the Land Commission will also be a tremendous fillip to the farmer who wants to build his own house.</P>
    <P>From housing, I want to go to the question of water and sewerage.  My county has been a pioneer in the group water scheme.  I am a great believer in <Col N="738" /> it because it brings about a wonderful community spirit and there is a wide sense of co-operation amongst the people when they get together to provide such a scheme for themselves.  A number of these schemes have been done in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>There are times when the full co-operation of the Department does not seem to be forthcoming but the position in that respect has improved somewhat recently.  Deputy Treacy seemed to think that the Department should not allow a group scheme if the local authority had a scheme in mind for that area in the future.  I do not agree with that.  A group scheme can be so designed that it can be incorporated in a regional scheme when that is promoted.The laying of the pipes and the servicing of the houses can be designed to that effect.  The only thing that is lost is the source of the water and the building of the reservoir.</P>
    <P>These group schemes can mean to the people who take part in them that they may have water in their homes five or ten years before the local authority could provide it for them. The local authority can spend only so much money in a year and it might be 10 or 12 years before they could complete any particular scheme so there is no reason why a group scheme should be stymied by the Department at this stage.  I think the Department should encourage them as much as they can.</P>
    <P>Sewerage is a different problem altogether and we have to depend to a great extent on private sewerage schemes for each house.  Here we have come up against a problem in which a cottier provided a sanitary service for his own house.  He was living on an elevated site and he installed a septic tank as laid down by the regulations of the local authority.  When he applied for the grant he was turned down because the tank was nearer than 60 feet to his dwelling.</P>
    <P>This problem is likely to arise in the case of a number of cottages in County Wicklow and I feel that if a man goes to the trouble of providing himself with a sanitary service he is making an improvement on existing conditions <Col N="739" /> and we should be prepared to meet him in regard to the grant.  Our county manager would not agree to give the grant in this case because the septic tank was within 60 feet of the house but we cannot expect a cottier, whose cottage is so placed that he may not have the 60 feet, to go out and try to get a site from his neighbour for a septic tank or to go out on the public road.  If a man can put the septic tank as far away as possible from his own house or any other house it should be sufficient and I hope the Minister will do something about it. Recently we passed a resolution at the county council asking that that decision should be reconsidered and I hope that resolution will receive sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>On the question of roads, like every other member of a local authority, I was disappointed when the Minister decided to transfer some of the money from the county to the main roads last year.  However, I realise that we have a problem in this question of main roads but the Minister has been lacking in not letting local authorities know exactly what the Department hopes to achieve in five or ten years with the main roads.  An amount of work has been carried out in my constituency on the Dublin-Wexford road, and, while I think a good job of work was done, I do not know what the plans for the future are.</P>
    <P>Some of the engineers tell me that the proposal is to have a dual carriageway for 30 miles outside Dublin.  I do not know whether we will or not but, as a member of the local authority in whose area this road runs, I should know what the ideas of the Department are with regard to the improvement of this main road.  We are charged with the responsibility of doing the work and although the money comes from the Department on the basis of 100 per cent grant we should know what the proposals are for our own areas.  I hope we will have some statement on road policy from the Minister in the near future.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems that will face local authorities in the future is the maintenance of the county roads. <Col N="740" /> We have some 900 miles of county roads in my county and about 80 per cent of them are now dust free.  We will be increasing that percentage in the next five or six years so that they will be all dust free.  That means that 900 miles of county roads will have to be maintained and the Wicklow ratepayers will have to pay about £100,000 annually for that maintenance.I understand that the cost of resurfacing a county road, taking in the cutting and trimming of hedges and everything else, is about £100 a mile which amounts to about £100,000 as far as we are concerned.  That is a colossal amount of money and I should like to bring it to the Minister's notice that it is a bit much to expect the ratepayers to raise it.</P>

However, this maintenance problem is one that will face local authorities in the future and it will be quite a problem for my local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is snow clearance.  There was a lot of ballyhoo in this House last year about the snow in Wicklow.  In fairness to the local authority officials, let me say they did a good job of work.  This situation arose overnight and we were not prepared for it in any way but we succeeded in getting a reasonable number of the roads open within the course of a few days.  The problem was that as fast as we were opening the roads, they were filling in again and it caused an acute problem for the officials <Col N="741" /> and workers in County Wicklow. I wonder if anything has been done since about it.</P>
    <P>In June and July this year when the sun was shining, the matter came up again by way of report to the county council and I suggested our engineer should be able to prepare some kind of scheme.  We knew exactly the areas in the county likely to be affected and I thought it would be a good idea if the engineer prepared some plan of campaign that would be available for his successor&mdash;because our experience is that engineers come and go and some of them would not be there for 12 months.  I did not get a great deal of encouragement and I wonder would the Department insist on some type of plan being prepared so that we could get on with the job even more quickly than we did last year?  I hope there will not be a recurrence of last year's snowstorm but it is quite possible that in the course of the next ten or 12 years we shall have another.  The trouble is that the people have reached the stage where they want the snow gone the next morning.  I remember snowfalls in County Wicklow on previous occasions when people were able to cope with the situation.  For instance, in 1933 and 1947, a great deal was done through co-operation.  Last year, however, there was such a campaign carried on by politicians and others that the people now want the snow gone the next day.</P>

      <P>There is an absence of speed limits in many built-up areas.  As a matter of fact, at a meeting of the Wicklow County Council, I said I wanted to see a speed limit in every built-up area in the county.  I found that a technical committee was set up and there was criticism of this technical committee here today by the members on the far side.  I do not know what the position was in Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of my county council, having been informed of the areas where it was intended to apply these speed limits, I noticed that some villages in my part of the county which I thought should have been included were not included and I succeeded in having them included before the thing was finalised.  Therefore, if there are areas in some Deputies' constituencies that are not covered by a speed limit, those Deputies are as much responsible as anybody else.  I believe there should be a speed limit in every built-up area in the county of Wicklow and indeed in every other such area in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to deal with a matter which came before a meeting of the Wicklow County Council, namely, a proposal to by-pass the village of Newtownmountkennedy.  I was hoping that this was merely an effort on the <Col N="743" /> part of the local officials and not Custom House policy.  In the county council, we felt that the by-passing of this village would not be desirable. What I am afraid of is that the approaches to this village will be so designed that in five or ten years time we shall have no option but to by-pass it.  I should like that to be clarified.  Personally, I think it was a local effort, and, if so, we in the county council have killed it.  However, if it is Custom House policy, I want to tell them that we in the Wicklow County Council will fight it tooth and nail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the speakers who contributed to this debate have referred to housing and I propose also to deal with the problem as I see it in Donegal.  You may remember, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that some months ago I tabled a motion that a sub-committee should be set up in County Donegal to deal with housing. I put down this motion having studied the report of the county medical officer of health in which he stated that 5,000 houses were needed to rehouse people in the county medical health district of Donegal.  Deputy Brennan mentioned that the Minister claims that there are 20,000 houses needed for rural Ireland.  If we take the figures of the Donegal county medical officer of health and the Minister's figures for the whole country, then Donegal requires one-quarter of the total number of houses which the Minister estimates are needed.  I could not emphasise enough the need for more houses in County Donegal.  We are not a rich county, by any means.  Geographically, it could be said that we are isolated from the rest of the 26 Counties.  It has often been remarked that the Dublin Government think that Donegal is in the Six Counties and the Stormont Government know that it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are neglected in different ways. The net result of the half-hearted approach of the Minister and his staff has been that during 1962 we built 73 houses.  Twenty-five of these were SI cottages and the other 48 were scheme houses.  I know that if the Minister <Col N="744" /> wishes to argue in support of his position he can say that the SDA cottages were built to supplement the 73 houses but there is an obligation on the local authority to rehouse the people and they have failed to do so. My proposal in the county council was to set up a sub-committee which could examine the efforts being made by urban councils and by the different local authorities in the Six Counties who are making far better efforts to rehouse their people than we are on this side of the Border and I say that deliberately.  Such a sub-committee could examine the efforts being made in Coleraine, Belfast, Portadown, Lurgan and the rural districts in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>However, because this proposal was made by a Fine Gael councillor, the members did not accept it.  Bearing in mind that Fianna Fáil councillors are in the majority, if they accepted it, they would have been admitting that the Minister for Local Government had failed in his first responsibility. For that reason, the motion was rejected and the alternative was to put me in a spot and to say: &ldquo;We will have a full council meeting to discuss this and try to make some headway.&rdquo; I agreed that as an alternative the full council should meet in committee, where each member could express his views and the Press would be present. I was prepared to accept that as a step towards getting something concrete done to rehouse the people who were in dire need of rehousing.  That meeting was held some two or three months ago and I have yet to get a report of the meeting.  The tendency seems to be to hedge.</P>
    <P>I find that when the county medical officer of health takes a census of a particular area to establish how many houses are required for rehousing and recommends, say 20, an inspector from the Department arrives, goes through the files, goes out to inspect the site, visits some of the homes of people recommended for rehousing, and then, after all this extra expenditure, the officials of the county council are told: &ldquo;Build ten of those houses. When you have the ten built and let, you can build the other ten.&rdquo;  If this <Col N="745" /> is not putting on the brake, I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>In Donegal, we have a type of cottage known as a specific instance cottage.  To my mind, this meets the demands and requirements of the rural dweller in County Donegal.  It is a scheme whereby an applicant, provided he has a family and is living in bad housing conditions and needs rehousing and comes within a certain group, will have a cottage built.  This scheme was introduced some time around 1953.  It is a good scheme and irrespective of politics, every councillor in the local authority agrees that it is ideal to meet the housing requirements of the people living outside the villages and towns in County Donegal. But it takes almost two and half years to build a cottage for a person who applies for one of them.  That is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>After he submits his application form, he is visited by the rent collector, the sanitary inspector and the rate collector and forms are filled in. This proceeds at a very slow pace and when the county manager is satisfied that the person is entitled to a house, by virtue of the fact that he has been recommended by the county medical officer, the county engineer and two or three of his assistants, and a site is offered by the applicant it is very common in Donegal that the person who owns the site has not got proper title and there is a delay in the Department of Local Government which neither I nor anyone else can understand.It can take up to 12 months to get that title put in order.</P>

      <P>The withdrawal of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara from auctioning and wholesaling does not effect the steady demand for fish on the home and export markets; indeed the Board are actively co-operating in the expansion of these markets.  The Board are continuing to purchase fish for processing in their factories at Killybegs and Galway.  They are also assisting fishermen in developing the co-operative marketing of their catches.  In addition the arrangements for payment of the full fish meal price to fishermen at the point of landing continue to apply.  In the circumstances I do not consider that the limited extent to which the Board are withdrawing leaves the fishermen unprotected in the matter of prices.  In any event the Board retain their right to resume any activity should circumstances render it desirable for them to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Before progress was reported, I was speaking in regard to council cottages in Donegal.  Where title to a cottage site is not in order, this should be dealt with by a compulsory purchase order.  If the owner of a site is willing to sell, I cannot see any reason for delay in having the title put in order.  However, we find that the county manager must make a compulsory purchase order, which must be submitted to the Department of Local Government.  Some officials <Col N="758" /> must ask a few pertinent questions. Finally, the owner of the site and the applicant anxious to get the house must make representations to a county councillor or a TD about the delay.</P>
      <P>I have contacted the Department about such cases.  In September, 1962, a compulsory purchase order was submitted to the Department.  The owners of each of the seven sites involved were prepared to give the land to the county council to provide a house for particular applicants.  There were few legal snags.  No member of the local authority could understand the delay in the Minister's Department.  Having made inquiries on three occasions, I was told that an inspector of the Department would have to go to Donegal and inspect each of the sites. One of the sites was in Falcarragh and another in south-west Donegal.  I would say the distance between them was 100 miles.  An inspector has to come to Donegal, inspect the sites and recommend to the officer responsible to the Minister that he sanction the compulsory purchase order.  If there was any legal difficulty I could appreciate the reason for a visit to Donegal by an official of the Department.But if the county manager and every other official in the county council are competent to do their jobs, then I think, in order to shortcircuit the delay, the Minister should give the county manager permission to instruct the officers in the Department to sanction the sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having established title and put it in order, the manager then recommends that a cottage be built for the particular applicant.  That is advertised and contractors submit tenders.  They are opened by the county manager in the presence of the local tender committee.The manager then recommends to the Department that a particular tender, normally the lowest, should be accepted.  But this tender must also be submitted to the Department of Local Government for sanctioning, and in some cases it lies in the Department for two or three months before it is eventually sanctioned.  Having got sanction, it happens on many occasions that the septic tank is discovered not to be in order.  Then we must start the <Col N="759" /> wheel turning all over again.  I could cite half a dozen cases where contractors had actually dug the foundations to erect a cottage 12 months ago and the contractor has not put a spade or shovel into one of those sites since then because of difficulties that arose out of delay caused in the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is a rational man and has the interests of his constituents at heart and I strongly recommend him to look at this situation.One Minister for Local Government said when he took office that he would buy scissors to cut the red tape. If that scissors is still in the Department, I respectfully suggest the Minister should use it.</P>
    <P>Vesting schemes for cottages, or purchase schemes, as Deputy Corry described them, were introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government and in the course of his contribution, he boasted about this magnificent scheme.  While much good can be said of it, much can also be said against it.  I am in full agreement with the county manager and his staff who recommend that occupants of council cottages should purchase their homes because a man's home is his castle and if a county council tenant purchases or enters into a vesting agreement with the county council to purchase his home, that home automatically becomes his own.  But there are a few snags.  Generally speaking, these snags do not arise until the original tenant has reared his family and passed to his reward.  Then the legalities start to pop up like popcorn.  I think nothing I could say in regard to the legalities of these things would add to this debate and I would prefer to leave them alone.</P>
    <P>What I intended to say about vested cottages, as I see them as a county councillor, is this.  There are possibly 50 vested cottages in County Donegal vacant at present and being used as summer residences by people who have emigrated to England and Scotland. These cottages were built possibly for those tenants or their fathers and now the heirs to these cottages are living in Britain.  Legally speaking, they are <Col N="760" /> entitled to hold possession of the cottages and there is nothing the county council can do to retrieve them unless the tenant violates some of the regulations which, even if he tried it, would be nearly impossible to do.</P>
    <P>If a local authority builds a cottage to house a person in it at a subsidised rate and if ultimately that cottage is vested and the heir of that cottage eventually claims it and lives in England, I cannot understand why the Minister for Local Government, if he has not got legislation to do it, should not introduce legislation to enable him to retrieve that cottage.  It was built by public money.  For want of a better term, it is, as it were, a present.  I cannot understand why it cannot be retrieved in view of the fact that the Minister for Lands is introducing a Bill whereby he can take over a farm of land from a person who has bought it or whose ancestors bought it with their own money.  The position could be at the moment that a widowed mother would elect to go to the Six Counties to live with a married son or daughter and she is not left in possession of her farm&mdash;the Land Commission take it from her.  We must remember that her husband or father or someone belonging to her bought that farm of land and she is more entitled to it, if we are to compare like with like, than the person living in England who is in possession of a vested cottage which is vacant for 11½ months of the year.</P>
    <P>The position is scandalous and I think the Minister should make inquiries.If he does, he will find there are roughly 50 houses of that type in County Donegal.  I said earlier that the Department have fallen flat on the housing programme in County Donegal and to try to save themselves, are putting up the argument that might be accepted by some people that sites are required in many cases for the erection of SDA houses.  I am in complete agreement with SDA housing but it is only people in certain categories who can afford to build these houses. If local authorities would set up sub-committees to encourage newly-married couples to build their own small houses, we would be alleviating <Col N="761" /> the problem that no doubt will be ours in another five or ten years.  If we could encourage newly-married couples to build with the help of grants and SDA loans, they can live in those houses for as little as 18/- a week or as much as they are prepared to build a house for.  I believe they could build a decent house for a repayment of 30/- a week under the SDA alone.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I mentioned at a Donegal County Council meeting that a recommendation should be made to the Department to give an incentive grant to a person in the lower income group who would wish to build his own cottage.  While the Minister and I disagree on many points, I trust he will give this serious consideration.  As I see it, a newly-married man in this group normally lives with his parents immediately after marriage and the couple end in a year's time living in a room with a child and possibly paying 30/- a week for it.  From that moment on, the problem is overcrowding.</P>
    <P>If that person were encouraged to build a three-roomed cottage of the type for which the Department of Local Government issued plans, and if he were in receipt of less than £10 a week, he could, in County Donegal, get £350 by way of grant&mdash;£175 from the Department and £175 from the Donegal County Council.  It is reckoned such a cottage could be built for something less than £1,000.  If the applicant were energetic enough, he could cut down on the cost by putting some of his own personal effort into the actual building.  In any case, he could borrow £550 to £650 and he could live in the completed cottage for 18/- per week.  He has a house of his own for 18/- a week.</P>
    <P>In most cases newly-married couples do not know of the existence of these aids.  They are not told about them. Whether it is that they are not told because the Department and the local authorities do not want to bother, or whether it is that they do not want possibly to discourage them, I do not know, but, in many cases, neither the Department nor the county council publicise the fact that a cottage big <Col N="762" /> enough for a newly-married couple, commodious enough to last them for the first ten years of their married lives, can be built for £1,000, of which £350 is available by way of grant and the remainder can be borrowed from the local authority at a repayment of 2/10 per week for every £100 borrowed over a period of 35 years.</P>
    <P>A husband, whose duty it is to provide a home for his wife and family, is normally scared when he thinks he is left with a figure of £1,000 but if he is told he can borrow and repay 2/10 per week for every £100 borrowed over a period of 35 years, then the idea becomes a concrete proposition.If people were encouraged in this direction the housing problem would, I believe, be relieved considerably in another five or ten years.  I trust the Minister will give keen consideration to this suggestion and, in the case of a person earning less than £8 per week, he should get an incentive grant to build a cottage and there could be a mortgage on the cottage preventing him from selling it at a later date to someone in a higher income group.</P>
    <P>Some few months ago the Minister introduced new town planning legislation here.  The provisions met with my approval, though I was disappointed in one aspect.  Town planning will involve local authorities in a tremendous amount of capital expenditure.  A great deal of effort will be put into it by local engineers.  Local councils will have to discuss the plan for their respective areas.  Having adopted it, at great expense, I think the Minister for Local Government, irrespective of what party he may represent, should accept the plan and leave it as it is. What do we find?  Whenever a county manager refuses town planning permission, the Minister should say that that is final.  If he does not say it is final, if he wishes to query it, having reversed the decision of the county manager, he should give the reasons for reversing the decision.  The present unsatisfactory position tends to create confusion and chaos and to militate against good planning.</P>
    <P>Linked with town planning, I should like to see better lighting.  The Minister <Col N="763" /> on his many journeys to his constituency in North East Donegal must have noticed the street lighting in Aughnacloy.  It is most attractive and most effective.  There is nothing so ugly as ESB poles lining one side of a street and Post Office telegraph poles lining the other.  If the Minister has not noticed the lighting in Augnacloy I suggest he should do so on his next journey to Donegal.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more co-operation between local authorities, the different sections of local authorities, and Departments of State.  Often when a new footpath has been laid the Department of Posts and Telegraphs comes along a week later to lay underground cables.  This is wanton waste of public moneys.  I suggest the Minister should appoint an officer in each county council to act as a link where public works are concerned between Departments of State and the different sections in the local authority.</P>
    <P>In the towns of Donegal, I should like to see better street surfacing.  As a public representative, I must condemn the delay in putting the streets in Ramelton into proper order.  It is a downright disgrace that a contractor should have spent two years, or more, putting in a town sewer in the streets of Ramelton.  The streets have yet to be resurfaced.  It is not the fault of, neither is it a reflection on, the county engineer.  The Minister should give marching orders to the contractor.  I believe he is now within a few weeks of completing the work.</P>
    <P>Roads constitute such a problem in Donegal that the position was summed up at a recent GP meeting of Donegal County Council in that the county engineer warned each councillor present that, if the present programme were to be continued, he would need an additional £7,000 per year over the next seven years.  He would need another £7,000 and it would go up each year until the seventh year had been reached.  That meant that in the first year we will get a demand for an immediate increase of 6d in the £, the next year it will be a shilling, the next year it will be ? and so on.  The Minister for Local Government was a <Col N="764" /> member of the Donegal County Council before his appointment as Minister and appreciates possibly more than I do the problem of rates in Donegal.  I cannot see any salvation for the Donegal ratepayers.  In many cases, the owners of guesthouses or small hotels are paying more in rates than the owners of larger guesthouses in the city of Dublin.</P>

I hope they will be a success in helping to protect the general public from drunken and reckless drivers.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister consider the provision of Garda motorcycle patrols on roads throughout the country.  In co-operation with the Minister for Justice, he could provide at least one extra Garda, equipped with a motorcycle, for each Garda station, to patrol the roads in their respective areas.  If any motorist, young or old, driving along country roads or on main roads approaching the city of Dublin, feared the presence of a motorcycle patrol, there would be fewer fatal accidents.</P>
      <P>From his knowledge of the Six Counties, the Minister must be aware that it is possible for a motorist to walk into the taxation office there any day of the year and have his car taxed for the coming 12 months.  For instance, if he goes into the taxation office on 4th April, he can tax his car until 3rd April following.  Now with the increased volume of traffic on our roads, I suggest the Minister adopt a similar system here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am giving credit to the Minister for many things, as a public representative I must condemn some of the things he is responsible for or partly responsible for.  We have had, in County Donegal, the job of appointing additional rate collectors.  The first of these vacancies was created in the Inishowen Peninsula.  Prior to the <Col N="765" /> appointment, we had two collectors, a lady who carried out her duties exceptionally well, and a middle-aged man who had to retire for health reasons.  Prior to his retirement, he had been in ill health but had carried on for four or five years.</P>
    <P>Then, for political purposes and no other reason, it was suggested behind closed doors that an additional appointment should be made.  Many reasons were given for this but the people are familiar with the facts.  I put a question to the Minister asking him why he sanctioned an additional appointment and he told me the area was too big for two men, though up to that time it was covered by a lady and a gentleman who was in failing health, to the satisfaction of the county manager and the county council.  Now the Minister says the area is too big for two young men.</P>
    <P>It is well known the first appointment was an upset for the Fianna Fáil Party.  The man who was to get the appointment discovered there was a stronger candidate in the field and this second candidate was appointed.  Then what happened?  A county councillor's son was told that if he held back he would get the next appointment.  Then a third man came along, the son of a Fianna Fáil urban councillor, and again the cat was in the nest.  The only solution that could be arrived at to keep everyone happy was to divide the area up so that each son of a strong Fianna Fáil supporter would get a job.</P>
    <P>During the voting in the Donegal County Council, there were married men, married men who had been TB patients, married men with national service, looking for these jobs but they were given to single men.  The next appointment we had was in the Glenties area.  The manager on this occasion recommended to the council that a rate collector with a number of years' service, with the princely salary of £240 a year, should be given the area.  This was suggested as a saving by the county manager but the Fianna Fáil members of Donegal County Council refused the county manager's recommendation and appointed the chairman of the Fianna Fáil Dáil Ceantair who was already in a job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> I might say that some of the people involved in this affair had relatives who are personal friends of mine.  I found it was offending these people when it was my duty to expose those things.  I make no apology for offending them but I give a warning to the Minister that if similar cases come before the county council, I will expose them as long as I am a member of that council.  I will also oppose the suggestion to abolish the general purposes committee.  This was proposed by local councillors for the reason that things discussed in committee could not be raised at a general meeting of the council.  It is a democratic right of every Deputy and councillor at a county council meeting to expose anything which he feels is contrary to the public interest.  While I remain a member of Donegal County Council, that will be my attitude.</P>
    <P>Might I say that I protest in the strongest possible manner against some of the actions of the Minister?  These actions are despicable, low and purely of a political nature.  Some of the things he has done recently bring his office into disrepute.  In the parish of Rosguil, in the reconstruction of the Rossapenna hotel, the contractor sent out letters to selected people asking them to apply for jobs and one man was actually brought back from England to fill a job.  It matters nothing to me if a contractor employs particular people.  He is entitled to select whomever he wishes to do his work but if he is getting a State grant, he is spending public money, not the money of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He is spending the money of the taxpayer and he should refrain from such petty political stunts as were indulged in this instance.  He invited people to apply for jobs from a list sent to him by the Minister for Local Government.  If this is an untruth, then the Minister can deny it.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time the Minister has stooped to such low tactics. Some time ago, there were 12 new jobs being created in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, labourers to the linesmen.  The Minister sent down two letters, one to the secretary of the local Fianna Fáil cumann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It is welcome news to hear that there are to be increased grants for small farmers.  I hope that with these increased grants from the Government, the local authorities will give increased grants in a similar ratio. These are grants for people who are waiting to build new houses and many of them have been waiting for a long time.  Meath County Council recently took a leaf out of the Minister's book. They were getting it so hard to obtain contractors that they provided loans at four per cent to enable people to build their own houses.  Those people can now get a house by borrowing £1,000 and, with the grant of £400, they have the house for repayments amounting to £1 0s. 6d. a week.</P>
      <P>I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister that quite a number of contractors take contracts to build houses and then, when called on to build them, say they are not interested any more.  When they take a contract, they should be bound in the insurance bond to complete it.  I have seen cases where cottages have been given in contract and they have not been built for two or three years afterwards.  The same thing happens in County Westmeath.I know of five houses which were given to a contractor in November, 1962 and he started to dig the foundations for the first house only last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is causing undue hardship to the people, especially as many have been living in houses which have been <Col N="768" /> condemned for a number of years. Naturally, they are not going to do repairs as they are expecting their new houses to be built and the house they are living in gets worse as the time goes on.  How often have we seen that where a person moves out of a house, particularly a thatched house, inside a week the house completely collapses. It is natural that once the fire goes out of it, it deteriorates quickly.  If the Minister could bring in a regulation or give encouragement to local authorities to demand an insurance bond with the acceptance of the contract, there would be some chance of getting the contractor to build a house in a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>We must compliment the Minister on the amount of new housing and housing reconstruction that has gone on over the past few years.  There were very few new houses being built a few years ago and more rarely still were they being repaired but since the introduction of new grants in the past couple of years there has been an increase in building and reconstruction.New housing is one of the most important signs of an upward trend in the community.  One often sees the standard of living of a family improving once they go into a new house.  If they live in an old house they can do nothing with it.  It is hard to decorate it but when they go into a new house they keep it spotless and the garden will be nicely kept.  Housing is a great uplift to the community.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the grants and loans which are being given could not be made available unless the economy were going well.  The Minister is making this money available according as the economy improves.  In my constituency certainly there has been a great increase in the number of new contractors who have sprung up in the past few years.  They are all extremely busy and they are doing very good work.  Furthermore, they are giving employment.</P>
    <P>One fact which does emerge from my interviews with constituents is the delay in the Department from the time the person who is looking for a subsidy fills up the application form and sends it to the local authority and then to the Department.  This whole operation <Col N="769" /> takes the best part of two or three months and if there is any snag, naturally it will take a bit longer. When a person is thinking of having work done he likes to make a bargain with the contractor.  The question is how much over or under the Department's estimate will he get the work done and he likes to have an opportunity of going around to see which contractor will do it at the lowest cost. When there is delay in a matter of this kind it takes a good deal of the satisfaction out of having the work done.</P>
    <P>I realise the Department have had to deal with an increased number of applications for grants in the past year or two.  It is phenomenal and, naturally, the more applications that come in, the more time it will take to deal with them.  With a little goodwill, I am sure the Minister could speed up this machinery.  It is only in the Department that there can be an appreciation of the number of people applying for these grants and building their houses. If you go into any local authority you will find there is not a day passes but it will sanction half a dozen or perhaps more water and sewerage grants.  The same will apply in the housing section in regard to housing grants.  This is proof that the Minister and his Department are achieving positive results which one likes to see when a Government or a Minister has put new plans and grants into operation.</P>
    <P>In regard to vesting cottages, on a number of occasions I have come across cases where a person would like to build a second house on his plot. This would be, perhaps, where one of the family is getting married.  It is sometimes hard to find an additional site even in the country where there is plenty of land especially if the person wants to be near home.  It is fairly hard to get an SDA loan where it is a vested house except the father or mother actually gets it in his or her name to build it for the son.  It is not satisfactory.  The father or mother does not like to be accountable for the son's house and possibly there is some way that problem can be overcome.  I am sure other Deputies have had cases of this kind because the problem is creeping in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> The SDA loans are extremely good. They are the simplest and cheapest loans that can be provided at present but there are a few counties, including Westmeath, where a person needs security for this loan.  When a person gives in the deeds that should be sufficient security.  There are other counties where they do not require the extra two securities and I feel that every county council should have this system.  It is embarrassing for a person who is looking for an SDA loan to have to ask two of his friends to sign a paper or give in their names.  It may be more embarrassing if the county councillor refuses to accept a name as security.  Something should be done to iron out that matter.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the delays regarding applications but there is also the delay between the time the house or reconstruction is completed and the time the man gets his money.  There are bills to be met.  In most cases shopkeepers are extremely good but a person does not like to be under an obligation to these people for five or six weeks before he can pay the money.  There is always the feeling that the money is not forthcoming.  I know that there is a form issued by the Department which the person can sign and cheques are paid but still it is not satisfactory.  The people would like to have this money fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>We have invested quite an amount of money in our roads.  While it is satisfactory to see so much money being devoted to the main arteries, there is an aspect of road improvement on which I should like to touch. Travelling from here to Naas one can see the construction of the dual carriageway.  To a layman at least it seems silly that the Dublin County Council and the Kildare County Council should be using two different methods to do the same job.  There must be a difference in cost and one method must be better than the other. The Kildare County Council are first putting down sand and gravel and then putting on tarmacadam; the Dublin County Council are putting down concrete first and then putting on the tarmacadam.Time will tell which is the better and cheaper method.  It is a <Col N="771" /> lovely road and should make for safer travelling.  Travelling on the old road was a nightmare and the sooner the dual carriageway is finished the better.</P>
    <P>Widening operations are being carried out along the western road through Meath and Westmeath.  One thing that strikes me about these wide roads is that when you have wire fences along the side the lights of a motor car seem to lose much of their effectiveness, in much the same way as they would if the car enters a large field.  I feel there is some danger here unless the sides of the roads are properly marked.  You have the centre line but there should be a demarcation line on the sides.  They have orange lines on the dual carriageway and something like that is needed on these wide roads.</P>
    <P>There have been two fatal accidents because of this lack.  Both accidents occurred shortly before last Christmas and involved a person on a bicycle on the gravel margin and two men walking on the gravel margin.  In both cases cars overran the gravel margin and struck the people.  In one of the cases the driver was dazzled but if you have your lights dimmed you can see the centre line and the line at the gravel margin.  If the Minister would convey this to the Meath County Council, it might save some lives and a great deal of expense.  In the Enfield district, the people feel a lot of anxiety and there is a lot of public feeling over those two accidents.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of a motor car lights on a wide road, I wonder if a bank would not be better than a wire fence.  A bank might be more costly but it would improve visibility. As Deputies are aware, on a narrow, winding road, your lights are very good but when you come to a wide expanse, they are not so good.  Possibly the Minister's engineers could bear this in mind for future reference.  Some of the money spent on roads could be diverted to the improvement of by-roads and laneways.  In County Meath, every road that has two or three houses is tarred up to the last house, but in Westmeath, there is a big number of laneways that need to be taken <Col N="772" /> over.  They are not public roads even yet.  The families living on them have been there for generations and you could describe them as being the backbone of the country.</P>
    <P>Those people still have to come through mud and water along laneways covered with potholes and if they have cars it does not improve them. In most cases, they go out on a bicycle and it is rather objectionable.  Very often, it means that they have to bring a second pair of shoes with them on Sunday morning when they are going to Mass so that they may change their shoes at the head of the road.  We should devote some of the money for main roads towards those laneways. Even if there is only one house along a lane, the position in most cases is that farms adjoin it and it is an outlet for other holdings.  At one time there may have been other houses in occupation there and, over the years, people moved out of them.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to people living in the country and who have a stake there.  We should do something by way of some form of grant or encouragement to take over those roads so that they will be repaired every now and then and, in the not too distant future, tarred just like the main roads.  The doing of one of those laneways would be comparatively cheap, so to speak, as compared with the money spent on main roads and you can take it that it would not need repairing for quite a long time.  Therefore, the initial cost is the capital cost.  I feel something could be done to encourage county councils to provide this service to the people who have been paying rates to them for generations.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department on the work they have been doing, which is certainly bearing good fruit.  The greater the number of applications they receive for grants of one kind or another, the greater the proof of the fruitful work they are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, housing has been the main subject of debate on the Minister's Estimate.  In the past few days, I have been very amused by speeches by some of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="773" /> Deputies and by the way they try to explain the housing position over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>The other night, Deputy N. Lemass stated that the slowing-down of house building was due to the collapse of housing in 1956.  He said that we are only now getting geared into starting a housing drive again&mdash;after seven years.  Just imagine that it would take a Department with an energetic Minister seven years to get geared again to start rebuilding houses!</P>
      <P>Another Deputy said that due to emigration, there was no necessity for building houses and that that was the cause of the closing down of housing. Today, Deputy Brennan made a further suggestion, that is, the alleged inactivity of the inter-Party Government in the 1950's.  I do not think any of these suggestions will bear examination.</P>
      <P>There was never so much house building as was done under the inter-Party Government.  When the present Government took up office in 1956, they decided, as part of their policy, to close down on housing.  I heard one of the able members of the Government state at a dinner in Kilkenny that the money spent by the inter-Party Government on housing was just slush money to create employment for the time being but was not really of any use economically; that it brought in no dividends and represented no permanent improvement to the economy of the country; that, for the time being, it was good enough to create employment and to give a fillip to employment over that period.</P>
      <P>House building is the most essential activity in any country.  As Deputy Crinion says, it helps families to go out of old houses into new houses, with a general improvement in the mode of living of such people.  They take pride in their new homes: they could not do anything with the old houses.  I think house building is the first essential and the inter-Party Government had the idea that the first thing we must do is to provide housing for the people.  We went a very long way to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in my own city of Kilkenny, housing has closed down over a <Col N="774" /> number of years.  Practically the last site bought for a housing scheme in Kilkenny was purchased in 1956. Tenancies were taken of 38 houses erected on the site purchased in 1956 exactly seven years later&mdash;in 1963. During all that time, we had plans with the Corporation.  There were further inquiries as to whether all the people to be rehoused in these houses were eligible for the two-thirds subsidy, and so on.</P>
    <P>I would not go as far as Deputy Brennan went today.  He said it was eight years before two houses in his area were even under way from the time the site was purchased.  They are under way now but it is eight years since the sites were first purchased.  He alleged that the Minister is deliberately holding up the building of houses.  A Deputy supporting the Minister stated today that the Minister is deliberately holding up the building of ten houses.</P>

      <P>I took it down.  I even asked the Deputy the name of the town.  I could not get it from him: I could not understand the name but I took down the actual statement he made, namely, that the Minister is deliberately holding up the building of ten houses.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have it looked up afterwards so as to see who is correct.  The number of local authority houses erected in 1962-63 was 1,828, according to the Minister.  He says this is an increase of 47 per cent.  It would be easy to have an increase of 47 per cent when the number of local authority houses built in 1961-62 was only 1,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can you imagine that, in the whole of Ireland, according to the Minister's figures, only 1,200 local authority houses were built in 1961-62.  That figure improved to 1,828 in 1962-63. According to some Fianna Fáil Deputies, the hard winter was the cause of houses in Dublin falling.  Due to the falling of these houses, and the resultant deaths of four people, the <Col N="775" /> housing position in Dublin has been taken in hands&mdash;taken in hands with panic measures.</P>
    <P>There was no attempt whatever to build to any extent local authority houses in the past six years.  Now we have taken panic measures.  There are proposals to extend existing contracts and additional schemes have been agreed to in order to save time in the preparation of contract documents. That is a big step forward for the Department of Local Government and the Government who practically closed down on housing over the past six or seven years.  It is a welcome step. However, if the house building had gone on in the normal way, there should be no necessity for these panic measures now.</P>
    <P>The Minister had discussions with the representatives of the Corporation on the possibility of further increasing housing output.  There were discussions between the officers of the Department and Corporation officials.  Is it not a pity that these discussions were not held over the past seven years?  It was a pity the housing drive did not go ahead even at a slightly slower pace rather than have it stop altogether.  The Government felt it was not yielding a return for the money, but it was yielding a social return.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's statement, the number of houses requiring replacement is 25,000.  At the rate of 1,200 houses a year, how long will it take to replace them?  We welcome the subsidy increase of 10 per cent, but we disagree with the Minister when he states that the increase in subsidy should encourage local authorities to speed up their housing programmes so as to eliminate the remaining pockets of unfit or overcrowded dwellings.  That is passing the responsibility over to the local authorities.  The Minister's statement seems to suggest that the local authorities have not been doing their duty.  They have been doing their duty, but they are frustrated by delays in the Minister's Department.  One would not mind the normal delays that might be expected, but when plans and lists of applicants are returned time after time, it means <Col N="776" /> there is a complete slowing down. Local authorities do not deserve that statement of the Minister.  They are only too anxious to speed up the provision of houses.  If the Minister would encourage his Department to co-operate with local authorities in building houses, he would be nearer the mark.</P>
    <P>I have been on several deputations to the Department seeking permission to build houses for people living in overcrowded conditions.  The Department refused the two-third subsidy on the last scheme we put up.  We were putting into those houses ordinary, working-class people recommended on grounds of hardship, medical grounds and overcrowding.  The Minister should give the Corporation the subsidy on those seven houses to encourage them take people out of overcrowded houses. I understand that when the case was put to him by a delegation from the municipal authorities, the Minister replied that if they in Kilkenny increased the rents on their houses he would give it more consideration.  In many instances rents in Kilkenny are very high in proportion to the incomes of the people in the houses.  Indeed, the tenants are to be congratulated on the wonderful manner in which they pay their rents.  We have had a 100 per cent rent collection in Kilkenny ever since the housing drive started. When many of these urban authority houses were built and people were transferred from houses costing 1/- or 2/- per week to houses costing 7/- or 8/- per week, it was said those people would never be able to pay the rents on the houses.  But, to their credit, they have paid their rents faithfully all the time.  Sometimes they have had to do without other things in order to pay the rent.  It does not come well from the Minister to say that he will consider the matter if we review the rents.</P>
    <P>An urban scheme of eight houses was built in County Kilkenny recently. There were 18 applicants for the houses.  I was interested in a few people who asked me to look up their applications.I went into one particular case.  The county medical officer in his report stated that this family were living in a damp house with the roof likely to cave in.  Surprisingly, however, <Col N="777" /> he did not recommend them for rehousing in any of the eight houses. I went to the county medical officer, referred to his report and asked him would that not justify him granting this family a tenancy in one of the new houses.  He told me he had done his job of allotting the houses as fairly and as honestly as he could.  The principle followed was to allot houses to families living in overcrowded conditions.He said he had families in Urlingford with ten to 12 people living in the one house and boys and girls of 13 and 14 practically in the same room.  He felt he was called upon to accept these people rather than families in unfit dwellings, and I had to accept that.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister should have another look at the regulations concerning overcrowding.  We had cases of eight people to one room in Kilkenny, but the Minister has refused time after time to sanction the two-third subsidy in respect of housing people because of overcrowding.  These people cannot afford to pay the rent that is payable if we get only the one-third subsidy. No ordinary working man can afford that.  He may pay 25/- or 30/- a week for a flat for a couple of months after his marriage but he cannot continue doing so.  I understand the Minister said he would review this matter.  I plead with him to give a fairer decision so that we may commence a building scheme to rehouse those now in overcrowded dwellings.  Most of them have been rehoused, because we have gone ahead with our housing schemes in the past.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to pay the full subsidy in good faith.</P>
    <P>Excellent work has been done by means of the reconstruction grants, which have meant much to places like Kilkenny.  But for the introduction of these grants many houses would be practically derelict sites.  I hope the grants will be continued and improved and that people will be facilitated as regards inspection.  Any time I have been in touch with the Department in regard to reconstruction grants I have had every civility and courtesy and the cases I inquired about were dealt with in a reasonable time.  I must give credit where credit is due.  The Corporation <Col N="778" /> have followed the lead of the Government and have given 100 per cent grants to anyone who obtained a reconstruction grant from the Department.This makes it easy for people reconstructing their houses to complete their work.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I should like to bring to the Minister's attention. It has already been brought to his attention by several of his own Deputies.It is the matter of the road grants for 1963-64.  We have got the same amount of grant for 1963-64 as we had in 1962-63.  There is no reduction. We have had a total of £170,000 in road grants.  As far as it goes, that is all right, but Kilkenny County Council have always been very energetic and went ahead with road improvement works.  After the last war, as county roads had not been touched during the war, they proposed that 2/- in the £ be allotted directly out of rates for these roads.  That had a big effect.  The road demand has gone up year after year but that 2/- remains for the improvement of county roads.  We have reached the point where we have at present 80.8 per cent of our county roads tarred and in good condition. But what congratulations do we get from the Government for such good work?  What is the result?  The county road improvement grant is cut from £170,000 to £48,000.  That is our reward.  If we had been slow and had not provided that 2/- in the £ for county road improvement and had less than 50 per cent in good condition, we should still have our £100,000 provided this year.</P>
    <P>I have a report here which says that the road improvement grant has been reduced by £52,500 for 1962-63 and that this will mean drastic reductions in improvement works on county roads.  Here is where the point comes in.  It says that it is necessary to surface-dress green roads and roads that have only received a first surface dressing.  Therefore, it is necessary to allocate £28,700 for surface dressing of roads from the County Road Improvement Grant and, therefore, there is only £19,400 available for the reconstruction of county roads during the present year.</P>
    <P>That is little or nothing when spread <Col N="779" /> out over the county.  We should have had £73,000 for the same work.  A certain amount of this money under the Road Improvement Grant has to be paid out against the previous year's work.  The sum of £28,000 has to be spent this year in that way, leaving us nearly £19,000 to divide over the various overseers.  They could hardly do one small job on a county road on that.  That is the return we get for being active and energetic and pressing forward with the work and using the most modern methods on our county roads, employing sand and gravel rather than broken stones.</P>
    <P>We even went further in regard to the by-roads that Deputy Crinion spoke about.  Over the past two years we provided £31,000 for the improvement of these roads and quite an amount of work was done on them. People on county roads now say: &ldquo;How is it that such and such a byroad is done and our county road is not done?&rdquo; We had a deputation in about one-and-a-half miles of county road left undone and they pressed their case so well and stated their road was so bad that we had to raise a loan of £1,500 or £1,800 to do that portion simply because the county improvement grant was cut.  If that is the encouragement local authorities are to get for going ahead, would it not be much better for them to go slow? Apparently, if they do not improve the roads they will get more grants and the slower they go the more they will get when everybody else have their roads done.  That is a bad system.  If you want arterial roads brought up to a higher standard, give more money but do not rob the people living on the county roads, the ratepayers, who also pay licence fees for cars and tractors and who expect a reasonable road up to their houses.</P>
    <P>A good share of the money taken from the county road improvement grant will be spent on about 7 miles of arterial road in the Johnstown-Urlingford road area, leaving all the other farmers to cope with potholes and water-logged roads which, unfortunately, they must use.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, the Department <Col N="780" /> and the Government to change the system of allocating money next year and restore the grants for county road improvements.  The more that is done the more the people want done.  If they see a neighbour's road done they want their own road to be as good. Kilkenny is a good tillage county and we must have reasonably good roads for the agricultural machinery.  The day of the laneway leading to three or four farmhouses has gone and I appeal to the Minister to restore the previous system of allocation.  The present policy seems to be one emanating from people who have lost touch with the people of the country.  They want to show how wonderful the main and arterial roads are and leave everybody else in dirt and mud.  If the former system were restored, would it not be great to be able to say: &ldquo;Now we have finished our county roads and we can devote extra money to main roads and arterial roads.&rdquo;  The main roads need some improvement but not so much the arterial roads.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to see water supplies coming but when you see a regional water scheme started you must expect that it will not be completed in ten years.  In the meantime, those who can afford to do so are putting in their own supply and that ultimately takes away from the revenue that should accrue to the regional water supply.  I ask the Minister and the Department to improve the rate of progress in getting these documents through.  I know a certain amount of time is necessary.  One has to get the source.  One cannot implement a scheme without having a source.  That is not something that can be done in a fortnight.  Nevertheless, something could be done, I think, to improve the present position.  One sees pipes being laid and the possibility is that the water will not go through them for two years.  Progress is slow.  The schemes look all right on paper, but when one comes to implement them, it is not such an easy job.  But too much time is taken, I think.</P>
    <P>We welcome the new traffic regulations, especially regarding lights on bicycles, and so on.  We all hope these will result in reducing the number of accidents on our roads.  I do not know <Col N="781" /> that improving the roads will help. Kilkenny Corporation sent up schemes for urban road improvement last June. We are now practically in the month of November and we have not yet got sanction from the Department of Local Government.  The principal schemes relate to tarmacadam roads. In order to do such roads properly, one must do them in the summer, or in good weather.  Had the scheme been sanctioned a few months ago, work could have started.  I ask the Minister to look into this matter and sanction this scheme as early as possible.</P>

      <P>Special emphasis has been placed on housing and on roads by practically every speaker in this debate so far.  Our main roads have come in for a good deal of praise.  On the occasion of President Kennedy's visit, he commented to a number of people that we had very fine roads.  Now we all know that President Kennedy drove from Collinstown Airport, through O'Connell Street and Dame Street to the American Legation in the Phoenix Park.  All that route is a first-class road.  Every other journey undertaken by President Kennedy was done by helicopter.</P>
      <P>Therein, I believe, lies the real trouble.  Our Ministers and visitors to this country see our main roads only. They see a speedway, suitable for four lanes of traffic, and they are under the impression that all the roads in the country are the same.  Naturally enough, those who accompany distinguished visitors do not do anything to destroy that impression; they paint the picture as if these are the roads we have built in recent years, and that we have them all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to housing the Minister has this year inspected housing conditions in, I think, Paris.  He has been all over the continent inspecting housing and discussing housing problems with various Ministers for Housing on the continent.  He was not fortunate enough to visit the United States this year but I am sure he is listed for a ministerial trip next year.  One would imagine that a Minister for Local Government would devote his energies <Col N="782" /> to inspecting housing conditions in his own capital city rather than in Paris, Amsterdam and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>No matter what some speakers may say, housing is a problem which must be tackled courageously.  It is a problem that has been tinkered with so far by the Government.  Fianna Fáil have been in office now for over 30 years and we find ourselves today with an acute housing shortage for our aged, our newly-weds, and large families. What have the Government done? They have thrown up their hands in despair and decided to put the people to live in caravans.</P>
    <P>The Minister will go down in history as the Caravan Minister for Local Government.  Presumably he has had a word in the ear of the Minister for Agriculture for the purpose of supplying these people with grants to buy horses so that they may become part and parcel of the itinerant class, travelling the roads in their caravans drawn by horses.  It is to that the Minister is driving our people.  It is a nice way of getting out of his difficulty: put the people on the road in caravans on wheels.  I do not know if the Minister got this idea as a result of the report of the Commission on Itinerants, but the idea seems to be now to create a number of caravan dwellings.  I do not know why.  It looks as if they want to drive those who need houses into caravan colonies.  To me it is demoralising.  To me it is degrading.  It is letting the country down.  It is letting our people down.  It is letting this capital city down.</P>
    <P>People cannot be given good housing conditions by being pushed into caravans.  The sooner our Caravan Minister for Local Government realises his real responsibilities, the better it will be.  Our people do not want caravans.  They do not want the kind of roof that covers itinerants.  It is entirely wrong, unchristian and indecent that caravans should be offered to our people.  The Minister is responsible for housing our people.  No matter how the Government may try to belittle the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, no matter what they may say about the inter-Party Government, the only Government in this <Col N="783" /> country that ever drove our people into caravans are the Fianna Fáil Government.  It is pitiful and shameful.It is a black mark on present housing policy.</P>
    <P>There were in 1960 numbers of rat-infested dwellings.  Not alone were there houses in which there was chronic overcrowding, but there were also bad houses, insanitary houses, houses in which there were neither water nor sewerage services.  The sooner we realise we are living in modern times, the sooner we will realise the urgency of the problem facing young married couples living in the most horrible conditions, unhealthy, unsound and insanitary.  We know all this from reading doctors' and county medical officers' reports, despite all the ballyhoo we hear from Fianna Fáil supporters.</P>
    <P>Had this question of housing been tackled properly and courageously it would have been solved by now.  All that is needed is a greater measure of co-operation between the local authorities and the Department.  The local authorities have done their fair share in the matter of the provision of houses but many of them now find themselves at a standstill because the rents are so high that tenants cannot afford to pay them.  These high rents are a great hindrance to the solution of our housing problems.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Department have not embarked on a scheme for the erection of what are generally known as workmen's houses.  Such houses could be erected in groups. There could be a group for the larger workingclass families, a group of small houses, comprising a kitchen, sittingroom and bedroom for old age pensioners, and a group for the lonely bachelors who wish to be independent and have a roof over their heads and who are prepared to pay for it.  No attempt has ever been made to provide houses for such groups of people who are unable to provide houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>It has been said that a man's house is his castle, but I am afraid we have many thousands of people in this <Col N="784" /> country, most of them with large families, living in unhealthy, rat-infested hovels.  I do not know whether the Minister, when touring the housing slums of the continent, saw conditions as bad as he can see any day in this country.  In my constituency last week, I was approached by a young expectant mother and her husband.  She told me the rats had eaten the food prepared for the children, that she was afraid to leave the children alone in the house.  This woman lives at Trumrea near Mountrath in County Laois.  She, her husband and children are living in the most shocking and desperate conditions.  The attention of the local authority has now been directed to it but it appears there is no alternative accommodation available for this young family, living in dread and horror.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not have to go to the continent to see rat-infested hovels.  I can speak with authority about housing conditions in the Midlands but I naturally have not the same knowledge of the position in Dublin.  What I want to draw the Minister's attention to, however, are the regulations of the Dublin Corporation imposing a residence qualification in regard to houses.  Apparently a person must have lived in the city for a certain period before he becomes qualified to get a house.</P>
    <P>This, to my mind, is an unjust regulation.  We know there is a flight from the land to our bigger cities and towns; we know that many thousands of our young people in recent years have come to Dublin to work.  Where their work is they must also live; yet they are debarred from getting houses here.  This is not a problem confined to Dublin.  It is a national problem. If these thousands of young people come to work here, live here and pay their taxes here, they are entitled to a roof of their own over their heads. Many of them have to continue to live in small flats after they are married. I am not at all satisfied the Department and the Minister have devoted all their energies to solving this problem or to the relief of the thousands of young people living in overcrowded flats in the city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> I am glad the question of the letting of houses by local authorities is being reviewed.  There was a regulation under which the full subsidy would not be paid on a house if the tenant had been a sub-tenant in a council house. Surely, if a member of a family gets married and if he has no house, the natural place for him to go to live is his parents' house.  This regulation about sub-tenants, therefore, can create untold hardship and has become a real barrier to the solution of our housing problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister, like all Ministers, is a man of many words, loud talk and little action.  That certainly applies in relation to housing.  I would like to know what is the position with relation to these caravan cottages that the Minister proposes to set up and what is the atmosphere that the children will be living in.  There is a moral obligation on the Government in this matter, a moral obligation they cannot get away from, to look after our people in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our housing difficulties arises in relation to rents. It is all very fine for a young married man to go into a house and pay 30/-a week in rent while he has no family but how is he going to continue to pay that when he has a family?  Assuming that he is a casual worker, and most of our workers are casual workers, if he allows his rent to run for two months due to a period of illness or unemployment, how is he going to clear it off? The relationship between a person's income and the rent he is charged does not stand the test of commonsense. No casual workers can be expected to pay the high rents that our present housing laws require.</P>
    <P>Is there any explanation for the regulation requiring a local authority to provide fully serviced houses in rural districts?  In a district called The Health, near Portlaoise, the Laois County Council erected a number of cottages and there was no part of the Midlands where they were more urgently required.  They were serviced for water but when the houses were completed they discovered that the water was not available.  That is a poor reflection on the engineering <Col N="786" /> ability of the Department or whoever was responsible.</P>
    <P>The rents of these houses are remarkably high and are based on the fact that the houses contain bathrooms which were not needed.  The people were told that the reason the rents are so high is that the houses have the facilities of bathroom and water despite the fact that water cannot be got to service toilets, bathrooms or anything else.  What investigation does the Minister propose to have into this matter to see why the tenants are being charged rents appropriate to serviced houses when they are not getting the services?  The fact that a person has an ornamental bathroom without water does not mean that he should have to pay for the service he has not got.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable to expect local authorities to provide houses of the very high standard required by the Department.  The tendency now is to build houses in groups in the rural areas.  Recently we have been furnished with statistics which tell us that there were never so few agricultural labourers on the land, never so few people living in remote rural districts. That is due to the fact that no effort has been made to scatter these houses throughout the rural districts.  In this day and age, we cannot expect agricultural workers to travel three or four miles a day to and from their work.</P>
    <P>We have many cases where farmers were prepared to give sites to local authorities to build houses for their agricultural workers and they are being told that the councils propose to build houses in groups and that these houses must be serviced with bathrooms, water and other modern facilities.  I do not know if the majority of agricultural workers or road workers are as anxious as all that about these additional facilities.  All they want is a clean house with a sound roof over their heads in which they can rear their families in Christian decency.  If we have a housing policy designed to strip and denude rural Ireland, how can we blame rural workers for drifting into the towns?</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why an effort was not made by the Forestry <Col N="787" /> Division in conjunction with the Department of Local Government to erect houses in remote districts for forestry workers who would be prepared to live near the various State forests.  I can well understand why such a large number of schools are closing down all over the country today.  I can understand the reports that are coming in to the Custom House of the low marriage rate.  The whole cause of that is the decision of the Government not to provide houses scattered around the rural areas where the farmworker can be near his work. I am all for building the houses on the land and that project should present no difficulty whatever.</P>
    <P>The present housing position does not reflect any great credit on the Minister.  However, in relation to the reconstruction and repair of old houses, I want to associate myself with the complimentary remarks of Deputy Crotty because the facilities which are made available by the Department for the reconstruction and repair of houses have done an immense amount of good in rural Ireland. I know, from my own experience, that there are the greatest possible attention, speedy reports, favourable and sympathetic consideration in this regard and, on the whole, may I say that the officers of the Minister's Department who are dealing with and deciding these individual cases have displayed a high degree of common-sense and intelligence?  I have no complaint whatever to make in relation to the manner in which the schemes for the reconstruction of houses are administered.</P>
    <P>In view of the increased building costs and the prospect of increased wages, I should like to see these grants being increased to a greater extent even than that to which the Minister has recently referred.  When one goes to repair or patch up an old house, it is very difficult to know the point which expenditure can reach.  When an attempt is made to roof an old building, it may be found that the gable end, the back wall or the front wall needs repair.  Very often repeated requests have to be made to the <Col N="788" /> Department for a new estimate for the work.  Substantially higher grants should be paid for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In regard to road grants, I am sure that since this debate commenced a few days ago, most Deputies must have appealed to the Minister to reintroduce the Local Authorities (Works) Act. That was a very useful Act, one that did excellent work and indeed one which has been very sadly missed in rural Ireland and more particularly by local authorities.  We are anxious to see the works which came within the scope of that Act and which now cannot be dealt with by the local authority except out of their own funds again being brought within the scope of that Act.  It would not require legislation to bring that about.  It could be done by ministerial order and I would appeal to the Minister to do that in the interest of the local authorities and in the interest of the many hundreds of schemes which would qualify to be carried out well and efficiently only under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>I opened my remarks in regard to roads and I had intended to develop the point to deal with county roads and byroads.  We are devoting too much attention to the main roads and it is high time that the <i>culs-de-sac</i> were properly tackled, <i>culs-de-sac</i> which are serving six, eight or ten houses.  There are also many lanes where children find it extremely difficult to travel daily to school, particularly in wintertime and aged people who have to go through these <i>culs-de-sac</i> and lanes in order to get to Mass at weekends have a genuine sense of grievance when they consider the facilities available on the roads for high-powered, expensive motor cars.  These roads are for the benefit of the millionaire class while these poor people cannot find a way in or out of their humble homes.</P>
    <P>I do not want to accuse all the county engineers of being members of golf clubs but I will challenge any Deputy here to tell me of a golf club in Ireland today that has not a tarmacadam surface leading to it.  I do not know of any.  It is very strange <Col N="789" /> that all the golf clubs can have rolled and tarmacadam surfaces while the lanes and byways out of which some of the finest and best men and women of this country came originally have to depend on these ill-kept paths and roadways.  I hope the Minister will take steps to relieve the plight of these people who are living in those shocking conditions and who have no hope except through the benefits of the rural improvements scheme and again, when it comes to that scheme, if the people are on in years, if their circumstances are not the best and they have no steady income, they are not in a position to contribute generously to a rural improvement scheme.</P>
    <P>One would think that in the <Col N="790" /> advanced period in which we are living and particularly in Ireland, being such a very small country, cases of this kind would be very few and far between.  I say no.  This is the case not only in my own constituency but all over the country where these boreens and lanes are not maintained. I cannot understand why county councils complete houses down such lanes and when the houses are built, wash their hands completely of responsibility for the roads leading to them.</P>
