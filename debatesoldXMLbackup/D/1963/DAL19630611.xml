    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of his statement on Thursday, 30th May, about the application of Ireland for membership of EEC, it is proposed to review the application in the near future, and, if so, when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy may have misinterpreted the statement to which he refers.  In that statement I indicated that it is our intention to reopen our application for membership of the European Economic Community at the earliest possible time.  I went on to say &ldquo;Whether it may be in two, three or four years there is virtual certainty that at some time before the end of this decade, membership of the European Economic Community will open for us, and we intend to acquire it.&rdquo; There has been no recent change in the position regarding our application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Taoiseach's reply it is not intended to renew our application before a decision is reached on the British application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of renewal.  Our application has not been withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach clarify that? Is it not proposed to prosecute our application unless and until the British application is reopened or accepted or rejected?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is well aware of our circumstances.  I am sure if he gives it some thought, he will appreciate there is no advantage in closing the door to any possibility by a unilateral declaration at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it been indicated to the EEC that we require our application to be deferred?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not communicated with the EEC regarding our application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say did the EEC inform us that they had deferred action?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that they have deferred action on all the applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has seen a report of 31st May, 1963 of an application for adjournment and transfer to the Central Criminal Court of a dangerous driving charge; whether he considers such application for transfer was appropriate; and if he will now in advance of the trial pay the costs of the accused, as was suggested by the Circuit Court judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a newspaper report of the proceedings referred to.  The application for the transfer of the trial to the Central Criminal Court was, in my view, appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that before the accused man left Sweden, his solicitor had spoken to him on the telephone and had informed him that, because of the absence of an essential prosecution witness, it was intended to apply to have the trial adjourned.  Written confirmation that an adjournment would be sought and that the prosecution would not require the attendance of the accused was sent to his solicitor. I understand that before this letter was sent by the State Solicitor its contents <Col N="641" /> were discussed with and approved by counsel for the accused.  If the accused had acted reasonably, he would not have incurred the expense of travelling from Sweden and the State is, therefore, not called upon to pay this unnecessary expense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that when all the facts relating to this matter were brought to the attention of the circuit court judge, he expressed the view that, if he reluctantly consented to an adjournment, he would expect the State to pay the costs and it was thereupon that the Attorney General exercised his prerogative to apply for a transfer to the Central Criminal Court, which it is obligatory on the circuit court judge to grant? Does the Taoiseach think that is a suitable use of the Attorney General's prerogative or is it an oppressive use of it in order to avoid paying costs which, in the judge's opinion, should be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what facts were within the knowledge of the circuit court judge.  The facts are as I stated in reply to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the power vested in the Attorney General to seek a transfer to the Central Criminal Court, and to have it of right, is designed for the better securing of justice to avoid circumstances where the due administration of justice might be complicated? Does he think it is a proper use of that arbitrary power to evade the State's liability for costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I should add anything to what I have said.  This case is still <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not <i>sub judice.</i> It has been transferred to the Central Criminal Court and whether the defendant is guilty or innocent, surely it is a wrong use of the Attorney General's power to make this application for the transfer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the whole story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very shocking abuse of a power vested in the Attorney General by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state for each of the years 1936 to 1962 inclusive (a) the grants made available in each case by his Department towards the erection and improvement of hospitals in County Cork and (b) the total cost of the works in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of institutions in Cork in respect of which grants were made available from the Hospitals Trust Fund during the period specified was 36.  The purposes for which grants were made available included the provision of a regional sanatorium, an orthopaedic hospital, a new maternity hospital, a new institution for mentally handicapped persons, a new admission unit at a mental hospital, reconstruction and adaptation works at existing hospitals, provision of new equipment, installation of central heating and sanitary annexes and lifts and fire escapes at certain hospitals, provision of accommodation for staff, carrying out of major schemes of repairs and so on.</P>
      <P>The compilation of a statement in the particular form requested would entail an undue expenditure of time and labour when so many different hospitals and so many different types of projects are involved, and taking into account that a period of 27 years is specified.  Information is available, however, regarding the total grant-payments made in each financial year to each of the institutions in the area administered by Cork Health Authority and the details are set out in a tabular statement which I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information is not readily available regarding the total cost of each capital project carried out in Cork over the period of 27 years covered in the question and it would involve detailed research of departmental records and files and reference to many of the hospital authorities concerned to determine the total cost in each instance. Details of the total cost of the major projects are included in the tabular <Col N="643" /> statement to be circulated in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>In June, 1962, the Laois County Council applied for a site for a public convenience at the front of the former military barrack property in Portlaoise. The site, however, was not considered suitable having regard to possible future development of the property.  As a result of discussion with representatives of the county council in October, 1962, an alternative site was suggested, and in March, 1963, the council indicated that this would be acceptable to them. Subject to the concurrence, which has been sought, of the Departments who occupy the barrack property a formal offer of the agreed site will be made to the county council at an early date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of erecting a winch and <Col N="653" /> widening the pier was considered in 1961.  The winch was provided at a cost of £55, but the widening was not then recommended by the Fisheries Division as they considered that the extent of the fishing activities in the area would not justify a further expenditure of the order required.

County Leitrim is a more difficult case because of the great volume of applications from that county, and delay has occurred owing to the shortage of engineers in recent years.

    <P>As much advance information as possible regarding the probable level of Irish turkey supplies is made available to British wholesalers each year both through the contacts which the exporters here maintain with their British agents and from a discussion on the turkey market which officers of my Department usually have, in the late Autumn, with representatives of the British National Federation of Wholesale Poultry Merchants.  It is, of course, difficult for an individual turkey exporter to give a reliable <Col N="659" /> advance estimate at an early stage of the quantity he himself will secure on the open market.</P>
    <P>The growing practice of forward sales by British turkey producers relates in particular to deliveries of early-season birds in oven-ready form by large commercial raisers but there is also a definite demand in Britain at Christmas for fresh New York dressed turkeys of the kind being exported from this country.</P>

    <P>Traffic on Saturday is much lower than on other weekdays and staff is adjusted accordingly.  I have given the figure for Friday, 31st May, 1963, lest that for 1st June might be misleading in relation to the question.</P>
    <P>The figure for 1959 is not now available.</P>
    <P>The delay in answering that is being met by callers is due to congestion of the equipment caused by very heavy traffic.  The provision of additional equipment is being pressed forward as much as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that a Dublin subscriber (telephone number 893187) was unable to get a reply from 10 or 31 on 31st May, 1963, notwithstanding the fact that he <Col N="680" /> waited for over 15 minutes on a number of occasions for such a reply; and if, as the experience of that subscriber appears to be a frequent and growing occurrence in the Dublin area, he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>I have no information about the particular incidents mentioned by the Deputy but on the dates in question and generally over the past fortnight telephone traffic was exceptionally heavy and there was serious congestion on most telephone routes.  Operators generally experienced difficulty in disposing of traffic and as a result were unable to attend promptly to all calling signals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fantastic situation that is developing in Dublin at present, in which it is quite common, when you dial 10, that the bell will ring from 30 to 40 times without anyone answering at all?  Can no steps be taken to get somebody to answer and say there is a delay or give some explanation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties which are now being experienced are due mainly to the fact that the existing system is not able to cater fully for the volume of traffic arising during the peak periods and I have taken all the steps open to me to take since I became Minister.  Major trunk schemes to the value of £2 million are already in progress and we must wait further before we find the result of the plans that have been made and are at present being executed to relieve the pressure on our telephone system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not the present exasperating situation be in some measure relieved by increasing the personnel attending to 10?  It is not so bad if you are answered and told that there is half an hour's delay or an hour's delay.  At least you know where you are, but what is absolutely maddening is to be left sitting there listening to 10 ringing 40 times and then to ring 31 and fail to get any answer at <Col N="681" /> all.  It appears to be a shortage of staff that is the cause of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no shortage of staff at all.  It is a question of the equipment being inadequate to deal with the traffic.  With regard to Dublin and peak periods, people will have to wait until relief is provided on the trunk network.  It will be a considerable time before it is completed.  It is not a question of an inadequacy of staff at all.</P>

Furthermore, the planned extension to the National Gallery of Ireland, the entire cost of which will be borne by the Exchequer, will contain space for temporary exhibitions.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>A contract was signed on 28 Bealtaine, 1963, for the supply of three helicopters and associated equipment.  The type of helicopter selected is the Alouette III.  The rescue potential of this helicopter when taking personnel from shipwrecks is four sitting persons or two stretcher cases at a time. Delivery of two helicopters is expected before the end of 1963 and the third machine will be delivered in Aibreán, 1964.  It is not the practice to divulge prices in the case of Government contracts. It may be stated, however, that the total cost of the helicopters, spare parts and basic training courses is estimated not to exceed £230,000.  In connection with the purchase of the Alouette III helicopters no reciprocal arrangements were made with France for the purchase by her of Irish goods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say why no reciprocal arrangements were made?  Is he not aware that our trade balance with France is heavily adverse? When a Government contract for almost a quarter of a million pounds was going a-begging, was that not the time to ensure that France would buy an adequate quantity of goods from us?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to enter a protest that the information I requested in my question to-day was not made available for this discussion.  I asked for the last accounts of one of the companies named in this Bill and its subsidiaries and the Minister chose to interpret that as meaning accounts to the 31st March, 1963.  I did not ask for those because I knew there was no hope of getting them.  I knew that I <Col N="701" /> had on many occasions to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ensure that that particular company would fulfil its statutory obligations and file its accounts and it did not do so at the proper time.  The circumstance that the Minister for Finance neglected to provide the accounts relating to one of the companies named does not make the discussion of this Bill any easier.  We may be able in some respects to clarify some matters but others may have to wait until the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I find the greatest difficulty in understanding what the Minister means in regard to this Bill.  If it suited him to jibe in his reply on the Second Stage, he is welcome.  It will not prevent me getting the information the House and the public are entitled to get, nor will the fact that the Minister misled the House in his opening or closing speech on the Second Stage assist the passage of the measure.  I do not know which was the true position, whether his prepared speech at the beginning was the correct one or his reply at the end, but in many aspects of the matter, he was not as frank with the House as he should have been.</P>
      <P>First, he said there was no need for an explanatory memorandum in regard to this Bill because the Minister for Industry and Commerce had forecast the entire contents of the Bill.  I challenge the Minister to produce any speech or statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in which he mentioned a word about a Bill to cover Aviation Development Limited. I challenge the Minister to produce anywhere a statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that this Bill that was to be introduced was to cover a company to be called Aviation Development Limited or that such a company would be for the purpose of developing one aspect of the Potez aircraft factory.  The fact is he did not. Obviously, before he made comments on that, the Minister did not take the trouble to read what his colleague said in this House on the occasion to which he referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In column 295, the Minister made it clear to the House he was proposing <Col N="702" /> to utilise up to £2½ million for the purpose of paying off the Industrial Credit Company Limited amounts expended in relation to the Industrial Engineering Company and its subsidiaries. It was clear to anyone that he meant they were to pay up to £2½ million.  We all know&mdash;and I showed it to some degree on the last occasion&mdash; there is not anything like £2½ million worth of assets there.  Then the Minister proceeded to change his feet when he was challenged and, in column 317, say they were not going to pay the £2½ million, that they were going to pay only what the shares and loans were worth at present.  I venture to say that the two statements by the Minister are recklessly inconsistent.  I do not know which is the correct one. I hope the second is correct.</P>
    <P>It is easy for people to comment on criticism of moneys expended in this way and say that the moneys provide employment.  But what we want is not merely the temporary employment, which passes if capital moneys are spent foolishly, but the permanent employment that wise productive capital expenditure will give.  The Minister cannot get that wise productive capital expenditure unless the projects involved can stand up to the light of day.  If they can, if they are viable projects, economically, commercially and nationally, nobody should object to their being examined in public here.  It is entirely wrong for public money of the size involved to be expended without proper evidence in support and without proper explanation to this House and to the country.</P>
    <P>I might add that the Minister misled the House in other respects in his initial remarks.  He said in column 292:</P>
    <P>I should add that these will be confined to the relatively small number eligible for grants from an Foras Tionscal in excess of £250,000.</P>
    <P>When he was challenged as to where that was in the Bill, he then proceeded to tell us something entirely different and to say that, while that might be the general position, there was nothing in the Bill, as I knew, and that in addition to that it was not even <Col N="703" /> intended to confine the provisions exclusively, as he had undertaken in his opening statement.  When we are dealing with sums of the size involved in this, it is, to say the least of it, unfortunate that the Minister should not be accurate.</P>
    <P>This Bill was to deal apparently with the taking up of shares in a company to which a grant or guarantee of borrowing has been or is to be given under the Tourist Traffic Acts.  I admit quite frankly that when I read the section I took that to mean resort development and so on.  I did not appreciate it would cover hotels as well, although I wish to make it quite clear that the Minister in his introductory speech did make it clear that hotels were included as well as tourist development associations and so on.  I must have failed to hear him at the time.</P>
    <P>Before we provide the money for this Bill, I should like to know whether it is proposed that this new company will take over from the Industrial Credit Company the stake the Industrial Credit Company have put in the new hotel being erected near Santry. If so, what are the terms of that arrangement?  Are the terms such that there is an adequate risk capital being placed by the <i>entrepeneurs</i> themselves and equally a chance of a satisfactory return for the State?  If public moneys are paid out to an individual concern and the individual concern does not put a proportionate part of its own money to the public moneys paid out, we are likely to get ventures of a sort that will not be permanent.</P>
    <P>We are entitled in this House, and should as Deputies satisfy ourselves, when Bills of this kind come before us, that the balance being kept between the private moneys being provided by the owners of the concern and the public moneys provided by this House is reasonably fair and proportionate, and that it is not a question of the matter being taken in a way that the entire risk is in one pocket and the entire profit, if things go well, in another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the <Col N="704" /> Deputy need have made this onslaught. Perhaps he will calm down after a few minutes.  The Deputy produced figures which I understood to be figures up to the 31st March, 1962.  I am sorry if I was wrong in that.  When I inquired in my own Department afterwards, having taken a note of that point, I was told there were no figures since then and, therefore, we could not give anything further than what was available in the Companies Office up to 31st March, 1962.  As far as my notes go, the Deputy referred to the Companies Office and I concluded, therefore, he had got the latest figures from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I got the latest figures that were there when I went there some months ago at the time the Minister for Industry and Commerce made his speech.  I have not been there since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they are there up to 31st March, 1962, now.  Perhaps, we can get a little more enlightment on that later on.  With regard to Dundalk, I said in my opening speech it was intended to take over the loan from the Industrial Credit Company and have it transferred to the new company. That is about all I said in my concluding speech.  I said it should be taken over on a realistic valuation. There is nothing contradictory in those two statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look at column 295 and see what he said?  He said:</P>
      <P>A sum of £1½ million will be required for the investment in Aviation Development Limited and up to £2½ million in respect of the transfer from the Industrial Credit Company of their shares and debentures in Industrial Engineering Company Limited.</P>
      <P>That could not mean anything except what it says.  We all know the shares and the loans are in fact worth less than £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest estimate I got was that £1½ million would be necessary.  I am not sticking to that <Col N="705" /> figure firmly but that is the impression I have been given.  The evaluation of the assets of the Dundalk companies has been going on for some time.  I may say nothing will be done until that evaluation is completed but when it is, Taiscí Stáit Teoranta will take over the assets there at a realistic valuation and I must come back to the Dáil to get money to pay the Industrial Credit Company whatever the difference may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there will be more than £3½ million and not as stated at column 295 from which I have quoted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  With regard to the £250,000, I said in my opening statement it was not intended to apply this Bill to any transaction where the subsidy would be less than £250,000. I referred to the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when introducing the Bill in respect of State grants when he explained that up to the limit of £250,000, it would be possible to give a company going into the undeveloped areas two-thirds of the cost of the building and the equipment but that the other one-third would have to be supplied by the person undertaking the building of the factory &mdash;the owner, if you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In parts of the country outside the undeveloped areas, the normal subsidy would be to a limit of one-half, but in certain cases that could go up to two-thirds.  It was considered there was ample provision there for dealing with any applications that might come along and that it would not be necessary for this company to intervene in any cases where the subsidy was less than £250,000.  Where the figure was over £250,000, there would be loans which would bring the figure of subsidy and loan to a maximum of two-thirds of the entire cost.  I explained that that loan would be given, half by the Industrial Credit Company on ordinary commercial terms and the other half by this new company on terms laid down.  It might be bad to have put into this Bill a provision through which we could not deal with any cases in which less than £250,000 <Col N="706" /> would be given in subsidy: it might be possible that where £250,000 would appear to be the appropriate subsidy, the applicant might be persuaded to take £200,000 by way of grant and £50,000 by way of equity capital and it would be impossible from a legal point of view to implement a decision of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that we would not like to see provided here that this would apply to any cases where the subsidy was less than £250,000.  It was intended that it would apply to any cases where the amount is less, except in extraordinary circumstances.  The Deputy asked me whether it was intended to take over the holding of the Industrial Credit Company in the Hilton hotels.  If this Bill had been there when that transaction took place, this new company would have dealt with it.  They would have taken the holding and I should say, though I have not discussed the matter with the Industrial Credit Company, if they express the desire that we should take over the holding I think we should consider it.</P>

    <P>I have studied this clause further and if Deputies will look at the first three lines of the section they will see the phrase &ldquo;with the appropriate Minister and with the agreement of the company concerned&rdquo;.  I have been advised since the Second Reading that these words were likely to give trouble because if Taiscí Stáit held shares in a company which they could dispose of at favourable terms they could do so as the clause stands without the consent of the company concerned.  As far as I understand it, the public company has no right to express any opinion at all.  That is one point.  A second point is that the company might say: &ldquo;We do not like it; leave things as they are.&rdquo;  In that case also Taiscí Stáit should have power to dispose of shares if they had thought well of it.  Apart from that, the section is fairly lucid, but I think it reads better as amended than in its original state. Actually, there is very little change in it&mdash;the amendment is practically a drafting one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the original wording, where it says &ldquo;company concerned&rdquo;, as meaning Taiscí Stáit. The Minister now says it was intended to mean, for example, Aviation <Col N="708" /> Development Limited.  It is clearly better that the section, in these circumstances, should be clarified as it has been in the Ministerial amendment.  I am, however, a little worried as to whether the functions of the company are as rigidly binding as in the original case.  I have made the case again and again in this House that if the Government of the day and the Dáil feel it is desirable and necessary to do a certain job in the national interest, and provide funds, they ought to do it but they should do it openly and above board, saying they are doing it for national reasons and not pretend that they were doing it as an economically viable proposition when everybody knew it was not.</P>
      <P>To that extent I was glad when the Minister for Industry and Commerce forecast last February that there would be a Bill of this sort.  What I want to be quite clear about is that when &amp; job of that nature is to be done it will be done by and on the responsibility of the Government.  It appears to me quite clear there was such Governmental responsibility in the original subsection (1) of this section.  I think there still is in subsection (2) but I want to be crystal clear that the Minister agrees the company can only exercise any of its functions if the Minister gives them a directive to do so and that accordingly, whether the Minister has or has not given them a directive, this will be a matter on which the Minister will be entitled to be questioned in this House.</P>

      <P>The Minister agrees I take it that if it is subject to a directive it is a matter in which the Minister will be amenable in the House.  However, I shall come back to the matter again when discussing the amendments.  It would be quite wrong to give a company which had been assisted the power of veto of the direction of the Minister and the Taiscí Stáit Teoranta to sell.  I understand from the Minister that that is the purpose of his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a certain matter on Committee Stage and the Minister <Col N="709" /> was kind enough to make reference to it in his reply.  This section, which is, in fact, the kernel of the Bill, provides that the company, Taiscí Stáit Teoranta, can do certain things in respect of industry and in respect of specific industries.  I appreciate what the Minister is trying to do in respect of the particular companies and in respect of other unnamed companies and businesses such as the hotel business and things like that and I applaud him for it.  As a matter of fact, on occasions throughout the past few years I have indicated on behalf of my Party that we believe some State agency should have an interest in industrial and other undertakings that have been assisted to a great extent by the State.  The Minister has greater appreciation of the difficulties in the matter of State assistance and protection of industries than possibly most members of the House would have.</P>
      <P>I am reluctant to talk in the strain in which I now propose to talk in respect of the type of industry that I mentioned before.  I do not know what the definition of &ldquo;State assistance&rdquo; is, whether it is confined entirely to assistance by way of grant or loan or whether it includes assistance by way of protection.  I should like to know whether or not industry that has been afforded protection comes under the heading of State assisted industry.</P>
      <P>I have no political axe to grind in asking that the Minister would consider the extension of this section in order to ensure by Government intervention, Government direction, Government investment, that industries which it would appear to most people have a chance of survival, would not be allowed to die for want of such State intervention.  There are industries that have not got substantial assistance by way of grant or loan and the plain fact is that they seem to be deteriorating and employment in them is becoming slacker and slacker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a new departure as far as the Minister is concerned.  It is a new departure in policy as far as the Government are concerned, a departure which I personally applaud and <Col N="710" /> which the members of my Party also applaud.</P>
    <P>I would seriously and sincerely ask the Minister, if it cannot be done under the section as it is, to ensure, by amendment, that the type of industry to which I refer and, might I say, the specific industry to which I refer, will not be allowed to die.  I do not want to mention names here.  The Minister knows exactly what I am talking about.  It is not my intention to put him into a difficulty or to embarrass him in any way.  I know his interest is as great as mine.  I want to impress upon him&mdash;it may be superfluous to do so&mdash;the seriousness of the position as far as certain industries are concerned.  If something is not done in the immediate future, it is my opinion, in which I am not alone, that there will be a good deal of unemployment which will affect the economy of the centres where these industries are situated.  If it can be dealt with under the Bill that is all right.  If &ldquo;State assistance&rdquo; means assistance by way of tariff or quota protection the industries to which I refer could be included within the terms of the Bill.  I doubt that &ldquo;State assistance&rdquo; does mean that in the context of this section but if it requires an amendment on Report Stage and if the Minister thinks it is possible to do something by way of amendment of the Bill, many people who will be affected will be very pleased indeed.</P>
    <P>I was one of those people who applauded the Government for the action they took in Dundalk when they were confronted with the situation of having 900 people unemployed.  I was not at all impressed by the protestations of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the effect that this was a private company.  It may have been a private company in theory; it may have been a private company according to the book, but it was a Government-sponsored company.  It was a company, or should I say a group of companies, established by the Government to alleviate or to prevent mass unemployment in Dundalk.  It is not the first time I have said this: Where the Government see that there may be unemployment in various centres, it is their bounden duty to try to ensure that that <Col N="711" /> will not happen, even if it means the establishment by the Government of an industry or a factory</P>
    <P>I realise the Government's difficulties, especially their political difficulties, with regard to the placing of industries but where there is an industry and where there is hope for that industry and it is generally acknowledged that it can be a thriving industry, it is the bounden duty of the Government to ensure its survival.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister, if it is not possible to do it under the Bill as it stands, to introduce an amendment whereby the Government could intervene for the worthwhile purpose of saving an industry and guaranteeing employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Corish looks at Section 3, he will see that, first of all, of course, it deals with State assisted industries.  A State assisted industry means an industry that has got a grant from An Foras Tionscal.  Then the section deals with three specific cases which are being taken over and which have already been dealt with&mdash; Aviation Development Limited, Industrial Engineering Company Limited and three hotels.  As far as the ordinary trading company is concerned, such a company always, of course, has the Industrial Credit Company to go to for a loan to carry on.  Apart from that, there is the readaptation grant which is available now to any company that wants to readapt its equipment or its make-up, in order to meet increasing competition.  As far as existing companies are concerned, therefore, the old-standing companies, they are amply supplied both by way of grant for re-equipment or anything like that and by way of loan in order to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I am quite well aware of the company that Deputy Corish has in mind and we are both, of course, very sympathetic, naturally, in seeing what can be done.  I think we would both agree also that the Industrial Credit Company would long ago have given loans if conditions were favourable in regard to management and so on.  We still hope that we may be able <Col N="712" /> to get over that difficulty, but it is not a matter for this Bill.  Apart from the three companies mentioned, the Bill will deal in future with entirely new companies which are getting grants from An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister understands my difficulty as well as I think I understand his, but let me put this to him.  Granted there is the Industrial Credit Company, and granted there may be some other agencies which are empowered and willing to come to the aid of industry. That is good, in general practice.  Many industries have availed of assistance from the Industrial Credit Company, and the like.  When we were discussing the Common Market, we discussed the ability and willingness of industries to readapt and re-equip themselves to change their methods, and provide for better marketing, salesmanship, and that sort of thing.  We must also be concerned about the neglect of industries by individuals.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that is interfering with private enterprise.  If I have a factory, and if I have allowed it to deteriorate, I may have no intention of availing&mdash;I may refuse to avail&mdash;of the assistance of the State.  I acknowledge, and I have always acknowledged, that so far as the establishment of industries is concerned the State has not been ungenerous.  The various pieces of legislation that have been introduced in recent years have not been ungenerous to those who want to improve their industries, or to those who want to establish industries.</P>
      <P>If we were to go into the Common Market in three, four, five or six years, I believe there would be people who would say : &ldquo;I am not going to bother about this business.  It is too much trouble.  I will not look for assistance from the Industrial Credit Company.  I will not ask the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance to help me.&rdquo;  That might be all right if the owner only were concerned, but 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 people are concerned, and I think someone has to do something.  I do not believe that is unwarranted interference in private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> I believe it is the duty of a Government or the State to take over such places.  The owner is important.  The idea of ownership and private property is sacrosanct, but the dependence of 300, 400, 500, 600 or 700 men for their livelihood on an industry is much more important.  If something cannot be done in this Bill I do not know what will happen.  I want to assure the Minister that it is no pleasure for me to introduce this matter into this debate.  It is not done for the purpose of embarrassing him or any of his Cabinet colleagues. I am concerned about a particular situation.  I believe something should be done about it, and I believe something must be done in a very short time.</P>

      <P>I am afraid we are committed to private enterprise.  We have to be very careful.  I can quite well understand the Deputy's impatience with the case he has in mind.  I know he is not by any means advocating expropriation but we have to be very careful because we are trying to induce people to come in here and start industries. I am afraid a bad story might be made about any interference of that kind.  I appeal to the Deputy to leave it to those concerned, including myself, to see if we can approach that problem in another way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 2, line 38, after &ldquo;Tionscal&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and which has at any time been named by the Minister by order which the Minister is hereby empowered to make.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I may disagree with some things Deputy Corish has just said on the first <Col N="714" /> amendment, there are certain other things with which I would entirely agree.  In my view it is quite essential that we succeed in getting it accepted by our own people that the facilities available for the development of industry are available for Irish people just as they are for foreigners, on exactly the same terms.  I want to make it quite clear that in saying that I am not suggesting that they are not.  We know what the position is, but we must get it accepted by our own people.  It is important that that should be done as well as ensuring that we do what we possibly can to induce further industries to come and settle here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned Dundalk. The Government had a job to do in Dundalk, but my objection at the time was that they did not go about it the right way.  My objection was that the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us it was a private enterprise transaction, which it never was.  My objection was that the Government forced&mdash;and I used the word &ldquo;forced&rdquo; deliberately &mdash; the Industrial Credit Company to cover up, under the guise that it was a commercially viable proposition, what never was a commercially viable proposition.</P>
    <P>It was a State rescue operation and should have been tackled by the Government under that heading, openly and avowedly.  There should not have been any shilly-shallying by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or by the Minister for Finance, in trying to maintain that it was an ordinary commercial loan which could be granted on a commercial basis.  It was a State rescue operation and should have been treated as such.  If it had been treated as such, and open as such to the wind of criticism, I think more permanent employment would have resulted from the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>I want to be quite clear that if there is any necessity to have a State rescue operation in the future, or if there is a State initiation operation, it should be treated openly and above board.  Therefore, the concerns should be named as the Aviation Development Limited and the Industrial Engineering Company Limited are named in the Bill.  We could then discuss <Col N="715" /> whether they are sound propositions, and whether portion of the pool of national capital should be put into those concerns.  Personally, I would not restrict at all the concerns that could be assisted to concerns which have got a grant from Foras Tionscal or under the Industrial Grants Act but I would insist that they be named in an order by the Minister which would be put on the Table of the House.  In that way, it would be all clear and above-board.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential, if we are to avoid the type of suspicion that is going around, that we have some type of open commitment by the Government that they feel as a matter of Government policy that doing something in relation to that company is desirable.  If the Government of the day are prepared to ensure that a company is assisted then they should be prepared to come out openly and say so by means of an order such as I suggest and, in addition to that, the company concerned should feel that it has nothing to hide and that the task is one that everybody would agree is a proper operation.  However, to try to suggest, as has been suggested up to this, that the Industrial Credit Company has in certain instances given loans on a purely commercial basis, when we all know it is entirely untrue that they were given on a commercial basis, is wrong and degrading for this House.  It creates suspicion and prevents Irish people in industry feeling they are getting a fair deal.</P>
    <P>Let me take an example.  I know of one case where, on the information I am able to get in the Companies Office, the people concerned have put in £87,000 and £4,600,000 of State money has been or is to be invested in that concern.  It seems to me quite improper, quite wrong, that that lack of balance would be made.  It means that the private enterprise people concerned have put less than 2½ per cent of the capital into the concern.  I know they are foreigners and I am saying nothing about that.  They have had a managing director down there who was as straight as a die, in my opinion, and who has done a first-class job.  They have a <Col N="716" /> managing director there, a foreigner, whom I have not had the pleasure of meeting but who I am sure is absolutely straightforward and knows his job. There is also a solicitor who is a director.  I am not making any criticism personally of him because I know he would not be a party to anything that is wrong.  My criticism is that a situation should be established in which £87,000 is put up by one person and £4,600,000 is put up by the State.  If the concern loses, the State lose their money.  If it wins and turns out all right, the person concerned takes all the benefit.  Admittedly, it is in the national interest if it succeeds because there will be valuable employment for the men concerned in that area but there is a lack of balance in the private enterprise investment and the State investment that should never have been allowed.</P>
    <P>However, as I say, I am not arguing whether it was right or wrong to make such an investment.  I am arguing that the Government that directed&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;directed&rdquo; deliberately &mdash;the Industrial Credit Company to make such an investment should have had the courage to say they were doing it as a matter of Government policy and done it in the proper way and not pretend and hide behind the skirts of the Industrial Credit Company, saying the money was being put up by the Industrial Credit Company because everybody knows the directors of that concern are commercial men of the utmost probity who would not make a loan in the ordinary case unless they were absolutely satisfied they were doing it on a commercial viability basis.</P>
    <P>I guarantee that the Minister could not produce a resolution or an expression of opinion, if you like, from that company denying they were directed by the Government to do that.  If the Government want that done, if it is necessary to have that done in the national interest, they should come here and say so openly, put the matters on the Table.  If it is done in that way the people's money will be invested in a more long-term, secure way both from the point of view of the return and permanent employment, <Col N="717" /> and we shall not have the suspicion that undoubtedly exists throughout the country that if you are an Irishman you will not get as good terms as if you are a foreigner.  I do not believe that is true but I want that suspicion killed.  One of the ways of killing it is to ensure that any company that is to get facilities under this Bill by direction of the Government will get them by being named in an order. Ninety-nine times out of a 100 the order will go through without anybody saying anything about it because we on this side of the House will make our own inquiries and will more than likely be satisfied.  There may be the odd one per cent of cases in which we may feel further investigation is needed here and that can be done by tabling a motion as I have provided here.</P>
    <P>If there were a provision that the company would be named by means of an order being tabled, I would not in any way restrict the operation of this section as the Minister himself has restricted it by the definition of a State-assisted industrial company.  It is infinitely more important for this House to know what is going on than to define the company concerned that is going to be assisted in the manner in which the Minister has defined it. I would far prefer to be able to name the concerns in the Bill.  I accept the Minister's statement that he cannot see for the future what exactly the concerns are likely to be.  Therefore, the method of naming it by administrative order is the appropriate one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot object very strongly to anything said by the Deputy but I should like to take this Bill, as it were, in two parts.  We have named certain companies like Dundalk, Potez, hotels and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>You have not named hotels either.  It has been left vague, any hotel company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is a clearly defined procedure laid down for the future that where a grant exceeds £250,000, that is one-third of the cost, there are various safeguards.  That is as far as we can go, or we can go <Col N="718" /> to £1,000 per worker.  However, over and above that, we have been trying to negotiate for some time with some of these big companies that instead of a grant, they would take equity capital. That has not been agreed to in many cases.  They do not like the idea of the Government coming into business with them.</P>
      <P>Then we came to the second alternative of making a loan.  That has been agreed to in some of the bigger cases, like Potez.  This Bill is implementing certain decisions arrived at that the loan in that case would be divided equally between the ordinary commercial loan of the Industrial Credit Company and the loan of Taiscí Stáit on the terms which have been mentioned, that is, it would be free of interest probably for seven years and then would be repayable at the ordinary commercial rate of interest plus half for every one per cent dividend paid by the company over seven and a half per cent, but the company has power at any time to pay off the loan.  That is the pattern that is in mind for future bigger propositions that come along.  I am told by the Department of Industry and Commerce that there are certain propositions being discussed but I do not know anything more about them at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, these are being discussed by the Industrial Authority who have to be in a position to discuss all the terms at the same time, that is, they get so much grant, so much by way of loan, and so much off by way of equity capital.  I think it would be impossible to publish any of the facts until a deal was concluded. As Deputies know, some of these deals do not come off; they just tail off and nothing more is heard about them. Where the deal is concluded, I do not think we could make the matter public until everything has been agreed. Therefore, I would have to argue strongly against the amendment proposed by Deputy Sweetman because we could not very well come to the Dáil and get permission to give this loan when negotiations are on, and when negotiations were completed, it might be a slow procedure.  If the Dáil happens <Col N="719" /> to be in recess, it would lie upon the Table and nobody could say for certain whether the answer of the Dáil would be yes or no until it had been discussed.</P>
    <P>I would certainly be as agreeable as I possibly could to give all the information that could be given afterwards.  In the first place, of course, this company will publish a full account of their proceedings at the end of each year and will mention the amounts given in each particular case.  They will be entitled to get balance sheets from these various companies.  They may be entitled to more but I am not sure.  I think I could guarantee that the balance sheets of these various companies in which they have a major holding, if not a minor holding, would also be made available to the Oireachtas.  That is as far as we could go.  Deputies will realise that in these negotiations we cannot make anything public until they are concluded.  Whether they are concluded by way of agreement or by way of disagreement, nothing can be done until the negotiations are finished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it is necessary during the course of these negotiations to make the position clear but we are all accustomed to negotiations of that sort being carried out and the Minister informing the parties concerned or the Authority: &ldquo;I am prepared to go to the Dáil with such and such a proposition&rdquo; and the interests concerned should always accept that when it could be done.  There would be no difficulty whatever in the Industrial Development Authority being able to say: &ldquo;We are negotiating with you and these are the terms we are going to put up, but the Minister must make an order but he will make the order because this is such that the Dáil will not object.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the Minister an example of another case which I consider should not have been dealt with so that he will appreciate that I am not just talking out of the air.  A certain company was formed in 1949 with an issued share capital of £45,215.  On 22nd July, 1949, the Industrial Credit Company made £140,000 available to <Col N="720" /> it.  On 18th November, 1954, the Industrial Credit Company made a further £26,000 available to it.  I am deliberately taking this company because apparently some of the payments were made in my name and because I want to make it clear that while I can be as political as I want on occasion I am not arguing this on a political basis. I am deliberately taking one company out of several companies about which I know something.  On 11th July, 1955, a further £20,000 was made available to it.  On 30th October 1958, £126,000 was made available and on 21st September, 1960, a sum of £93,941 was made available.  The position therefore in 1959 was that the issued capital of the concern by the private <i>entrepeneurs</i> was £45,196 while the Industrial Credit Company loans were £318,565.  The firm's assets were far from satisfactory and I am afraid I have the gravest reason to fear that a great deal of that money which was put up by the Industrial Credit Company was not secure and was lost.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be a typical case of what I might call an imbalance between the private <i>entrepeneurs</i> putting up £45,000 and the State putting up £318,000.  Part of that money that was put up by the State was put up by them, as far as I can judge from the Companies Office, by their taking over a loan that formerly had been made to the company by some of the joint stock banks.  I might add that in addition to that, I found, when I went to investigate in the Companies Office, that the particular company were two years late in their returns to the Companies Office.  The Minister should seriously consider issuing a directive, or getting his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to issue a directive, that in any case where State moneys have been made available, the utmost strictness should be observed to make certain that the companies fulfil their proper statutory obligation of making statutory returns.  As I say, in the case in question, there were two years' arrears of returns at the time I was endeavouring to probe and find out what had occurred.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he is going to make the information <Col N="721" /> available after the deal is made.  That, of course, to a large extent is closing the stable door after the horse has gone.  However, there is another point which should be attended to and frankly it was only while the Minister was speaking that it occurred to me or I would have put it down by way of amendment.  It is desirable that there should be in the definition both in relation to the Tourist Traffic Company, and in relation to State assisted industrial companies, that they must be public companies so that it will be possible for anybody to investigate, if they want to, the position of the company concerned at the Companies Office.</P>
    <P>One of the worst situations is where it is impossible for anyone to see what has transpired because the company is a private company and gives the certificate that there has been no issue to the public.  There should be a prohibition against assistance in any case except where it is a public company&mdash;a public company limited by shares or a public company limited by guarantee or a public unlimited company, but one never has that.  If the Minister would give me an undertaking that he will consider such an amendment between now and Report Stage it would go some distance to meet my difficulty.  It would strengthen the Minister's hand to have publicity in some shape or form.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the situation if notice had to be given that a deal was about to be signed under this Bill, when enacted&mdash;even if it were only a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> The fact that that had to be done would immeasurably strengthen the hands of the official bargainers&mdash;if I may call them that&mdash;in relation to the terms. The fact that they would be in a position to say: &ldquo;We have to give notice publicly that this will be done and therefore it would be impossible for the Minister to stand over the suggestions you are making&rdquo; would help rather than hinder the striking of a satisfactory bargain.</P>
    <P>I appreciate, at once, in relation to industrial development, that inevitably there is a fair amount of bargaining <Col N="722" /> on both sides.  I think it is all wrong that there should be a situation in which people can say: &ldquo;Heads I win; tails you lose,&rdquo; when they are negotiating with the representatives of the taxpayer.  Where it is only £87,000 ordinary share capital put up by a private <i>entrepreneur</i>, and £4,600,000 is being made available by the State, the imbalance is outrageous.  It is not the sort of case that should be dealt with except with the glare of publicity so that it can be decided coolly, calmly and deliberately whether it is right to do that for the sake of the employment content.  I can see circumstances in which it would be right but it is quite improper that that should be done under the guise and the pretence that any such arrangement can be a commercial proposition.  It is not&mdash; and nobody helps himself or the country or the industry by suggesting it is.</P>

      <P>The Deputy made some suggestions which I shall certainly consider.  I want to deal, first of all, with the point that State companies should be compelled to carry out their statutory obligations.  The Deputy thinks a State-assisted company or a Tourist Traffic Company which comes under this Bill should be a public company.  I do not know the implications of that.  I might find, on examination, that some companies we are dealing with are private companies, are quite reputable companies, and so on, and it might be difficult to make that stipulation.  I suggest that where Taiscí Stáit make a loan they could insist on getting a balance sheet and that could be made available to the House or to the Library.  Whether it is a public or a private company, that might be an alternative.  We shall have a look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of giving notice, I made the case already that in these negotiations&mdash;which are very prolonged and very bitterly contested on both sides&mdash;those negotiating the agreement are sometimes very glad when they get an agreement and they have succeeded, as it were, in bringing a firm here which would be expected to give good employment.  I <Col N="723" /> am sure they would protest very strongly against doing anything that might upset the whole agreement at the very end.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made a suggestion about publishing the matter before signing.  That might be possible.  I cannot see any objection to publication of the signing of such an agreement. Whether it was made the day before and signed the day after, I do not know, but I can see no objection that it might be published that such an agreement was made.  Therefore, I would undertake to consider the various suggestions made by the Deputy.  I think we might be able to be very definite, as it were, on what could be done on the next stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Minister that the position for the future will be that no pressure will be brought by the Government on the Industrial Credit Company to deal, themselves, directly with a proposition that they do not consider to be a commercial proposition?  If the Industrial Credit Company do not consider a proposition to be a commercial proposition, then the position is that the Minister will take responsibility if it is to be done.  May I take it that it will not be done by the Industrial Credit Company under pressure rather than under this?  I think that is essential.  Without such a categorical assurance, public confidence in the Industrial Credit Company would not be retained.  Everybody knows that the Industrial Credit Company had been pushed to the point of making facilities available not on a commercial basis.  It would go a long way to re-establish the reputation of the Industrial Credit Company as the company for which it was established if the Minister gave such a categorical assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> I regard the Industrial Credit Company's loan arrangements as only a very small part of the facilities which it should offer.  I want to see the Industrial Credit Company going back to what it was originally when it was initiated as an issuing house.  At present there is a very widespread desire for social securities, and a market in which there is great anxiety for good class Irish industrial securities. That is the occasion on which the Industrial Credit Company should push the people whom it has assisted by loans out into the market, if at all possible.  We want a wider market in Irish industrial securities and the assistance given by Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932 and by the death duty provision in the 1956 Finance Act to Irish industrial securities should be availed of in the present climate for buyers for the purpose of getting that wider market.  I do not think the Industrial Credit Company can play its full part as an issuing house unless it has the reputation also of dealing only with commercial transactions.</P>
    <P>It is because of that I want the position clarified beyond question now.  I am not discussing all their functions as managers under Section 4, in regard to Ministerial direction.  That is a perfectly different situation.  The commercial aspect does not necessarily arise in that but in regard to their ordinary operations the time has come when they should be treated and allowed to treat themselves entirely as a commercial concern.  By so doing, they will be able to do far more as an issuing house and inspire far greater confidence in the public and in that way give the public a wider portfolio of Irish industrial securities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is great difficulty in regard to the Industrial Credit Company becoming an issuing house.  They are quite willing to do it but there has been no issue by them so far as I know at all in recent years.  I have not seen an issue of that kind.  But I am sure they would be willing to do the job if it arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards giving this assurance, I think the Dundalk Company is the only one that really matters.  The <Col N="725" /> Deputy mentioned another company. He did not mention the name and I shall not mention it either.  The Industrial Credit Company were not asked to go into that company.  The £87,000 was capital but substantial loans were made by the foreigners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not another good reason why it should be a public company because nothing appears in the companies register?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister it is.  I have it here.  At 2nd August, 1962, let me add, the loans by the other concern were not mentioned as far as I can make out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the last debate in which it was stated they were seeking some grants, I made inquiries and I find that is true.  What they will get is another matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the company was helped substantially by way of loans.  We shall leave it at that at the moment.  The only company that would fit in at all with the Deputy's argument is the Dundalk Company.  I think it true that the Industrial Credit Company would not have gone in there as a commercial proposition.  They were quite willing to go in if it were Government policy to help the concern.  They had an understanding, although I do not think it was in writing, that they should go in temporarily and that they would be taken out of the mess as soon as possible.  That was what the arrangement amounted to and we are now doing that in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the future, as far as I can see, all new companies setting up here in a big way will have access to this Taiscí Stáit under the conditions laid down but I could not say, should another case like this arise, what will be done.  I certainly hope that the Industrial Credit Company would be left to carry on its commercial business and not asked to do anything else. <Col N="726" /> However, if such a case should arise, they have the staff and so on to deal with it and, as a temporary expedient, it is a convenient body to ask to step in for the time being.  I hope such a case will not arise and I hope they will not be asked to intervene in anything like that again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is misinterpreting the situation when he uses, as one of his arguments, the fact that they have the staff.  It is precisely because they have the staff that they are being asked to be managers under Section 4 of this Bill.  That is a very good thing.  But I can assure the Minister if he asks the Industrial Credit Company to read the statement he has just made and if he asks them if he is in a position to repeat it on the Report Stage, he will be told categorically that he is not, that it is not true that Dundalk is the only case in which they were asked by the Government to deal with matters on a noncommercial basis.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting the Minister is deliberately telling lies to the House but if he does make the inquiry, the directors of the Industrial Credit Company, whom I know to be honourable men, will not underwrite the Minister's statement when they know it.  If the Minister makes the inquiry between now and the Report Stage, he will find my information is right and that the information he has given, quite <i>bona fide</i>, to the House, is not correct.  I think the existing practice should end, now that we have got a proper vehicle in the shape of this Bill.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1962&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 14, line 7, after &ldquo;longer period&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not exceeding two years&rdquo;.&mdash; (Deputy Jones.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this amendment on the last day, I sought to impress on the House the necessity for putting some limit on the time allowed for the making of a development plan.  In the general intent of this Bill, there is a question of three years and such time as the Minister may allow.  On the last occasion, the Minister saw the point I was making, that I was attempting to avoid a situation that could arise and that did arise in the past and that, to facilitate the making of development plans and to ensure there would be a reasonable length of time, we would confine the further period to two years.  The Minister on that occasion said that if the amendment had been submitted for that purpose it had merit in it.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister would not wish it to go out from the House that there would be any encouragement of postponements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can readily see from the discussion here to date that the problem that will face the country as a whole will be of some magnitude.  The fact that the Minister has power to bring it into operation at different times in different areas might lessen the dangers of such delays occurring, inasmuch as the trained personnel would be available in different parts at different times, and it was with the desire of enabling this to come about that the amendment was put down.  We could have a situation arising such as that which arose under the old legislation and resulted in a court case <Col N="731" /> recently.  I think the Minister appreciates the intention of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at one with the Deputy in trying to ensure that the introduction of these plans, the bringing into operation of this legislation generally, will not be delayed longer than is absolutely necessary.  While doing that, none of us can really foresee everything that may occur, all the difficulties that can conceivably arise, which might make the two year limit as proposed in the amendment unworkable in some isolated but perhaps very important case.</P>
      <P>I advise the Deputy to have a look at amendment No. 55, an official amendment, which sets out the procedure which must be followed by any planning authority proposing to ask for an extension of any length of time over three years.  It lies in the hands of the local authority, the planning authority, and then they must follow through with publication of their intention to seek a further period than three years. They must set out what further period they require and make it known to the public so that anybody interested may object to the granting of the additional time.  I therefore think the official amendment does add some further weight, some further safeguard to what I have gone on record as saying regarding the purpose of this amendment&mdash;that these extensions of time will not be lightly given, nor indeed will we welcome them except in cases where they are absolutely justified.  We may be tying ourselves up in knots which we cannot foresee at the moment but which could give us quite a lot of difficulty in the future.  While the amendment may appear desirable in many ways, it could have adverse effects, and amendment No. 55 gives the safeguards which he is anxious to see included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion, I referred to the fact that the personnel of local authorities change every five years with elections.  That could bring about reversals and there is also the question of the review within each fifth year.  I wonder if the Minister has considered that difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine such difficulties could arise but I cannot see how any change in personnel brought about by local elections every five years could reflect any radical changes in the outlook of any draft plan.  I could not conceive that you would have any such changes in a council, but even if you had a substantial change in personnel, I cannot see that would bring about any great change of mind on the part of the council as a whole on the pattern or outlook of the plan for that area.  I cannot foresee that being a real cause for worry.</P>

It is very difficult to distinguish the sense in which the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; here is being used. If we wish to avoid ambiguity in this subsection, is there any reason why we should not use the words &ldquo;plan, which consists of a sketch or map&rdquo;? The use of that phrase would indicate clearly what is meant.  In the ordinary way, a written statement can very often be ambiguous, whereas a sketch can indicate what is intended in a development plan.  In the case of any map in respect of any area, the amount of written material going with it is really of no benefit unless a person also has reference to the sketch or map.  A written statement does not convey the same information as a sketch would convey.  The use of the words &ldquo;map or sketch&rdquo; would <Col N="733" /> avoid ambiguity.  If the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; in the second instance is regarded as a written statement there should be provision for a map or sketch indicating the development objectives within the plan.  It is for that purpose that we have put down the amendment.</P>
    <P>The ordinary individual reading subsection (2) and finding the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; defined as &ldquo;a written statement and a plan indicating the development objectives&rdquo; will be at a disadvantage.  The amendment, if accepted by the Minister, would avoid ambiguity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>At first sight it would appear that the use of the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; in two places in the same subsection would confuse but there is no ambiguity about what it is intended to mean.  As to the use of the words &ldquo;map or sketch&rdquo;, a map would depict what exists at present.  In other words, it would be a factual record in a drawing to scale of what exists.  Therefore, it is felt the use of the word &ldquo;map&rdquo; here would not be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Sketch&rdquo;, then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A sketch could be a free-hand drawing which would not necessarily be accurate.  Although it might give a very real picture of what was in mind, there would be no guarantee that any particular part of the sketch was accurate or factual. A plan, undoubtedly, would be an illustrated plan, not just a written document stating what the planning authority had in mind.  This illustrated plan and the written statement would be complementary to each other and would be for the guidance of all concerned so as to make more readily understood the overall intention.  The illustrated plan, as distinct from a map or sketch, would be projecting into the future what was intended.  That word has been used in this context in the past.  It may well be that some new word may be coined that would even more suitably fit the bill but I am not aware of such a word.  For the reason I have given, I do not think either of the words proposed by Deputy Jones would improve the subsection. I would be afraid that they <Col N="734" /> would disimprove it and would create ambiguity as to what subsection (2) really means.  I have not yet been shown that either of the words suggested by Deputy Jones is more appropriate than the word I am proposing to use.  If I could be shown that either of them was more appropriate I would be quite happy to accept it but that has not been demonstrated and I do not think it could be demonstrated that either of these words would be better than the word I am proposing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary designation of a plan is a type of drawing which can be to scale or not to scale.  In this section it is proposed that there will be a plan which shall consist of a written statement and a plan.  Generally, in the case of a house, there would be reference to plan and specification, the specification being a written document indicating what would be carried out in relation to the plan.  I take it that in the ordinary way the planning authority, with the aid of its consultants, will obtain an ordnance survey map or a series of maps of the areas and on those maps would indicate what they thought should be done in regard to development in the areas under their control.  The plan could then be consulted at any time by interested persons.  There will be a written statement indicating the various lines of development.  They may indicate that, for instance, the shaded portions are to be residential areas, industrial areas, green belt areas and so on.  I presume there would be shown in colour new roads, parks and parking places.  There would be a written document to elaborate what was shown in the plan or sketch.  The plan would indicate underground services. Such subterranean developments are generally shown by dotted lines.  That is my idea of a sketch.  In the section the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; occurs in two places. According to the Minister, the words indicate two different things.  We suggest that in order to avoid ambiguity, the second word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; should be deleted and the words &ldquo;map or sketch&rdquo; substituted.  Whichever word <Col N="735" /> is used will certainly have reference to the written statement.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) (a) says:</P>
      <P>with respect to county boroughs, boroughs, urban districts and scheduled towns&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  for the use solely or primarily (as may be indicated in the plan) of particular areas...</P>
      <P>Can you indicate in a written statement what you are going to do in regard, say, to a town? You can, by reference to well-known landmarks but otherwise how can any individual know what is intended?  Whereas if a sketch or map is there, it is recognised procedure by which a place may be indicated or pinpointed.  It is for that reason that we put down this amendment.  We think it would make the intent more clear and it would convey, if you like, what the Minister has agreed will be done by this type of document about which he speaks, with different colours indicating the stage of development and of proposed development in any area.  It was to avoid any ambiguity about the use of the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; twice, that we put down the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty seems to be that both of us want the same thing but it is a question of how we are to get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I am as anxious as Deputy Jones to get into the Bill what the intent is.  We are both clear as to what the intention should be, and I had hoped it was clear so far as the Bill was concerned.  Deputy Jones still feels it is not clear.  I go with him to this extent.  The use of the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; twice in the subsection could, in a different context, seem to cause some confusion, although, as I said earlier, I still feel it does not cause any ambiguity.  Deputy Jones outlined the likely procedure for the planning authority to adopt: to get a map and superimpose on that map their wishes for the future.  That is exactly the intention of a written statement <Col N="736" /> and a plan.  The map would very likely have superimposed on it the intention for the future and it would explain more fully, or possibly illustrate in a clear way, what may be written at some considerable length.</P>
      <P>We both know what we want.  It is very likely that the planning authority will present a plan together with the written statement.  At a later stage, in Section 23, I think, the Minister for Local Government will have power to issue model plans.  We would intend to issue therein something such as Deputy Jones has outlined, a map coloured for this, that and the other thing, and the finer and further points would be explained in writing.  The fact that we mention a written statement and a plan would immediately be accepted as ruling out any possibility that the proposals would be in writing only.  A written statement might be confusing and might not be too easily understood.</P>
      <P>That is the manner in which we approach this.  We have to rely on the draftsman's office to put into legal phraseology our ideas and what we presented to him perhaps in woolly form.  I am satisfied that what is in the Bill can be accepted without quibble or question as what Deputy Jones thinks should be there.</P>

      <P>In subsection (4), page 14, line 35, after &ldquo;fall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in part&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> Subsection (4) reads:</P>
    <P>Where a planning authority propose to include in a plan under this section any development objective the responsibility for the effecting of which would fall on another local authority, the planning authority shall not include that objective in the plan save after consultation with the other local authority.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to ensure that an area of a local authority for which another local authority is the planning authority comes under the jurisdiction of the planning authority for the purposes of the Act.  As we have said on numerous occasions, the making of the development plan is something which is being reserved to the elected representatives. I did mention on previous occasions that a situation could arise where this authority might be taken from them.  I asked the Minister on previous occasions&mdash;but I did not press him&mdash;under what circumstances might the making of a development plan not be the function of the elected representatives?</P>
    <P>As we know, there might be two contiguous planning authorities.  A dispute might arise between them and in that case it falls to the Minister to decide the issue between them.  What I would like to have clarified in regard to the taking away of the authority from the elected representatives is in what circumstances would the making of a plan no longer be a function reserved to the elected representatives. What we seek in the amendment is to ensure that where another local authority is the planning authority the area concerned will be brought within the jurisdiction of the planning authority for the purposes of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slight misunderstanding on the part of Deputy Jones as to what subsection (4) is intended to cover.  He has mentioned the possible difficulties in adjoining or contiguous areas and this amendment is proposed with that in view. Although it may not be very clear, this subsection does not deal with that sort of problem.  It really deals with the problem where, for instance, a county authority would be responsible <Col N="739" /> for the main road through an urban authority.  The purpose of the subsection in those circumstances is to preclude the planning authority, that is, the urban authority, in such an instance from including in a development plan any development objective which would interfere with the road, say, realignment or something such as that, which road was the responsibility of the county.  They could and would only do that and plan for that after consultation with the county authority whose responsibility this road was. This has nothing to do with contiguous or adjoining areas or problems arising therefrom.  It is this other kind of problem and the most likely problem is that of a county road in an urban area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 55:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (6) to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) (a)  The making of an application to the Minister for the allowance of such a longer period as is referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall be a reserved function.</P>
      <P>(b)  Where a planning authority have applied to the Minister for the allowance of such a longer period as is referred to in subsection (1) of this section, they shall cause notice of the application to be published in at least one newspaper circulating in their area and in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
      <P>(c)  A notice under the foregoing paragraph&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  shall specify the longer period applied for, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  shall state that objections with respect to the application made to the Minister within a specified period of not less than one month will be taken into consideration before the grant of the application (and such <Col N="740" /> objections shall be taken into consideration accordingly).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the new subsection to which I adverted when I was speaking on amendment No. 50 and it is the paraphernalia, so to speak, which we are imposing on planning authorities who may wish during the currency of the three-year period stipulated in the Bill and within which they will be required to prepare their plan.  It is intended to ensure that only genuine and good reasons will be brought forward to support a case for an extension of the three-year period for any additional period, whether it be a month or twelve months.  Before the elected representatives come forward with this application to the Minister, they will naturally discuss it at some of the meetings and the reasons for which they must get additional time for their plans will have to be aired publicly.  They will then be required to publish this intention to apply to the Minister for extended time, stating the additional time they are seeking. This will be an assurance that additional time will not be needlessly sought and will be requested only where a good case can be made for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>This helps to clarify the situation to which we referred earlier. In regard to the requirement to publish the notices in at least one newspaper circulating in an area and in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, the Minister, I am sure, appreciates that in the rural areas, in particular, the people pay far more attention to the weekly papers that circulate in their area than to daily papers, and certainly the week-end is a time when the countryman gives attention to these documents or notices from the local authority which generally appear in the week-end editions of papers circulating in their areas, notices in regard to the erection of houses or contracts for various types of work to be carried out by the local authority.  I would like to be assured that it is not the intention to confine the advertisement to one newspaper circulating in the area.  In regard to daily papers, in most areas there will be perhaps three or four morning newspapers circulating.  Furthermore, <Col N="741" /><i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is a document which people in the legal profession may be expected to buy but I would venture to suggest that the general public do not buy such a paper.  Therefore, I should like the Minister's comments on the wording of this amendment, which occurs at other places in the Bill.  I suggest the phraseology should be altered from &ldquo;in at least one newspaper&rdquo;. The public, in rural areas, are entitled to notification in the newspapers circulating in their area.  If we are to bring to the notice of the rural public the intent in regard to these matters, it is necessary that such intent be published in the weekly Press as well as in the daily Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to what is the object of the Minister's amendment.  In most country districts or most county council areas, more than one local newspaper is published and as a result any of the newspapers may miss out on a specific portion of an area which is covered by the local authority.  Even if it did, is it suggested that because of the fact that it must be published in the newspapers the officials would have to put up a better case than the elected representatives, who must be satisfied that it is necessary to make representations to the Minister for an extension of the time, or otherwise the representation would not be made?  I am not too happy about the amendment.  If the public representatives in the local authority are doing their job, they are the people who must be satisfied.  Any crank can write in and say that he is not satisfied that there should be an extension and is the Minister to take it that the opinions of cranks are to bear more weight than those of the local authorities when they meet in council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already been admonished that we must have regard to the cranks and in a slight way we are doing that in this case but this is not really to cater for the cranks.  To deal with Deputy Jones first, the amendment is in keeping with other parts of the Bill.  The notice must be published in at least one newspaper. In this particular instance, I have no doubt that the elected representatives <Col N="742" /> dealing with the actual approval of the request to go to the Minister will themselves consider how best this might be circulated.  I am quite sure that there will not just be the selection of one daily newspaper to the exclusion of all local papers.  I do not think there is any danger of that happening.  It is also true that we ought not fetter the local planning authority by providing that they should publish it in all newspapers circulated there.  We are laying down a minimum to ensure that it will be published in at least one newspaper circulating in the area.  If the elected members of the local authority feel that one newspaper is not sufficient coverage, I am sure they will bring that to the notice of the other members and the decision will be to publish it in all newspapers or a selected few.</P>
      <P>I think it is quite safely left in their hands in this case to ensure that what is intended, that is, that the public should learn what the intention is, will be carried out.  This, no doubt, will be subsequent to reports in the local newspapers of the council's proceedings when they discuss this matter before agreement is reached.</P>
      <P>In so far as Deputy Tully is concerned and his doubts about the necessity or desirability of this section, the whole purpose in publishing the intention to apply for an addition to the time within which the plan must be prepared is in order that objections should be made.  That is the whole intention. Those objections will be made, and, having been made, will be considered in conjunction with the application to the Minister for consent.  It is to give everybody a fair chance of having his say and if good reasons are put forward which might counteract the case made by the council, both sides will be before the Minister before he decides to give three months, six months, or 12 months, or any additional time at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

      <P>I move amendment No. 58:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (c) and (d), page 15, lines 26 and 30, to delete &ldquo;the preparation of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the subsections stand, they read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  where the draft includes any provision relating to any structure proposed to be preserved because of its artistic, historic or architectural interest, they shall serve notice of the <Col N="745" /> preparation of the draft on the owner and on the occupier of the structure, (d)  where the draft includes any provision relating to the preservation of a public right of way, they shall serve notice of the preparation of the draft on the owner and on the occupier of the land.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the owner of the property will have served upon him a draft of the development plan which will interfere with his property.  There is very little use in serving upon a property-owner notice of preparation of a draft. He would be interested in the actual draft of the development plan and the manner in which the plan would preserve, for instance, an alleged public right of way over his land.  Furthermore, since the landowner will be entitled under subsection (2) to appeal to the Circuit Court he will require to have a copy of the draft development plan.  The right to inspect the draft development plan would be useless when it would come to considering his rights with his legal advisers.</P>
    <P>In these two subparagraphs of subsection (1) of Section 21 the Bill seeks to interfere with rights to property and, because of that, we on this side of the House are anxious to have the fullest cover given to the owner of property. The interests of the individual ought to be of paramount importance.  It would not impose any undue obligation on the local authority to serve on the owner of the property a draft of the development plan and not just a notice saying that a draft had been prepared.</P>
    <P>On an earlier section we dealt with the question of a written statement accompanied by something in the nature of a map or a sketch.  In so far as the two subparagraphs here are concerned, we should seek, from the point of view of clarity, to provide that where the draft includes any provision relating to any structure proposed to be preserved because of its artistic, historic or architectural interest, they shall serve notice of the draft on the owner and on the occupier of the structure and, furthermore, where the draft includes any provision relating to the preservation <Col N="746" /> of a public right of way they shall serve notice of the draft on the owner and on the occupier of the land.  The individual whose property is being affected is entitled to protection from this House in respect of this type of legislation which may interfere with the rights of the individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>At first sight, the amendments would appear to be acceptable but, having listened to Deputy Jones, I realise that, though we might accept the amendments, they would not attain the ends for which they were drafted.  The deletion of the words &ldquo;the preparation of&rdquo; would not confer on these few owners &mdash;they will be few, of course&mdash;the right to have served on them a draft of the plan.</P>
      <P>It would probably be wasteful, and what not, to have a draft of the plan served on these people in circumstances such as we are discussing in these subparagraphs when only a very small part of the draft would be of any interest or concern to them.  I have no real objection to acceptance of the amendments but the intention of the Deputy would not be attained by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The section would then read that the people will be served with notice of the draft; they will not be served with the draft but with notice of it.  We propose to serve them with notice of the preparation of the draft.  In so far as the words &ldquo;the preparation of&rdquo; are concerned, I am quite prepared to forgo them because it does not seem to make any difference whatsoever.  The amended form, which Deputy Jones desires, would seem more sensible and would cut out some of these superfluous words but it will not attain what the Deputy has said he believes it will attain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that we know what he is after, I suggest he withdraw these amendments and, on Report Stage, I shall introduce a further amendment or, if desired, a new amendment to the effect that an extract of some description or specific information relating to a particular <Col N="747" /> property or building, or whatever it may be, would, on completion of the draft plan by the planning authority, be notified to the person or persons affected under this section.  It would not be a good idea to say that the draft of the whole area should be sent to each person.  It would be better to inform people who would be affected that a draft plan had been drawn up and to give them a rough outline of it in writing or otherwise. They could then specify any objections they might have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand the Minister's reasoning.  Earlier, he said he wanted the public to get all the information possible.  Now he objects to the giving of the draft plan to the people who would be affected by it.  Surely it would be simpler to get a copy of the complete draft plan than to have a section of it specially made for those people who would be affected?  The Minister may be worrying about the cost to local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is slightly out of context.  We have a section and we have a proposed amendment which, on its explanation by its proposers&mdash; not Deputy Tully&mdash;would not achieve the purpose they wished it to achieve. I am trying to meet them and at the same time keep in line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But Deputy Tully has a vote on this just as have those who introduced it and, therefore, he is entitled to have his say.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, perhaps, the Minister would listen for a moment. If the draft plan is going to be submitted, surely it would be more reasonable to give the complete draft which would be easier to copy?  If the Minister is sincere in saying, as he did on a previous amendment, that he wants the public to be aware of what is being done so that they may lodge objections if necessary, surely they should be allowed to have all the information, particularly those directly concerned?</P>

      <P>Yes, but they will not have the property on which the historic building is placed.  There will be relatively few cases.  The general public are being catered for <i>en bloc</i> in the publications and notices of plans that will appear and the display of the plans.  This section is intended to apply where people are specifically concerned in operations aimed at preserving historic buildings or dealing with rights of way where personal property is involved and only in such cases is this procedure envisaged.  I am trying to give the proposers of the amendment what they want even though by accepting the amendment they would not get it.  I propose to do that on the next Stage.  I have no objection to the provision but to issue the whole plan for a county planning area to each person who might have a right of way or historic building or an ancient monument on his property could be wasteful.  I think the situation will be fully met provided we indicate to such persons what is going to be done and that it is in their interests to see about it.  We would probably have the planning authority writing a letter telling the affected owners how they are affected.  If they wish, they can follow up that and I am sure the local authority will be helpful in providing more details if required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's point of view.  In proposing the amendment we wanted to ensure that owners would be aware of development that would interfere with <Col N="749" /> their property.  We are not thinking in terms of development for the whole area but only so far as it would affect the right of any individual in any particular case whether in regard to a building or right of way.  We thought by taking out the words &ldquo;the preparation of&rdquo;, such people would have notice of the draft itself and not just notice of the fact that a draft had been prepared.  We did not intend that an individual would get a copy of the draft plan for a local authority area or even for a large section of it such as a rural district but that he would get as much as concerned his own property. However, the Minister is bringing in an amendment, I understand, on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 59:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (a), page 15, line 35, to delete &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;six&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to extend the period of three months to six months within which objection may be taken to proposals which will affect a person's property under the development plan.  Previously, I said that three months could be a short time in which to make an objection if one felt one's rights were involved and I instanced the sort of circumstances that might arise, a death in the family or the death of a legal adviser.  We want to ensure that a person would not be precluded from making an objection where a question of property rights being interfered with would arise.  I think an extension to six months would not affect the matter seriously from the development point of view and might avoid cases of hardship which could conceivably arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We should keep in mind in regard to this subsection that <Col N="750" /> the three months is a minimum term. At least three months' notice must be given.  The planning authority may make that six months or more as the section stands.  We do not specify how far they may go beyond it but we insist they give at least three months' notice.  We should also keep in mind that whether it is three months or 12 months that period will be within the three years which is already set out in the Bill as the normal time within which the planning authority will be required to have their plan prepared.</P>
      <P>I think from what Deputy Jones said that it was not so much the danger of the three months being too little within which people could make objections that worried him but rather that he was afraid that even having known within the three months that there was something against which they wanted to appeal, for some reason or other they might be prevented from taking the proper steps within the period.  The appeal must be made within the period laid down, during which the planning authority will have the plan on view for all to see.  It appears to me that it is the time for making an appeal arising from what may be seen during the display of the plan that really worries Deputy Jones.  With that point of view I have some sympathy, even if it were only to extend the period by a month beyond the three months which is allowed for making an appeal as distinct from the period during which a person may find out if he has anything to appeal about.  Whatever that minimum would be, it might be well if in the later section connected with this some additional time beyond the three months were allowed for the lodging of appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that one could conceivably come to examine this plan in the last hour of the last day of the third month. According to a later section, the appeal of an aggrieved party would then be too late because, according to that section, it must be made in the same period.  If I am right as to what Deputy Jones has in mind.  I should be inclined to ask the House to leave the minimum three months, and we might extend the time beyond that three months by a fortnight or a month within which appeals of aggrieved parties may be <Col N="751" /> made to the courts.  If that meets with the wishes of the House, I would ask that this proposal for a six months' extension be withdrawn and undertake on the later section to extend the period beyond the three months to allow for appeals to the court being made by aggrieved parties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 60:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (b), page 15, line 41, after &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and the plan or variations altered&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection 2 (b) states:</P>
      <P>that objections or representations with respect to the draft made to the planning authority within the said period will be taken into consideration before the making of the plan or variations (and any such objections or representations shall be taken into consideration accordingly),</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that representations and objections will not only be considered but will be given due weight, leading, perhaps, to an alteration in the plan. It is only fair to assume that if a person makes an objection of this type he should feel that it will get due weight.  If his representations are well founded, the plan should be varied or altered accordingly.</P>
      <P>As the subsection reads at present, it says that objections and representations will be taken into consideration. I want to ensure that if a person successfully makes representations, the plan would fall to be altered or changed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite honestly, I cannot see how we can more clearly and without causing confusion and ambiguity give to interested parties the right to make representations.  As to how effective these representations will be will surely depend, first, on the case itself and on their ability to make that <Col N="752" /> case.  When they have made that case to the best of their ability, it will, under this section, be taken into consideration.  That implies looking into the case and examining it.  But, having done so, they may by the weight of the argument advanced alter or completely change the plan to meet the wishes of the person who made the representations.</P>
      <P>To accept the amendment would appear to copperfasten the situation, but, in fact, it will do no such thing. I am informed it would turn the whole Bill haywire.  If we were to accept this amendment, every representation or objection made would have to be accepted.  We would undoubtedly have contradictory claims being made and we would finish up with nothing whatever. I know that is not the intention of the proposer of the amendment.  I have had this looked at very thoroughly and it is quite clear that, if we accept the amendment, that is what would happen.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that representations and objections are covered in the subsection as it stands.  I do not think they can be covered to any greater extent.  Consideration does not mean merely looking at objections and throwing them into the wastepaper basket.  It is to see if they have any merits.  If they have, it would be a foolish person who would not have regard to them.  That is the whole intent of the subsection.  We could not accept the amendment because it would put the cat among the pigeons and bring about the situation that every representation and objection would have to be written in.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that the section, as it stands, covers the point and that the amendment would do exactly what the Minister says&mdash;make it obligatory on the planning authority to carry out whatever was suggested.  I do not think that is the intention of Deputy Jones.</P>

      <P>I would refer to the previous discussion we had in regard to an alleged right-of-way which a person might successfully prosecute by way of representation to the local <Col N="753" /> authority, in the first instance, or by way of appeal to the Minister.  If this is successfully done, a draft is prepared showing the proposed right-of-way or, perhaps, a public building to be retained in the interests of the public at large.  The fact that a person could successfully prosecute such an objection would cause the plan to be amended.  We wish to have this amendment accepted to ensure that the plan would be altered to show that.  If a person can successfully prosecute such an objection to the local authority, or by way of appeal to the Minister, the draft plan should be altered to show the effect of that type of representation.  That was what we wanted to ensure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I want to do in relation to this Department is nail the statement of the Minister for Finance, oft repeated here over the past year or so whenever he is told the farmers are worse off, that the valuation of land has appreciated 50 per cent. Nobody who is in touch with the farmers or with land in any context will fail to realise the truth is that this is a scarcity value.  Even though we have lost 18,000 people off the land of Ireland in the past year&mdash;a terrible situation&mdash;at the same time, when a farm is offered for sale, two or three people with funds are prepared to bid for that farm a figure completely unrelated to the profits they may get off it, related in fact to the consideration that it is attractive in situation or in some other such manner to those people.  They will therefore pay far more than the market value, if market value is related to the profits a person might hope to gain from such a parcel of land.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance knows this and he is doing no service to the farmers or the country in general by propagating this brand of untruth. Somebody may ask where this money comes from, that money must be made on land if people are so anxious to buy it at those prices.  Over the past 50 years, land has been our biggest industry and whether or not over the past three or four decades it has been helped by Fianna Fáil maladministration does not matter.  There still must be in this relatively vast industry some funds left to pay a scarcity value which has no relation to profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one takes the Estimate for the Department of Lands and looks at it from a bookkeeping point of view, one will find that over the years this <Col N="755" /> Department has been allowed to drift towards an extraordinary situation as far as expenditure and the cost of administering that expenditure are concerned.  I would refer the House to the details in the Book of Estimates for this year and to subheads G, I and L in the Estimate for this Department. Subhead G refers to the purchase of the interest in land and the auctioneer's commission, and there is a sum of £215,000 quoted.  Subhead I deals with the development of estates, and Subhead L with the preservation and improvement of game resources.</P>
    <P>In the list of moneys being expended by the Department of Lands this year, these are the only subheads I can find that are actually designed to improve the land of the small holders in Ireland or do something to improve the land of this country.  The total sum there expended is £1,030,000.  If one turns to the number of civil servants administering this sum, one finds at page 154 of the Book of Estimates that the total number shows an increase of two this year to, by a strange coincidence, 1,030.  In other words, it took one civil servant to administer each £1,000 expenditure on the land of Ireland and that does not take into account the people who build the houses for small holders, the people who erect the fences.  They are doing productive work on holdings.</P>
    <P>But surely it is executive madness if it takes one civil servant to administer each £1,000 of the Vote we entrust to the Minister each year.  Surely this Department needs to be turned inside out.  The first thing we must examine is whether the Minister, a young man, is showing any progressive trend, whether he is anxious to see whether all is well or whether it is necessary for him to take monumental steps towards righting the situation.  From the figures he has put before the House in this Estimate, we do not find any such evidence.  It is a complete condemnation that we have in 1963 a Department requiring one civil servant to administer each £1,000 spent on the operations entrusted to that Department.</P>
    <P>Do not think I am using this opportunity to abuse civil servants.  They are <Col N="756" /> a loyal body of people who, once they get the direction from the top, will do what they are told, and anybody who has been here for a number of years knows they will do it well.  It is not their fault.  It is the fault of management, and management lies first with the Minister and the Government who entrusted the Department to him.  In this regard, therefore, the Minister has been a failure.  If we are not to have some drastic changes here, it is another indication that the Government and the Minister have gone stale and that it is time they moved over and gave the job to somebody else.</P>
    <P>The disappointment people are expressing everywhere in the activities of the Department of Lands is something of which the Government are well aware.  The Taoiseach is not noted either for his knowledge or his interest in anything to do with land but quite recently, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 15th August, 1962, he indicated what he called a new policy in relation to land and its distribution. I want to quote from that speech and to examine the Taoiseach's points one by one.  For instance, he said in future it would be policy to provide family farms.  As far as stated policy is concerned, nobody in the House or outside it was misled by that, which has always been the stated policy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said that where farms were enlarged to the new standard the State would contribute 50 per cent of the purchase price and the cost of improvement.  In this connection, I would refer the Minister for Lands and the House to Subheads G and I of this Estimate where it will be found that the purchase price of land in fact has been about one-third of the cost of its development.  That proves conclusively of course, that the Taoiseach was again making a beautiful political speech and talking a lot of hot air.</P>
    <P>He said that interest-free loans would be made available to western land holders who sell their farms to the Land Commission to buy land elsewhere. The Taoiseach has not much experience of representations from people who are short of land.  He is a Kildare Street farmer rather than a <Col N="757" /> country farmer.  If he looked more carefully at the situation he would observe that the system of exchange holding that has operated would give far more to those who exchange their holdings than anything he has indicated there.</P>
    <P>He said that the Land Commission would be empowered to reoccupy vacant or unworked farms.  As far as I know, the Land Commission were always empowered to do this.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that legislation to purchase holdings from elderly or incapacitated owners was envisaged. This was the most dangerous statement as far as lands are concerned made by a politician for 20 years.  There are times in the life of a family, particularly a rural family that stay together, when the old people, for a decade or perhaps a decade and a half, are not in a position to work the family farm and want to let it through the local auctioneer, to live on the income therefrom and, having preserved it for 10 or 15 years, to hand it to a nephew when they pass on.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything wrong with that.  One of the first jobs I got as a politician was in 1954 when I had to go to the Land Commission Court in the company of a reverend parish priest to stop the Land Commission from taking 18 acres from an old woman because it was two or three miles from her home and she could not work it.  This woman was trying to keep the land for an energetic nephew.  We won the case in the Land Commission Court.  I would love the opportunity to go there again to stop that kind of land acquisition.  If the Taoiseach or the Minister would wish, I would send him the half-dozen letters that I have got&mdash;and I do not come from a constituency where congestion is at its worst&mdash;from old people worrying as to whether or not the Land Commission were going to take their lands from them.  The elderly and incapacitated owner is a person who should not be touched, even from a practical point of view, because he will not be that long there anyway and for the years remaining to him is quite entitled to live on the land, <Col N="758" /> his family farm, and pass it on to a relative, or in a case where he has not a relative, a neighbour who will farm it.  The Taoiseach did a bad day's work when he included that statement in his speech on that occasion.</P>
    <P>He said: &ldquo;Loans will be made available to small farmers for the purchase of livestock and equipment.&rdquo; Anyone who wants to go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation can avail of these loans.  There is no change whatever.</P>
    <P>He said: &ldquo;The State is to encourage co-operation, especially in the west&rdquo;. That is what I would refer to as a sort of stuffing you put in a goose. When you cook it, you do not eat it. You throw it away.</P>
    <P>The whole effort on the part of the Taoiseach on that occasion was to chip in to help his friend the Minister when he felt public opinion was going against him and he had not convinced anyone that he was the bright young man who was going to do something for the Department of Lands or that things were going to expand.</P>
    <P>Total expansion in a time when money values are falling here is £219,320.  A major policy speech by the Taoiseach was made about this sum.  If one is to take the amount of natural increase in wages and salaries represented in the total amount of £2,709,370 voted, one finds that it is most probably greater than the increase of £219,320.  So that the same situation obtains.  Fianna Fáil have no interest in the land of Ireland, no interest in the farmers of Ireland. They do not want to increase production and hope that the farmers in some of the particularly congested districts will do what they always did, namely, vote the way their fathers did and not record their displeasure at the fact that they are being left in a backwater, absolutely unattended to.</P>
    <P>There are lots of things the Minister could have done.  His predecessor produced the quite stupid effort of fish ponds, about which I do not intend to talk very much tonight.  Surely in each group of farms that are allocated there could be one farm on which, say, there could be an experimental pig-fattening <Col N="759" /> house where the neighbouring farmers could see what could be done with a modern pig house to supplement the family income.  Surely the bright young man who has been put in charge of the Department of Lands could have expanded Scéim na Muc in some such way.  Surely, in each group of 20 or 10 farms allocated by the Department of Lands the Minister could find somebody who would operate a broiler unit under the supervision of the local poultry instructress or agricultural instructor and would produce costings so that his neighbours would then begin to supplement their earnings from their land by that sort of operation?  Where the land is suitable, when ten or 15 farmers are given farms, there could be one farm where a young active man who had been put there&mdash; and the idea is to give land to that type of person&mdash;would engage in market gardening under the direction of the horticultural instructor for the county and produce tomatoes and mushrooms and vegetables for the local town and demonstrate to his neighbours that he was making an additional income from that operation.</P>
    <P>That is not being done.  The Minister is back in the dark and misty days and proceeds to dish out the land.  The farmers are left in a backwater.  The cost of administration is shown by the fact that there is one official for every £1,000 spent.</P>
    <P>Having been perhaps more critical than some other speakers, I should like to come to a matter which I can discuss with the Minister without being extremely critical, inasmuch as I understand his difficulties in this regard and appreciate his efforts.  I refer to the preservation of game.  Over the past eight or nine years, a great deal of effort in this House has been directed to the preservation of game and the development of fishing and shooting. In fact it is a long time&mdash;I think it was in 1955&mdash;since a group of Fine Gael Deputies put down a motion which was discussed in a very open manner by all sides of the House.  In that debate, quite a lot of useful information was gathered.  One thing that emerged was that while you could loose 100 boats on Lough Conn and <Col N="760" /> another 100 boats on Lough Corrib without affecting the fish population, you cannot do that type of wholesale operation upon the game population. The game population must be preserved; it is something you cannot shoot out.  It cannot be a free-for-all. We would all wish it could be a free-for-all, but it is clear that that is a physical impossibility.</P>
    <P>The approach of the regional game councils in which their first precept is that the farmer owns the game rights, is a good one.  If he preserves game on his own land, he can let the rights to shoot on the land to interested sportsmen.  He can discipline their shooting.  He can limit the amount they can shoot, if he wishes.  He can limit the number of days, if he wishes, and the manner in which they shoot, if he wishes.  The thinking on this matter has come right.  Initially, efforts were made through Bord Fáilte.  It was proposed that shooting should be available to a large number of tourists. With the possible exception of snipe, that is not possible.  While certain individual tourists may make arrangements with farmers and lease the shooting where game is preserved, the truth is that shooting will have to be regarded as rather restricted.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done well in regard to grants to the regional game councils who are the responsible bodies.  He deplored the obvious friction that exists.  It would be rather like sticking one's head in the sand to ignore it, and he was plucky enough and quite right not to do so.  There is obviously friction between the regional game councils and other organisations, notably the National Sporting Association. I feel that most of that friction is quite unnecessary.  The regional game councils hold the view that the associations would wish to get their hands on the game rights which are clearly and necessarily the farmers' property.  At the same time, the other associations feel that the regional game councils, who have a close affiliation with the National Farmers' Association and Macra na Feirme, tend to keep out the townsman, the professional man and other people.</P>
    <P>If we crystallise the difficulties, we find that neither assumption is true. <Col N="761" /> The correct procedure is that the farmer owns the rights and he can preserve the game, and he can let it to anyone, be he another farmer, a professional man or a member of any association.  The regional game councils are quite right in their approach to that matter.  An effort should be made to strengthen, if possible, the friendship between the different bodies.  I add my voice to that of the Minister in hoping that will come about.  The Minister was quite right also in saying, and in backing his word with action, that he would not wait until this friction eased itself, and that he would continue to give grants even though there was friction between the two bodies.  He said he hoped that situation would heal itself in time.  He was quite right.  Time does not stand still.  In an unsatisfactory situation, you cannot wait until time has passed you by.</P>
    <P>In a general way, there is a wonderful opportunity to help the small holders of Ireland by agricultural education, and by inducing them to participate after they have been advised by the ordinary agricultural advisory services and the committees of agriculture. There is also a great opportunity for the Minister to do specific things I mentioned, to get people interested in operations on their small holdings that will bring in additional income.  He has not done that.  That is the grave criticism of him.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago, the situation in the pig fattening and pig breeding industry was far different from what it is today. There was quite a divergence of opinion about the best type of pig house.  We now know that quite a lot that were thought best certainly were not the best, and in fact were quite unsatisfactory by modern standards.  There is now a degree of standardisation in these matters which would allow the Minister to stick his neck out, if I may use a slang phrase, by indicating the right type of pig fattening house for the smallholder and putting one on a small farm as an example to the farmer's neighbours.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's job to lead.  It is not his job to sit in Merrion Street and allow the stagnation that is around him <Col N="762" /> to continue, bound, I agree, by tradition and methods of operation for which he is not responsible.  The Minister is a young man and he could and should lead.  I do not think he is doing it and from that point of view the Government stand condemned.  One thing is certain: in the not too distant future when we get a chance, there will be changes, big changes, changes for the betterment of the smallholders of Ireland, and for the betterment of everyone who lives on the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to preface my remarks by making an earnest appeal to the Minister on behalf of a group of so-called landless applicants for divided land.  Up to now, they have received little consideration.  The type of farmer to whom I refer&mdash;the House may be surprised if I describe him as a farmer and a landless man&mdash; is, to my mind, one of the most worthy types engaged in the agricultural industry. I refer to the group confined to the Munster counties and known as dairymen.  Over a long number of years, they have paid high rentals for the use of farms which they are not mining, but farming, and from which they derive their livelihoods as a result of extremely hard work on the part of themselves, their wives, and their families.</P>
      <P>The men and women engaged on this work are highly trained in the craft of agriculture.  They start with little in life, and by sheer hard work and industry, secure a livelihood at great cost.  One thing which they do not do is mine the farms which they work.  They are engaged in a type of farming which restores to the soil as much as, if not more than, they extract from it.  They work for seven days of the week, 52 weeks of the year.  I earnestly suggest to the Minister that they constitute a class to which he should give the most favourable consideration in their applications for divided holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are equipped with experience and knowledge, and they are equipped with the stock and machinery to farm any holding which they may be granted.  There is a case for the acquisition of the farms which they are dairying and granting them to the <Col N="763" /> men and women who have for so many years derived their livelihood from such lands.  They have paid year in and year out what would secure for them some time ago an adequate holding on which to live and to bequeath to their families.  We must realise the insecurity in which these people work, and work so hard.</P>
    <P>My sole purpose in intervening in this debate is to stress the claims of that class in their applications for divided holdings.  I suggest they should not be moved from the areas in which they reside, from the lands which they occupy, the lands which they work and the lands of whose conditions they have such an intimate knowledge.  They have a right to the opportunity of becoming owners of the lands they work.  These people may not be large in numbers.  They may not have much influence with public men but ever since I came to realise how my neighbours live, I have nothing but the highest admiration for their industry and the hard work of which they are capable.  I feel very deeply for them inasmuch as they cannot give the slightest hope to their families of continuing in the homestead in which they were born and reared because they know not the day nor the hour when they may be removed from it.  Many of these people, because they are engaged solely in dairying, have contributed, down through the years, a great deal to the maintenance of fertility of the land which they husband.  I hope the Minister will give some measure of hope to that class of applicant.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to appeal to him in so far as he can to direct the activities of his Department into the rearrangement of some of these small holdings that have been divided into parcels which are the occasion of so much ill-feeling among neighbours and which constitute such difficulties for the people who try to derive a livelihood from them.  In present-day conditions people are dependent on mechanisation and the access to parts of their holdings is by other people's land.  There is the widening of passage ways, and so on.  It is impossible for <Col N="764" /> people to till the land without machinery and many difficulties are presented which cause annoyance and trouble among neighbours, the matter of trespass and so on.  I would impress upon the Minister the desirability of rearranging these holdings so as to combat the difficulties with which so many of these people have to contend.</P>
    <P>The operations of the Department of Lands apply to certain parts of the country, by way of acquisition of land, the granting of divided holdings to migrants, and so on, but I do suggest that the fact that taxes are being paid by the people as a whole would require the Department to attend to other areas, perhaps not in the realm of actual division but in regard to rearrangement and such matters.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to what has become the burning question for this country for many a long day, that is, the purchase of land by foreigners.  The Government have adopted a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude in relation to the reports that are at hand to all Deputies regarding the effects of such purchases in our various constituencies. The Minister tells us they are of little consequence in relation to the amount of land available in the country but the Minister and his Government must realise what the effect has been of encouraging&mdash;and they have been encouraged &mdash; people from the Continent with their vast financial resources to come in here to find a refuge in this little island and to deprive farmers' sons of the opportunity of ever having a holding of their own.</P>
    <P>Let us examine for a moment the effect that this has had on boys leaving the national school or technical school and who have devoted many years working at home with their older brothers and their parents, if they are still living, and saving up for the day when they can settle down and themselves become independent farmers and raise a family on an Irish farm.  Can they face the competition of the cheque-book evictions which are occurring?  Can they face in the open market the challenge that is presented to them of paying the price for land that these people from outside <Col N="765" /> our shores are prepared to pay, for what purpose we can just guess? Many of these people we distinctly welcome, inasmuch as they are contributing to the economy of the country in the provision of industrial employment, but we have not got sufficient land to make all the uneconomic holders economic.  We have not sufficient land to provide the size of holding we would like to provide for so many of our young farmers' sons who want to continue as farmers here.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is a serious matter that auctioneers in the south of Ireland will direct their activities towards the translation into German of the advertisements in Continental papers of holdings that come on to the market before if not as soon as they would give an opportunity to an Irish person to buy such a holding.  These matters would be better rectified now than rectified after much local bitterness has developed.  We are not unreasonable in this.  The Minister says that only so much land has been purchased by foreigners, that they have spent only so much on it, but the Minister for Finance gives a figure which is £500,000 out from that of the Minister for Lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who are the people to believe when two Ministers speak with such divergent views in respect of two figures and when there is such disparity in the figures?</P>
      <P>I want to refer finally to a grave injustice experienced by a man because he made a success of his life and because he had a tradition in Irish agriculture, because he had secured an agricultural education at one of these schools under the supervision of our Department of Agriculture.  When he had advanced and secured land in which to continue his business as a farmer, what treatment did he get?  I find from reading the statement submitted by this man that I have a considerable sympathy with him.  This case was brought to my notice only recently.</P>
      <P>I refer to the case of this man and his family in Limerick and to the impact on this man of taxation on a substantial holding there.  The land was acquired and it has not been paid for and this man did not get the assistance he should have been afforded to permit him to purchase some alternative holding.  I suggest that this man should be given an opportunity at a reasonable figure of leasing the land until such time as it is divided.  There is no doubt that he sought accommodation from the Department by way of ready payment of the land bonds that would give him the security to provide the necessary capital to buy an alternative holding.  He gave adequate notice to the Department, I thought, to permit them to assist him in getting this accommodation.  An undue period of time elapsed between his application and the time he received the reply which made it impossible for him to purchase the land in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to go into further detail but I regard it as a grave injustice ever to have acquired his holding as he had spent thousands of pounds on fertilising the lands and as he was the father of a young family and had made a success of his business and intended ultimately to reside on the holding. I did not think it would have been <Col N="767" /> possible for the Land Court to reject this man's claim to the land he had purchased.  However, that is gone.  It is remarkable that, adjoining the farm acquired from this man, there were other holdings which were left untouched, holdings which had been let for periods of 35, 40 or 45 years for grazing and no crops sown on them. They had been let for as little as £3 to £3 10s. per Irish acre per annum.  This man was singled out and his land acquired and he was left dangling for years without the money due to him being paid.  It is impossible for him to acquire other lands to accommodate the livestock he has to accommodate in the course of his business. It is in such circumstances that much of the goodwill that could exist is damaged by the unjust treatment of individuals. I suggest that the Minister could rectify some of the injustices perpetrated against this individual if he would now facilitate him by letting him his own lands until such time as the Department is ready to divide them, whenever that will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years people in the southern areas had one complaint.  They always felt that when land was being divided, they should get a fair slice of it and when they saw people coming from western areas, naturally they were upset, to say the least of it.  That was the complaint of small farmers, workers and others in these areas for many years.  Now we know that the pattern has changed and my sole reason for intervening in this debate is to draw attention to the very dangerous situation which is now arising, particularly in the southern and south-western coastal areas.  We are told about the amount of land, some of it agricultural and some of it non-agricultural, which is now being sold.  Let me say that I would much prefer to see a man from beyond, say, Spiddal, around Costello and such areas, in which it must be very difficult to live, coming to the southern areas rather than that the land there should be sold to foreigners who are now putting up notices that trespassers will be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this Government Ministers <Col N="768" /> drawing attention to the urgent necessity of concentrating on tourism. Surely it must be true to say that with tourism we must connect the advantages offered to people, whether Irish or otherwise, if they wish to visit the southern and south-western seaboard areas where nature has given us many advantages in the shape of good beaches and favourable swimming amenities.  Now, however, the mere Irish, or even the ordinary working people coming from England for a holiday, are being put into the position of trespassers by people from God knows where.  It is too serious to sit here and agree to what is happening. It is no use closing our eyes to the facts.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to deal with individual cases.  Deputy O'Sullivan dealt with one but I have no intention of letting it go without the full facts being brought out here or to the courts of where a company was formed and where a husband and wife, who are not natives of this country, were able to get a farm of agricultural land in the eastern part of the country and who then disappeared to become absentee landlords.  The next thing we find is that they are again back on the books as a registered company and in 1961 were able to have that land sold again to a foreigner who is the brother-in-law of the man who was Chief of Protocol to a certain dictator in Central Europe not long ago.  In that very place now people are told that they dare not trespass.  It is not far from where I live and the people are being told that they have not the right of free access to the nearby seashore.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister or the Government or any one of us believe that we can continue to close our eyes to such a situation?  The people in these areas are finding it very difficult to remain patient in the prevailing conditions but even with our own Government, we cannot hope to have Irishmen and Irishwomen continue to remain servile to foreign people in control here.  It was amusing to read a recent letter in a Sunday newspaper written by someone who I presume comes from some part of Europe saying that we should not say anything as the land is being <Col N="769" /> paid for.  The land is being paid for and certain individuals may be gaining but ultimately we know the nation will be a nation of serfs again.  Taking the south-western part of Cork, we find that many of the areas with sandy beaches which offered advantages to people from Cork city and from some of the larger towns are now somewhat like a battlefield with barbed wire surrounding the beaches and with notices bearing the words &ldquo;Trespassers will be prosecuted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I say that we are now at the crossroads and we must make up our minds whether or not this is to continue. It is no use for us to say that the land is being put into two categories, agricultural land and non-agricultural land.  Who would classify some of the land in Connemara as agricultural? Yet many of the unfortunates there must strive to eke out an existence for themselves.  Would it not be better to see them come to us?  We know that, as Irishmen, they would not barricade their holdings or erect barbed wire or fences around the strands to keep for themselves the advantages which nature has provided in this country for the enjoyment of everybody.</P>
    <P>It is about time the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Finance straightened out the issue of whether our land is agricultural.  We do not wish to be petty or parochial but, with so much talk about Europeanism at present, we must bear in mind that what is ours is not ours as individuals but belongs to this country.  If some Irish people are prepared to sell their land to the highest bidder, be he a Nazi or otherwise, that tendency must be curbed.  We must not be put in the position of having to say to an Irishman that he has no right to sell at an exorbitant price to people who are prepared to keep from all others the rights enjoyed by everybody for generations.  For too long, that sort of thing continued in the past.  It has now come to us in a new way, in a way many of us never expected, in the past ten years.  However, even at this stage, it may not be too late to attempt to repair the damage that has been done.  Otherwise, in years to come, perhaps not many years hence, we may <Col N="770" /> regret out inactivity in Dáil Éireann in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Estimate has roamed round and about, high, wide and handsome, and some extraordinary allegations have been made.  It would be wise for us all to get back to realities on some of the issues raised.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, before I come to some of the main fears expressed in connection with the purchase of land by aliens, I should deal for a moment with the queer allegation by Deputy Donegan that we have a civil servant in the Land Commission for every thousand pounds spent.  Above all people in this House, nobody knows less about congestion than the same Deputy Donegan. I would expect him to study the figures before making an allegation of this kind.  In addition to the cash figures to which I referred, the Deputy completely forgot that the Land Commission administers approximately £1 million in Land Bonds.  They have to deal with the collection of annuities, sub-divisions and a thousand other things with which the Land Commission is charged.  Deputy Donegan tried to work out this peculiar sum by taking the cash transactions dealt with by the Land Commission and relating them to the number of civil servants employed by the Department.  That is an indication of the manner in which the Deputy approached this issue.</P>
      <P>Let me now come to people who know a lot better than Deputy Donegan, including Deputy Blowick. Supported by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Blowick started with allegations about an extraordinary incursion of aliens purchasing the land of Ireland.  When I drew the attention of Deputy Blowick to the fact that, during his period of office as Minister for Lands, we had these same allegations, and when I reminded him of what he had to say about them in those days, he airily wiped them aside with the suggestion that in those days only 1,000 or 1,200 acres a year were involved in these transactions.  Nobody knows better than Deputy Blowick that that is completely false.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blowick had questions in <Col N="771" /> this House, the answers to which I shall refer in the course of my reply. He also had to deal with a Bill, introduced I think by Deputy McQuillan, dealing with these very allegations of an infiltration by foreigners purchasing the land of Ireland when he was Minister for Lands.  At that time, he caused an inquiry to be made in the Land Commission to find out the approximate amount of land involved in these transactions over the previous ten years.  The figure he collected was approximately 5,000 acres a year changing hands in these transactions over that period.</P>
    <P>In the purchase of land by aliens the figures on which those 5,000 acres were based excluded any land under 100 acres.  Therefore, the House may take it that when Deputy Blowick was charged with responsibility as Minister for Lands&mdash;and indeed, his colleague, Deputy Dillon, too, as a Minister of that Government&mdash;the position was that though the average amount of land involved yearly in these transactions with aliens of one kind or another was approximately 5,000 acres it must have been a minimum figure because in compiling the figures the Land Commission ignored, from their sources of information, cases in which a figure of under 100 acres was involved.</P>
    <P>Speaking for his Government and as Minister for Lands on the Land Bill, 1949, in Seanad Éireann, as reported at column 1908 of the Official Report, Volume 37, Deputy Blowick had this to say:</P>
    <P>A close watch is being kept on the purchase of land by non-nationals. I want to assure the House that there is no need for alarm.  Some have bought the land at fantastic prices and have burnt their fingers.  The number of purchases by foreigners is so small that no action is necessary at the moment in regard to it.  I want to assure the House on that, for fear there might be alarm as a result of some of the speeches made here and in the Dáil. The question is not a serious one, by any means.  Some Senators are afraid that there will be a new conquest <Col N="772" /> of this country by money, that foreigners will buy out this country. The only thing I can say is that they will want to hurry up to make any impression at all, because at the rate of purchase for the last ten years, it will take 2,400 years to buy up the land of this country.</P>
    <P>Now, 2,400 years to buy up the land of this country is based on a calculation that we have 12 million acres of arable land.  At a rate of sale of 5,000 acres a year, it would take 2,400 years, as Deputy Blowick then said, to purchase the whole of the land of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want the House fully to understand the hypocrisy surrounding some of the allegations made in this debate on this issue.  When the Coalition Government were in office and when Deputy Blowick was in charge of the Department of Lands, on his own figures, the average in these transactions was 5,000 acres a year.  I do not suggest that all of that was arable land but I shall give the House some figures to guide them on that issue in a few moments.</P>
    <P>The minimum amount of Irish land involved in these transactions during the period of the Coalition Government was approximately 5,000 acres a year, as Deputy Blowick said, and that figure, as such, excludes areas of less than 100 acres.  This was the considered judgment and the reaction of that Government to the question at the time.  When Deputy Dillon comes along in this debate and sheds crocodile tears about the land of Ireland being sold, let me make it quite clear and drive it home that the approximate figure today for these transactions is roughly the same&mdash;between 5,000 and 6,000 acres.  But the difference is that in dealing with agricultural land, this Government have established an exact register through which, under the law of the land, the Land Commission are aware of every square foot of land sold to anybody not an Irish national no matter for what purpose.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what Fine Gael policy on this issue is because it was a Fianna Fáil Minister who originally introduced the very severe <Col N="773" /> 25 per cent differential tax on land purchased here by aliens.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring the House back to show the attitude of those who now take this Government to task for alleged inaction on this problem. When the Government of the day introduced this 25 per cent tax, Deputy Dillon, as reported in the Official Report of 15th October, 1947, at column 466, said:</P>
    <P>We are to increase the stamp duty on the sale of land to persons ordinarily resident outside the State to 25 per cent.  That is the kind of muddled-headed, mean, ignorant thing that Fianna Fáil are peculiarly expert at doing.  They think that will be popular&mdash;&ldquo;We are going to stop the Englishmen from buying our lands&rdquo;.  Of course, there will be a few ignorant &ldquo;goms&rdquo; down the country who will swallow it and at the same time they can say to others: &ldquo;We do not want to stop anybody, but we want to get the revenue to prevent inflation.&rdquo;  But that ignorant, cloutish device will achieve neither object.  The only effect it will have will be materially to lessen the value of land generally and of such house property as may be purchased by strangers coming to visit this country.</P>
    <P>At column 467, he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Everybody wants to make pious gestures about it, because they think it is a popular thing to do.  Do we object to English people buying a house and grounds in this country for their own occupation, or do we not?</P>
    <P>He goes on:</P>
    <P>This is a sovereign Parliament and we can prohibit the registration of land in the name of any foreigner tomorrow without the slightest difficulty. If we want to do that, why do we not do it?  I do not want to do it.</P>
    <P>Further on, he says:</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of preventing respectable English people buying properties in this country for residences if they want to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> He also says:</P>
    <P>It will not deter one of the class to whom I have referred from buying a place if they want it; but it may prevent a number of decent people from acquiring modest establishments who otherwise would.  It certainly will reduce the value of land on a lot of people who had a right to believe that an Irish Government would not so interfere with free sale as materially to depreciate their assets in the shape of the holding they desire to sell.</P>
    <P>Here is the spoken word of the present leader of the Opposition expressing the view of the Fine Gael Party against the imposition of the 25 per cent tax which the then Minister for Finance introduced to deal with the problem and restrict transactions.  These are the words of the Deputy who in this debate painted for us such a terrible picture of the invasion of Ireland by foreigners and the awful consequences that would ensue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also took the Government to task about what, he alleges, is the flow of capital here through the sale of house property and business premises to foreigners in Dublin and elsewhere.  Strangely, it was Deputy Dillon's colleague, Deputy Sweetman, who, when Minister for Finance, amended the law as it then was and allowed free of differential tax the sale to any non-national of any property where less than five acres of land went with it.  Deputy Sweetman opened the gap in his Finance Act of 1956 for all and sundry to come to any city or town and purchase any house or business, provided there was no greater area than five acres concerned in the transaction.  These people come along now trying to sell the public the idea that there is an extraordinary invasion going on at present and that the Government are doing nothing about it, whereas in fact they bitterly opposed and derided measures taken by the Government when this differential 25 per cent tax was applied in order to curtail, as was then considered necessary, the purchase of land by aliens.</P>
    <P>It is completely untrue to suggest, as some Deputies have done in this <Col N="775" /> debate, that the Government have at any time, or any of their Ministers, suggested to foreigners that the purchase of agricultural land here would be welcomed.  It has been made abundantly clear time and again by different Ministers and by myself that land is a very scarce commodity here and that we need for our own people all the available land suitable for Land Commission purposes to deal with our congestion problem.  That was made clear on many occasions and the late Dr. Reiffenscheidt, former German Ambassador, was so informed by me. When he visited his own country, he made a speech that got a tremendous amount of publicity there to the effect that while German nationals were welcome here to bring in their knowhow and skill in industry and business, they would not be welcome from the viewpoint of the acquisition of agricultural land.  This Government took the steps they considered necessary to control the situation.  If, in the Government's view, at any time further steps are needed, they will be taken if the national interest requires it.</P>
    <P>What I am making clear is that approximately the same pattern is evident now as was evident in those years to which I refer.  The amount of land, good, bad or indifferent, concerned in these transactions is running between 5,000 and 6,000 acres a year according to this register, which is accurate and which, according to my officials, is effective under the law passed by this House in 1961.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, Deputy Tully, Deputy Treacy, Deputy Desmond and others made wild general allegations that the law in connection with stamp duty is being got over.  It is very difficult for me or anybody else to deal with general allegations of that kind where we have no particulars.  It is very easy with such general allegations to create an idea abroad that there is something radically wrong, and neither I nor anybody else can investigate it.  I would welcome particulars from any Deputy of any instance, or even of suspicion, of the law being evaded.</P>
    <P>An allegation made by a Deputy during the debate on this Estimate last year that solicitors, auctioneers and <Col N="776" /> others are holding land in this country in trust for foreigners is completely untrue. He said that everybody knew they did so.  I, for one, do not know it.  Under the Finance Act, 1961, this is a very grave criminal offence.  Any individual who lends his name to that kind of thing would not alone be liable to a very heavy fine but to a very severe term of imprisonment.  Knowing the solicitors' profession as I do, they are not all idiots, and I doubt whether any solicitor in his sane mind &mdash;or any auctioneer, for that matter&mdash; would allow himself to be put in that position.</P>
    <P>I have directed the officials of the Land Commission to make spot checks as often as they can to see if they can get any evidence anywhere of the law as set out in the 1961 Act being evaded.  So far, no evidence of any device for fraud has emerged. As I say, I would welcome details of any case in which a Deputy has his suspicions, so that they can be investigated. But, for heaven's sake, let us get away from these wild general allegations of dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi.  Let us get down to realities and get away from these statements that everybody knows there is fraud going on.  If there is, I and the Land Commissioners are the people to whom such frauds or suspicions of them should be reported.  I would suggest to Deputies that, apart from any question of being fair to me, in fairness to themselves, it is their duty as citizens to bring to the notice of the authorities a breach of the law, which in this case would amount to a breach of the criminal law of this land.</P>
    <P>Evidently, there are different approaches to this question, depending upon whether certain Deputies are in Government or out of it.  Some of the arguments that have been used in this House and elsewhere by my predecessor, Deputy Blowick, when he was charged with the responsibility of administering the Department of Lands, can well be quoted here, because some of the arguments used are still relevant to this situation.  It is true that because of our history, one of the most sensitive subjects we have is the question of land.  It is also true <Col N="777" /> that unscrupulous people can make use of the national sensitivity of our people on this subject for political advantage if the people fall for misleading propaganda.  In dealing with a question of this kind, apart from the constitutional issue it raises between man and man, it may be no harm to go back and see some of the arguments advocated when this question of aliens was raised in February, 1950, under the then Land Bill.</P>
    <P>An amendment was introduced by a Clann na Talmhan Deputy, the former Deputy Commons.  He advocated not alone taking land from aliens who acquired it here, but not paying them the same price or market value proposed to be paid to our own citizens when land is taken from them for the relief of congestion.  Deputy Blowick, the then Minister for Lands, at column 701 of the 23rd February, 1950, had this to say:</P>
    <P>...there are other factors to be considered.  First, a number of our flesh and blood abroad have purchased property in other countries. It is an international principle, which has been embodied in Section 3 of the Aliens Act, 1935, that the property of non-nationals will get the same protection in law in this country as that of nationals and citizens of the State.  The very same thing applies to our kith and kin in England, America and elsewhere. That is one aspect of it which would have very serious repercussions. I do not know whether we might not look forward to retaliation if the amendment were adopted. As the amendment is worded, it also throws into that category our own people who went abroad in former years and acquired American citizenship.  There are quite a few of them my own neighbours and I suppose such people are to be found in every county.  They acquired American citizenship while abroad and have since come home to take up their parents' holdings in this country.  They have never bothered, however, to set right the question of their citizenship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> On the same occasion, Deputy Dillon waxed eloquently as follows:</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to set up one basis of compensation for Billy and another for Jack.  The fundamental law of this country says that, whether a man is rich or poor, great or humble, native or stranger, when he is under the protection of our law, whatever may be his fate in his own country, he will be treated under Irish law in accordance with the tenets of justice and equity. Where is the justice and equity of taking a stranger's property and denying him its value if you take identical property from his neighbour who is a citizen of this State and give him its full value?  Millions of our people have in their time been strangers in a strange land and they have had abundant cause to thank God that the land they went to had a constitution and that however humble they were, however insignificant, if anyone in the United States of America dared to treat them differently before the law from the most venerable family in America, there were judges there to see, whatever injustice prevailed under British dispensations in Ireland whence such a man came, now that he was in America he was entitled to precisely the same treatment under the law as the President of the United States.  I hope to God that a people who have thanked God for that haven of refuge and freedom in their day will not so far disgrace themselves in respect of this matter as to say: &ldquo;Having thanked God for that freedom, that justice and that equity when we were down-trodden and poor, we will deny it to strangers who come to live in our midst&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is the view of Deputy Dillon about differentiation in regard to aliens purchasing land here.</P>
    <P>At column 727, during the Committee Stage of the Bill, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins had this to say:</P>
    <P>I think, with the Minister for Agriculture, that it matters little whether this amendment is passed or rejected, because I agree that, should the matter ever be examined <Col N="779" /> by the courts set up under the Constitution, they would hold such a legislative provision as contrary to the Constitution of this country, and therefore void.  Apart from that, I would remind Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Commons of this fact, that, taking their own constituencies, there are, unfortunately&mdash;and I am certain of this&mdash;many kinsmen, constituents of theirs, living, working and carrying on business in a country not so far away from this country and owning property&mdash;houses and land&mdash;in England, and are we, even by a futile Act of this Parliament, going to establish a principle which may in times like these be quite easily used in England against our own citizens, our own people abroad?</P>
    <P>Those were the views of Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture in the Coalition Government, of Deputy Blowick as Minister for Lands, and of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.  The transactions with aliens were approximately the same at that time but at that time the question was that if we took any action against aliens, we would be calling down the wrath of the Almighty because Americans might treat our people accordingly where there is no rule against our people acquiring land, or that the British might do the same thing in Britain where there is no domestic law stopping our nationals from acquiring any property they are in a position to acquire.</P>
    <P>The official view of the Opposition then was that this would be a retrograde step.  Deputy Dillon rhapsodised about allowing the free sale of the land and about depriving the individual here of the free right of sale, no matter whether it was to a man from Timbuctoo, Frankfurt or from across the water in Britain.  Deputy T.F. O'Higgins said it would be contrary to the Constitution to introduce legislation differentiating between an alien and one of our own citizens.</P>
    <P>Is it not pertinent for me now to ask what is Fine Gael policy on this matter?  There has not been a solitary constructive proposal put forward by the Fine Gael Party as to what they would do in this situation if they were charged with the responsibility of <Col N="780" /> office.  They opposed the 25 per cent tax placed on the purchase by aliens of Irish land.  They pooh-poohed the provisions in the 1961 Finance Act setting up a register to keep a complete and accurate record of every square foot of land purchased by non-nationals throughout the country.</P>
    <P>What do they want to do now?  Is it not the height of political dishonesty to suggest, on the one hand, that you will maintain free sale here, the right of every farmer in Ireland to sell at the highest penny, and at the same time to submit that the Government should do something about this question of foreigners purchasing land here?  They offer no constructive proposal as to what should be done about it. The only suggestion I have heard from the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, or from anybody else on the benches opposite, was a proposition brought in in the form of an unworkable Bill to create a register under which track would be kept of the extent of these purchases.</P>
    <P>The present register was created under the Finance Act of 1961.  Under it, every square foot of land is covered and if there has been any avoidance of the law, officials of my Department or of the Revenue Commissioners have not discovered it.  It may be that there could be some cases of which we do not know.  If there are, I believe they are based on fraud and the law is there, and it is a very severe law, to deal with any gentleman who makes a false declaration or sets out false particulars in any deed of transfer, or indeed in dealing with the shares of any company owning land.</P>
    <P>In view of what Deputy Desmond has said, I would point out that the device of the pre-1947 company is gone and affords no protection as regards stamp duty in regard to the purchase of land by aliens.  In the case of the company, the majority of the shares must be held in the beneficial ownership of Irish nationals and if there is any false declaration to get out of the stamp duty, or in regard to the shares of the company, then the individual making that statement, if brought to book, will suffer the consequences I have mentioned under <Col N="781" /> the penal clauses of the 1961 Finance Act and he will find himself for a long time kicking his heels up in Mountjoy; that is, if any fraud is taking place.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that this applies equally to companies and individuals so that in every conceivable way the legal advisers to the Government and myself could devise, steps were taken in the Finance Bill of 1961 to keep full track not alone of all land purchased by non-nationals but also to deal with any device that might be put up by the legal advisers of these gentlemen.</P>
    <P>The figures are there and I have given them to the House.  Let me make it clear again that should this picture change, should it become necessary in the view of the Government to increase the present penal tax or to take any further steps, the Government will not be slow to do so.  I would point out, though, that in dealing with this question, there is another matter that requires clearing up &mdash; the deliberate confusion that has been attempted by some Deputies about figures given by the Minister for Finance and myself.</P>
    <P>I have already put it on the records of the House that the approximate amount of money payable in regard to these transactions was £500,000.  I was dealing with the amount of agricultural land on which the 25 per cent stamp duty had in fact been paid.  The Minister for Finance, in giving his figures, dealt not alone with the amount of agricultural land on which the 25 per cent stamp duty was paid but with every acre of land, irrespective of the purpose, be it for a factory, or a dwelling house with land under five acres in extent.  He was giving the figure for the total inflow of money for land of any kind or description, for whatever purpose, from aliens.</P>
    <P>I made that clear here in the House. So did the Minister for Finance.  But, of course, the suggestion was again trotted out by Deputy Dillon in the course of this debate that neither the Minister for Finance nor myself knew the exact figure.  I was rather surprised by Deputy Treacy, I think it was, from the Labour Party, coming <Col N="782" /> out with the same thing.  I do not know whether, like Tit Willow in the song, Deputy Treacy had a rather tough political worm in his little inside.  I would hate to think it was weakness of intellect.  He does seem to have the capacity for swallowing every political worm thrown up by Deputy Dillon and regurgitating it here as if it were the truth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is most unfair.  The Minister should keep the dirt out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that Deputy Dillon, who knew the figures that were given here, attempted for the tenth time to misinterpret figures given by the Minister for Finance and by me, was followed by Deputy Treacy making the same allegation that Deputy Dillon had made, that we did not know what the exact figure was. Let me repeat: the figure is there in detail, and for every square foot of land purchased in this country since 1961 by any alien, be he British, German or irrespective of what part of the world he came from&mdash;American for that matter.  This was the first time that such a register was established in this country and in so far as we know it is factual, it is accurate and, until we find evidence to the contrary, it is proof that the machinery provided under the 1961 Finance Act to deal with this matter has been effectual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputies here want to bring in some further measures, further discrimination against the purchase of land by aliens in this country, I do hope that at least the main Opposition Party will make a practical proposal as to what they want done.  Let them not try to mislead the public into thinking that they are going to have this free sale, for which Deputy Dillon is prepared to die, and at the same time, stop the Irish farmer from selling his farm for £500 more to an alien because he is an alien and at the same time allow that farmer the right of free sale.  It just cannot be done and there is nobody who knows that better than Deputy Dillon but, of course, he is quite facile in making these allegations and selling the idea now, far away <Col N="783" /> from the views expressed by him which I quoted when he was Minister for Agriculture in dealing with this situation.  Now he thinks there are some political kudos to be garnered because he well knows the sensitivity of our people on the question of Irish land.</P>
    <P>Let me give an instance for the benefit of Deputy McQuillan and others who, obviously, did not reason out this matter or deliberately refrained from reasoning out the matter and who would like to give the idea that a very large number of people could be settled on 50 acre holdings if these transactions with aliens were completely stopped and if we possibly could stop them.</P>
    <P>A case came to my notice in the Land Commission during the last week.  It was a purchase in the West of Ireland by an alien.  If the purchase goes through, it will be quite a substantial one.  The area concerned comprises 5,500 acres.  That sounds and is a very substantial area.  It is an area that I know well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the valuation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The valuation is £40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister need waste the time of the House any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The average value of this land is 2d. an acre.  Using Deputy McQuillan's argument and the argument of some of the Deputies on these benches, if the Land Commission were to take over these 5,500 acres, they could settle in wonderful comfort approximately 110 families on holdings of 50 acres each.  But, the average valuation of the holdings would be 8/4d. and I do not think the most optimistic of us would relish the idea of having to make a living on a holding of that kind.  It would be a misnomer to describe this place as snipe grass because snipe would not and cannot live on it.  I know it well.  The Forestry Division turned it down years ago.  There was not a place between the rocks to stick a bush in.  If this land goes on to the register, can it be used as an instance of the number of <Col N="784" /> Irish families that could be settled on this tract of 5,500 acres of Irish land? The three or four common owners who have rights over this land thought that Santa Claus had come twice to them when this gentleman came along and proposed taking these rocks off their hands.  I wish this gentleman all the luck in the world with it.  What he will do with it, I do not know but, if he is prepared to take that kind of land and give some of our people some kind of price for it, land that is valued at 2d. an acre, I say more luck to him with his purchase.</P>
      <P>This is the fallacy&mdash;this is the easy picture to be painted for the ignorant, when you say you have all these acres going to foreigners on which you could settle so many Irish families.  Let me say that in respect of purchases by foreigners in this country in some cases the Commissioners have power, where the lands are not suitable, where they are what I would call white elephants, they have power to recommend relief from the differential stamp duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a nasty phrase for the Minister for Health to hear. The Minister for Lands should not say it in his hearing.  He may be sensitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are in this country many white elephants in the form of big old houses with not sufficient land to support them round about them and places that would be completely unsuitable for Land Commission purposes.  Indeed, unless some of these people came along to relieve the owners of some of these white elephants, I do not know what they would do with them because certainly no local man who knows his business would take on what he would know to be a liability.  In many of these cases we find on examination of the figures that some aliens come over and get stuck with these white elephants and put money into them and then, having experience and the Irishmen having their money, they try to unload them on others of their ilk if they can get some green enough to fall for them. Many of these transactions are taking place amongst the same class of inexperienced people.  Some of them have come over the years looking for atmosphere <Col N="785" /> and so on.  They get the atmosphere with the old mansion and quite a lot of them do not last very long and try to unload again, as everybody does who is caught in a deal of that kind.</P>
      <P>I should not take up so much of the time of the House in dealing with this particular aspect of this matter, but I should like to point out the complete dishonesty of approach to this question by some of those who have attempted to stampede public opinion into the idea that there is some fantastic sell-out going on in connection with Irish land.  There is not.  The picture is approximately the same. It would appear to me that there is a change in the treatment because of the fact that a few people from one particular country who we are not used to here have come into the country and bought a few farms here and there.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a much more easy approach to the British ex-colonels and generals who flocked here after the last war, and for some years afterwards. It would seem that there is some bias against the very few people comparatively speaking who have come here in recent years, and have certainly brought with them technique and know-how that is extremely valuable to this country, and who are, to my knowledge in some cases at all events, very welcome by the local people.</P>
      <P>Let me come now to another allegation made by a number of Deputies throughout this debate.  There was an allegation that beaches are being closed by some people who have purchased land here.  Let this be clear. There is no one, no purchaser of land in this country, who can close up anything that was not private property before he bought it.  A purchaser of any farm can purchase only what the vendor had.  If there was a right of way to the sea, or a Mass path, or a right to take seaweed, that right is still there, and all the foreigners in the world cannot change that one iota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some experience of this matter.  I spent very many years in my time before our courts dealing with rights of way and questions of title in rural Ireland.  I do not think there are people in the whole wide world <Col N="786" /> who have a greater sense of property and property rights than our own people.  I dare you in Mayo to let your hen run across your neighbour's fence, or to go across land where you have not established the right to do so.  You will soon find yourself hauled before the courts.  In many cases over the right to walk a donkey across a few rocks or some snipe grass, people have beggared themselves with cases and appeals in regard to title.  I maintain that no people have a greater sense of property rights than our own people. Unless the people down in the south where the allegations are made are aliens, I for one am surprised that they will allow anyone to walk over their rights if, in fact, they have those rights as the allegations say they have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not privilege that was talked about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of privilege is one that is watched very carefully by the Irishman.  If I am so soft as to let you walk across my field for 12 years without stopping you, you have the right to go across it, and tell me to go and jump in a lake.  The right to water takes somewhat longer. It is 20 years.  Where the right to seaweed, to the sea or elsewhere, is a traditional one, the Attorney General can come in for and on behalf of the public and assert that that right is being interfered with.  The people and their advisers are not, I think, any more dumb in the south than they are in the west.  I should like to see anyone in the county with which I am familiar stopping a man from going across the Mass path or going for seaweed, or taking from him any right which he has enjoyed from time immemorial.  I cannot accept those allegations.  I do not believe them.  I assert to the House again that any purchaser can only get what the vendor had.  If some alleged right is closed up, either there never was such a right, or the people are asleep in that part of the country if they are not asserting their rights.  I, for one, find grave difficulty, from my experience, in believing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some matters dealing with individual cases have been raised.  Deputy <Col N="787" /> O'Sullivan mentioned some case in Limerick.  I would have no details of that case without notice from the Deputy.  I gather from what he said that it was a matter which was dealt with by the Land Court.  If it has been dealt with by the Land Court, I do not accept that this particular cattle dealer was unfairly discriminated against in the Land Court. In a question of compulsory acquisition of land, the Land Court is invariably most sympathetic to those concerned.  It has been my experience, long before I joined the Government, that if there was any question of a man having to go away from his holding for a while, or being in temporary difficulties and having to let his land for that reason, the Land Court invariably gave him time to come back, or time to improve his position in order to maintain his land.  I gather the case to which the Deputy referred was dealt with by the Land Court, and if it was, he would have an opportunity of putting his case fully before the court.  At all events, that is the law of the land, and it is a matter for which I am not responsible. Someone must do this work.  It is as fair a system as could be devised, and while an occasional mistake may occur, so far it has worked out fairly satisfactorily to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Flanagan who complained about cases where the Land Commission withdrew after the price was fixed by the Appeal Tribunal. The Land Commission have no appeal against whatever price may be fixed by the judge of the Appeal Tribunal. As in other cases, the judge in the Land Court makes up his mind and gives a decision on the evidence put before him.  A judge may be misled.  A judge may be codded just the same as anyone else, if people are prepared to swear to unreal values.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, in an action before a jury in the High Court, sometimes there can be a daft decision on the question of damages.  The aggrieved party can go to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the damages are too heavy and unrealistic, and the Supreme Court can order a new trial, and send the case back to <Col N="788" /> another jury.  Under the land law, the Land Commission have no appeal against a judgment given by an appeal judge.  Therefore, if there is an appeal, and evidence is produced to the judge which puts an unrealistic and extremely high value on the land, and if the judge accepts that evidence, the Land Commission have no redress under the law except to withdraw. They have that power.  Indeed, from my experience, where the Land Commission have exercised that power&mdash; they rarely do so but it is necessary from time to time&mdash;the owner who has got that unrealistic price goes along to them and says, irrespective of what the judge has said: &ldquo;I am prepared to accept £500 less&rdquo; or £1,000 less and so on.  We have had that experience sometimes.  It proves beyond yea or nay that in these cases an unrealistic amount of compensation was given for the land acquired and, as I say, it is the one form of protection the Land Commission have.</P>
    <P>In the national interest and from the point of view of enabling the Land Commission to get the greatest amount of land possible from the budget with which they are provided, it is very necessary that they should have and that the House should have a proper approach to this question.  Indeed the House should be anxious that the Land Commission should not pay any unrealistic price for land because in many cases the Land Commission, particularly where they are empowered under the limited powers they have, to purchase at public auction they are competing with people who might make good use of land, and farmers naturally want to try to get holdings for their sons.  There is a limit to the amount of land which the Land Commission in the national interest should acquire but under the budget provided for them, they are making a very good impact on the acquisition of land. Under the different headings there has been more money provided for them by this Administration than was ever provided before and the result of these sinews of war which have been provided for the Land Commission is apparent and will be more apparent as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I am deliberately refraining from <Col N="789" /> dealing with the various allegations that were made about what is proposed to be done under the new Land Bill.  The simple answer to the allegations that I did not deal with the various provisions of the new Land Bill is the fact that I would be out of order in doing so on this Estimate. It is true, as I have told the House, there may be some matters that as a matter of policy could be put into operation without the new legislation, which, as I have said, will be introduced this session.  One of these matters is the question of providing the new family farm of 40 to 45 acres, and the policy has already been put into operation by me because I could do so as a matter of policy direction to the Land Commission.  At this time all the new migrants' holdings are being brought up to that standard.  Where land is available on the division of any estates by way of additions, in so far as the Land Commission can do it that is the aim and will be the aim for the family farm in the future.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is a pipe dream on Deputy Blowick's part to allege that he or his colleagues in Government ever attempted to increase the size of the family farm.  He made that allegation on this debate.  In fact the position was that there was one standard in the congested areas in the west of Ireland and a different standard in the whole of the rest of the country.  A man in the west of Ireland, once he was over £10 valuation was written off by the Land Commission and could not qualify for any addition where land was available adjoining him or in the townland within the mile distance; whereas in the south or the east of the country he could be up to £30 valuation and still would be eligible to receive an addition of land if there was land available for division in the area.</P>
    <P>That situation was left there by Deputy Blowick but I decided that it was time to do something about it and that it was time to stop creating what I regard as further land slums by keeping people on a subsistence farming level.  Anybody now who is under £10 valuation on West of Ireland land could not be regarded as being anything but a subsistence farmer because <Col N="790" /> he would have to spend at least three months of the year looking for work from the county council or emigrate to England or elsewhere in order to supplement the family income.  He could not possibly provide for himself and his family on a valuation less than £10.</P>
    <P>That has been changed and changed as a matter of policy.  The other enabling sections which will give inducements to people to give their lands to the Land Commission will be dealt with when the new Land Bill is brought in here.</P>
    <P>It is quite easy for Deputy Dillon, as he stated in this debate, to allege that the Taoiseach or I or this Government are paying people to leave the land in the west of Ireland, that this is a daft national policy.  It is very easy to manufacture an &ldquo;Aunt Sally&rdquo; and, of course, Deputy Dillon has any amount of coconuts to shy at an Aunt Sally of his own creation.  The Taoiseach or I never said anything of that kind.  What I did say in this House, even before the Taoiseach's speech, when in introducing my Estimate last year I was dealing with what I thought should be done in connection with the new Land Bill was that power should be taken by the Land Commission to deal with the particular area where, because of the local congestion in that village, or that townland, it was obvious one or two people would have to be migrated so as to leave room for the others in order to give them an economic holding.</P>
    <P>It was not today or yesterday I said that.  I saw from a debate I was looking up today that I had advocated that very proposition in this House to Deputy Blowick when he was Minister for Lands in connection with the 1950 Land Bill and what has been said by both the Taoiseach and myself is that power should be taken by the Land Commission in a situation where there is congestion in a village or townland and it is obvious that one or two must get out of that because the holdings are uneconomic or too small, in order to make a reasonable rearrangement for those who are left.  The idea was that the Land Commission would pick out one or two good, thrifty young fellows and say to them: &ldquo;You go <Col N="791" /> ahead to the next village or watch the local paper and, where you see a holding that is suitable, take it and we shall provide you with the sinews of war to do so.&rdquo;  He will be financed by the Land Commission to do that. If that is not sound logic and commonsense in order to deal with that congestion, I&mdash;Deputies from the south and the Midlands may not be familiar with it but we have a relic of Cromwellian times west of the Shannon&mdash;do not know what is.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this day and age will expect people to try to exist on living standards of the Famine times, on valuations of £2, £3 or £4.  That is unrealistic in this day and age.  These provisions such as I have indicated to the House, and which I hope to introduce here shortly, to deal with this problem and to provide these inducements, to increase the pool of land in these congested areas will, we hope, keep these people on the land. Economics are driving them from it and it is to remedy that situation that the new land policy has been inaugurated. At all events, within the framework of the law as it exists, as the responsible Minister, we have provided the sinews of war to implement the restricted powers the Land Commission have up to date, to try to speed up the Land Commission machine.  With the new powers I hope to have in operation by the time this Estimate comes around again, I hope that with the co-operation of the House, we will be able to make a real impact, an impact that will be apparent to the House and to the country, on this inherited terrible problem of the land slums of Ireland.</P>

    <P>These figures account for an increase of £220,490 in the gross Estimate.  The Estimate provision for Appropriations-in-Aid (Subhead G) is down by £250,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be particularly interested in Subhead C.&mdash;Acquisition of Land, Subhead C.2&mdash;Forest Development and Management, Subhead G&mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid and Subhead D &mdash;Grants for Afforestation Purposes. I propose to refer briefly to the remaining Subheads of the Vote before dealing with these in detail.</P>
    <P>Subhead A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;shows an increase of £29,840 on the provision for 1962-63. The rise in requirements is due mainly to increases in the Inspectorate and Forester staff, together with the usual allowances for incremental increases. Subhead B&mdash;Travelling Expenses&mdash;is higher by £12,550 than the provision for 1962-63.  Of this £10,000 represents the increased cost of travelling and subsistence expenditure.  The steady increases in the area of State Forest and field staff requirements make a steady rise in the provision for travelling and subsistence inevitable. The remainder of the increase is spread over advertising, publicity, <Col N="793" /> telephones and other miscellaneous expenses and calls for no special comment.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.3&mdash;Sawmilling&mdash;shows an increase of £900.  This Subhead provides for the operation of the Department's fixed sawmills at Cong and Dundrum.  The rise includes provision for increased wage outgoings to workers at the mills.  The provision for Forestry Education&mdash;Subhead E&mdash; is up by £800 of which £500 arises under general expenses of management. It is expected that in the current year there will be an average of 90 trainee foresters undergoing instruction at the Department's two training establishments.  Subhead F&mdash;Agency, Advisory and Special Services&mdash;shows no change from the provision for last year.  The provision under this head is intended to cover the re-engagement of an industrial consultant for short periods in connection with Incentive Bonus Schemes.</P>
    <P>Since the Estimate was framed, the Department has formalised arrangements with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards for the initiation of a programme of testing of Irish grown timber in the Institute's laboratories. The programme agreed with the Institute is designed to establish the mechanical properties of the tree species grown on a considerable scale in Ireland.  Reliable scientific data are necessary as a basis for determination of size specifications of structural timbers, working quality for joinery purposes, etc.  The programme will, in due course, be co-ordinated with the Department's own research activities in connection with seed provenance and tree improvement.  Deputies will be quick to realise the increasing importance of research of this kind to a large scale producer of timber like the Forestry Division.  The Forestry Estimate in future years will include a provision of about £10,000 under this Subhead towards the cost of this programme. The tests will be starting immediately but for this year the contribution can be met by savings on other subheads of the Vote.</P>
    <P>Turning now to Subhead C.I&mdash; Acquisition of Land&mdash;it will be noted that provision has been made for an <Col N="794" /> increase of £50,000 under this head. The balance in the Grant-in-Aid Fund on 31st March, 1963 was £155,351 so that with the new grant of £320,000 sought there will be a total of £475,351 available for the purchase of land in 1963/64.  The House will recall that during 1962/63 I sought an additional sum of £135,000 in a Supplementary Estimate in order to be in a position to meet certain particularly large commitments then in hands.  In fact the more significant commitments in question had not matured by 31st March, and the money was, therefore, carried forward in the balance on the Grant-in-Aid Fund.  Apart even from these big cases there was some slowing-down in the progress of negotiations and title clearance work in the closing stages of 1962/63 because of the prolonged disruption of normal life in rural areas due to weather conditions.</P>
    <P>The gross total area acquired for State forestry purposes last year was 25,380 acres of which about 23,000 acres were plantable.  This was acquired in 528 separate transactions giving an average productive area of 43.5 acres per transaction compared with an average productive area of 45 acres in 1961/62, 51 acres in 1960/61 and 67 acres in 1959/60.  The progressive decline in the average size of acquisition to which I referred in previous years has, therefore, continued and inevitably added to the difficulties being encountered by my Department in its efforts to increase the plantable reserve.</P>
    <P>The effective plantable reserve on 1st April, 1962 was 51,600 acres.  The drain on this reserve to meet the 1962/63 planting programme was eased by the inclusion in the programme of some 1,700 acres of land formerly classified as unplantable and woodland cleared for replanting.  With the addition of the plantable area of 23,000 acres acquired in 1962/63 the effective reserve on the 1st April, 1963 was virtually unchanged.</P>
    <P>The overall plantable reserve position is still unsatisfactory and continues to give rise to management problems at many forest centres.  Until this position can be substantially improved the policy objective of stabilisation of local forest employment cannot be attained.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made <Col N="795" /> during the year in the advancement of difficult land acquisition cases being handled under the Forestry Act, 1956. Proceedings were brought to a successful conclusion in four cases involving an area of 2,725 acres.  These cases are all very troublesome and time-consuming. In a current total of 368 commonages cases in hands 3,353 separate interests were involved of which 2,829 were on offer to the Department. Despite the difficulties involved price agreement had been reached at 31st March, 1963 in 51 of these cases representing an area of 11,038 acres. Some of these cases can be brought to completion without the use of the 1956 Act procedure but 26 cases totalling 5,420 acres required Vesting Order procedure.</P>
    <P>In general, land acquisition prospects for the current year are good and the total of over £475,000 which, as I have explained, will be available this year is not unreasonably high in relation to the general tempo of progress.</P>
    <P>Subhead C. 2&mdash;Forest Development and Management&mdash;totals £2,687,650, an increase of £126,400 on the Estimate for 1962/63.  Expenditure on labour continues to account for the major part of expenditure under this subhead.  The labour provision for 1962/63 as adjusted by Supplementary Estimate was £2,011,000.  The corresponding provision in the 1963/64 Estimate is £2,080,500, an increase of £69,500 on the 1962/63 adjusted figure. The balance of the increase of £126,400 is spread over the non-labour heads.</P>
    <P>The provision for Head (1)&mdash;State Forest Nurseries&mdash;shows an increase of £5,000 on the provision for 1962/63. This is almost entirely accounted for by increased labour costs, the remaining costs being virtually unchanged.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the policy of converting to large scale nurseries three of the smaller nurseries were closed down during the year.  There are now nine large scale nurseries in production and it is expected that lands for another will be acquired shortly.  Further areas are being considered for acquisition. The provision of plants to meet <Col N="796" /> the planting programme will be much facilitated when the changeover is completed.</P>
    <P>Head (2)&mdash;Establishment of Plantations&mdash;covers all expenditure on fencing, ground preparation, drainage and planting of land, apart from mechanical work charged to Head (6). The provision for 1963/64 is £675,000, an increase of £43,000 on the provision for 1962/63.  £29,000 of the increase is in respect of increased labour costs. The remainder of the increase is mainly in respect of fencing materials and manures.</P>
    <P>The total area of new plantations established in 1962/63 was 24,400 acres in addition to the reforestation of 325 acres from which the original State plantations had been marketed.  425 acres of plantations destroyed by fire, etc., were replanted during the year.  I would like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the achievement of the Forestry Division in maintaining its reputation for completing its planting programme even in this past winter.  Deputies will scarcely need&mdash; or wish&mdash;to be reminded of the winter of 1962/63.  In many areas up to three months of the planting season were lost because the ground was frostbound and often snow covered so that planting was impossible.  There was a grave danger that the planting programme would be seriously curtailed. In the light of this the virtual completion of the 25,000-acre programme was an achievement reflecting the greatest credit on all concerned.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1962/63 the total woodland area held by my Department was 382,000 acres.  Of 371,000 acres of State plantations it is of interest to note that 144,000 acres were planted in the last 6 years.</P>
    <P>Planting is being continued at the rate of 25,000 acres this year.</P>
    <P>Once again the western counties with some 40 per cent of the overall programme of 25,000 acres will occupy a prominent place.  There has been a continuous intake of substantial areas of forest land in the western counties. Over 9,000 acres were acquired in western counties last year and almost half the lands at present being considered <Col N="797" /> for acquisition are situated in that area.  In pursuance of the policy of providing employment in this area where sources of productive employment are so badly needed, my Department is continuing its efforts to increase the pace of acquisition and planting there.  In addition the Department's extensive research work aimed at achieving afforestation on less fertile peat soils and under other difficult conditions encountered in western regions is continuing.</P>
    <P>At present employment is being provided for about 2,000 men in the area and the annual wage bill is in the neighbourhood of £800,000.</P>
    <P>Head (3)&mdash;New Roads and Buildings &mdash;provides for an increase of £27,750 compared with the estimate for 1962/63. £11,000 of this increase is in respect of the labour provision.  The remainder is in respect of increased provision for road materials and building.  The road construction programme last year was seriously affected by adverse weather conditions.  One hundred and seventy miles of road were, however, completed in the year. The provision for 1962/63 is adequate for the completion of 220 miles of roads.  Budgeted expenditure of £131,250 on road metalling materials will relate mainly to the supply of stones and gravel by contractors and thus includes a substantial sum for indirect employment.</P>
    <P>The provision for buildings is increased from £25,000 in 1962/63 to £35,000 in the current year.  This includes a provision of £5,500 for direct labour.</P>
    <P>Head (4)&mdash;General Forest Management &mdash; exceeds the provision for 1962/63 by £53,000, of which all but £7,000 is in respect of increased labour costs.  To this head are charged all the expenses of maintenance and protection of State plantations.  It is noteworthy that of the total provision of £958,000 under this head £921,000 is in respect of labour.  A pattern of regular annual increases under this head is normal.  The annual intake of new land and the present planting target of 25,000 acres inevitably involves increasing expenditure <Col N="798" /> on such work as cleaning of young plantations, repairs to fences, drains, roads and buildings, pruning and protection of plantations.</P>
    <P>The provision for Head (5)&mdash;Timber Conversion &mdash; is down by £30,000 compared with the 1962/63 provision. This is mainly due to an anticipated reduction in the availability of material suitable for transmission and telegraph poles.  As I have mentioned on previous occasions direct labour felling by my Department is mainly confined to the felling of special orders such as transmission poles for the ESB and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and to areas being thinned for the first time.  The bulk of forest produce continues to be sold standing to timber merchants who make their own arrangements for felling and extraction.</P>
    <P>Head (6)&mdash;Mechanical Equipment for Forest Development and Management &mdash; is £27,650 in excess of last year.  Of this £2,500 is in respect of increased labour costs, £5,000 is being provided for increased purchases of machinery and the balance is due to increased provision for running expenses and repairs.</P>
    <P>The sum provided for forest labour in 1963/64 is £2,098,000 against a provision of £2,028,500 in 1962/63 and an actual outturn of £1,993,000 for that year.  The current year's provision is, therefore, £165,000 in excess of the 1962/63 outturn.</P>
    <P>The average weekly number of men in the direct employment of my Department during 1962/63 was 4,663.  The figure of 4,663 is, however, not comparable with previous employment figures as the severest winter in living memory created particular problems of employment in the forests where in many areas for weeks on end men were unable to get to work and in others work was impossible due to the prevailing weather conditions.  Had the winter been normal, the employment pattern for the year would have differed only marginally from that of 1961/62, when the average employment level was 4,803.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for 1963-64 is adequate to cover an average direct employment level of up to 5,000 men and should, <Col N="799" /> therefore, be sufficient to meet all requirements for the year including the increased tempo of maintenance work.</P>
    <P>Before passing from the forest employment position, it may be of interest to the House to point out that while productivity gains under the Incentive Bonus Scheme have enabled a steadily increasing work-load over the past five years to be handled with little change in total labour absorption, there has been a very substantial increase in total outgoings on wages over the period, due to a succession of substantial rises in wage rates.  Total expenditure on forest labour in 1958-59 was £1.3 million.  The expenditure of over £2 million contemplated by the Estimate now before the House represents an increase of almost £750,000.</P>
    <P>That is a welcome boost to the local economy of the rural areas concerned in so far as it represents increased spending power which must have its effect on money circulation generally, but, unfortunately it also indicates a sharp rise in the cost of all forest operations.  Forestry costs are particularly sensitive to wage variation because of the high employment content of all Forest work.  It is reasonable to presume that in the long term rising timber prices will provide an offset but such a sharp rise in operating costs in a five-year period emphasises the need for the importance which the Department has been placing on the pursuit of maximum economy in production methods and costs.  In these fields steady progress is still being made.</P>
    <P>The total provision for receipts under Subhead G&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash; at £578,000 is £25,000 less than the revised provision for 1962-63.  Actual receipts for the latter year, however, amounted to £564,000 so that in fact we are budgeting for a slight increase over the level of receipts for 1962-63. Revenue from the minor heads, Sawmills, Rents and Miscellaneous is on much the same level as for the past few years but on the major head&mdash; Sales of Timber&mdash;the general tendency towards an expansion of income from sale of timber in both the sawlog and pulpwood categories has been largely <Col N="800" /> offset in 1962-63 and will be so again in the current year by the drop, to which I have already referred, in the availability of material suitable for conversion to transmission poles for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and ESB markets.  The market for timber of sawlog size has been generally good and there is every indication that the growing volume of material becoming available will find ready sale.  The range of outlets for pulpwood was increased during the past year by the commencement of production at the new chipboard factory at Waterford.  The total volume of material sold from State forests in 1962-63 was about 6¾ million cu. ft. of which 2½ million cu. ft. was of 8&rdquo; quarter girth and upwards.</P>
    <P>Turning finally to private forestry, the provision for Subhead D&mdash;Grants for Afforestation purposes&mdash;is the same as the revised figure for 1962/63. During last year, first instalment grants were sanctioned for newly established plantations totalling 1,307 acres.  Most of this planting would have been done in the 1961/62 planting season.  It is too soon to make more than a rough forecast of planting done in the 1962/63 season but I would not expect a substantial difference from the previous year's outturn.  The Department continued its efforts to promote private planting during the past year.  Extensive advertising of the Planting Grant Scheme was carried out and lectures on tree planting were given at seventeen Winter Farm School classes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The amount of planting carried out by private landowners has in recent years shown substantial improvement but I am satisfied that there is still room for considerable expansion in the private forestry sector.  Since 1958 over 3,000 landowners have availed themselves of the free technical advisory service operated by my Department for Landowners interested in laying down plantations on their farms.  This advisory service covers all aspects of the planting&mdash;ground preparation, fencing, species selection, planting techniques, etc.  Over 13,000 acres have been inspected since 1958 and detailed advice on planting furnished to the <Col N="801" /> owners but less than half that area has been planted so far.  I would again appeal to those landowners who have been given detailed advice on the establishment of plantations on their lands to put the work in hands and avail themselves of the generous assistance for which they can qualify when the plantation has been established.</P>
    <P>The current level of forest revenue at over £½ million a year is in itself an indication of the very considerable monetary value of our forests today. Total investment value of the State forests is now in excess of £40 million. That investment is something which we must all assist in safeguarding.  Our experience already in this calendar year has not been happy; in the 3 months ended on 31st March last almost 100 fires occurred at or near State forests and a total of 102 acres of plantation was destroyed.  Each member of the community can help to reduce this loss by promoting greater care in avoiding the risk of fire&mdash;the greatest threat to any forest's existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first Government of this State, from 1922 to 1932, must be complimented on their great foresight regarding forestry, particularly when we see in recent years that those engaged in the building trade have more than once expressed appreciation of the manner in which Irish timber was available for building and constructional purposes.</P>
      <P>We all realise that forestry does not yield an immediate financial return but it pays over a long period.  The trees planted during the first Government's time in office have now been used in the construction of many of our homes and industrial buildings and have contributed in no small way to the building programme.  It is a great satisfaction when a body such as the Master Builders' Association comment on the favourable quality of Irish timber which they say is superior to any imported timber for building purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that from 1932 to 1948 very little attention was paid to the expansion or development of State forests.  The development that has taken place recently, particularly <Col N="802" /> from 1948 on, is something for which we must give credit and pay tribute to the efficiency and skill of the foresters in the various centres throughout the country.  International recognition has been given to the high standard of our forestry experts.  It is only right on such an occasion as this that we should avail of the opportunity to express our appreciation of the excellent services of our foresters.</P>
    <P>We are glad that in recent years forestry training colleges were established having the most up-to-date technical advice.  I fully realise the excellent standard of those engaged in the training colleges and I am sure the Minister is aware that these colleges are turning out experts in forestry and the forests which we see in West Cork or Wicklow or in many parts of the Midlands, in Laois and Offaly and elsewhere, are a tribute to the training they have got, because of their magnificent lay-out.  That expression of appreciation is richly merited by these men.</P>
    <P>Expansion of forestry provides employment and where we have forestry centres much needed employment is given.  We already have 4,600 men engaged in forestry.  After 40 years of native Government, that figure is not very gratifying.  One would imagine that our forestry development would be able to carry something like 10,000 workers and the figure of 4,600 falls far short of the number which afforestation in general can carry.  I often wondered why there is not greater co-operation between Bord na Móna and the Forestry Division.  Bord na Móna employ large numbers of workers at seasonal periods, but we find at the end of those periods, there is no work for those workers in the district.  The work of Bord na Móna and the Forestry Division should be dovetailed so that when the slack period of Bord na Móna comes, those workers can be turned over to the Forestry Division. They could be engaged in drainage and the preparation of land for forestry purposes.  There must be a section of Bord na Móna who would be prepared to consider favourably co-operation with the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why work cannot <Col N="803" /> be commenced on the vast areas of bogland and cutaway bog in the west suitable for afforestation purposes. The idea is to have large forestry centres.  That may be necessary to enable the forestry centres to be run economically, but you may have vast areas of land not convenient to large forestry centres.  Afforestation in the west has not brought the results I should like to see.  Certain areas there should be selected for small initial schemes and land should be drained and prepared for experimental forestry work.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why there has not been an extensive scheme of afforestation in the Shannon Valley. Many years ago, we heard that the Forestry Division were examining the question of an extensive plantation there.  There are in the Shannon Valley large areas of land which, in the opinion of the experts, can be converted into suitable land for afforestation. The Forestry Division are slow in announcing their plans for the Shannon Valley.  Year after year, we see extensive flooding there.  In view of the fact that we have excellent drainage and afforestation experts, it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility to provide suitable plantations in the areas and thus relieve flooding.  Plantations have been carried out in Holland and the United States, and I feel the Forestry Division should pay special attention to the Shannon Valley.</P>
    <P>In addition to the great benefit it would bestow on the area, it would provide much needed employment for the workers of Roscommon, Galway, Westmeath and Offaly.  I would ask the Minister to let us know what progress has been made in that regard and whether there has been any discussion this year or any time concerning co-operation between his Department and Bord na Móna.  I recall that some years ago the Forestry Division were about to enter into negotiations with Bord na Móna to see if their various schemes could be dovetailed so far as employment was concerned.  I feel Bord na Móna and the Forestry <Col N="804" /> Division could work with a greater degree of co-operation.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to make a close examination of the prices paid to owners of land acquired for afforestation purposes.  Numerous persons throughout the country have offered land to the Forestry Division. During the lifetime of the inter-Party Government, an Act was passed enabling the Forestry Division to deal more quickly with questions of title. The Forestry Division are noted for not paying what we consider to be a proper price for land acquired for afforestation purposes.  It would encourage the owners of waste land to offer their land to the Forestry Division, if they could be assured of a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Division's estimate of the value of land does not coincide with the estimate of expert valuers.  The Forestry Division should seek the advice of qualified valuers in regard to the value of waste land, bog land and other land suitable for afforestation. There has been a great conflict of opinion between civil servants and qualified foresters and the views expressed by qualified valuers, whose job it is to value conscientiously and fairly. If the Forestry Division availed of the advice of qualified valuers, it would be to the benefit not alone of the landowners but eventually of the Department.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to the Forestry Division that in cases of dispute, where any doubt is expressed or where the landowner feels his case should be further considered, they should seek the advice of the local valuers, who know the value of land and who will express an honest opinion.  Land valuers have been noted for the conscientious manner in which they give their views.  That has been the experience in the Land Commission.  In many cases, they have been responsible for negotiating successfully in a spirit of co-operation and understanding. The land valuer has a certain amount of experience that neither the civil servant nor those engaged in the Forestry Division have.  I think more land would come the way of the <Col N="805" /> Forestry Division if valuers were employed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister again to bring the values of land for afforestation purposes to a more reasonable rate.  Land for agricultural purposes in any part of the country is fetching something like £130 an acre, while we have the Forestry Division still paying £5, £6 or £7 an acre, the same as they paid years ago.  The time has come when we should solicit the co-operation of landowners who have land they consider suitable for planting. Voluntary offers of land for afforestation have been on the Department's books for years, from my constituency and from outside it, and it is time now that these should be cleared out of the Department, acquired and efforts made to plant them.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to see that land suitable for agricultural purposes is not planted.  This should be the policy particularly in regard to land owned by smallholders, even when it is situated convenient to existing forests.  I know the Department have been exercising caution in this respect and I would ask them to continue this policy.  It is encouraging to see that both the ESB and the Post Office are buying poles from our forests.  The extent to which they are doing this is a tribute to those who have been in charge of our forests.  My hope is that these activities will continue and, in fact, be extended.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give us more definite information about the negotiations taking place in regard to the provision of adequate pension schemes for forestry workers.  We all know that representations have been made by the trade unions, and forestry workers in my constituency are still awaiting the outcome.  Forestry workers should be looked upon with special attention because they are a group of men who possess specialised knowledge.  A greater degree of security would serve to promote greater enthusiasm in these workers.</P>
    <P>It is high time that we launched a proper examination of the manner in which our timber by-products could be utilised.  Very little has been done <Col N="806" /> here in that regard&mdash;in fact, we are far behind other countries.  I suggest that a special committee be set up to report to the Minister on the uses we could make of our timber by-products. There should also be an examination of ways and means of encouraging private planting on a greater scale.  I recently attended a series of lectures given by Departmental experts on this subject.  I would ask the Minister again to re-examine this scheme of encouragement of private planting. Most landowners would be inclined to plant an acre or two, if they were given financial support.  If such support did not take the form of grants or bonuses, it would be given by way of relief of rates.</P>
    <P>The progress made in afforestation during the past year is in line with that reported in previous years and suggests that we must tackle afforestation in a more courageous manner. When criticising the Department, we must, however, bear in mind that it is very easy to plant trees on paper but very difficult to do so on land. Afforestation involves the preparation of the land and of suitable plants, the later thinning of the young forests.  If we are to tackle afforestation in the courageous way necessary, instead of employing 4,600 men, we need at least 10,000.  We are capable of extending our programme as we pointed out in the Fine Gael Party programme for afforestation and begun by the inter-Party Government.  A great need is the establishment of an organisation to market efficiently the products of Irish forests.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Estimate does not suggest any revolutionary changes in the immediate future.  He does not give us any hope that more men will be employed or that any greater acreage will be planted.  It is like many other Departments of State.  We should no longer be tinkering with afforestation.  Let us get ahead and spend more lavishly than we have done in the past.  Afforestation can serve the rural community as a means of providing employment.  State forests beautify the countryside. Deputies who have seen our State forests will agree that they are among <Col N="807" /> the best laid out in the world. I have already complimented those responsible for them.</P>
    <P>There is room for considerable expansion in the afforestation drive. The Government are not dealing with this matter as seriously as they might. The Minister referred this evening to the changes envisaged in the new Land Bill.  The time has come for recasting of legislation in relation to forestry, for drastic action and the setting up of efficient machinery to carry out the work.  I agree that the last Bill in relation to forestry helped to simplify the acquisition of land for forestry purposes but it did not go far enough. There should be an all-out drive to double the numbers employed in forestry.  As I have pointed out, and as the Minister agrees, afforestation will not give a return within a year or even five years of the expenditure of the money but will certainly repay that expenditure with very considerable dividends within 15 or 20 years. We should embark on an extensive programme of afforestation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>While I must agree that there has been continued progress in forestry over the last number of years and, according to the Estimate before us, it is proposed that afforestation should continue in the coming year at the same rate, nevertheless there are a number of aspects of the forestry programme on which I have to make critical comment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the fact that the amount of land available for forestry is becoming scarcer and harder to get.  That is bound to be the case.  As years go on, the availability of land must become a problem.  That being the case, why is it that sales have not been completed in so many cases where lands have been surveyed and negotiations have taken place for acquisition?  There would appear to be a contradiction in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, there may be a group of small farms consisting of marginal land.  Each smallholder may have ten to 20 acres of such land which in all would represent a considerable acreage. If there is a long delay before <Col N="808" /> acquisition takes place and if the farmers need money badly enough, the tendency is to sell the land privately and then the Forestry Division may say that the amount of land left would not be sufficient to warrant their acquiring it and they drop the scheme or the landowners become disinterested in selling.</P>
    <P>I have in mind one holding beside an existing forest.  A number of neighbouring landholders have agreed to sell portions of land.  The persons concerned are anxious to dispose of the land for two reasons&mdash;first, because, like everybody else at the present time, they require ready cash; and, secondly, because of the fact that some of them are employed in the forests and feel it would safeguard their employment if this extra land were taken over.  For some extraordinary reason the sale has not been completed.  The persons concerned should be told definitely whether or not it is the intention of the Forestry Division to acquire this land. There may be a very good reason for the delay but it is unfair that the persons concerned should be left in that position.</P>
    <P>The question of the amount being paid for land suitable for forestry is a matter of some concern.  I agree that there is land such as the Minister referred to to-night, the poor law valuation of which is 2d. an acre.  Usually that type of land is not suitable for forestry purposes.  Even those whose land is of a low valuation do not like to give it away for nothing.  There is a tendency on the part of the people negotiating the purchase of such land to say that it is very bad land which does not command a high price.  I am aware of land taken over by the Forestry Division which was derelict and grown with rushes but when the rushes were taken off, it became apparent that wheat had been grown on that land many years ago.  Elderly people in the area remembered that good crops of wheat had been taken off that land.  It is rather ridiculous that a very small sum should be offered for such land, even though it may not be suitable for anything other than the growing of trees.</P>
    <P>The question of private planting has <Col N="809" /> been referred to. That is one of my favourite topics.  In my opinion, not half enough is being done to encourage private planting.  I do not blame the Forestry Division for that.  Every public representative and every body having contact with the general public, including the Press, the Churches, and so on, should encourage private planting. I am not referring to the planting of two or three or even 20 acres.  I am talking about the person who has perhaps a quarter- or half-acre of bad land on his farm who could plant trees on it and eventually it would be a source of income for his family.  That land would be effectively drained and would become good land and there would be a good return from the trees.</P>
    <P>I recounted last year that in Central Europe it is quite a common thing that when a child is born, especially in the case of a girl, the farmer plants an acre of trees.  By the time the girl is 21, she has an excellent dowry.  It might solve many of our problems if such a practice were encouraged here. Small farmers and medium size farmers should be encouraged to grow trees on the portion of their farm which at present is lying idle.</P>
    <P>Tribute has been paid here to those who work for the Forestry Division for the fact that during the bad weather they were unable to travel to their work or to carry out the work when they did travel and yet, despite that, production for the year was up to par. That is an excellent thing and a great tribute to the people concerned, both the technical and labouring staff.  It is rather a pity that the people who were actually planting the trees&mdash;it is something that I feel sore about&mdash;did not get very much for their extra effort.  It is all right for people who are employed in a certain position and are guaranteed a full week's wages or month's wages all the year round and who will carry out their work in a certain way.  In the case of forestry labourers and the people directly over them who up to now have been regarded as casuals, irrespective of how hard they work, they get their week's wages only when they work and they get their bonus.</P>
    <P>I should like again to say how glad <Col N="810" /> I am the bonus scheme has worked well with the co-operation of the workers, the trade unions and the Forestry Division.  Despite that, when we had wet or frosty weather, and when we had snow, those people got neither wages nor a bonus.  The excuse was made that they were laid off because of the fact that they could sign on at the labour exchange, and by signing on, get some money.  I do not think that is the proper way to deal with labourers without whom the Forestry Division could not carry on.  The Forestry Division should realise that as well as the Minister and his senior and junior officials getting salaries, the people who work for them outside are also entitled to a fair deal.  It is no use saying they are only labourers and can go to the labour exchange, sign on, and get a few shillings.  That is what happened in many cases.  I know they turned out as much work as they normally would in a whole year.  Great credit is due to them.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the working hours of those people.  Negotiations have been going on for a long time on their behalf seeking a 5-day working week.  The Department offered a 48-hour 5-day week.  That could not work because it would mean they would have to work a 9½-hour day. As we all know, during the winter period it is not possible to work anything like a 48-hour week, and the men have been working slightly over a 40-hour week during the winter period.  As a result of a Labour Court recommendation, local authority employees have been working a 5-day, 45-hour week for almost two years. This year an innovation, which I recommend to the Forestry Division, has been introduced.  It is known as an average 45-hour, 5-day week.  In the summer time the men work longer than the normal 45 hours, and in the winter they work whatever time is required to ensure that over the year they are credited with 45 hours a week. That is a very fair way and, in fact, the Forestry Division would gain on the transaction if they were prepared to agree with it.  I suggest the Minister should have a look at it with his officials and they might be able to agree <Col N="811" /> to put it into operation.  If they do, it would solve this whole burning problem.</P>
    <P>For some time, it has been a question of what we call holding the line. Government Departments generally try to hold the line but it has been bulging in many cases now and it will break somewhere.  There is a break in some Government Departments but, of course, the blind eye is turned on it.  If members of the building trade or craft unions are employed by any Government Department there is no objection whatever to their working a 45-hour, 5-day week.  If labourers are recruited from men who ordinarily work a 48-hour week they are put on the 45-hour, 5-day week, but as soon as they go back to the other job they become a different race and must work the 48-hour, 5½-day week. Let us forget about the White Paper and any other paper.  This matter must be dealt with and the men should be dealt with fairly.</P>
    <P>The pension scheme was mentioned by the previous speaker.  I know well that the answer of the Forestry Division officials and the Minister is that they are casual workers and you cannot have a pension scheme for them. That is the stock answer, but employees of the Department of Local Government and of the county councils are also casual workers on a day to day basis, and they work a pension scheme.  There is a very simple way of dealing with it.  I suggest again that the Minister should have another look at the scheme which is being operated.  It would give some security to the forestry workers.</P>
    <P>Another question that is causing a lot of trouble is the question of the man who is out sick.  If he is a local authority employee, he gets sick pay. He gets the difference between his social welfare benefits and his wages for two weeks, and something less for the next two weeks.  In some counties, he gets more.  Surely it is not too much to ask the Forestry Division to do something like that and to stretch the purse to do it.  They do not do it.  If a man has been out as a result of an <Col N="812" /> accident or an illness and, if as a result, in the 12 months he completes less than 1,600 hours, the Department of Lands will not give him any holiday pay.  That is stretching things a bit too far.  It is a mean trick to play on anyone.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there will be red faces in the Department because of this matter being raised here, but if there are not there should be, because everyone else in employment get their holiday pay except employees of the Department of Lands.  They do not get it.  I know that the Act will probably be thrown back at me and I will be told that the Act says they must work 1,600 hours in a whole year. They could dismiss them and give them cesser pay, but if they are not dismissed they do not get it.  In every other Department, and in private employment, if a man is out sick, he certainly is not penalised by losing his holiday pay.  It is coming the hound a bit to say these people must qualify for their holiday pay by working 1,600 hours in a year.</P>
    <P>When the bonus scheme was first introduced, it was tried in one forest, then another, and eventually it was extended.  Arrangements were made, not verbally, but in writing, between the trade unions and the Forestry Division, that, when the bonus system had extended to all forests, a wages tribunal would be set up.  If my memory serves me correctly, the bonus system came into operation in the last forest two years ago last February, and we have not yet got a wages tribunal.  I understand there is something called an inter-Departmental Committee which is taking an interest and has so far stymied any effort made to set up that tribunal by saying that if the forestry workers got it other Departments would also look for one. I see no reason at all why one should not be set up to deal with Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The forestry workers, like other employees of the Department of Local Government are the only people in the country who have no right to a tribunal on the question of wages. Local government employees have been <Col N="813" /> brought in as a result of the 1956 Act. We have been claiming on the trade union side that wages and conditions of employment were to be discussed by the tribunal although, strictly speaking, the agreement is on wages only.  I believe I could prove that you cannot discuss wages without discussing hours of work and other conditions. It is reasonable to say that, even though the agreement says wages only, if the tribunal is set up, it must, of necessity, deal with all matters which would affect wages.</P>
    <P>Would I be asking too much of the Minister if I ask him to look into this matter and honour the agreement which was made in good faith and accepted in good faith by the Department and by the trade unions so many years ago?  We are not asking for something which will put the Department to a great deal of expense.  As a matter of fact, I think it will be found that wages will follow a certain pattern.  However, these workers are entitled to have some way of settling their wage claims.</P>
    <P>There was a long drawn out battle over wages in a couple of sawmills and that was straightened out eventually. There was a long drawn out battle about a man who carries a saw into the forest.  It is a heavy saw and he gets a couple of pence a day extra for carrying it around.  By the time the forestry officials had discussed it with the trade unions and the Minister, and they made a recommendation to him and it went back again to the Department of Finance, months and months passed by.  It is one of those stupid things that should not be allowed to continue.  This is a progressive Department. The Forestry Division have proved in every other way they are all in favour of progress and the Minister has given it his full backing, but this question of wages should be dealt with in a proper way, and it could be so dealt with without upsetting things too much.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the question of continuity of employment. Since the Department are progressive, they must make changes, and one of the changes they have been <Col N="814" /> making recently is in regard to the nursery system.  While it is stated they have been a success, it is just too bad for people who have been employed a long number of years and who have become experts at their job to find that because the Department changed the system, they are out of a job.</P>
    <P>I referred today to Mulroy Forest which is in the constituency of the Minister for Local Government.  I hope it did not embarrass him to be sitting beside the Minister when the question was answered. Deputy Harte is in the same constituency but these people had written to me as the general secretary of their trade union saying that a number of workers had been let go and that the nursery is to be closed down completely in the near future.  The Minister's reply today confirmed this fact.  The Minister said the Department have always tried to find employment for people they displace, and I agree that is so. Nevertheless, there is a fear, a very real fear, that when the forest nursery closes, there will not be employment near enough to those people.  They may be in an area where employment is not easy to get and may be out of a job. More consideration should be given to the effect on local employees when such changes are being made rather than to say: &ldquo;This is in the best interests of the country and, therefore, we must do it irrespective of who is affected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the things we must bear in mind is that forestry work is productive work. When employment is discussed or the means of giving employment to people, we often hear it said that the work they are doing is not productive and that is used as an argument why it should not be continued. Forestry work is productive work but, in addition, in areas such as Mulroy in areas west of the Shannon referred to here tonight, it is also, as I am sure Deputy Geoghegan will agree, a social benefit because the people who are employed there, as well as doing a good job are actually improving the whole area by virtue of the fact that they are spending their earnings in that area. I am sure that is not being lost sight of, and the fact that so much of <Col N="815" /> the forestry work is being done in Connacht and in such areas where there is not much other employment proves that the Department are well aware of the situation, but I wonder if something more cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to the situation in bog areas where Bord na Móna lay off a number of people at the end of the season and, according as the bogs become more mechanised, the number of men who are laid off becomes greater.  Could some arrangement not be made with Bord na Móna whereby some of the marginal areas around the bogs, cut-away portions of those bogs which have been partly reclaimed and left there, could be taken over and used for forestry purposes? I know that difficulties might arise from people being transferred from semi-State employment to State employment and from the fact that the Bord na Móna people now have a pension scheme, although I hope the Forestry Division, if they ever introduce a pension scheme, will not follow that pattern.  I am sure arrangements could be made that the Forestry Division could give the necessary technical advice and that Bord na Móna could carry out the work there themselves. I suggest that the Minister would give serious consideration to that.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the ESB and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were to be complimented on using Irish timber for poles.  I do not think there is any compliment due to them.  In fact, they should be blamed for not doing it many years earlier because if you go to any country in the world where those poles are being put up, it does not matter whether they are crooked or twisted, native timber will be used. Until very recently, it was the practice here that nothing less than Norwegian or Finnish timber was any use for our telegraph or ESB poles.  It was about time that those responsible woke up to the fact that we have timber suitable for this work.  The only thing I cannot understand is that the Minister says the supply of certain types of timber seems to be reducing. One would imagine that the opposite <Col N="816" /> should be the case, that the supply would be bound to increase as more timber matures over the years but again possibly there is a technical reason for that which I do not understand.</P>
    <P>The use of native timber for housing has also been referred to and, while it is very good that every effort should be made to use native timber, there should be a proviso that only properly seasoned Irish timber will be allowed in any building.  I am sure most of us have had experience of timber being used which was not seasoned when put into the roof, the doors or the window frames of houses, with disastrous results. People handling timber should have a very strict rule laid down for them that only timber which has been treated properly and dried properly will be used for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The question of having native industries based on Irish timber is also important. In my own constituency, there are a number of small sawmills which are depending on what they get from the forests to carry on.  If at all possible, I should like to see every concession given to those people because, as well as using up the products of the forests, they are giving local employment.  It does happen that from time to time supplies run out and they have to travel very long distances to get supplies from other forests.  Every effort should be made to facilitate those people.</P>
    <P>With reference to employment, there is one bone of contention which most outdoor employees of the Forestry Division have and that is in relation to income tax.  Particularly since the bonus system was introduced quite a number have to pay income tax.  I can see no reason, nor can they, why income tax cannot be collected from them weekly.  Many people will be surprised to hear that while PAYE applies to practically everyone those people pay the same rate but the tax is not collected weekly and very often coming to the end of the year they get a nasty jolt when they are informed that the income tax has fallen due and, therefore, the next week's wages must be short of a considerable amount of money.</P>

      <P>Forestry workers are having income tax deducted as it was being deducted from other people before the introduction of PAYE.  I would be grateful if the Minister would pass along the word to whoever is responsible and ask that the deductions be made every week as in the case of every other employee who pays under PAYE.  Another matter referred to is the grave loss caused to the Forestry Division through forest fires.  We all deplore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the action of the person who lights a fire near a forest and who leaves it without making sure that it is out, or the person who throws bottles, particularly broken bottles, into a forest.  Having regard to the weather we have been enjoying, it is extraordinary that we have not had more forest fires caused by the sun's rays on these broken bottles.  To a certain extent I blame the Forestry <Col N="818" /> Division because while they have a nominal fire service and have fire watchers who do a nominal amount of patrolling, I think, in view of the loss caused by the destruction of even a couple of acres of forestry, they could usefully spend a considerable amount of money employing firewatchers during the particularly dangerous season.  More attention should be given to the combating of fires when they occur because it may not be much use telephoning a fire brigade which is located in a town 20 miles away.  It should be possible to have in every forest some type of mobile unit which could deal with a smaller type of fire.  It is no use attacking a fire with a bush or with the back of a shovel.  More attention should be given to training people to put out fires.</P>
      <P>I would recommend the Minister to have a greater number of firewatchers. Over the whole year there would be a net gain.  If he succeeded in stopping half the fires which occur the gain would be considerable.  Reference has been made also to an increase which has resulted from higher travelling expenses.  I agree that it is only right that they should be kept in line with other workers and officials.  They are entitled to the same expenses as everybody else is getting and we must provide for them.  I find great pleasure in dealing with the Department of Lands.  Despite the fact that on many occasions they may say no usually they say it politely.  They will at least discuss matters fully and while we complain that we have not got the results we were looking for, nevertheless, our dealings with the officials have been cordial.  They are courteous people who deal with the public as best they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of workmen's compensation which has arisen again and again is the question of a worker who is injured when working in a forest.  He is entitled to workmen's compensation. Usually he has to go to the doctor and in too many cases the question of the doctor's fees has to be taken up with the trade unions before the bill is paid.  While eventually they are paid they should be straightened out immediately.  There is a limit of <Col N="819" /> £5 and usually the doctor's bill comes to much less.  While it may be a very small amount to the Department of Lands it is a considerable sum to a forestry worker, particularly if he is out on workmen's compensation at the rate of £4 10s. for a number of weeks.  The matter should be dealt with as quickly as possible and embarrassment should not be caused to everybody concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the employer was not liable for it unless agreement had been recorded for the £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but if the Department wanted it that way the easiest thing to do is consult a solicitor and have the solicitor's fees added to the £5. Usually the employers are clever enough, and that includes the Department of Lands, to pay the original bill rather than have that happen.  I know that legal people like to see agreement recorded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In court.  If a solicitor takes the matter up with the Department and there is agreement recorded, <Col N="820" /> then the £5 can be paid within the law but usually most companies as well as private employers take the easy way out and pay without going into court. Otherwise, they would have to pay much more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But if he does not agree to pay it, then there is no doubt it can be recorded.  The accident occurred in his employment and the person is liable to pay and he can take the matter to court and have extra expense.  The private employer and the Government Department usually pay without going to court.</P>
