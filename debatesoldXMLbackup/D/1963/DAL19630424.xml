      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in view of the fact that records of insurance contributions paid previous to 1947 seem in many cases to be unavailable in his Department, he will state the type of evidence which will be acceptable to his Department with a view to proving that insurance contributions were actually paid in the case of applicants for old age (contributory) pensions who were in insurable employment, and who paid insurance contributions previous to 1947, or previous to the dates in the records of his Department of the payment of such contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>When Cumann an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte was set up under the National Health Insurance Act, 1933, the insurance records of existing members of approved societies were taken over to form the basis of the new records. These records, expanded over the years to cover new members, were used in framing the new Social Insurance records under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>My Department's records of National Health Insurance are complete except, in some respects, for insurances before 1932 and also for periods where stamped insurance cards were not surrendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very few claims to old age (contributory) pension are affected by these <Col N="236" /> deficiencies and no claim is rejected merely because there is no insurance record or the record is deficient.

      <P>For the conservation of our valuable lobster stocks, I recently made an order declaring a new minimum size limit from the beginning of next month and I appealed for the full co-operation of fishermen in its application. I issued a statement in the matter a couple of weeks ago and perhaps I might quote an extract explaining that I am advised against making an order on the lines indicated in the question:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before the new order was made, special consideration was given to the question of prohibiting the taking of `berried' lobsters, i.e. female lobsters on which eggs are visible. The conclusion reached, however, was that it would be more effective to enforce a size limit which would permit of spawning, adequate for maintenance of the stocks, to take place before the lobsters attain that size. The removal of berried lobsters above that size should then have no adverse effect on the stocks. Every female lobster is a potential berried lobster and there would be little advantage in prohibiting the taking of a lobster which could be legally taken before becoming berried.&rdquo;</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="245" />
      <Col N="246" /> TABLE showing number of children in each of the 48 industrial schools in the State on 31st December, 1962, the number of primary teachers on the staff and the amount of capitation maintenance grant paid by the State to each school in the last financial year.</P>
    <P>NOTE: (i) In 19 out of the 48 industrial schools, instruction in primary education is given on the premises. In the remainder, the children attend local national schools. The statistics in column (3) relate to the former category.</P>
    <P>(ii) The rate of capitation maintenance grant is 45/- per week shared equally by the State and the local authorities. Capitation maintenance grants paid to the schools by the local authorities approximate to the figures shown in column (4) for the same period.</P>

      <P>The maintenance of national schools, apart from painting, is a matter for the managers.  Grants of up to two-thirds of the cost of internal and external painting are available from the Department provided that all other works of maintenance have been properly carried out. This grants scheme came into operation on 1st April, 1962.</P>

      <P>The persons mentioned are under 70 years of age and it was necessary to have them medically examined, as a condition for the award of a special allowance in such a case is that the applicant be incapable of self-support by reason of permanent infirmity of body or mind.  In one case (Denis Bowen) this condition was not fulfilled and consequently the question of an award does not arise.  In the other case (John Collins) the applicant fulfilled the condition and an award has been made to him as from 16 Aibreán, 1963.</P>
      <P>Mr. Collins's application was received in my Department on 19 Eanáir, 1963.  In accordance with the prescribed procedure, it was necessary to obtain a report on his means and also as already stated, to have him medically examined.  He was unable to come to Oispedéal Bricin for examination when called, and a Pensions Medical Officer had then to be appointed to examine him locally.  In the circumstances, there was no avoidable delay in disposing of the case.</P>

By 8th December, 1962, he had been an inmate of the Mercy Hospital, Cork, for some six weeks.  He was in the North Infirmary, Cork, from January to 25th March, 1963.

When it was decided to dispose of these aircraft, tender forms were issued to all persons who had, over the past few years, made inquiries as to the possibility of the purchase of such aircraft.  Over 90 tender forms have been issued to date.  The latest date for the return of tender forms is 10 Meitheamh, 1963.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice what is the present strength of the Garda in Dublin; and if he is aware of the need to increase the number of Gardaí in order to combat the number of cases of housebreaking, vandalism and rowdyism and to provide more effective traffic control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The nominal strength of the Garda Síochána in the Dublin Metropolitan Division is 1,775.  Actual strength fluctuates almost from day to day and may be a little above or below that figure depending on retirements <Col N="257" /> and allocation of recruits at the end of their training.  The present actual strength is 1,761 but 20 recruit-Gardaí are to be allocated to the Division next week.</P>
      <P>The present strength of the Force in Dublin is, roughly, 200 higher than it was four or five years ago and, in addition, the number of cars and motor-cycles, including radio-equipped cars, at their disposal has been almost doubled.  While the crime figures for the year ended 30th September last show an upward trend in housebreakings and similar offences, the figures are very much lower than they were in the years 1957 to 1959. Furthermore the detection rate is now well over 70 per cent, and is nearly 10 per cent higher than it was in 1959.</P>
      <P>There is another Question on the Order Paper dealing specifically with vandalism and I shall, therefore, be making a separate statement on that matter.</P>
      <P>The question whether additional members may be needed in connection with traffic control cannot be answered until the Force have experience of the enforcement of the law with the additional powers of enforcement which were given to them by the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  These powers did not become effective in Dublin until the 1st April and their effect in terms of manpower requirements cannot be estimated for some time yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Malicious damage to property is, of course, a criminal offence, and, like all other crimes, is a matter for police action.</P>
      <P>Legally, malicious damage is either an indictable or a summary offence depending on whether the damage caused does or does not exceed £50. In the six months ended 31st March the number of such indictable offences in the Dublin Metropolitan Division was 12, in all of which detections were made.  In the previous year, out of seven cases, five detections were made. The same pattern of a very high detection rate obtained in previous years.</P>
      <P>As regards non-indictable offences, the figures of crimes reported include such matters as damage to electric light bulbs, to fittings in cinemas, to display cases outside shop windows, etc. and, obviously, detections are extremely difficult unless the offenders are caught in the act either by the police or by some other person willing to give evidence.  The figures for this type of crime have regrettably been increasing in recent years though the figures for the last six months in the Dublin Metropolitan Division are, as it happens, proportionately a little lower than in the preceding year.  Every possible effort is being made to deal with the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to the House that this disastrous Budget not only has in it grievous and inevitable consequences for the country but is itself evidence not merely of the irresponsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands to which I propose to refer in some detail later, but evidence also of the complete confusion of mind that has descended on the Government.  Heretofore, the Government have professed to base their policy for economic expansion very largely on what is commonly known as the &ldquo;Grey Book&rdquo; and their own pronouncements from time to time arising therefrom.  In the Grey Book, ordinarily known as <i>Economic Development,</i> Mr. Whitaker is on record as saying that a general purchase tax would have an immediate reaction on sales of Irish products and probably in the end would have an inflationary effect on wages and salaries and the cost of living.</P>
      <P>The Government in their White Paper two years ago on direct taxation said the introduction of a purchase tax, as recommended by the Income Tax Commission, bringing in about £6 million a year would be socially undesirable.  If employed as a partial substitute for income tax, its economic effects might also be adverse.  The prices of taxed goods would be increased and, through compensatory raising of money incomes, costs might be increased and the competitive capacity affected, with risk to export and employment.  That was their view two years ago of a sales tax designed to offset a substantial reduction in income tax.  But the proposal now before the House is for a sales tax with the full maintenance of income tax and a substantial increase in corporation profits tax.</P>
      <P>I have a more recent quotation. This is Deputy Lenihan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, speaking in his constituency as reported in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of March 23, 1963:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> Mr. Lenihan in his address stressed the necessity of every member of the cumann having the arguments and policy of the Party at his fingertips to meet the criticism which was bound to come.  He said that in the next few weeks and months, the Budget would be the main topic of conversation and he wished the members of the cumann to have all the facts at their fingertips.  There would be no increase on those items which were already perhaps overtaxed, items such as beer, cigarettes, petrol, spirits and so on.  The increases would be on luxury goods and semi-luxury goods such as jewellery, furs and expensive motor cars, and these items were already taxed in Britain and on the Continent. The increases would go towards increasing agricultural grants, tourism and other things, including vocational education, which was very important in this day and age. The taxes, he assured the meeting, were being imposed on luxurious and semi-luxurious goods.  There was increased expenditure, but he had no objection to spending money so long as it was being spent on the economic development of the country. They could not tax agriculture or industry any more, and the tax was being put on these luxury items that were already taxed elsewhere. Mr. Lenihan said he was telling the members these things so that they could act as propagandists for the Party.  They would meet criticism but he wanted them to remember that most, the vast majority, of the people from whom criticism would come were anti-national.</P>
    <P>The purchase tax which it is proposed to impose in this Budget covers, it is true, furs, jewellery and expensive motor cars, but it also covers perambulators, butter, boots, tobacco, spirits and everything else anyone has to buy.  In case the Parliamentary Secretary finds some difficulty in returning to the Boyle comhairle ceanntair, I should like to give him this assistance.  Boyle comhairle ceanntair are entitled now to know that, in addition to the furs, the jewels and the expensive motor cars, they will <Col N="266" /> be required to pay a tax on prams, to pay 1½d. per lb. on tea, 1/- on a pair of shoes, a penny on a lb. of butter, a 1½d. on a gallon of petrol, a penny on a glass of whiskey, a penny on a packet of cigarettes and a penny on the plug of tobacco.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable illustration of the confused mind which seems to have descended on Fianna Fáil and which is typical of the gambler who has plunged pretty heavily already and determines he is now prepared to let the tail go with the hide in one mighty effort.  I always remember the story of Joe Lee, the old bookmaker.  He once told a friend of mine that he was laying wagers at Aintree racecourse when a man asked him what his price was for a particular horse. He said &ldquo;40 to one.&rdquo;  The man asked: &ldquo;How much will you take about it?&rdquo; and he replied, &ldquo;More than you can afford to lay.&rdquo;  The man handed him £10,000 in notes.  And he paid the bet, because the horse won.  Joe Lee was asked what was the explanation of a man of such poor attire and aspect being in a position to lay such a wager. He said it was the man's last wager, that if that money filched from the till did not come home, they would have found him in the Mersey.  He was one of the very few lucky ones.</P>
    <P>That is the road we are travelling now. We are engaged in an unparalleled gamble, but what concerns me is that the gambler does not seem to have control of the direction in which he is travelling.  We are committed in the OECD to collaborating with our fellow members there to attempt a 50 per cent. expansion in our gross national product in the decade from 1960 to 1970.  Half of that decade is gone.  During the first half of that decade, the expansion in the gross national product in certain countries in OECD fell short of the annual increase requisite to achieve the goal. Countries as powerful and as great as the United States of America and the United Kingdom, faced with that situation, came to the conclusion that the burden of taxation must be lightened if industry and business were to have a chance of providing the expansion requisite to play their <Col N="267" /> part in achieving the common goal. We are all aware that the Federal Government of the United States at present have proposals before the legislature of that country for an immense relief of taxation.  We are all aware that Mr. Maudling, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the British House of Commons introduced a Budget recently designed to give vast relief to the tax-paying public, individual and business, and very large additional reliefs to stimulate output there.</P>
    <P>In this country, having gone on record in 1961 as saying that a purchase tax, or a substantial increase in direct taxation such as provided for here in the extravagant increase in the corporation profits tax, was inimical to expansion, we find ourselves in 1963 making our contribution to the common target of an expansion of 50 per cent of the gross national product by levying the very two taxes which it was stated only two years ago were absolutely fatal to any prospect of achieving that objective which we have internationally committed ourselves to seek.  What are we to say of a Government who in 1963 do exactly what they declared it would be inexpedient to do in 1961 when junior members of that Government were prancing around the country and assuring their constituents less than a month ago that whatever else would happen, the Government of which they were members would introduce no proposals for a general increase in prices such as is now provided in the Government Budget Resolutions?</P>
    <P>It is time to ask ourselves who is right: the Governments who believe that, to secure a general measure of expansion in the gross national product, it is requisite to reduce taxation, or our Government, professing to have the same end, who introduce in this Budget proposals for an increase of £12 million per annum, an increase of nine per cent in the total taxation burden on our people which I believe must come closely to a record in the history of this State.</P>
    <P>That is not the only record to which this Government can lay legitimate <Col N="268" /> claim.  This Government have it to tell that for the first time in the history of this country, the London County Council is now in a position to tell us that five per cent of the population of Greater London were born in Ireland. There are, after seven years of Fianna Fáil Government, more Irish-born people living in Greater London than in the entire province of Connacht. That, I believe, is an historical record. I do not believe that could be matched immediately after the Famine.  The cost of living has reached the highest level ever recorded since statistics were first kept.  When Fianna Fáil first came into office, the index figure was 135.  It stands today at 160 and as we all know, when the provisions of this Budget begin to operate&mdash;if they ever do, if the people ever allow them to&mdash; it will go higher.  That was confidently forecast both in Mr. Whitaker's volume <i>Economic Development</i> and in the Government's comment in the White Paper on Direct Taxation when they foresaw that the application of such a tax measure as this would result in a substantial increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Our adverse trade balance for the first time in the history of this country is now substantially in excess of £100 million per annum and the national debt stands at substantially more than £500 million.  Both of these are records never before established since this State was founded.  Government expenditure this year is a record for all time and the taxation it is proposed to raise under the proposals submitted by the Minister for Finance in a full year is greater than has ever been suggested by any Minister for Finance since the State was founded. Local rates payable by the ratepayers of this country&mdash;and I am not talking about local expenditure which includes a Government contribution; I am talking about local rates levied on the ratepayer and paid by him&mdash;stand at the highest figure ever established since the Local Government Act of 1898 was passed.</P>
    <P>The deficit on the current Budget is £4,857,000 and that is all in the context of the fact that our imports are steadily rising and our exports are <Col N="269" /> declining.  Not only is that true but the rate of increase in the gross national product at constant market prices is steadily declining.  The increase in 1959 was 4.9; in 1960, it was 5.9; in 1961, it was 3.8; and in 1962, it had declined to 2.5.  If these facts do not give the Government pause, then I suggest this Government are no longer fit to govern this country and ought to get out.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when he was Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce in the previous Government, with the full authority of that position and when appealing to be returned to office, solemnly declared to the people that he had a plan in his hand which if he were given a chance to implement it, would produce 100,000 jobs for our people.  Largely on that representation, the present Government took office and I ask the House to note this astonishing fact: seven years after that undertaking was given, for the greater portion of which Fianna Fáil enjoyed a clear majority in Dáil Éireann&mdash;which they do not do now&mdash;there are 58,500 fewer people at work in Ireland in 1963 than there were on the day the Taoiseach gave his undertaking to provide 100,000 new jobs.  There are 58,500 fewer people working in Ireland than there were then.</P>
    <P>Did anyone in this country, or in Clery's Ballroom, or at any of the byelection meetings at which he spoke, believe that when he gave that undertaking to provide 100,000 new jobs, he meant that the 100,000 jobs would be in London, Birmingham and Glasgow? Because that is what happened.  Since those words were uttered, nearly 300,000 of our people between the ages of 18 and 30 years have emigrated from this country to the industrial cities of England.  They form a large part of the five per cent of the population of Greater London to-day but they are to be found in every other industrial city in England and Scotland.</P>
    <P>We are told by Fianna Fáil to-day that they rejoice in the fact that the rate of emigration is going down.  If they knew rural Ireland, they would realise that it must go down, unless <Col N="270" /> they are prepared to provide perambulators and bathchairs to take the emigrants out.  Three hundred thousand have gone.  Where would we be in this country to-day if the 300,000 had stayed at home?  We tried to keep them at home.  We would have over 300,000 unemployed.  Is that a record of which any Government in this country can be proud and is that a situation which the proposals in this Budget will make any contribution to resolve?  Not if we accept the view expressed by the Government themselves in their own White Paper and adopted by the Government in their approbation of Mr. Whitaker's <i>Economic Development</i>, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Naturally, attention was largely concentrated yesterday on the proposal to tax everything, not only furs and jewellery and expensive motor cars but everything&mdash;everything that anyone has to buy.</P>

I want to warn the House that that increase in corporation profits tax strikes at the very foundation of our hopes for expanded production in this country and it is one of these irresponsible things of which a Government may be guilty because they think that the bulk of the people will not appreciate or understand the significance of what is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider what the situation is.  A small company, providing employment, whose profit is less than £2,500 a year heretofore paid no corporation profits tax.  It paid its income tax and then, if it was sensibly managed, it distributed one-half or less than one-half of its profits in dividends and it <Col N="271" /> ploughed the other half back and that other half went to keep the equipment and business up-to-date and equal to the increasing demands of competition. Today, that company will be faced with the fact that it has to pay income tax on its profits and then pay £100 corporation profits tax.  A company that earns £20,000 a year will now pay £3,000 corporation profits tax, after it has paid income tax on its profits.  A company that makes £200,000 a year will pay £30,000 corporation profits tax, after it has paid its income tax as well.</P>
    <P>Only those who have some knowledge of business realise the iniquity of these proposals.  There never was a time when Irish industry and Irish business should be more encouraged to plough back their profits in improved equipment and modernisation of their methods and facilities than this time and this is the time we lay upon them a fresh taxation burden which makes the adequate repair of their facilities that much more difficult. It is profoundly inimical to the interests of the expansion in gross national product to which we have committed ourselves in so far as it impinges on the larger firm; it is a cruel and unjust imposition on the smaller firms who are brought within the range of corporation profits tax for the first time this year.</P>
    <P>When I think of small shopkeepers in this city and in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and in towns and villages throughout the country who are faced with the arrival of large international combines to set up, without any regard to capital cost whatever, the most modern and attractive self-service stores that their experience and capital resources will allow, in competition with people whose whole resources are invested in their relatively small establishments and who are now told that the money they so urgently need to bring their premises up to some degree of competitiveness with these financial mammoths that are arriving with the express intention of wiping them out, I find it very hard to be patient with a Government guilty of such irresponsible indifference to the interests of <Col N="272" /> hard-working people in their own country.</P>
    <P>Now I want to say a word to put this problem of the turnover tax in true perspective.  The Parliamentary Secretary says it taxes nothing.  If that is the criterion the Government are really applying to this, this proposal becomes even more iniquitous than it first appears because, if that is the line of country he is travelling, what it really means is that the Government proposals are that in the case of the retail distributive trade of this country, which, after all, is one of the biggest employers of labour in the country&mdash; let us not forget that&mdash;they are going to say to a firm with a turnover of £100,000, such a firm as would employ 10, 12 or 15 assistants, that they must pay a turnover tax of £2,500.</P>
    <P>To many minds, when you speak of £2,500 in the context of £100,000, the inclination is to say: &ldquo;Well, that is not much&rdquo; but do not forget that the profit on the turnover of £100,000 is in the order of £5,000 net.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Four thousand pounds is the average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am allowing them £5,000 after expenses have been paid. What we are, in effect, saying to that firm is: &ldquo;When you have made £5,000 net, you must pay income tax first on your £5,000 and then you must pay corporation profits tax on your £5,000 and then you must pay £2,500 which we call sales tax but which is the same as corporation profits tax but we give you leave to get it back from your customers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands tells the Boyle comhairle ceanntair that it is not going to put a tax upon anything.  Either he is right and the shopkeeper is wiped out; on his turnover of £100,000, he will be left with a net profit of substantially less than £2,000, or else he can put his hand to the task of raising the price of butter, tea, cigarettes, whiskey, and petrol, if he sells it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is designed to secure for the Exchequer £10½ million per annum. Someone must pay it: either <Col N="273" /> the consumer will be successfully assessed for it or else the medium-sized business man will close his doors because he will not have it if he cannot get it back, and if he does, the men and women who work for him will be out of jobs and will presumably be offered the opportunity of joining their brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts, in London, Birmingham and Glasgow.</P>
    <P>I view the prospect of this levy with profound alarm, and every authority that has considered it in anticipation, and particularly objectively out of the context of the proposals here before us, has condemned it.  Their opinion has been endorsed not only by the economic experts but by this very Government themselves because at that time they had not seen the Nemesis that was advancing upon them.  They were living in the Utopia of belief that the Common Market would resolve all their problems and that in any case, if it did not, it would be a useful scapegoat on which to hang the blame.  That gamble has not come off and now we are going back on all the detached estimates that were made when the Government were not a panic-stricken mob abandoning all their principles.</P>
    <P>When I look across at the Tánaiste and think of the things I have heard him say, think of him then subscribing to the proposals now before the House, it astonishes me that a man who entertained the convictions he once claimed to have could have the audacity to remain in public life and sponsor the proposals now before the House. He knows it.  We used to speak of the man who sold his soul for a penny roll and a lump of hairy bacon, but I would not like to be in the Tanaiste's position today.  I hope if I were, I would have the courage to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>We quite casually accepted in yesterday's division the principle that the prerogative enjoyed by the co-operative societies for 65 years in this country is to be swept aside.  I do not believe that proposal has been given adequate consideration or a true estimate made of its impact, but I suggest to the House that the imposition <Col N="274" /> of income tax on certain of the activities of these co-operative societies will subtract from the farmers in many areas throughout the country more than the penny a gallon conceded to them recently under the increased price for milk announced by the Government in the past three months.  I suggest that a change of that kind should not be made without reasonable consultation with the co-operative movement and a true assessment of the probable repercussions on the whole structure of agriculture.  Prior to such a radical departure, I do not believe any such inquiry was undertaken and I charge the Government with irresponsibly embarking on this without notice to anybody and without adequate investigation of what the consequences of that decision will be.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the dimensions of the adverse trade balance.  It now stands at £102 million, but, turning to <i>Economic Statistics</i> provided prior to the Budget of 1963, I want to remind the House of certain facts to which I saw fit to draw its attention on more than one occasion and which were indignantly repudiated by the Government when I first brought the attention of the House to them.  These preparatory papers speak of the gap in the trade balance and of the deficit in the balance of payments and comment on the capital movements that are taking place between this country and the outside world which we have to cloak for the time being, the fiduciary reaction of the balance of trade on the net external assets of the joint stock banks, the Central Bank and the Government funds, and point out that our invisible exports make a substantial contribution by way of tourism, emigrants' remittances, pensions and so on and say there is a balance of £24 million which is made up of external subscriptions to Government loans.  If that is not hot money, would I be exaggerating if I described it as warm money? That investment could be thrown on the market with very uncomfortable consequences at a moment's notice.  Bank deposits of external customers is the next category.  That is the most polysyllabic <Col N="275" /> example of hot money I ever saw because the boys who deposit that money here could take it out at the drop of a hat.</P>
    <P>The third category are purchases of buildings and land by externs.  It is hard to find out what the Government's view on this is.  The Minister for Lands says it does not amount to £500,000, the Minister for Finance says his latest information is that about £1 million worth of land was purchased here in the past 12 months.  I believe the figure to be substantially higher and I believe it to be substantially increased by a new invasion&mdash;the land speculators and the property speculators who are moving in and now buying up house and office property and renting it to nationals of this country. Some of them, short of liquid capital, are glad to sell out to international financiers and are glad to become rent-paying occupiers of the property. There are two aspects of this matter to which I want to draw attention. One is that I believe the sound basic instinct of our people will say: &ldquo;This must stop; what we did not allow them to take by force we will not now allow them to buy with money.  We fought long enough to get this country back into our own hands and we will not sell it now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That happened in Canada.  There has been bitter feeling in Canada over an excessive import of foreign capital, expressed through purchase of property.  That is a very different cup of tea from the import of capital for the establishment of industry, but over and above that, leaving aside altogether the social aspect, let us not forget that none of these international operators puts his money here for the love of our lovely blue eyes.  He puts it here in the anticipation that he will get a profit out of it and, taking one transaction with another, you may assume that capital of this character invested here is designed to bring home a seven per cent return.  That means that for every £10 million of this money that finds its way in here by the purchase of our property and land and by investment in our industry, they believe they are creating a charge on <Col N="276" /> our balance of payments of £700,000 per annum in perpetuity.  It must be carried in perpetuity, and so the relief at present enjoyed by the balance of payments is a benefit at the expense of our ability to meet a charge in perpetuity of £700,000 for every £10 million invested.</P>
    <P>While the money is coming in, that is lovely.  If our gross national product is expanding at a rate which will generate exports on a scale sufficient to meet the certain charge upon us, well and good, but we are in a situation in which our exports are falling and our imports rising and in which the rate of expansion of our gross national product is declining&mdash;it stands now at 2½ per cent &mdash;and in which we have an adverse balance of payments this year of something of the order of £13 million.  It is time we had some regard to the future.  Whether that does any good or not with this Government is hard to say because two years ago they examined the future with detachment and deliberation and they declared most categorically that the things they must never consent to do are the things they themselves propose to do in 1963.  If they were right in 1961, they are wrong in 1963: if they are right in 1963, they were wrong in 1961.</P>
    <P>The fourth element in this item of £24 million is the revaluation of external securities held by banks&mdash;in fact, the changing of figures in a book. The fifth element is the investment by foreign firms in their subsidiaries here and that fact, while it can be of excellent value to the country in so far as it provides good employment for some people in their own country without imposing on them the obligation of emigrating, still has an economic element in it in that it means a charge in perpetuity on the balance of payments and if there is not a corresponding increase in our exports, we are purchasing a temporary benefit at the expense of a permanent charge which with the present trend in our resources, we shall have little prospect of being able to meet when it may be vitally necessary to this country that we should be more than adequately covered.</P>
    <P>I believe this Government are <Col N="277" /> floundering and what fills me with consternation is that I believe they can drag us all down with them.  I believe they do not know where they are going but they are hoping and praying that something will turn up.  I do not underestimate&mdash;I never have done so&mdash;the difficulties with which an agricultural country such as this is confronted in finding advantageous markets in which to trade.  I know the difficulties at this time of finding profitable markets in which to dispose of our creamery products and certain other products of which we have or could have an abundance to send abroad.  I rejoice that we still have for our people what no other country in Europe has to so great an extent, a viable and invaluable market in Great Britain for our livestock and for a large proportion of our industrial output.  I hope that this Government will have the <i>nous</i> and capacity not only to keep but to expand that market.</P>
    <P>I get the impression strongly that although there are a number of people in this House who strongly advocate that this country should negotiate an association with the Common Market in lieu of membership and point to the achievement of Greece in having secured such an arrangement, if my information is worth anything, that agreement of association is not proving the boon that Greece thought it would be.  I suggest to our Government that if they will not get out&mdash;so long as we have Deputy Sherwin and a few more of them there, we cannot get them out by a vote of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not deny that only a fool would long to have handed over to him the confusion in which this Government at present stand.  I do not deny that and I do not believe any honest man could stand up and say, when he sees the present situation in which the Government are, that he believes it is going to be fun to be responsible for the resettlement of this nation's affairs.  But I believe we can do it and that it has to be done and, unlike Deputy Sherwin, I believe that you are not entitled to make a choice to suit your own personal predilection after you have been 30 years in the public life of any country.  If you do not want to accept responsibility, you should never have sought it in the first place. No one has to go up for ballot, but if he does so and if the devolution of events puts him in a position of responsibility, he must face the responsibility, whether he likes it or not.</P>
      <P>I conceded at once that the condition into which the country has got through the activities of this Government is very grave and difficult but not by any means more grave or difficult than it was in 1947.  I remember the present Taoiseach speaking in Letterkenny in 1947 and saying he wanted to warn people that there lay before the country a period of five years or a decade of acute crisis through which he could not see his way and it was going to be a time of sacrifice and difficulty and great economic peril for this State.  I do not think the Minister will deny that.</P>

In our first period in office, the population of the country went up for the first time since the Famine.  That has not happened since.  The population trend had turned and was going up.

      <P>I would not like you to go; I would not like either of us to go.  I do not believe the Minister gives a damn but the country gives a damn and when the people feel the full impact of these proposals, they will understand them better.  I want to point out to the House and to the country this interesting feature.  The Minister for Finance is portrayed in the morning papers as a smiling, babylike, innocent person. Somebody even described the picture as that of the glaxo <Col N="281" /> baby.  Nobody could look more benevolent or kindly but he is neither one or the other.  He is a very astute old operator.</P>
      <P>It used to be a virtue in Government in this country that the Minister for Finance felt he had an obligation to come before the House and lay his proposals honestly and clearly before us.  Can anyone describe the Minister's present proposals as honest or above board?  Can anyone describe as honest or above board a Minister who announced that he hoped to collect £3½ million from these proposals this year?  He did not consider it necessary to say what he would collect from them in a full year until a member of the Labour Party put the question to him and then he said that they would produce £10½ million in a full year.</P>
      <P>How many people in the country today really appreciate that this Budget contains proposals designed to raise increased taxation to the tune of approximately £13 million in a full year, the largest increase ever proposed in a Budget in this country? He has presented proposals, not for a tax on tobacco, or beer, or spirits or clothing but for a tax on nobody knows what. Those who will have to pay it will feel it and will know that serious consequences must inevitably follow for the whole economic life of this country.  These consequences may be postponed for a time but they are certain and inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country does not belong to any one of us or to any group.  It belongs to us all and if it goes down, unfortunately the great majority of us will go down with it.  I think the policies of the present Government put us in the gravest possible jeopardy of becoming the sick and poverty-stricken nation of Europe at a time when all the countries associated with us in OECD and the other organisations have a high prospect of achieving a greater measure of prosperity than ever before.  It would be a regrettable humiliation for those of us who love this country if it should have to go begging and looking for charity hat in hand to Denmark, Holland, Belgium, France, Germany or Britain. If the policies of the Government are persisted <Col N="282" /> in, that is the danger which faces us. It is a danger which I do not think this country is fit to face, but which, if I were called upon, I would face with reluctance but sincere in the conviction that I could avert the consequences of what this Government have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>To me, there is one outstanding feature in this Budget.  As far as we can see, it defines very clearly what is the attitude of the Government towards taxation.  In page 53 of the Minister's speech, he clearly defines that attitude and may I say straight off that it is a policy with which the Labour Party violently disagree. He said:</P>
      <P>Government policy with regard to taxation, as stated on many occasions, is that it is a good principle in the circumstances of a developing country to place the emphasis of taxation on expenditure rather than on income so that earning and saving will be encouraged rather than spending.</P>
      <P>He goes on to say:</P>
      <P>It is not contrary to equity that those members of the community who can afford to spend most should pay most, as will be the position secured by the new tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know from the Taoiseach or from the Minister for Finance what is good about the principle that was stated here yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  Theoretically, as far as the economists are concerned, a 2½ per cent tax on expenditure will get them a certain amount of money. It will get them the money they require this year, £3½ million, and, in an ordinary year, £10 million.  That is all right in theory.  What the Government seem to have neglected this time is to think in terms of ordinary people, to think in terms of the capacity of individuals to pay this tax, and not so much in terms of the capacity of the country as a whole to bear a tax such as this.  The distribution of the tax burden as far as the Labour Party are concerned is all important.  The Minister for Finance had a relatively easy task when he <Col N="283" /> said to himself: &ldquo;I require £3½ million this year; £10½ million in a full year. The simplest thing to do is to put a 2½ per cent tax on &ldquo;&mdash;what is described in this Budget as a turnover tax.</P>
    <P>We are told, again in the same words&mdash;the words I have just quoted&mdash; that this is to encourage people to save rather than to spend.  It seems to me to be somewhat contradictory. Apart from the fact that it is a tax which the poorest person in the country will have to pay, a tax on such a person is designed, according to the Minister for Finance and the Government, to make him save rather than spend.  Such people are supposed not to spend money on food, clothes, medicines, footwear and such things so that they may save.</P>
    <P>I did not read Deputy Lenihan's speech in the <i>Roscommon Herald.</i> I just heard the quotations by Deputy Dillon who read extracts from some of the local newspapers.  I think Deputy Lenihan's attitude was probably right and it is what I am sure the members of the Fianna Fáil Party expected, namely, that such a tax would not be imposed on practically every item one can think of that is purchased by the people of this State.</P>
    <P>I can and the Labour Party certainly can, agree with something the Taoiseach said here when he spoke on the Vote on Account.  On that occasion he said that the level of taxation was relatively lighter in Ireland than in most European countries. He described it in Ireland as being 23 per cent.  He quoted Britain, Italy, Holland, US, France and Germany as having a higher level of taxation related to gross national product.  He says, and rightly so&mdash;it cannot be contradicted&mdash;that the relationship between tax revenue and gross national product has remained somewhat static over the past ten years or so at 22 or 23 per cent.  Our concern is how the taxation is levied and on whom.</P>
    <P>We have in this country, as there is in most countries, two types of tax&mdash;the indirect form of taxation and the direct form of taxation.  The Taoiseach, when announcing to some extent the new <Col N="284" /> programme for economic expansion was wont to quote&mdash;I suppose for the benefit of the Labour Party&mdash;the practice of Labour Parties and Socialist Parties on the Continent.  He said that the Labour Party in Britain and other countries favour a purchase sales tax or a turnover tax.  I do not think he can have it both ways.</P>
    <P>As far as most of the European countries are concerned, the burden of direct taxation is far heavier than that of indirect taxation.  In this country, the level of indirect taxation stands at about 70 per cent.  Indirect taxation&mdash; that hidden form of taxation&mdash;is designed to fall on consumer goods rather than to be levied on wealth or income.  In the US, a country to which the Taoiseach referred, indirect taxation is 34 per cent, of gross national product; in Sweden, 37 per cent; in Western Germany, 43 per cent; in Holland, 44 per cent; in Britain, 48 per cent; and in France, 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not know how economists form and frame their views on indirect <i>versus</i> direct taxation.  The House might like to hear a recent comment by an economist in France especially in regard to indirect taxation.  He is Monsieur Pierre Uri who, I might say, is regarded as one of the architects of European integration and French planning. He said that France had the highest indirect taxes in the world and that these were among the main factors to which he attributes the blame for the present inflation and social unrest there.</P>
    <P>We are a country with indirect taxation to the tune of 70 per cent.  I would say, as far as this Budget is concerned and the further burden of indirect taxation, that the repercussions will be very widely felt when this turnover tax is implemented.  I think it must generally be accepted that a tax on expenditure falls far more heavily on the lower income groups than on the higher income groups.</P>

      <P>The tax on income places the tax burden on those whom we regard as best able to bear it.  It seems to be deliberate Government policy to reduce direct taxation and to <Col N="285" /> increase indirect taxation.  I congratulate them on their frankness on that but it is a policy with which we in the Labour Party violently disagree. They have demonstrated that in recent Budgets.</P>
      <P>Direct taxation has been reduced since 1957 by the Fianna Fáil Government to the tune of £6 million and that extra £6 million has been pushed over into concealed taxes, into hidden taxes or, as it has been termed, indirect taxation.  There has been a certain amount of brain-washing and propaganda in recent months, especially by the Taoiseach, in trying to sell this idea of a purchase, sales or turnover tax to the people.  I think it was last Thursday night, when he spoke to some members of his Party in Dublin, that he said the Labour Party in Great Britain were contemplating&mdash;&mdash; as if they were in favour of&mdash;a purchase tax.  I do not think such is the case; or, if such is the case, it is not the type of tax that has been proposed in this Budget&mdash;a tax which will fall on food and the other necessaries of life.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach wants to quote Britain and other countries in order to sell the idea of a tax of this kind to this House and to the people of Ireland.  On the other hand, when we mention to him that there are better social services and better health services, more employment, and so on, in other countries in Europe, he says we cannot make any comparison. However, when he wants to take an example which he thinks will suit himself, he has no hesitation in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach seek justification for the imposition of this turnover tax from the Income Tax Commission Report. I do not think it was fair, to say the least of it, that justification should be sought from that Report.  In the first place, the Taoiseach must remember that the proposal to introduce a tax of this kind was carried by a very slim majority. On that occasion, the vote was six to five in favour of a tax merely for the purpose, of course, of reducing income tax. In those six, you had the Chairman; whether or not he used a casting <Col N="286" /> vote, I do not know.  The Taoiseach should remember that, whilst the personnel of the Commission were not strictly deemed to represent any group, those among the five represented very substantially more than those who could be termed to be members of the six.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm, therefore, for me to refer again to the Income Tax Commission Report and to quote not the comments of the Income Tax Commission but the views that were given by the Government at the time the Report was issued.  In April, 1961, the Government had this to say with reference to a sales, purchase or turnover tax:</P>
    <P>It is clear that to reduce income tax by 2/- in the £ and to make up the revenue by a sales tax at a rate or rates between 7½ and 15 per cent would be a major change having important effects on the incidence of taxation.  It would shift so markedly the burden of taxation from single to married taxpayers, especially those with children, and from the higher to the lower income groups, as to be, in the Government's view, socially undesirable.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may say in regard to the Budget that income tax is not reduced.  It has not been reduced this year but surtax has been reduced in the past three or four years and income tax was reduced. It is to fill that gap caused by the reduction in surtax and the like that it has been necessary to introduce what is described here as a turnover tax. I do suggest that the burden has been shifted from the single person to married people and those who are less able to afford to pay this turnover tax.  Surtax was reduced in 1959. The level at which it begins was increased from £1,500 to £2,734. Income tax was reduced in 1961 from 7/6 to 6/4d.  Somebody might say: &ldquo;Surely you do not want to see income tax increased.&rdquo;  I would say that if it is a choice between a tax on income and a tax such as is proposed in this Budget, I would vote for a tax on income all the time.</P>
    <P>These reductions in income tax and surtax have been of much more <Col N="287" /> benefit to those in the higher income groups than they have been to those in the lower income groups because, as was demonstrated in this House when the change in surtax and in income tax was effected, it meant that as regards people with higher salaries, they saved substantially more than those earning £11, £14, £15, £16 a week or people with even lower incomes.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear, even though income tax has not been reduced in accordance with the proposal of the majority of the Income Tax Commission, that one of the reasons for the imposition of the turnover tax is that there has been a change in the burden of direct taxation as against indirect taxation.  In any event, the propaganda that has been made over the past few weeks, especially by the Taoiseach, has resulted in what is described as a turnover tax and despite the heavy burden of indirect taxation, this Budget will further increase indirect taxation.  At the present time the proportion of indirect taxation to gross national product is twice as much as it is in most European countries.</P>
    <P>The Government, I am sure, very deliberately gave this tax a name they hoped the ordinary people would not understand.  They called it a turnover tax.  A sales tax or purchase tax would have a certain significance for the ordinary consumer.  Last night, the Minister for Finance tried to give the impression that this was a tax on retailers only, that they could collect it in whatever way they liked.  It is true, as far as the mechanics of the matter are concerned, that the retailer's responsibility is to the Government and that the initial demand is made on the retailer.  While it is said a rose by any other name may swell as sweet, a poison by any other name is just as deadly.  Nobody can suggest that the retailers will pay this £10½ million.  Is anybody suggesting the shopkeepers and storekeepers of this country will pay this amount?  We know that this will be and must be passed on to those who purchase the goods.  The net point is that an expenditure tax has been <Col N="288" /> imposed to the tune of £10½ million per annum.  Therefore instead of being a sales tax, a purchase tax or a turnover tax, it is a tax on living.  Deputy Lenihan assured his constituents that food would not be taxed.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon, Sir. The Parliamentary Secretary assured his constituents that food would not be taxed.  He assured constituents that petrol, cigarettes, beer, footwear, medicines, all those items, would not be taxed, but this turnover tax will tax every single thing except those which have been listed as being exempt in the Minister's Budget speech and which are very insignificant indeed as far as the ordinary people are concerned.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach may say that it is only 2½ per cent or 6d. in the £1, that it is a very small burden to impose on the Irish people.  I suppose to some people it might not be of any great significance but I want to be clear about this, as far as the Labour Party are concerned.  What we are concerned about, and the sinister thing we see in this Budget, is the introduction at all of a sales tax.  I trust I am as much concerned about the health and the well-being of the Minister for Finance as Deputy Dillon but I would venture to say that he has certainly not acquitted himself well, if this is to be his last year or his last term as Minister for Finance, in giving this stamp to Irish tax law, the introduction of a sales, purchase or turnover tax. It is the principle to which we object and object very strongly. If one thought of it in the terms of a sales or purchase tax, or in the same terms as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands did, on luxuries, on motor cars, on jewellery, on fur coats -granted they would not take in anything like £3½ million in the present year or £10½ million in any one year&mdash; it would not be so bad, but I do not think anybody in Ireland thought for one moment there would be a tax on bread, on the necessaries of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a great furore in this House in the initial stages of the granting <Col N="289" /> of the food subsidies. Then there was a great furore about the withdrawal of those food subsidies by Fianna Fáil, first of all in 1952 and again in 1957.  In 1947 and 1948, and for years afterwards, Governments thought that food should be subsidised. Afterwards, the food subsidies disappeared. We have now gone to the other extreme.  Instead of giving food subsidies, we want to tax food. I wonder does the Taoiseach want to throw in the sponge? Does he want to make such a mess of affairs that the people will reject him at the very first opportunity? It is fantastic that an Irish Government should tax food. As Deputy Norton said, I do not think it has ever been done before in this country. Are there many other civilised countries in the world that tax food?</P>
    <P>Medicines, about which the Minister for Health ought to be concerned, are also to be taxed.  He knows the concern of this House in regard to health services and of the pressure in that regard from all Parties in Dáil Éireann.  A Committee has been established and is sitting now to try to better health services and we all applaud that.  That is being done because health expenses impose a great burden on many of our people.  At a time when drugs are so necessary and expensive, it will mean that for every pound's worth of prescriptions bought, the purchaser will have to pay an extra 6d. because the chemists are not going to bear that 6d. in the £.  It is a shame for the Government to tax food, medicine, clothing, footwear&mdash;to tax the necessaries of life.  Therefore, I say this Budget represents a tax on living.</P>
    <P>I will not say the Taoiseach gave away any intimate Budget secret when he made propaganda speeches about sales, purchase or turnover taxes.  The ordinary individual buys things as he can afford to buy them.  I do not know what amount the Minister for Finance expects to get from the purchase of motors, jewellery, furs and so on, but the purchasers of these articles got more than a hint from the Taoiseach that some form of purchase tax would be introduced.  From now until November, <Col N="290" /> such people have time to buy all they want. Will they not buy their Jaguars now rather than pay an extra £25 or £30 next November? Will those who can afford to lay down the money now not buy their washing machines and television sets?  Will not next winter's furs be bought now, because if they wait until November, they will have to pay an extra 6d. in the £?</P>
    <P>But the person who has to buy food must buy it from week to week.  The man with a large family who needs winter shoes and clothing for his children will not be able to pay for them now.  The agricultural labourer will certainly not be able to buy them on his £6. 2. 6. per week.  He will only buy them when he needs them in November or December after this tax has been imposed.  But those who have the money will be able to buy all they need now because they have five months in which to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was very hurt last night when he was asked any questions.  I concede he must have been pretty tired after a speech of one and threequarter hours, having to sit in here until 8.30 p.m.  But, as Minister for Finance, he should have the information asked of him last night.  Perhaps the Taoiseach has it now, or did the Government seek to find the information prior to their deciding to impose this tax?  What effect will this tax have on the cost of living?  Will prices go up?  By how much will they go up? By how much will the cost of living index figure go up?  It is quite clear they will go up, because retailers will pass on this tax and the consumers will have to pay the price.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies asked what is going to happen in respect of a commodity costing, say 1/-.  What tax will be passed on in that case?  It may be said that the tax will be on the overall turnover and that shopkeepers and retailers will not charge an increase on that article but will charge a little more on another article.  In any case, it must be clear that this tax will have an effect on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>This comes at a time when the Government are shrieking for stability in prices.  The trade unions and the workers were led to believe that price <Col N="291" /> stability was now the most important aspect in the economic life of the country. They were told they should have regard to the possible effect of wage increases on the economy of the country.  The White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> was issued&mdash;it was recognised by everyone as a pay pause&mdash;telling those under the control of the Government, of Government agencies and of local bodies that they need not expect any increase in present circumstances.  That was done in the name of keeping prices stable.</P>
    <P>Here we have the Government by their deliberate action increasing the cost of living, increasing the price, not of selected commodities, but of every single article one can think of sold in any shop or store.  It seems to me extraordinary behaviour that we should withdraw the food subsidies, tell the workers that prices should be stabilised and that they need not expect any increase in their wages, and then on 23rd April, two short months after the White Paper was issued, say to them: &ldquo;We are going to tax your food.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what relationship exists between the Taoiseach and trade unionists here, but in all seriousness, does the Taoiseach expect them to stand for that?  Does he expect them to accept a pay pause in the light of the fact that everything they buy for themselves and their families will be taxed and increased in price?  Bang goes your stability of prices.  It will not be the workers' fault this time; it will be the Government's fault, who by their deliberate action in this Budget, will have in November substantially increased the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Last Friday night, the Taoiseach, speaking to the cumann in Dublin North-East, referred to the new <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  I know he has attempted to give a review of the last three or four years in relation to the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  Can he now honestly say it has been as successful as he and the members of his Party pretend it was?  There are two things to be remembered as far as I am concerned when one talks about economic expansion and progress.  One can think <Col N="292" /> in terms of national income and say it has gone up by such and such a percentage. One can talk about an increase in production and the state of our balance of payments.  That is all right.  By those standards, a country may be deemed to be prosperous.  But we have to come down to the different sections and different individuals.  We have to have regard to such things as employment and unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>I do not think the picture is as rosy as pretended by the Minister in his Budget speech yesterday.  There is no point in trotting out again to the Taoiseach the 100,000 new jobs.  He would like to live that down.  He described it as a blueprint to be considered. At the time nobody believed the Taoiseach had any intention of implementing it.  I do not think he or his Government ever started to consider their plans for the provision of 100,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>The booklet <i>Economic Statistics</i> has not been produced in the same form as last year and, therefore, we cannot make the same comparisons as last year.  I do not want to go back any further than 1958.  This new booklet tells us that in the transportable goods industries in 1958 we had 150,300 employed. In 1962&mdash;again the Government's figure&mdash;we had 170,500 employed. Therefore, in five years in the transportable goods industries, there have been 20,000 new jobs.  If other factors had not to be taken into account, that would not be a bad record but the Taoiseach has a responsibility not alone for those engaged or to be engaged in transportable goods industries but for all those who seek employment here.  Therefore, he has to have regard to the situation in agricultural employment and agricultural employment is given pretty clearly in the booklet <i>Economic Statistics</i> published last week.  That shows that, in 1958, there were 395,300 people employed in agriculture.  In 1962, there were 360,800 which means that as far as agricultural employment is concerned, between 1958 and 1962 there was a loss of 34,500.  Therefore, we had a loss in agriculture of 34,500 but in transportable goods industries, we <Col N="293" /> had an improvement of 20,200 which means we had 14,000 fewer in employment.</P>
    <P>We are twitted from time to time about inter-Party Governments and about what happened in 1955 and 1956 and Fianna Fáil allege that there was a mess made here and in this, that and the other place but Fianna Fáil should remember that they have been 25 years in Government, that for a quarter of a century, they have been the Government of this country and the employment position has not improved in all those years.  People are still flying from the land but as far as the Taoiseach is concerned, the next corner we turn will be the end.  We seem to be going around in a perpetual circle never reaching the corner of which the Taoiseach speaks.  Everybody appreciates the difficulties of the Government and of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Finance but I do not think that is a very creditable performance.</P>
    <P>Again, taking what Fianna Fáil alleges were the bad years of 1955 and 1956, it is clear that the situation as far as employment is concerned was tens of thousands better than it is now and they are in far better circumstances than the Government were in 1955 and 1956.  There is no doubt in the world about that.  The lack of progress of Fianna Fáil has meant that between 1958 and 1962, there were 14,300&mdash;I think that is a very modest figure&mdash; fewer employed as between agricultural employment and employment in transportable goods industries.</P>
    <P>You have to remember this when you think in terms of the Taoiseach's new announcement of a new <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>&mdash; that these are the first four or five years of his first programme and they have succeeded in reducing employment to the extent of over 14,000 in these two sectors I have just mentioned, I do not know whether the Government have seen any significance in what happened in agricultural employment last year. I have said that there has been an increase in employment in transportable goods industries of 20,200 between 1958 and 1962. Last <Col N="294" /> year, as far as agricultural employment was concerned, that was practically wiped out, wiped out in one year. The efforts of this Government have been, in the transportable goods industries, to increase employment in five years by 20,000 but that was all lost by reason of the fall in agricultural employment of 19,200 last year.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any cause for the complacency which appears to exist about the unemployment figures.  There is a definite tendency for them to rise and they have been rising compared with last year and the year before, for the past six or seven months, but the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance do not seem to see any major signal there. We were told in January and February, and the explanation was more or less accepted, that it was due to the bad weather that there had been such an increase as compared with a similar period in 1962.  The Minister for Finance said yesterday that the figures were falling again.  He is right when he says that they are falling again but it is a seasonal fall.  Compared with the same period last year, there is an increase.  Compared with the same weeks in 1962, we see an increase of between 3,000 and 5,000 and also compared with 1961.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister for Finance should not content himself by saying that the unemployment figures are falling again.  They are not.  We have an unemployment situation which is represented as seven per cent of the insurable population, much lower, one might say, than what it is in the Six Counties but recently, and again in the bad weather in Great Britain, their unemployment figure was represented as being four per cent of their insurable population and there was a near political crisis.  In fact, there was a political crisis in that the British Prime Minister appointed a Cabinet Minister to look after the question of unemployment and he went around the north-eastern parts of England and Scotland and to other places, but it did demonstrate as far as the Government of Britain and the Labour Party Opposition were concerned, that they regarded this four per cent unemployment as being a near crisis.  Here, we <Col N="295" /> have been going along for the past five years with seven per cent or 8.7 per cent as against four per cent and we are saying: &ldquo;Oh, it is not too bad at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to emigration. Somebody said recently that the population was rising again, that we were holding part of the natural increase in our population, but it seems to me that there is not a great difference between the rate of emigration now as against this time last year.  The Minister announced that emigration was proceeding at the rate of 20,800 in 1962.  That is 400 per week and it still means that that number of people are emigrating every week from our various ports, mainly because they cannot get work here and are forced to emigrate to Great Britain.  There is no evidence of a further improvement in 1963.  I do not think the Minister can produce any firm figure to show that there has been an improvement in emigration in 1963 because the figure he would get for the months of January and February would be false.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach when he was explaining away the rise in unemployment some time ago said in the Dáil that many of these workers engaged in building in Great Britain had not returned and hence the register of unemployed was swollen.  I suppose that is true, but when one thinks in terms of emigration figures, one must also remember that these boys and girls, these men and women, were still in the country and did not return to Britain until the end of February and some of them did not return until March.  The true figure could possibly be got now but for anybody to talk in terms of emigration for the year ending February, 1963, would be to give a false picture.</P>
    <P>We naturally welcome the increases proposed by the Minister in respect of social welfare.  It is about time the Government mended their hand in respect of social welfare payments as related to tax revenue.  We have had occasion to complain that recipients of social welfare benefit had not been treated equitably by the Fianna Fáil Government since 1957-58.  We were <Col N="296" /> always told that if financial circumstances permitted more would be given to old age pensioners, widows, the unemployed and sick persons.  We find&mdash;and again these are not my figures; I did not compile these figures &mdash;that, as a percentage of tax revenue, social welfare payments have been falling steadily from 1957-58 down to 1962-63.  On 7th March, 1963, the Minister for Finance was asked for the percentage of social welfare related to tax revenue.  He gave the figure for 1957-58 as 22.0 per cent.  It had fallen in 1958-59 to 22.5 per cent; in 1959-60, to 20.9 per cent; in 1960-61, to 20 per cent; and in 1961-62, to 18 per cent.  In 1962-63, it was between 18 and 19 per cent&mdash;nearer, I suppose to 19 per cent.  I have no reliable figure for that.  I have not yet had time to see whether or not there has been any increase in the percentage devoted to social welfare as related to tax revenue.</P>
    <P>These new increases, we are told, will not be effective until November next.  I can appreciate that the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance would have difficulty in preparing the legislation to make provision for these increases.  Many of us and many of the Minister's supporters believed that even the usual date of operation, namely, the middle of August or 1st August, was too far away but it is a little bit much that the date should be deferred for another two months, to November.  The amount involved does not warrant the recipient being denied an extra two months' payment of the increase in old age pensions for this year.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary what can be done by the financial experts when there is a real desire to get money.  The Minister for Finance in his Financial Statement yesterday posed the question: &ldquo;What would you have done?&rdquo; I could be smart and quote what the Taoiseach said when he was Deputy Lemass and Deputy Leader of the Opposition.  I do not pretend to quote his exact words but they were to the effect: &ldquo;It is not for us to give you the solution.  It is for us here to criticise. You should provide your own solution.  You are the Government of the country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> In respect of social welfare benefits, it is not today or yesterday that the Labour Party have advocated that more revenue could be secured from corporation profits tax.  The Minister is doing it in his Budget to the tune of £3 million.  How often have the Labour Party advocated that there should be a tightening up of tax collection? We pointed out that as far as the salaried worker or the wage earner was concerned, he could not escape a penny.  His wages were returned by his employer to the revenue authorities and they assessed exactly the tax he had to pay, so that the wage and salary earner is paying down to the very last halfpenny.  The Minister for Finance will admit that many people have evaded tax, that people who engage in cash transactions are not paying according to their income. The effort on the part of the Government to tighten up the laws or regulations in connection with tax evasion is welcome, though belated.  It is amazing that when financial experts are put to it, when there seems to be urgent need for money, money can be got.  It is estimated that £3 million will be obtained by way of corporation profits tax but if there were a question of another 2/6d. on top of the 2/6d. provided for in the Budget for old age pensioners we would be told the bottom of the barrel would be scraped.</P>
    <P>As far as social welfare groups are concerned, we welcome the increase, even though it is apparent that the benefit of it will be offset to a large extent by the turnover tax they will have to pay as consumers.  They will not get 2/6d. per week.</P>
    <P>It may be said that when I was Minister for Social Welfare, all they got in so many years was 2/6d. but I venture to suggest that 2/6d. in 1954 was of more value than 2/6d. in 1963. As Deputy Sherwin said, they will not get 2/6d.  They will be paying tax out of that 2/6d.  Deputy Sherwin pointed out that all they will have to spend is 35/- but a big proportion of that will be spent in the tax on food and clothing.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that as far as old age pensioners, widows, home assistance recipients, unemployment <Col N="298" /> assistance recipients are concerned, they do not buy Jaguar cars, Savile Row suits, furs, mink.  Their expenditure is on tea, bread, butter, sugar, milk and, maybe, a bit of meat.  They will pay tax every time they purchase these commodities, or I do not know the retailers in this country.</P>
    <P>There is an increase provided for in children's allowances, which, again, we welcome.  There is a provision for the first-born child of 10/- per month and 4/6d. in respect of the third and each subsequent child.  This is an effort by the Government, they say, to offset the effect of the turnover tax, which is an admission that the turnover tax will affect the family person.  This provision will compensate to some extent but, on balance, they will have to pay more.  The turnover tax certainly will mean a tax on their expenditure over and above the 10/- and the 4/6d.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered, also, that there is another class of people in our society, who, because they are in the minority, seem to be ignored.  The Government have taken the initiative in declaring that the disabled person's maintenance allowance be increased by 2/6d.  It is a pity the Minister for Finance or the Government could not ensure that these people will in fact get the 2/6d.  It is a matter for the local authority, I know, but many local authorities have acted very shabbily in respect of past increases declared by the Government.  As we all know, local authorities have taken off the increase in other allowances for which they are responsible&mdash;home assistance, infectious diseases maintenance allowances, and the like.  If the Minister or the Government can do anything to ensure that there will be a real increase for these people, it will alleviate their circumstances to some small extent.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate the view of the Labour Party in respect of the general taxation policy of the Government.  We do not believe that the heaviest burden of taxation should be by way of indirect taxation.  We believe that wealth and high income should be taxed if the State needs this extra money.  We believe that the necessaries of life that have been mentioned here in the last few hours and last night <i>ad nauseam</i><Col N="299" />&mdash;food, clothing, footwear, medicines &mdash;should not be taxed. We believe that if more money is required, it should be obtained by a tax on wealth, a tax on high incomes, and not by means of a tax on people who cannot afford to bear the burden.</P>
    <P>One newspaper in its leading article prior to the Budget said that one of the functions of the Minister should be to distribute the burden fairly and equitably, to place it on the shoulders of those best able to bear it.  This Budget has not done that.  On the contrary, it has introduced into the taxation code of this country a tax which I believe will have far-reaching repercussions on the economy, not least of which will be the effect on the cost of living, on prices.  If prices are to be affected by reason of this turnover tax, it certainly will be reflected on the attitude of the workers who must compensate themselves for any extra prices they have to pay for essentials.</P>

      <P>This Budget rests on the proposition that economic and social progress require increased Government spending.  The stimulation of higher production, the realisation of higher levels of employment, the extension of health, education and social welfare services, the provision of more houses, the improvement of communications and similar public services which make for better living in town and country, all require to be financed in whole or part through the Budget. We can cut down on Government spending only by cutting back on economic and social improvement.  This is a fact of political life which the Government accept and which the Opposition Parties still appear to be reluctant to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a fact which Deputy Dillon ostentatiously avoided in the whole of his speech as Leader of his Party this afternoon.  One beneficial effect of this Budget and of the debate on it now taking place is that it will help to clarify the really fundamental differences in approach to national problems between the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Parties about which there may have been some deliberately fostered <Col N="300" /> ambiguity in the past.  The Fine Gael approach, as disclosed in Deputy Dillon's speech this afternoon and in speeches made by him and his colleagues yesterday, is negative, deflationary, timorous, political in the extreme. The Fianna Fáil attitude is, and I hope will always remain, positive, constructive and national.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that it is good for the nation to have a continuing extension of our social welfare arrangements, better health services, better schools and houses, rural electrification, rural piped water supplies and so forth.  In our judgment, the country can now, because of the growth of national production under the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> afford them.  To make them possible, it is necessary, however, through taxation to get the money required made available to the Exchequer.  We think it is good policy to adjust our taxation system for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Those who want lower taxes, or those who at least wanted to prevent any increase in the level of the taxes fixed in the Budget of 1962, must be prepared to argue in favour of doing without the better public services and the extended facilities which it is now intended to provide.  That is the alternative, and Deputies who favour that course must not be afraid to spell out what it means.  They must not be timorous about telling the people what it means.  There is no method by which the country can get the benefit of improved services without paying for them.  Those who want to avoid paying must be willing to advise the people to do without those services.</P>
    <P>The Government's regret&mdash;and it is the only regret we have about this Budget&mdash;is that it is not possible to improve those necessary and desirable public services to a far greater extent than we are now proposing.  We hope to improve them much more in the future. The present Budget is designed not merely for 1963 but for future years as well: it lays the foundation on which better social welfare, extended health, education and agricultural services can be erected in future years.  As the country's economic progress continues, as we become better off as a national <Col N="301" /> community by reason of the growth of our production, it is our intention that the State's revenue should also expand so that the improvements we desire to see, the greater improvements we hope to realise, will be made possible.</P>
    <P>There is always room for argument as to the level to which taxation can safely or justly be raised.  It would be possible to try to do too much at once, which would involve taxation so heavy as to cripple economic progress. It is not our view that this stage has been reached.  We think what we have in mind can be done without altering very much, if at all, the proportion of the total national income which is taken for public purposes, relying on the growth of the national income to bring about consequential expansion of the revenue.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that in the wealthier countries the proportion of the national income taken for public purposes is higher than in the less well off countries.  That is understandable because a country can give itself better public services only to the extent that the total national income provides a margin over and above what is necessary to maintain reasonable living standards.  As we get better off, we can spend more&mdash;we can spend more relatively as well as absolutely&mdash;for desirable public purposes, and it will be the policy of this Government to do so.</P>
    <P>If there is another and contrary policy, let it be stated.  It is just foolish to fulminate against taxation and to demand at the same time more spending for better public services.  Nobody likes taxation and nobody is expected to like it.  There were no taxation proposals capable of being conceived by the Government, capable of being introduced here by the Minister for Finance, against which some case could not be made.  It is not the individual proposals that are made but the overall purpose they are intended to achieve that is important, and in so far as that is concerned, I do not want to be misunderstood regarding the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>We believe the country must spend more money to achieve economic and <Col N="302" /> social progress, that it is good policy to do it and that we can afford to do it.  If there is any alternative policy, I hope it will be stated with equal simplicity, with equal clarity.  Recently in the course of a speech I made, and to which reference has been made here, I attempted to give in broad outline the Government's ideas for distributing the fruits of economic progress so as to ensure that all elements of our community&mdash;the farmers, the wage and salary earners, traders, State officials, pensioners and social welfare classes generally&mdash;will all participate in the benefits of rising national production, in a way that will ensure that future economic progress will be helped and so that the living conditions of our people will improve steadily and without interruption over the years.</P>
    <P>We are not talking of a pay pause as Deputy Corish attempted to suggest. We have been trying to work out&mdash;and hope, indeed, to succeed in evolving&mdash;a regular and orderly system by which the benefits of rising national resources resulting from increased production will be fairly and evenly distributed among all the elements in the community, the wage and salary-earners no less than the farmers.  In the fulfilment of any policy of that type, in so far as concerns the social welfare classes and State employees and State pensioners and all those who benefit from the different social schemes, all who are remunerated or helped out of State funds in one way or another, and in present circumstances so far as concerns the aim of keeping farm incomes improving in line with urban incomes, it is clear that the Budget must be the main weapon used.</P>
    <P>In plain terms, that means this: when justice demands it, we must be prepared to level up incomes by taking away in taxation from some to give it to others whose circumstances require support in that way.  I have expressed the view, and I believe this to be true, that our people as a whole, if assured that they will personally be better off in terms of the real buying power of their incomes or wages or salaries will not object to contributing <Col N="303" /> something in taxation to sustain the policy which makes all this economic and social progress possible and which ensures that they are now, and can hope in the future to be, better off than in the past.</P>
    <P>This, at any rate, in broad outline as I said, is the policy of the Government. Deputies could advance arguments against that policy on its merits. None of them has done so and I shall venture to forecast that in the course of this debate none will.  What they are doing is refusing to look at it and instead are seeking for niggling arguments of a political kind against the proposals of the Government, defaulting in their duty as members in Opposition to the Government to consider that policy as an intelligent and constructive contribution to the development of national thought and particularly to consider its implications in relation to the Budget.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this policy which I have outlined, has in large measure to be implemented through the Budget and so, therefore, the Budget must be framed to make it feasible.  The tax structure must be such that, regardless of changes in public taste and habits, the inflow of revenue into the Exchequer will also expand in direct proportion to the improvement in national circumstances and in sufficient degree to meet the requirements of a developing social policy.  It is clear that the old Budget stand-bys, tobacco, beer and spirits and petrol, will no longer suffice to sustain this policy. Indeed it is now fairly obvious that higher tax rates upon these commodities would not yield higher revenue in the same degree.  That is the case for extending the range of the expenditure taxes by the introduction of a new system.  We have tried, in framing this Budget, to think in longer terms than the problems of this financial year. We are coming up now to the second phase of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and everything which we are proposing to the Dáil in taxation, no less than in legislation, is intended to make sure that so far as is humanly possible, the rate of national economic and social progress in the second phase will be no less than it was in the first.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> The preparation of this second <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> covering the period to the end of the present decade, is proceeding.  It has now been decided to publish it in two parts.  The first part of the new programme will, I hope, be published before the end of the present Dáil session.  It will set out the objectives of the second Programme, the main assumptions upon which it will be based and the conditions necessary for its fulfilment.  Following publication of that first part, it is intended to arrange a series of consultations with the principal functional organisations representing trade unions, industry, agriculture and other important sectors of economic activity.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these consultations will be to secure, if we can, their participation and help in the preparation of the detailed programmes conforming to the objectives already defined. We hope for wide and informed consultations. Democratic government is essentially government by persuasion. We have not in mind any form of compulsion other than the compulsion of public opinion, except to the extent that it may be needed to secure that general effect is given to majority decisions. The measure of a country's material progress is the readiness of its people to co-operate in a development policy.  Any plan for economic development must be comprehensive and coordinated. Nothing which can help or hinder it can be left out of account. Success assumes a wide measure of agreement.  If we cannot succeed on a basis of goodwill, we are not likely to do it on the basis of compulsion. If we do not succeed, there will not be much satisfaction in naming those responsible for our failure.</P>
    <P>The realisation of a pre-determined rate of economic growth will involve a whole series of important decisions based on assumptions as to population growth and movement, productivity, exports and our capacity to finance capital needs and will only in part fall to be implemented by Government action.  The expectation is that these consultations will be completed before the autumn and that the full and detailed programme will be ready for publication before the end of the year. <Col N="305" /> As this is our timetable, I have had to warn my colleagues in the Government who are directly concerned in these matters not to count on the prospect of holidays during the period of the Summer Recess.</P>
    <P>I believe that the time has come when national policy should take a shift to the left.  By this, I mean, first, more positive measures than have heretofore been attempted involving Government initiative to ensure the effective translation of the benefits of economic progress into the improvement of social conditions and specifically an equitable wage structure, wider educational opportunities, the extension of the health services and of our systems of protection against the hazards of old age, illness and unemployment; secondly, more direct Government intervention when necessary to keep the national economy on an even keel while maintaining the pace of our economic advance; thirdly, the maintenance of State investment activity at the highest possible level having regard to available resources; and fourthly, the more detailed planning of our economic activities so as to ensure the flow of resources in the directions where prospects are best, if necessary, diverting them from sectors where prospects are poorest. These ideas, in so far as they are developed during the consultations I have mentioned, will influence the character of the second <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>As in the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> private enterprise will continue to be the mainspring of our progress.  We have no plans for extending the area of State ownership so far as existing industries and services are concerned, and, indeed, we consider that there should be a periodic re-assessment of all State operations of this kind to ascertain if there have been changes in general conditions which would enable the public interest to be better served by leaving more scope for private initiative.  The extent of State activity in the industrial field now taking place&mdash;in steel, in processed foodstuffs and in chemical fertilisers&mdash; is in directions where in our circumstances it offers the most practical <Col N="306" /> method of speedy progress.  Our approach to this matter is pragmatic and not doctrinaire.</P>
    <P>State investment activity is planned for this year at the maximum level at which we think it is possible to finance it without seeking external loans.  We have introduced a new procedure, as Deputies are aware, by which the Dáil and the public are being given fuller information about the capital programme and the methods of financing it.  The extension of the State capital programme over and above the levels fixed this year will require a considerable rise in the level of savings. It is still the position that the proportion of national income saved for investment in this country is low by European standards.  Deputy Dillon appeared to me to be talking about the prospects of balancing this Budget by deliberately planning a deficit.  I can know of no more irresponsible suggestion at this particular time.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to compare this country with the United States of America. We are trying to make available for capital development every penny that can be procured.  We could not plan for a Budget deficit without cutting down our investment for production.  In the United States of America, they have no problem of that kind.  If they wish, they can meet any problem of that nature while pouring out the hundreds of millions and indeed billions of dollars in loans and grants throughout the world. When we are as wealthy as the United States of America, we may be able to think along these lines but, as Deputies should know, there would be no possibility for us of meeting a deficit on current expenditure except by cutting down on our capital programme and that would be the worst possible policy to adopt at our present state of development.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of Deputies to the statement made by the Minister for Education at Question Time today, when he said that he intends shortly to make a statement regarding Government policy in respect of the development and strengthening of the country's educational facilities. I do not wish to anticipate that statement but what I do wish to do is to <Col N="307" /> congratulate the Labour Party on having produced a policy in that respect. I am always prepared to pay a tribute of respect to any Party in opposition which has the courage to lay on the line its own proposals with regard to matters such as this and whether I agree with these proposals or not, I would commend them for that activity.  It is something I would commend to the Fine Gael Party but they are not likely to do it.  They refused to reveal even the shreds and tatters of policy with which they went into the last general election until the Dáil had been dissolved and all possibility of criticism had been eliminated.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that there are serious gaps in our present educational system.  In the world of to-morrow, economic progress in this country as in others will depend more upon the education, training and skill of our people than on muscle power.  That development is clearly to be foreseen. The time is not far distant when the unskilled labourer will be in diminishing demand and it is not too soon to start preparing the next generation of our people for this situation.  But that cannot be done without spending money and you cannot spend money unless you ask the people to contribute it.  I say this to the Labour Party also.  It is all very well to produce a policy for education but they must go on to the next step and indicate quite clearly to everyone that they are prepared to take that policy out of the realm of theory and put it into the realm of practicability by proposals for providing the money to put it into operation.  You cannot do that by voting against taxation.</P>
    <P>We tried to make the first economic development programme as flexible as possible and the second economic development programme will be similar in design.  Prior to 1958, when the first programme was being prepared, we could say that progress in any direction was all to the good.  In conditions as we see them developing for the remainder of this decade, we must adopt a more selective approach, encouraging the forms of development <Col N="308" /> from which we can expect the best results and discouraging those from which the results appear to be doubtful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, on this occasion as on others, spoke about the external trade situation.  He is hypnotised by this figure of £100 million difference between the value of our exports and that of our imports.  In planning the nation's future progress, we must have regard to this aspect of it as well as to the aspects dealt with in the Budget, that is to say, we must consider how any development plan to which we may commit ourselves will affect the country's international payments.  That is agreed.  I have no desire to encourage any complacency about the reemergence of a deficit in our international payments, even if it is very small in relation to the volume of our international transactions which ran last year to a total of £700 million, and even if no loss of our external financial reserves was involved.</P>
    <P>It would have been a much healthier position if our exports had been that much higher so as to eliminate that gap in our external payments but it is equally undesirable to exaggerate its significance.  Here I am handicapped by Deputy Dillon's obvious incapacity to understand the position at all.  This is certain, that while our economic growth is proceeding, while we are building up the productive capacity of our country, trying to get the development of our economy going ahead as rapidly as we would wish, there will be many years in which exceptional imports of capital equipment and materials for production are bound to create a similar pattern in regard to our external trade.  We have at least the expert advice of the OECD, in their very recent survey of our situation, that this is something which we must be prepared to expect and to tolerate.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of the means of increased production, of the equipment needed to enable us to increase our production, must always run ahead of the expansion of trade which it will make possible.  Certainly nothing has happened and nothing seems likely to <Col N="309" /> happen which would call for exceptional restrictive measures affecting imports.  Nothing we can now foresee is likely to require from us measures of the disastrous nature which, in more serious circumstances, the Coalition Government brought into operation during their final year of office.</P>
    <P>We can congratulate ourselves that we got through 1962, with all the inflationary pressures operating during that year, without a more serious deficit, without any loss of external reserves and without any need for restrictive measures by the Government. Nor is it true to say, as Deputy Dillon contended, that our exports are declining.  In the first quarter of this year, they were the highest ever recorded for any similar period in any previous year.  It is also true that our imports during the first quarter of this year were at an all-time high record. The import excess is higher than it was during the similar period of last year and indeed higher than it was in any year since the first quarter of 1956.</P>
    <P>The growth in our external trade is a necessary consequence of our economic expansion.  While it highlights and emphasises our need to pursue vigorously the expansion of our exports, there is nothing yet in that picture which would justify in any way any type of restrictive policy applying to our plans for the expansion of production in industry or agriculture. It is clear that if we are to realise our target of an average annual increase of national production of 4 per cent, the main contribution must in present circumstances come from non-agricultural activities and principally from manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked me if we are satisfied with the outcome of the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> As he well knows, we set ourselves, in the circumstances of 1958, the target of increasing national production at a rate of two per cent per year.  We at least have so developed since then that we can now raise our target, elevate our sights and hope to achieve in the rest of this decade an increase of four per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years, the volume of our industrial output rose in 1960 <Col N="310" /> by 8.6 per cent; in 1961 by 8.7 per cent and in 1962 by 4.9 per cent&mdash;an average over three years of 7.4 per cent.  The significance of the lower rate of growth in 1962 requires our attention.  Looking a little further beyond these gross figures we see that, during these three years, there was an expansion of production at a reasonable rate, which appears likely to continue, in many industrial groups, particularly those classified as chemicals and chemical products, structural products, glass and cement, metals and engineering, foodstuffs, clothing and taxtiles.  However, all industrial groups contributed something to this expansion of output.  The construction industry is also expanding steadily, perhaps even expanding too rapidly, and certainly seems set for a protracted spell of high activity.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Statement that arrangements have been made to set up a Building Advisory Council which we hope will be able to bring about a further expansion in the productive capacity of the construction industry which we shall certainly need if we are to keep up our present rate of development.  If we are to realise our target rate of growth, the average annual expansion in manufacturing industry in the years ahead of us must not be less than the average achieved over the past three years and certainly must be higher than the rate achieved in 1962.  A major aim of national policy must be to create and maintain the conditions which will make this growth rate possible.</P>
    <P>The expansion of exports requires favourable conditions in export markets. In so far as our export trade is mainly directed to markets in Britain, all the present indications are that prospects there will improve during the year and that the signs of recession which seemed to characterise the British scene in recent months are now fading away.  The opportunity for expansion is present if we go after it with sufficient energy.</P>
    <P>A very large part of the tax revenue which the Budget is designed to yield will be devoted to agricultural price supports and production aids.  The total Exchequer outlay for the benefit <Col N="311" /> of agriculture, both on current and capital account, this year will be just around £40 million and that, in relation to our resources, is a very large sum, indeed.  This policy of supporting agriculture in these ways and to that extent may not seriously be challenged in the Dáil.  It may not require elaborate defence here but I think it has to be defended to the taxpayers.  In this, as in all other countries, the rise in agricultural incomes has tended to fall behind the rise in urban incomes notwithstanding the fact that in every country situated like ours there is a decline in the numbers engaged in agriculture.  This tendency of agricultural incomes to fall behind urban incomes is particularly true in countries like ours in which agriculture is a major economic activity and in which increased production is largely dependent on access to export markets in which the prevailing prices are frequently below economic levels.</P>
    <P>It is not merely elementary justice that requires support from the whole community for agricultural incomes, in the circumstances which I have described, but economic policy also. With some 35 per cent of the country's manpower engaged in farming, any falling-off in their purchasing power must affect adversely levels of trade generally and the growth of employment in many urban occupations. Agriculture contributes 25 per cent of national production and its economic significance requires no stressing.  A main difficulty about diverting resources to the support of agriculture is to find a way of doing it that will benefit the hardworking, efficient farmer more than the lazy or bad farmer. The fertiliser subsidy, the farm building grants, and so forth, are a good example of what I have in mind and already they are bringing about a marked improvement in agricultural productivity.  The more we channel our help to agriculture in a way that will benefit the enterprising farmer the better will be the results and the less public questioning will there be of the wisdom of this policy.</P>
    <P>It is to be expected that for some time yet the fall in the number of persons engaged in agriculture will <Col N="312" /> continue and, while it has the effect of increasing the income per head of the remainder, it has social and economic implications for rural areas which we must try to counter by promoting other types of rural employment.  The answer to the problem of declining population in the small farm areas is not solely more and bigger subsidies for farmers but the development of additional forms of economic activities in those areas.  This is the policy of the Government and action to this end is being taken in accord with the recommendations of the Small Farms Committee.</P>
    <P>The amount provided for agriculture this year represents a very considerable increase over the amount provided in the Budget of 1962.  Our main concern must be to get farmers and farmers' organisations thinking in terms of what they can do for themselves by better farming methods rather than in terms of increased subventions from the Exchequer.  Subsidisation always has the effect of killing initiative.  The danger of increasing these subventions is that farmers will think of them as the only road open to them to better living.  Surveys recently carried out have shown that there is an immense amount of work to be done before we can feel certain that our methods of producing and marketing agricultural products are as good as they should be, and show also that by better methods the position and the incomes of the farmers can be greatly strengthened, and strengthened to a degree that far exceeds anything which it is possible to do by increasing State aids.  It is the duty of farmers' organisations to get these reports examined thoroughly by all their branches and to formulate their views upon the recommendations contained in them.  They cannot be expected to be treated as serious organisations unless they do this.  There is certainly need for a national effort along those lines and I hope that, with their help, we shall be able to create it.</P>
    <P>When will the necessity for these various supports from the Exchequer to farming cease?  The only possible answer is: when international management of agricultural markets brings <Col N="313" /> prices for farm products passing in international trade up to economic levels.  We had hoped for that eventual result in the European Economic Community and that hope has to be postponed, although it is by no means abandoned.  There are prospects of international agreements in the context of the GATT but it would be, I think, unwise to place too much reliance on them.  In this country, we cannot arrange for ourselves the conditions in international trade that would suit our circumstances, although we can and will support any and every prospect of international action.  In the meantime, the Government have decided that it is to the national advantage that by the re-distribution of income by means of taxation for the purpose of price and other supports, the farming community will be given the chance of sharing fully in improving national circumstances.</P>
    <P>May I at this stage say that in relation to certain statistics which appear in the book which has been circulated to Deputies and which has been quoted here that something seems to have gone seriously wrong with some of our national statistics? Estimates of the total number of people in employment and available for employment based on the census of 1951 became increasingly erroneous as the years passed and while we ceased a couple of years ago, suspecting that to be the cause, the provision of figures relating to a so-called total labour force, it is clear that the position cannot be put right in a statistical sense until the results of the 1961 census have been analysed.  Let it be quite clear this is just a statistical matter.  None of these errors in our estimates has put one person into or one person out of a job, but the statistics relating to the movement of people out of agriculture are completely inexplicable.  That is stated in the brochure which was circulated and which Deputies who have quoted from the brochure did not apparently note.  They do not just add up.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that 19,000 relatives of farmers left farming in 1962, any more than I believe that in the previous year the number of relatives who <Col N="314" /> assisted farmers increased by 5,000, as the statistics appear to show.  With emigration in the past 12 months at the lowest level since the war, with the increase of employment in industry and other occupations capable of fairly exact measurement, with our population rising and with the number of those out of employment exactly counted each week at the employment exchanges, the recorded increase in the number of farmers' relatives leaving agriculture cannot be explained and those who are responsible for the preparation of these statistics and estimates have a job of work to do there.</P>
    <P>The movement of people out of agriculture is certainly continuing.  It is continuing in this country as in all other countries in Europe, whatever its dimensions here.  The various proposals for reversing it, such as the development of vegetable processing industries, the operation of the county development teams now established in the western counties and the recent emphasis on rural developments of many kinds have not yet begun to grip with sufficient strength to reverse it.  Personally I would regard this as the major economic and social problem now to be faced.  I hope the Dáil will also agree to accept it as such and be prepared to support a policy of diverting financial resources into its solution.</P>
    <P>There is a reference I think I should make also to the drop in the rate of emigration which was quoted by the Minister for Finance yesterday in respect of the twelve month period ended December, 1962, as around 20,000 and which in the twelve month period ended February fell to about 12,000.  I do not think that that drop in emigration in that period of two months could be explained by any sudden increase in employment here. On the contrary we know that, because of adverse weather conditions in this country, these were difficult months so far as employment was concerned. Therefore, that substantial drop in the level of net emigration between the 12 months ended December and the 12 months ended February suggests that a substantial number of Irish workers who came back to Ireland during the <Col N="315" /> Christmas holiday period did not return to England and that the outward movement of our people during these months was restricted.  That may possibly be due to employment conditions in Britain during these months and the position may change again if and when these conditions improve.</P>
    <P>I must confess, however, that it irritates me intensely to hear Deputy Dillon talking as if emigration were something this Government invented. I want to contrast that figure of 12,000, representing the net emigration in the period which ended in February last, with the 55,000 who had emigrated in the 12 months immediately preceding the time when the people were able to eject Deputy Dillon from office, although, at that time, on the day this Government took office there were 97,000 people registered as unemployed at our labour exchanges.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to discuss this question on this low political level if Deputy Dillon wants to persist in it, but I would hope on an occasion like this to get a more constructive and intelligent approach to national problems.</P>
      <P>The outstanding features of this Budget are, first of all, the introduction of a higher corporation profits tax; secondly, the inauguration of the turnover tax; thirdly, the increased provision for our social welfare services and children's allowances; and, fourthly, the increased provision in the Budget to raise the production subsidy to the creamery milk suppliers.</P>
      <P>This increase in the tax upon company profits is a step on which the Government decided after very careful consideration indeed.  While companies, as such, are long recognised to be legitimate subjects for taxation, we had to give much thought to the effect of a higher corporation profits tax on the realisation of our main national aim of expanding economic activity. The question was whether a tax of this kind would operate as a disincentive to higher efficiency, increased exports or growth in productive investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> May I ask Deputy Dillon to take some advice regarding the existing circumstances of company taxation about which he knows very little? The income tax to which he is referring is not wholly borne by companies. It is, in part, offset by a deduction at the source of the tax that would be payable by the shareholders of the company in respect of the profits distributed by the company.</P>
    <P>As regards the possible effect of an increase in the corporation profits tax on the general efficiency of our industrial and commercial organisation, it seems to me the consequences should be to increase the pressure to maximise efficiency and the incentives to company managements to secure the most economical working of their undertakings so that the effect of the higher tax on profits will in that way be offset. With the existing tax concessions in operation it should also encourage manufacturing companies to try to expand their export sales, to divert more of their products into exports if they can do so, and in that way escape the effect of the tax rise altogether.</P>
    <P>As regards possible adverse consequences on the total level of investments, it certainly could have this effect in marginal cases in respect of projects of doubtful profitability.  The view of the Government is that there is need at this time for more positive measures to direct or attract capital resources into the soundest type of commercial enterprise.  Certainly, for sound concerns, a higher tax of this kind is unlikely to lead to any avoidance or postponement of investment decisions when one takes into account at the same time that the Government are prepared to offer to industrial concerns, planning to expand or renovate, substantial free grants or loans on favourable terms.</P>
    <P>It is correct, as the Minister for Finance pointed out, that, even with this increase, our direct taxation of company profits is low by European or United States standards.  Deputy Corish must not make too much of the apparent disparity between the proportion of revenue in the country secured by direct taxation as contrasted <Col N="317" /> with other European countries.  We just have not got here these enormous industrial and commercial combines which operate in Britain, France, Germany and elsewhere.  We have not got that class of very wealthy people from whom taxation can be drawn to the extent it is drawn in these countries. Until we have developed economically far beyond anything we are now thinking of, we cannot hope to create a situation in which exactly the same distribution of tax burden between direct and indirect taxation can exist here as in the case of the far more developed countries in Europe with which he is contrasting us.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to turn now to the turnover tax, which is the main innovation.  Let me be quite clear as to its character.  This is a turnover tax, not a purchase tax or a sales tax, as Deputy Dillon alternately called it. A purchase tax on the English model would be imposed at the wholesale level and would involve this disadvantage: that the retailer in charging his customers for the goods so taxed not merely adds on the tax but his profit on the tax and, therefore, prices are increased in a way which is of no benefit to the Exchequer.  A sales tax, as it is operated in many European countries and in many of the States of America, involves the giving of a document to each person buying goods indicating not merely the price of the goods but the appropriate tax paid on these goods.  The system of taxation is based on these documents and in some cases even stamps are used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We considered and discarded all these ideas and decided in favour of a simple tax on retail turnover.  This is not a tax on any commodity.  Deputies can undoubtedly refer to individual commodities that people in the retail trade sell, but, basically, this is a tax on the total turnover of retail establishments. It is clear if there is to be no evasion of that tax&mdash;and I am quite certain some bright boys in the retail trade will find some method of minimising their liability under it&mdash;<Col N="318" /> we must not attempt to differentiate in respect of the commodities sold over the shopkeeper's counter either in regard to the category of the commodity or the amount of tax attaching to each item.</P>
    <P>If the principle is agreed, as I hope it will be, that our social welfare services and other desirable public facilities provided by the Budget should expand and if it is agreed that, for the time being, support for agriculture at the present high level must be maintained, then some such tax as this turnover tax is essential.  It is the one certain way by which a continually expanding source of revenue can be opened up to enable this income re-distribution process to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputies have asked what will be the effect of this tax upon the retail price level.  That is not easy to forecast. Indeed, the effect on prices is far more likely to be exaggerated than otherwise. If the full amount of the tax is passed on in respect of all prices, if the general price level goes up by the amount of the tax, then an increase of around two per cent may be counted on, allowing that the tax does not apply to things like rents, transport services and so on.</P>
    <P>Do not let us look on this as a sort of national catastrophe.  In the past 12 months, the general price level went up by four per cent.  All the indications are that even with this tax in operation, the rise in the general price level in 1963 will not be as high as it was in 1962.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will not give way&mdash;it is even probable that the force of competition between traders will restrict the extent to which the tax is passed on.  Certainly one of the consequences of the tax in other countries was that it increased the inducements to traders to revise their profit margins because part of the effect of the reduction <Col N="319" /> of profit margins could be passed on to the Exchequer in reduced tax liability.  One thing that also has to be kept in mind, because of its importance, is that the volume of retail sales is rising steadily and it is certain that this increase will continue.  During 1956, the total turnover of our retail establishments increased in value by 7 per cent.  That increase is continuing in this year as the figures published for the first two months reveal.</P>
      <P>Traders generally can expect that a rising volume of business will help them to carry this tax in part, if not altogether.  Every gain in national income and every beneficial consequence of our efforts to expand the country's economy and improve its social security is reflected in higher business for retail traders.  I would urge Deputies to give careful consideration to the case made by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech in favour of the type of low level, broadly-based turnover tax on which we have decided, against any of the other kinds of expenditure tax which we might have adopted and which are operated in other European countries.</P>
      <P>There are details which have yet to be worked out.  The Government's proposals will come before the Dáil in the Finance Bill and may I say that, subject to securing the revenue at which the tax is aimed, the Minister for Finance will be prepared to consider fully any representations that are made in the House, or may in the meantime be conveyed to him by organisations of retail traders, because it will be in all our interests to get this turnover tax working as smoothly and as harmoniously as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I just want to say a few words about what the Budget contains in respect of social welfare services.  I was proud yesterday, as I am sure were all members of my Party, when the Minister for Finance was able to say that every Budget during the past four years provided for increases in old age pensions and other pensions and for higher unemployment assistance. This Budget does the same.  It is true that the individual increases in <Col N="320" /> each year were not very considerable. I have said before that it will never be possible to have a great leap forward in respect of these social welfare services and we must aim at improving them step by step.  I accept that the level of our social welfare services does not compare favourably with that of other neighbouring countries in Europe.  We realise very well that these countries are much wealthier than we are but nevertheless the aim of policy must be not merely to improve these services in line with the improvement of living conditions generally in the country, but to do better than that and try to bring them up nearer to those prevailing in other countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced in his Budget speech that he was setting aside a sum of money for an increase in the social insurance payments. Now, he did not indicate what that increase would be.  May I say that in the Government's view the increase in these social insurance benefits should not be less than double the increase in the non-contributory benefits, but this is a matter which will be settled in consultation with workers' and employers' representatives.  It will be appreciated that, under our system of social insurance, one-third of the cost is paid by the State, one-third by the workers through their contributions, and one-third by the employers. As the contributions of workers and employers must be increased in order to make higher benefits possible, they must be given the opportunity of expressing their views and, if they should wish to secure a greater increase in the rates of benefits than the 5/- which I have indicated and are prepared to accept increased contributions to bring that about, the Government would be prepared to consider it.</P>
    <P>In this country, the Government pay a higher proportion of these social welfare charges than other European countries. It is only in Britain and here that there is this system of one-thirds, where an obligation is accepted by the Government to pay one-third of the cost of benefits.  In fact, we pay something more than that and it is higher even than in Britain.  In most other <Col N="321" /> European countries, the position is that the State contributes a very small amount of the amount contributed in benefits and the main charge falls on the workers and employers.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;better opportunities for education and cultural development generally and a steady strengthening of the security of livelihood of all.  All these are great advantages which we can have if we are prepared to spend money on them, prepared to invest in them, prepared to divert to these national purposes some part of our larger resources resulting from our economic growth.  We cannot have progress on easy terms.  This is not a time for rest but for exertion; this is not a time for retrenchment but expansion, not a time for timidity but courage.  We have experienced in recent years all the excitement of a vigorous growth and all the stimulus of new hopes.</P>
      <P>Some of our national critics used to say that we as a people always proceeded by spurts and stops, that we lack the stamina for a sustained effort.  We can prove to them how wrong they are by the manner in which we face up to the opportunities which now face us.  For this Government there is no other course.  We have tried always to lead the country forward.  We have never told it that there was a time to rest and, certainly, never told it there was a time to give way or fall back.  We are fully committed to the programme for economic and social progress which the Budget is framed to implement.  We hope it will make possible a still bolder, a still more ambitious programme for future years when the nation has generated the new resources to make it feasible.  We are proud of what we have done but it represents only a small part of our hopes.  The future must see still greater achievements.</P>
      <P>So far as the Budget is concerned, therefore, we present it to the Dáil and to the country as marking a further and important stage in the nation's economic and social progress, a solid foundation on which the future prosperity of the nation can be built.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this Budget discussion is the manner in which the Fianna Fáil Party, like so <Col N="323" /> many well-drilled zombies, applaud the Government decision to increase food costs and the cost of basic essentials on the people of this country. This is the third time in the past 12 years that a Fianna Fáil Government, by deliberate, positive, Government action, have imposed increases on the price of food, fuel and clothing.  I hope the Taoiseach did not intend it as the slick political argument that it sounded when he said that this turnover tax was not a tax on any commodity at all.  It is not a tax on any single commodity.  In fact, it is a tax on all commodities.  A far better description of it than a turnover tax would be an &ldquo;all-over&rdquo; tax because it is quite clear that the result of the tax which the Government propose to impose will be to increase the price of every article, every line of goods that one can visualise.  That is deliberate Government policy.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary shakes his head.  That may be an eloquent gesture of what he thinks of the turnover tax or it may be an eloquent expression of the Government's attitude in relation to the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary already quoted in this House this afternoon and which I hope to quote again.</P>

      <P>The fact of the matter is that it is quite clear, and it makes nonsense of the Government's intentions if it is not clear, that practically every article that one can think of will be increased in price under this proposal and the tragedy of it for the ordinary people is that it is clear also from the figures quoted by the Minister for Finance in his Financial Statement yesterday that the Government intend collecting threequarters of that total amount of this turnover tax from the essential commodities, food, fuel and clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his Financial Statement stated that if he did not include the basic essentials food, fuel and clothing in his turnover tax, the amount of the tax would require to be, not 6d. in the £, but 2/-in the £. In face of that, I cannot be <Col N="324" /> challenged when I say that it is the intention of the Government to raise three-quarters of the £10½ million which they intend or hope to get in a full year under this taxation, by increased food prices, increased fuel prices and increased clothing prices.

      <P>Let us get back to the Fianna Fáil record on prices.  I have stated this is the third time in the past 12 years and, oddly enough, it seems to be in six year cycles, that Fianna Fáil introduced Budget proposals deliberately designed to increase the price of food and other essential commodities.  Deputies will remember that Fianna Fáil first started on this road in their first Budget when they were returned to office following the 1951 general election and that as a result of their activities in that Budget, when they, without entirely removing them, interfered with the food subsidies so that the 2 lb. loaf was increased in price, butter, sugar <Col N="326" /> and flour were increased in price. Butter went from 2/6d. to 4/2d. and bread from 6d. or 6½d. to 9½d.  Flour went up from 2/8d. a bag to over 4/-.</P>

That continued until 1957 when Fianna Fáil, having fought another general election and having taken some pains to assure the public that there was nothing further from their minds than to allow essential commodities to go up in price or to remove the food subsidies, immediately removed the food subsidies on returning to office, with a resultant saving of £9 million, which, in effect, meant that £9 million a year was taken out of the taxpayers' pockets by means of increased prices for food and other essential commodities. Now, six years later, by means of what they choose to call a turnover tax, Fianna Fáil are again increasing the price of virtually every article, but certainly food, fuel and clothing.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary would look up his copy of the Budget Statement, at page 50, for example, he will find the Minister said:</P>
      <P>It is because the tax will apply to all retail sales, with the few exceptions indicated, that it is possible to have a rate as low as 6d. in the £. If food, clothing and fuel were to be excepted, a rate of up to 2/- in the £ would be necessary to produce the same yield.</P>

      <P>The Minister's boast was that it was the cheapest tax ever, that as far as administration costs were concerned, they would be negligible. <Col N="327" /> That simple sum in arithmetic is there on page 50 where the Minister said that if food, clothing and fuel were excepted, it would be 2/- in the £ instead of 6d.</P>

      <P>That means the Minister is hoping to get threequarters of his tax from those commodities. Whatever he is getting out of it, there is no doubt that food, clothing and fuel, which are regarded as basic essentials, will be subject to this tax.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would stop shaking his head like a Buddha going wrong and let me know what is in his mind, I might be able to help him.

      <P>That is just slick politics.  Of course there is a tax on all of them.  Let us hear what the Parliamentary Secretary had to say last month, and how good he is as a political prophet.  A few weeks ago, on 23rd March, the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> had a report of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech to a Fianna Fáil cumann in Boyle.  This is the report in that newspaper of what the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>In the next few weeks and months, the Budget would be the main topic of conversation and he wished the members of the cumann to have all the facts at their fingertips.</P>
      <P>The facts were to be at their fingertips. Let us see how the facts correspond with the facts as we know them now. The Parliamentary Secretary went on to say at Boyle:</P>
      <P>There would be no increase on those items which were already perhaps overtaxed, items such as beer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Does beer escape this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>If the Deputy did not, presumably one of his colleagues did and gave him the benefit of his enlightened reading.  The Parliamentary Secretary said in Boyle there would be no increase on items such as beer, cigarettes, petrol, spirits and so on.  He is wrong there, of course.  The report goes on to quote him as saying:</P>
      <P>The increases would be on luxurious goods and semi-luxurious goods.</P>
      <P>Mind you, these are the Parliamentary Secretary's words, not mine.  He said the increases would be on goods such as jewellery, furs and expensive motor cars, items already taxed in Britain and the Continent.  Now the Parliamentary Secretary uses the slick political argument that this Budget does not impose a tax on any of these items.  It does not&mdash;it imposes a tax on all of them. If he wants to use the slick argument that identified articles are not specifically covered, will he tell me where in the Minister's statement this differentiation is made?</P>

      <P>I am letting the House have the benefit of what the <Col N="329" /> Parliamentary Secretary said behind the closed doors of a Fianna Fáil meeting at Boyle.  He said he wanted all at the meeting to have the arguments at their fingertips.  Listen to the arguments and, having listened to them and considered their full weight, lay alongside them the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance.  Then, if you are in the mood for such mental exercise, perhaps you could spend a couple of days, or better still a couple of weeks, trying to reconcile the two. You could even get the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary into a room and have a discussion with them and see if the two will come back afterwards and sit on the same bench.  The report says that the Parliamentary Secretary told the Boyle meeting:</P>
      <P>The taxes were being imposed on luxurious and semi-luxurious goods. There was increased expenditure, but he had no objection to spending money so long as it was being spent on the economic development of the country.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary went on to say that the increases would go towards higher agricultural grants, towards tourism and other things, including vocational education.  He also said they could not tax agriculture or industry any more.  Why did he not whisper that to the Minister for Finance before he came in here yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what the Budget has done with regard to taxation or non-taxation, as the case may be, in agriculture and in industry.  It is well known that Fianna Fáil spokesmen over the years, led, I think, by the present Tánaiste when he was Minister for Finance, have held as one of their cogent tenets the fact that taxation lay lightly on the land.  I think that was the very phrase used by the Tánaiste when he was responsible for the finances of this country, and the Taoiseach in his speech this afternoon seemed to me to be leaning very much to that theme&mdash; that taxation lay lightly on the land. Unless I am very much mistaken, it was the Taoiseach himself who coined the phrase about the featherbed condition <Col N="330" /> of the farmers, and yet we had the Parliamentary Secretary saying at Boyle that they could not tax agriculture or industry any further.</P>
    <P>How does agriculture fare under this Budget?  I think I am correct in saying that for the first time any farmer who carries on any other trade will now find he must pay income tax at the full rate on the earnings from the farm rather than pay income tax on the valuation.  That is one of the provisions being made in this Budget.  Yet according to the Parliamentary Secretary, there was to be no new tax on agriculture.  Of course, every farmer who buys a commodity in a shop will pay increased taxation anyway because of this turnover tax.</P>
    <P>What about industry?  Have businessmen and industrialists escaped, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands forecast they would escape?  Will he seriously argue that there is no increased taxation on industry in this Budget with the increase in corporation profits tax and so on?  Yet, it was only a few weeks ago that we had the Parliamentary Secretary telling his people in his constituency: I want you to have the arguments at your fingertips.  There is going to be no increase in beer, no increase on cigarettes, no increase in taxation on agriculture, no increase in taxation on industry and the only things that will be taxed are the luxuries, expensive motor cars, furs and jewellery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not the only things.  The Parliamentary Secretary wanted to condition the Party members in the area and the report goes on:</P>
      <P>Mr. Lenihan said he was telling the members these things so that they could all act as propagandists for the Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget has been introduced but Deputy Lenihan wants the propagandists to go to work.  He wants them to forget the fact that the prices of food, <Col N="331" /> fuel, clothing, beer and tobacco and all the rest will be increased under the provisions of this Budget when implemented.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but the Parliamentary Secretary wants us to have arguments at our fingertips and there is only one way to have them at your fingertips and that is to keep drumming them home.  Then he went on:</P>
      <P>They would meet criticism but he wanted them to remember that most, the vast majority, of the people from whom criticism would come were anti-nationals.</P>
      <P>He was conditioning them in advance. If there was a breath of criticism against this Budget which was going to tax expensive motor cars, furs and jewellery, they could say that the man who was criticising was anti-national. That was their line and it is a very clever line.  If you cannot defend the Budget to be introduced by the Minister for Finance, set up some ninepins to knock down.  Try to get the people's minds off the Budget, off the fact that they are going to pay more for food and fuel and clothing and get them to call those who criticise the Budget or criticise Fianna Fáil, anti-national. They were to keep that at their fingertips.  That was the recommendation given by the Parliamentary Secretary to his organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he felt it necessary to stick out his chest a little, as the Taoiseach did here today.  It was not enough to say <Col N="332" /> that everyone who criticised the Budget, or the vast majority of them, to use the Parliamentary Secretary's phrase, were anti-national, but apparently he did some research and he gave the Party members gathered in Boyle the benefit of his conclusions. He says, in continuation :</P>
    <P>One found that the people who support Fianna Fáil came from a national background.</P>
    <P>So now you have the position that anyone who is in the room with the Parliamentary Secretary or who supports Fianna Fáil, can get from the Parliamentary Secretary a certificate as coming from a national background, but if anyone raises his voice against the Budget, if anyone protests against the Budget increases on food, fuel and clothing he is to be called anti-national and you should not argue with him but tell him that he is anti-national.</P>

      <P>Mr. Lenihan said he was telling the members these things so that they could all act as propagandists.

      <P>Oh, no.  Let us not misunderstand each other.  According to this report, Mr. B. Lenihan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, attended a meeting of Boyle comhairle ceanntair in the Courthouse, <Col N="333" /> Boyle, at which there was an excellent attendance of delegates from surrounding areas.  The meeting was described by Mr. Lenihan as the best he had ever seen in the area.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to meet the criticism which was bound to come. I do not want to omit anything. The Party had always had a national outlook.  It was always thinking of the interests of all the people and of the country rather than of a certain section of the people.  That was the main difference between them and other Parties in the country.  They were a national organisation and anything they did was in the national interest&mdash;no argument about it; the boss has spoken.  He went on&mdash;and this is the bit Deputy Briscoe wanted to hear again&mdash;and he said that in the next few weeks and months the Budget would be the main topic of conversation and he wished them all to have the facts at their fingertips&mdash;do you want me to go over that again ?</P>

      <P>I do not think the Taoiseach dealt with the question of the 100,000 new jobs the Fianna Fáil Government were to provide.  I missed portion of his speech but I did not hear him proclaim that his Government had achieved price stabilisation. I did not hear him claim that the Government have succeeded in effecting the economies which we were told about some years ago, nor did I hear him claim that they had brought about a reduction in the number of civil servants.  But we did hear a lot of talk about unemployment and emigration. I do not know whether I misheard the Taoiseach or took him up wrongly but I understood him to express the wish that the Dáil would agree with him that two of the big national problems were still unemployment and emigration. This is six years after the Fianna Fáil Party spoke of a plan of 100,000 new jobs, spoke of having been elected to office for the purpose of ending unemployment and emigration.</P>
      <P>On 14th May, 1957, in Column 144 of the Official Report, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to the mandate of the Government.  I do not know if there is any purpose to be served by discussing what our mandate was but I and my colleagues have no doubt in our minds that we became the Government because the people expect us to work determinedly and intelligently to bring about a situation in which employment would be expanded and in which the twin problems of unemployment <Col N="335" /> and emigration would be vigorously tackled.</P>
    <P>The result of six years of effort in that direction is that we have fewer people in employment.  I do not think the Taoiseach or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party can claim that emigration has been reduced since they came back to office in face of the preliminary reports of the 1961 census which show that in the census period 1956 to 1961, a total of 215,641 people left this country.  At the end of six years of what the Taoiseach hoped would be determined and intelligent action on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party, we have fewer people at work in this country at the moment and between 200,000 and 250,000 people have left the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare came into the House the following day and on 15th May, 1957, at column 1283, he recorded his view of why Fianna Fáil were back in Government in this country when he said :</P>
    <P>In my opinion and in the opinion of any fairminded person who, even now, goes back and looks over the speeches made in the general election, it is beyond all doubt that we were put in here as a Government to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation of mass unemployment and emigration brought about by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>How did they do that?  There are more people out of work today and there are just as many people going across the seas, if not many more.  I may have misheard the Taoiseach but I understood him to say that today, six years later, the Taoiseach rightly regards the question of unemployment and emigration as a major national problem.  Remember that when he and his Party were going before the people six years ago in the general election of that time, they went as the Party who were going to end unemployment, create 100,000 new jobs, and put a stop to emigration.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party at one time used to play themselves up as the friends of the workers.  I wonder how the workers will regard their friends in Fianna Fáil today when, once again, a <Col N="336" /> Fianna Fáil Government, deliberately by budgetary policy and action, have increased the cost of the essentials of life&mdash;food, fuel and clothing.</P>

      <P>What does this turnover tax mean, if that is not so?  Why is there all this paraphernalia about compensatory provisions because of the increase in the cost of living?  Why did the Minister for Finance honestly and specifically point to the fact that the reason the rate of the turnover tax is as low as 6d. is that food, fuel and clothing are to be included in it?  If it were not for that, a rate of 2/- in the £1 would be necessary to produce the same result.</P>

      <P>So far as the provisions of this Budget are concerned, it means, in the first place, that virtually all goods, including the basic essentials, will go up in price. The Fianna Fáil Government will deliberately put them up in price by means of their turnover tax.  They are leaving it to the retailer to recoup himself and, as there is no price control machinery to operate in conjunction with this tax, there is nothing to prevent the retailer from evening-off any fractional discrepancy there may be in his own favour.</P>
      <P>Unless I misunderstood him, I think the recommendation by the Minister for Finance in the course of the discussion yesterday was that retailers might find it more suitable to put larger increases on some commodities and a smaller increase on other commodities rather than to work out fractions for an increase of 6d. in the £ over all commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, a major feature of this Budget for many people, particularly for many widows throughout the country, will be the taxation on rents. It could be argued that there was no reason other than a social one which possibly is not applicable today why a differential of taxation of rents should accrue from business lettings and from residential lettings.  The fact is that, all through the years, up to now, there has been that differential in the taxation imposed on business rents and residential rents.  If the letting was for residential purposes, the ordinary income tax schedule was not charged. The result of that has been that in a number of cases where a father of a family died, leaving a widow to fend for herself and possibly to care for some young children, it was often a worthwhile investment for that woman to let her house either entirely in one letting or to let it in residential flats and to secure for herself an income out of those lettings, secure in the knowledge that the income which she was getting in and which she required to keep herself and her family and possibly to educate some of the <Col N="338" /> younger children would not be subject to income tax in the same way as income from other sources.</P>
    <P>Let us recognise what we are doing now.  With a few saving provisions, that is going by the board.  There are some modifications.  I think I am correct in saying that in some cases, up to a maximum of £200, only 60 per cent of the rent will be returnable and that in other cases of non-controlled lettings, a reduction of 20 per cent is allowed, subject to a maximum of £100.  However, a very substantial alteration in the tax law and the tax code is being effected by this proposal. It will affect a great number of people who can least afford to be hit once more by the Fianna Fáil Party when they get cracking on taxation.  It will affect people who deliberately, because it was an attractive type of investment and a source of income, put their money into those kinds of lettings in the past.  Now, with little or no warning, that will be overturned, rather than turned over, in the new tax code that is being imposed.  These people were entitled to expect a bit more from the Government because this is one of the matters dealt with by the Income Tax Commission.</P>
    <P>I have not got the Report of the Commission or the Government comment here but I am quoting from an article in today's <i>Irish Times</i> under the title &ldquo;Economic Comment&rdquo; by Mr. Garret FitzGerald in which he says:</P>
    <P>The other tax increase in the Budget affects income from the rents of unfurnished residential lettings, which are at present free of Schedule D income tax, and merely subject to a nominal tax on a notional rent under Schedule A.  This tax change was recommended by the Income Tax Commission, on condition, <i>inter alia,</i> that the amount assessable in the case of rent-controlled premises be reduced so as to take account of the extent to which rent income is reduced by control.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on:</P>
    <P>This recommendation was rejected in strong terms by the Government two years ago, on the <Col N="339" /> grounds that it would be quite impracticable to assess on a case-by-case basis the effect of rent control on rents, &ldquo;and the adoption of a common multiplier would result in obvious inequalities of treatment. ... Accordingly&mdash;</P>
    <P>this is a quotation, apparently&mdash;</P>
    <P>the Government do not propose to alter the existing income tax position before control under the Rent Restrictions Acts is substantially relaxed or abolished.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, within two years of that rejection by the Government, the whole thing is changed.</P>
    <P>In the meanwhile, consider the position of people, particularly of the type I am referring to here&mdash;the widow who is suddenly bereft of the breadwinner of the family, who had to get some source of income to maintain herself and her children and who adopted as an attractive method this one of letting out the house either in whole or in residential lettings.  She was encouraged to do that in the knowledge that the Government had specifically rejected any notion of altering the basis of taxation which applied in her case.</P>
    <P>The third, I think, main provision in this Budget will affect the farming community.  Take the farmer who carries on any other trade or business as well as the farm.  He will now find&mdash;perhaps not certainly but very likely&mdash;that he will be assessed in the ordinary way with full income tax on his earnings out of the farm as well as on his earnings out of whatever trade or business he engages in.  The Government changed their mind with regard to the purchase tax.  Again, I refer to the same article by Mr. Garret FitzGerald in today's <i>Irish Times</i>.  It is only a comparatively short while since the idea of a purchase tax &mdash;I do not think it matters whether you call it a purchase tax, a sales tax or a turnover tax&mdash;did not commend itself to the Government.  Mr. Fitzgerald in his article says:</P>
    <P>As for the retail tax itself it may be worth quoting earlier official views on this type of tax.  In <i>Economic <Col N="340" /> Development</i> Mr. Whitaker suggested that &ldquo;a general purchase tax would have an immediate reaction on sales of Irish products and would probably, in the end, have inflationary effects on wages and salaries and the cost of living&rdquo;, while in their White Paper on Direct Taxation just two years ago, the Government said that the introduction of a purchase tax, as recommended by the Income Tax Commission, bringing in about £6,000,000 a year, would be sociably undesirable if employed as a partial substitue for income tax, adding that &ldquo;its economic effects might also be adverse: the prices of taxed goods would be increased and, through compensatory raising of money incomes, costs might be increased and competitive capacity affected with risk to exports and employment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government have changed their mind on that also.  One of the features of this turnover tax is that the Government intend raising approximately £3½ million by means of that tax this year, in four months, and that, according to the figures given by the Minister for Finance in the course of the discussion here yesterday, they expect to raise £10½ million in a full year.  The Minister having gradually gone through the Budget Statement, dealt with the narrowing of the gap here and the increasing of the gap there, eventually arrived at a stage in his Budget speech where there was a gap to be bridged of £3½ million and the bridge to be used was this turnover tax.  That is all right for this year but the incidence of taxation has been increased.  A sum of £10½ million will be collected from that tax in a full year, £6½ million or £7 million more than the gap which the Minister wants to bridge.  Therefore under these Budget proposals when they are implemented, the level of taxation is being raised unnecessarily by approximately £7 million and that is being done in respect of the necessaries of life, food, fuel and clothing.  Once the level of taxation is raised, everyone will agree that it will be extremely difficult to bring it down again within&mdash;to use an expression which I do not like using <Col N="341" /> but which is an appropriate one&mdash;the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are deliberately raising the level of taxation.  They are deliberately setting about the taking of approximately £7 million more than they require to balance the Budget. In return for the increased cost to the consumer in relation to the ordinary commodities being purchased each day, compensatory benefits are being given by way of social welfare and children's allowances, and so on, amounting to £4½ million in a full year.  Do the Government think that will compensate the people from whom they are taking £10½ million through this one tax alone?  A sum of £13 million or £14 million in the year in new taxation will be taken from people under this Budget and they are given back in return a compensatory provision of £4½ million.</P>
    <P>In the context of the wage freeze policy in which this Budget is being introduced, do the Government seriously think that the people are so well off that they can afford to give a present of £10 million to the Government and not to seek some redress for it? That is what the Government are asking them to do.  They produced a short while ago their White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> which, robbed of its finery, was simply a wage-freeze policy, the old wage-freeze policy of Fianna Fáil, that State servants and people of that description would not get increases. Having done that, they now load another £13 million or £14 million worth of taxation on to the backs of the people.  Is it any wonder that the people will feel that Fianna Fáil are not giving them a fair crack of the whip in this Budget?  I do not want to say any more here.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will take my advice and endeavour to reconcile his differences with the Minister for Finance in regard to forecasting Fianna Fáil financial policy.</P>

      <P>We in the Labour Party believe that the number of people at work is the test of economic progress.  Bearing that in mind, it is <Col N="342" /> only proper that we should have regard to what progress has been made in putting people to work.  In 1955, there were 1,181,000 people at work and in 1962, there were 1,119,000 people at work.  That is a drop of 62,000.  This year, we are told by the Minister for Finance that there is an increase of 7,000 in the number of people in nonagricultural employment.  He did not mention that there was a drop of 19,000 people employed in agriculture, leaving a total drop in employment of 12,000 people.  That does not give any ground for the Minister's boast in relation to the 7,000 people.  Coupled with that figure must be the number of people leaving school and seeking employment.  There were thousands of such people.  We must bear in mind the Government's slogan at the last election appealing to wives to get their husbands out to work and promising 100,000 new jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking this afternoon, the Taoiseach said this Budget was designed for future years.  He indicated it was planned to have better social welfare benefits, educational, health and public services.  Having regard to the operations of the different Ministers and their Departments, there is no indication that that is on the horizon.  The absence of liaison between the different Ministers is to be deplored.  The Taoiseach referred to the importance of teaching people their jobs.  He indicated that the unskilled worker is on the way out and that we will have to teach more people their jobs.  That brings us to the Department of Education and the plans in relation to that matter.  It reminds me of the absence of planning in connection with vocational education.  It reminds me of the lack of liaison between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Education in the matter of educating the worker for the job.  The Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible for the operation of the Apprenticeship Act, but there are insufficient vocational schools to take all the apprentices released on a day release scheme.  We have one Minister putting a plan into operation, while the other Minister is not ready for it.  We must have regard to the <Col N="343" /> extraordinary delay we have experienced in the matter of workmen's compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an indication in the Budget that there will be an increase in non-contributory pensions and in unemployment assistance.  There is no indication of any increase in the health services.  I want to find out what will be the effect of the turnover tax on drugs and medicines.  How will a chemist operate it?  We know the chemists have their own technique for making up prescriptions and making charges.  Does it not mean that the chemist will simply pass on this tax to the consumer, in particular to the person least able to bear it ?</P>
      <P>The increase given to people on unemployment assistance will amount to 5/- in respect of a married man with a dependent wife.  If he is living in a Dublin Corporation house, immediately he gets that 5/- a sum of 10d. out of it will be added on to his differential rent.  Is the Minister prepared to make an arrangement with Dublin Corporation to ensure that that is not done?  The increase in the non-contributory pensions means that 5d. of it will go in the differential rent.  Is there any arrangement made to ensure that there will be no adverse effect on the benefits obtained by way of home assistance?  There is no point in giving something with one hand and taking it back with two hands.  On the occasion of striking the rate, we succeeded in preventing 5d. being put on to differential rents.  Some attempt should be made to prevent its being taken out of this 2/6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> Can the Minister tell us what exactly will be the effect of the turnover tax on people making purchases ? What will happen to the person who purchases ten cigarettes?  Will it be left to the shopkeeper to determine whether he puts on the tax or not? What will happen to the badly-off person who has to buy a lb. of margarine, a loaf of bread, a quarter of rashers or a quarter of tea&mdash;all generally used in working-class homes ?  Will this tax allow some shopkeepers to &ldquo;go to town&rdquo; on their customers?  It is all very well for the Minister for Finance to say it is introducing an element of competition and that the tax will not be passed on in the way I fear.  In Finglas West, portion of my constituency, there are six shops catering for thousands of people.  They can charge what they like.  How will the tax be collected ? Who will pay it?  It is important that we get an answer to such questions.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a married man with £8 a week.  We are left to assume he will pay 4/- in tax.  If he has three children, he will benefit by the children's allowances to the extent of approximately 3/-.  He loses a shilling on the deal each week.  This is a man barely eking out an existence.  I would venture to say that no Minister could work out a satisfactory budget to show how such a man could live in reasonable comfort on £8 a week.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said it was all very well to criticise taxation and not make any suggestions.  We in the Labour Party have repeatedly made suggestions as to how taxation should be imposed. We have no hesitation in saying that the emphasis in relation to taxation should be on wealth.  Fianna Fáil on this occasion have succeeded in doing something which is unique. They have brought every man into the orbit of taxes and people who never paid taxes before are now to be called upon to pay them.  They have been paying them indirectly but now they are to pay them more directly.  While the tax is described as a turnover tax, a more appropriate name would be the &ldquo;twist tax&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the major complaints I have <Col N="345" /> to make about it is in regard to the absence of information and the absence of clarity, the failure of the Minister to indicate clearly the effects this taxation will have on the ordinary people. One has been led to believe that the man on the lowest rung of the ladder will benefit as a result of this tax imposition but do we not all know that if it is to be a tax on purchases and the man in the shop has to account for it, he will pass it on?  Prior to the Budget, there was talk about <i>Closing the Gap,</i> and some people called it a wage pause, but I feel that this turnover tax is an invitation to working-class people to start another round of increases.  I feel they will be left with no option but to do that, in the absence of clarity and in the absence of price control.  If there were price control in relation to this tax, one could have very little complaint to make about it.</P>
    <P>I noticed yesterday when the Minister was being pressed for information that he shrugged his shoulders and did not express any concern about price control.  Maybe it is not too late to ask for something to be done in regard to the control of prices.  If not, surely we will have shopkeepers and other traders being afforded the opportunity to pass on the tax, and more than the tax, to the consumer.  You will also find that it will be passed on in rent.  I wonder will the ESB pass it on, or will the gas company pass it on?  Can we not be told how exactly this is to be done?  Are we correct in believing that under no circumstances will the ordinary man-in-the-street have to pay the tax but that in fact the man who has the business will be the taxpayer?  I do not believe that.  It has not been conveyed to me in that way.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Sherwin said that the poorest people will benefit.  I do not believe that.  I believe that the poorest people will come out the worst because they can afford it least.  If I am not correct, the Minister should explain to what extent the poor, the unemployed and the people in meagrely-paid employment can meet this increased taxation. Deputy Norton made a very good point yesterday to which he did not get an answer, although it was <Col N="346" /> something which was crying out for an answer.  He referred to the man who spends in shillings and not in pounds. He asked how the tax would be met and he said that if that man spent twenty single shillings, the tax would be 1/8.  If it is 1/8, it will mean that the old age pensioner will get 2/6 to meet that 1/8 out of each £1 and along with that he will have to pay an increased differential rent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that strikes me about this Budget is the lack of desire of Fianna Fáil members to contribute to the debate.  We are now only in the second day of the debate and we find two Ministers in the House with no backbenchers to support them.  Their absence from the House is peculiar and it is peculiar that they do not want to contribute in some way or other, either constructively or destructively.  I think they are only now beginning to find out what is in the Budget.  Personally, I think it is one of the worst Budgets introduced in this State since its foundation.  This is the first time in the history of the State that the poorer classes are being taxed.  A single man earning up to £6 a week is free of income tax but now he is to pay 2½ per cent on everything he purchases with that £6.  It is a very bad principle indeed that we should start this retail tax with a tax on the poorer classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands inferred that no additional taxes were being imposed in this Budget but what does this turnover tax of 2½ per cent mean? It means that on every retail article, and on every personal service, the consumer must pay 2½ per cent.  I am thinking of the impact this will have on the poorer people in West Donegal and on the western seaboard generally. I am going to single out in particular a very famous cooperative society situated in Dungloe and founded by a very famous man known as &ldquo;Paddy the Cope&rdquo;.  The turnover of that society for the past number of years has been in the neighbourhood of £200,000 annually.  At least 95 per cent of their sales are retail.  They were not required to pay income tax <Col N="347" /> or corporation profits tax of any description.  They pay a dividend of five per cent on their profits.  Now, the Templecrone Co-operative Society from November 1st will be required to pay 2½ per cent retail tax on their gross turnover.  In other words, if the turnover remains at £200,000, they will have to pay £5,000 a year as a retail tax.  Naturally, that will be passed on to the consumer.  In addition to that, they will be required to pay income tax just the same as a private company or an individual, for the first time ever.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister may say to me that they will not be required to pay income tax on what may be regarded purely as agricultural merchandise but unfortunately this society do not deal in what may be described as purely agricultural merchandise. They have endeavoured down through the years to supply the poorer people of West Donegal with all commodities necessary to life at a minimum of profit.  As I say, all they could pay was a five per cent dividend but here, by one fell stroke of the pen, 2½ per cent&mdash;in other words, £5,000 a year&mdash;will be taken from them and will be put into revenue.  In addition, they will pay income tax.  That is a very serious matter for the poorer people served by that co-operative society.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon pointed out today, no indication whatsoever was given that this sales tax would be imposed on the poorer people and in case people have forgotten what it means, I may say it means 1½d. on the 1b. of tea, a shilling on a pair of shoes, a penny on a lb. of butter, 1½d. on a gallon of petrol, a penny on a glass of whiskey and a penny on a packet of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister saying the retailer will not pass that on to his customer.  A retailer who is living on a turnover with a small profit must pass it on to the consumer and the co-operative societies to which I refer are living on a small profit and must therefore pass this on to the consumer. I know the Minister says he is <Col N="348" /> not going to control the amount the retailer may pass on to the consumer and the retailer will certainly ensure that he is not at a loss.  So, therefore, it is the consumer who must pay.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister has kindly told the House that for the poorer type of consumer, he is making provision for this tax.  He is giving to the old age pensioner an extra 2/6d.  Incidentally, it is only to the non-contributory old age pensioner.  He is giving to the unemployed person an extra 2/6d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that it is as a result of the criticism of the Financial Statement that these matters have been worked out.  However, an extra 2/6d. is being given to the blind pensioner and to the widow. The Minister tells us that this will compensate for the retail tax.  Is the Minister serious in telling us that an old age pensioner can live in 1963 on 35/- a week?  Is the Minister telling us that a widow can live on 35/- a week? Is it not quite plain that there must be some subsidiary amount, be it from family earnings in England or elsewhere, to the old age pension to enable pensioners to live and is it not further necessary to pay 2½ per cent on whatever subsidiary amount is available to the pensioner?  So that 2/6d. could not possibly make up for the 2½ per cent retail tax on the actual cost of living of an old age pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thought, just as the <i>Evening Press</i> last night thought, that we would accept this extra 2/6d. without inquiring into the reason for its <Col N="349" /> being granted.  Most of the Press yesterday evening were misled by the Minister's speech.  They thought it was a standstill in so far as essential foodstuffs and clothing were concerned. It is only when people began to realise the meaning of this 2½ per cent retail tax that they were able to appreciate the Minister's gesture in giving the extra 2/6d. a week to pensioners.</P>
    <P>What about the poor unfortunate who is earning only £6 10s. or £7 a week ?  He barely exists on it.  I am thinking of the roadworker.  He, certainly, has no savings out of £7 per week and he has to pay this additional tax of 1½d. on a lb. of tea, a shilling on a pair of shoes, a penny on butter, a penny on a glass of whiskey and a penny on a package of cigarettes. He has got to pay the tax but there is no increase of wages for him.</P>
    <P>What about the civil servants ? There is no increase in income for them.  If the Government had got away with the White Paper, there would have been a standstill order in so far as they were concerned.</P>
    <P>This is the beginning of agitation for a ninth round increase in wages. There is not the slightest doubt about that.  This retail tax is the greatest blister that has been placed on the people for quite a while.  Not only are the people taxed on the essential foodstuffs but they are also taxed in respect of essential services.  The barber is taxed at a rate of 2½ per cent on his gross takings.  It is a personal service which he renders.  The barber has to pay 2½ per cent tax on his takings, irrespective of whether they are £6, £5, £8 or £9 a week. The ladies' hairdresser has to pay 2½ per cent retail tax on the fees she earns for the personal service she gives to her clients and naturally she will pass it on to her clients.  All these things must be added up if we are to find the real impact of the Budget on the citizens.</P>
    <P>Again, there is a very subtle section in the Minister's Financial Statement, at page 57:</P>
    <P>A loophole in the existing law which will be closed relates to the case where a person, who engages <Col N="350" /> in a trade or profession and is taxed on actual profits under Schedule D engages also in farming which is charged under Schedule B.  Where a question arises as to the adequacy, having regard to the person's standard of living and financial position, of the amount of business profits returned he may allege that the apparent discrepancy is accounted for by large profits from farming. Since his farming profits are taxed on a notional basis under Schedule B the taxpayer has nothing to lose by overstating them.  A new section will provide that farming operations in such cases shall be assessed under Schedule D by reference to actual profits.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  It means that the small farmers of the west of Ireland who could not possibly eke out an existence on their farms unless their incomes were supplemented by some business or other&mdash;shop, publichouse, hackney car or petrol pump&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is one crowd I am very glad to see included under this tax and that is the dancehall proprietors.  I am very glad indeed they will not escape.  I remember a time when there was a 10 per cent tax on dancing and when a certain amount of revenue&mdash;something in the <Col N="355" /> region of £150,000&mdash;was realised.

The Minister knows that all companies produce a balance sheet annually.  They pay dividends, distribute profits, retaining certain profits for improvement of their machinery and their business.  Where are they now to find the money to pay the arrears of corporation tax ?  I know one firm in this city, a very big firm, that finds itself &ldquo;in the red&rdquo; to the extent of £30,000 which it must draw from the bank to pay the arrears.</P>

It is a poor state of affairs when you find a Deputy leaving his own city and tramping the streets of Dublin looking for a pair of Irish socks.  I am certain the shopkeepers of Cobh or of Cork could produce Irish socks and, if necessary, handknit Irish socks, and yet the Deputy comes here, to what is known as the dirty city, trying to get a pair of clean socks. He will pay 2½ per cent on those socks from now on and not only that but the farm-labourer who works for him will pay 2½ per cent on his socks, provided he has them.</P>

      <P>Another aspect of this matter which worries me is the impact of this retail tax on food supplies and other items supplied to hospitals and other local authority institutions. I do not think we can classify purveyors of food supplies to hospitals as wholesalers ; they must be described, I fear, as retailers and therefore on all supplies to hospitals and other local authority institutions, there will be a 2½ per cent retail tax.  That is a very considerable sum which will have to be borne proportionately by taxpayers and ratepayers.  Has the Minister worked out what will be the impact on the rates from November 1st next ?  It will be very heavy.  This will hit particularly the ratepayers who, in my opinion, are already taxed to capacity and who will find great difficulty in providing further funds to meet the 2½ per cent increase.</P>
      <P>I wonder what the position will be in regard to fish landed in our harbours. Will there be a 2½ per cent tax on the sale of fish?  Of course, it does mean that fish sold over the counter will be subject to the 2½ per cent but I am thinking of the retailer who sells his fish across the water.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to know that as otherwise it would be serious from our point of view on the western seaboard.  Of course, the fishmonger will have to pay 2½ per cent and he will pass that on to the fish consumers.  I do not think that will encourage the greater consumption of fish to which the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary referred.  That is serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget will hit more people and hit them next November in unexpected places. Perhaps the Minister <Col N="358" /> would define what he means by &ldquo;a very small shopkeeper&rdquo;.  He says that in the case of such a person, there will be a nominal tax of 10/- per £100 where the retail turnover is £100 per month.  Who has heard of a shopkeeper with a turnover of £100 per month ?  I do not know how we could have such a person.  Who is the &ldquo;very small shopkeeper&rdquo; referred to by the Minister in his speech?  It would be very interesting to know.</P>
    <P>I refer to page 51 of the Minister's speech where he says:</P>
    <P>There will be relief, by way of reduced rates of tax, for persons in a small way of business.  In fact, very small businesses will have to pay only a nominal charge.  The intention is to charge only a flat 5/-for the first £50 of monthly turnover and 3d. in the £ for the next £50 of monthly turnover, which would mean that a shop with sales of £100 a month would pay only 17/6d. tax a month.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister in mind what limit a small shopkeeper could go to pay on his turnover ?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I was dealing with the Budget when I was so rudely interrupted.  I would like the Minister to define what he means by a small business.  I know he has told us that it is a business with a turnover of £100 a month, making a profit of 20 per cent. I hope that every member of the Fianna Fáil Party will read the Budget carefully and be able to explain to the people of rural Ireland why they are putting 1½d. on the 1b of tea, one shilling on the pair of shoes, a penny on the 1b of butter, a penny on whiskey and a penny on cigarettes.  To make up for that the recipient of the old age pension is to get 2/6 a week.</P>
      <P>Take the case of the shopkeeper who is selling what we in the country call heavy goods such as meal, lard and feeding stuffs.  Such goods are very expensive and the profit on them is very small.  For every £100 worth of these goods, there may be only one per cent of profit.  Yet a retail tax of 2½ per cent is to be taken from that trader.  Surely the retailer must add that to the farmer's bill and therefore put up the cost of feeding stuffs throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to deal with this Budget mainly from the point of view of its effect on the recipient of social welfare.  I think it will not be a very long or difficult task to show that the net result is that this year, once again, the Budget provides for a further improvement in the position relative to the cost of living of every recipient of social welfare, both under assistance schemes and insurance schemes.  The year 1963 marks another step in the continuous progress in that regard that has been taking place under this Government. This Budget is yet one more <Col N="361" /> instance of the already well established fact that one of the many differences between Fianna Fáil and the alternative Government is that even in the most difficult circumstances we have always given practical evidence of our concern for those people who find themselves dependent on the schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare while the Opposition record in that respect is one of almost completely ignoring the duty of a Government.</P>
      <P>Last year, I showed, and other speakers on the Government benches showed, beyond any shadow of doubt, that the increases given by the present Fianna Fáil Government in regard to every social welfare service more than compensated for the increases in the cost of living.  I showed that that was so, no matter what date was given as the starting point for these comparisons. I showed that that was so, even allowing for the backlog that accumulated due to the years of neglect by the two Coalition Governments we have had.  I demonstrated clearly at the time of the Budget last year that we were making gradual progress&mdash; I admit, slow progress but continuous progress&mdash;towards the objective the Taoiseach mentioned here today of raising social welfare payments to a level that could be regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In theory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, in order to establish that this process is continued in the present Budget, it is only necessary for me to compare the position subsequent to and consequent on this Budget with the position with regard to the different social welfare services that existed immediately after the 1962 Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit I am tempted to go back a good deal further so as to show once again the contrast between the neglect of social welfare by the Coalition and the continuous development both in regard to the scope of social welfare and the level of payments under Fianna Fáil.  But, beyond reminding the Opposition that the increases given by Fianna Fáil&mdash;for instance in the <Col N="362" /> case of non-contributory old age pensions&mdash;since the War now total 15/-as against the total of 5/- granted by the two Coalition Governments and beyond reminding them that all new schemes introduced since the beginning of this Dáil to function here were introduced by Fianna Fáil and that practically all increases in every other social welfare scheme, apart from non-contributory old age pensions, were given by Fianna Fáil&mdash;beyond reminding the Opposition once again of that&mdash; I shall resist the temptation to go into any further details.</P>
    <P>I said that all I had to do, then, was to establish that the position of social welfare recipients following on this Budget is better than the position which existed following on the last Budget.  The cost of living figure for February, 1962, which was the latest figure available at the time of the 1962 Budget and on which the arguments of that time were based, was 154.  The latest figure available now is the figure for February, 1963, which was 160&mdash;an increase of 3.9 per cent.  The turnover tax, the only feature of this Budget that will affect the costs of the receipients of social welfare, is 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  There are more effects than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>So that, even if all the income from social welfare payments were affected by this turnover tax&mdash; which of course will not be the fact&mdash; the total increase necessary then to get back to the position that was established by the Budget of 1962 would be 6.4 per cent.  But, of course, the turnover tax will not fall on all expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Budget statement shows that the tax will fall on approximately 75 per cent of total personal expenditure. Therefore, if that proportion were to apply to an equal extent to social welfare recipients as well as to other classes of the community, the total increase that would be necessary to restore social welfare payments to the position that existed after the last Budget would be 5.8 per cent.  As I say, that is only if we assume that all <Col N="363" /> the items will carry the 2½ per cent equally.  I do not think it is necessarily true that that is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>Retailers will have to try to get back this 2½ per cent, which they will have to pay on their turnover, in the most efficient way in which it can be got. I think that, generally speaking, they will have sufficient intelligence to see that people who are existing at or near subsistence level are already spending as much of their income on these types of items as they can and that therefore an attempt to recover this tax by increasing the prices of necessaries is not likely to be very effective.  I feel that the intelligent retailer will make every effort to avoid increases in commodities that are necessaries and will put them, instead, on the type of item that is purchased mainly by better-off people.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while for the purpose of comparing the position of social welfare recipients now with what it was after the last Budget, I shall take the figure of 5.8 per cent as the deterioration in their position due to the cumulative effect of the increase in the cost of living and this turnover tax, I am quite certain that in actual fact there will not be that much deterioration in their condition.  I propose now, in order to show up some of the nonsense which the Opposition have been talking, to take a brief look at each of the social welfare schemes so as to compare the position as established by this Budget with that which existed after the last Budget.</P>
    <P>The increases proposed are 2/6d. per week in the personal rate and the adult dependant's rate for all the assistance schemes.  As the Minister said in his statement, this increase is applied also to the Infectious Diseases Allowances and to the Disabled Persons (Maintenance) Allowances. Apparently, Opposition Deputies did not study the Minister's statement and were not aware of this but the Taoiseach mentioned here today that provision is also made for increases in the contribution schemes which&mdash;while the details are not yet worked out&mdash;we believe should be approximately <Col N="364" /> double those for the assistance schemes.  That is for the contributory schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Which the workers will pay for as they did the last time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The workers will pay some of it, of course; the employers will pay their share of it and the general taxpayers will pay the rest, but it is as a result of the provisions of this Budget that this extra amount will be made available.  That is the mechanics of making it available, and all the money eventually comes from the people's pockets.</P>
      <P>In addition to these increases in the assistance and insurance schemes there are also the increases in children's allowances which were mentioned in the Budget statement.  These will be equivalent approximately to an increase of 2/3 per week for the family who have one child, 3/3 for a family of three children, 4/3 for a family with four children, and so on.  I propose to examine briefly the effect on each of these social welfare schemes of these increased rates in conjunction with the increases in the cost of living since the Budget of last year and in conjunction with the maximum possible effect of the proposed turnover tax, which maximum effect I do not actually expect to materialise.</P>
      <P>I suppose it would be best to start at the one social welfare scheme which any of the Opposition Deputies have the nerve to mention, the only one in which they have any record so far, even though their record in regard to that is so miserable compared with Fianna Fáil's, that is, the non-contributory old age pension scheme. At present the rate is 32/6 on which there is an increase of 2/6, which is an increase of 8 per cent.  Therefore in that scheme the net position of the pensioner after this Budget is better than that after the last Budget and, as I said, it was demonstrated clearly that at the time of the last Budget the increases that have taken place in the cost of living from any date one chose to take had been more than compensated for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the non-contributory widows' pension scheme for a widow <Col N="365" /> with no child the increase proposed is 2/6d., from 31/- to 33/6d., which is again an increase of approximately 8 per cent.  If the widow has one child the effect of the increase in the widows' pension scheme plus the increase in the children's allowance scheme will be to give her a total increase of 4/9d. on the present rate of 41/-, which is an increase of 11.6 per cent.  If she has two children, there being no extra increase for the second child, her percentage increase is 8.7 per cent.  If she has four children the increase is 6/9d. and that amounts to 9.1 per cent on her present income from the non-contributory widows' pension scheme. Therefore in that scheme also there is a net improvement in the position of the recipients.</P>
    <P>The other assistance scheme is that for unemployment assistance.  The rates here are different for rural and urban recipients.  I am taking the figures for urban receipients ; of course, the rural figures are less and the increases given are the same so that the percentage in the case of rural people will be higher.  Here again the increase for a single man is 2/6d. on the present rate of 24/-, an increase of 10.4 per cent.  If he is married the increase is 5/-, which is an increase of 12 per cent.  If he has one child the increase, taken in conjunction with the increase in children's allowances, is 7/3d., which is an increase of 13.8 per cent.  If he has two children the increase is 11 per cent; if he has four children the increase is 9/3d., an increase of 10.8 per cent.  There again the increases given more than compensate for the maximum possible effect that can be attributed to the increases in the cost of living and the effect of the proposed new turnover tax.</P>
    <P>On the contributory side the position is the same.  As regards the contributory old age pension scheme the exact figures have not been decided upon but it is assumed that they will be approximately double those of the assistance side; that will be 5/- for the personal rate and the same or something similar in the adult dependant rate.  In any of the contributory schemes the percentage increase in payment would be at <Col N="366" /> least double the maximum deterioration in the purchasing power that could be ascribed to the combined effect of the cost of living increase and the effect of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Obviously then the position is that each recipient of social welfare in any shape or form, whether married or single, with or without children, has his or her position improved as a result of this Budget.  Last year I pointed out that as a result of the provisions of the Budget an additional amount of £4.2 million was being made available for the receipients of social welfare.  The amount by which they will benefit from the proposals being made in this Budget is at least £5.64 million.  That is taking into account the full effect on the contributory schemes of the workers' contributions and the employers' contributions and also taking into account the increases in children's allowances, and that is in a full financial year.</P>
    <P>Of the total of £3.5 million which it is proposed to collect by way of this turnover tax, the Minister's statement showed that £1.9 million is needed for the increases in the different social welfare services in this financial year but in addition to that, of course, the increases that were granted last year operated only for portion of the year and they were financed by the taxes imposed in last year's Budget only for that portion of a full year.  This year those increases have to be paid for the full year and the money to pay for them is being provided in this Budget. The difference between the cost to the State of these increases for a full financial year and for that period over which they operated last year is £1.032 million.  Taking that extra provision which has to be made for the increases that were granted last year in conjunction with the provision that is being made for this year for these new increases, there is almost £3 million of this £3.5 million, which is being raised this year by means of the turnover tax, required for social welfare increases.</P>
    <P>This Budget is an honest one.  It is framed to provide the necessary money to meet the expenditure incurred in operating all the services that the Oireachtas has deemed it fit to provide. <Col N="367" /> I have shown that not alone has it maintained the position of social welfare recipients but that another improvement has been made in the real level of social welfare payments. There have been no specific and concrete suggestions as to where economies could have been made.  The only thing approaching such a suggestion I have heard was from Deputy Norton when he described the subsidy being given to milk production as the most useless type of expenditure imaginable.  I do not know what the milk producers of County Kildare will think of that contribution to the Budget debate yesterday.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think it can be said no attempt has been made to substantiate the allegation that the size of the bill the Minister for Finance had to meet was in any degree due to extravagance. Through all the speeches I have heard, there has been instead a tacit admission that the expenditure is all needed to meet the demands of social justice and of economic and social development.  If it is agreed, as I think it is, that the expenditure the Government have to meet is necessary, then the only other point I propose to deal with is whether the extra taxation needed has been levied in a fair and equitable manner.  As far as I am concerned, that means to investigate whether the lower income group have been safeguarded from hardship in the collection of the extra taxation.</P>
    <P>I am a firm believer in the fundamental principle that taxation should be tailored to fit the capacity of the individual to pay.  The net effect of the Budget is to do that effectively. The amount of total extra taxation to be raised was £7.5 million.  It was first decided to raise a sum of £3 million by way of corporation profits tax, a tax on profits which does not affect the lower income group. Since those who make these profits will also pay the new turnover tax in proportion to their expenditure, the increased taxation is obviously going to be mainly obtained from those who can afford best to pay it.  There is a further £4 million to be obtained by <Col N="368" /> a tax on rents and a further £.6 million by tightening up the anti-evasion measures.  The remaining £3.5 million is to be raised by means of the proposed turnover tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that a tax directly proportional to expenditure, without providing for any tax-free allowances as in the case of income tax or without specifically exempting essentials, is unjust to a person of low income.  That contention would need to be seriously considered if it were proposed to operate this tax in isolation or to collect a significant amount of total taxation in this manner.  There are two considerations that make that criticism inapplicable in the present case.  In the first place, the proposed tax is a very small one.  In the second place, the proposed increases in children's allowances modify its effect very considerably in favour of the person of low income with a young family.  It can be shown that any of the other forms of traditional taxation, if they were designed to produce the same amount of revenue, would weigh more heavily on the vast majority of people with low income.</P>
      <P>In theory, income tax is a very equitable system, but it is no secret&mdash; it has been fairly well established over a long number of years&mdash;that there is an almost insuperable difficulty in assessing all incomes accurately and that because of that, many people escape paying their due share.  The result is that those people whose incomes can be readily and fully verified&mdash;these people are mainly employees&mdash;have to contribute more than they should.  This tax cannot be so readily avoided, so that all must pay their share.  Since it is proportional to expenditure, it is obviously proportional to capacity to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just as income tax is adjusted in favour of people with low incomes by way of tax-free allowances, this Budget does the same thing in regard to the turnover tax by increasing children's allowances.  It is blatantly untrue <Col N="369" /> to say there is no attempt to make it equitable by making it fit the capacity of people to pay.  A man with one child under 16 will have his weekly income increased by 2/3d.  If he has three children, the increase will be 3/3d.; four children, 4/3d. and so on. Therefore, a person of modest means, who is in a position to pay £6 a week on the type of item that comes under this turnover tax&mdash;and presuming that the tax is fully passed on in respect of all items, which I do not think will happen&mdash;will be adversely effected by only 9d. per week if he has one child, and if he has three or more, will actually gain slightly from the provisions of the Budget.  If he is in a position to spend £8, on that assumption, the extra cost if he has one child would be 1/9d. per week, and if he has four or more, his net position would be better than it was before.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in addition to improving the position of all social welfare recipients, this Budget has arranged effectively that this extra tax will fall lightly on those with modest incomes. For instance, in the case of a man who smokes&mdash;and very many people with low incomes smoke as heavily as wealthy people&mdash;it will fall more lightly than would a tax arranged to bring in an equivalent amount placed on cigarettes and tobacco.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, while the effect on people of low income is almost neutralised, if they have a family, by means of the children's allowance provision, the man in a position to spend £20 a week on the items affected by the new tax will be affected to the extent of 10/- if he has no children, 7/9d. if he has one or two, and 6/9d. if he has three.  It is obvious that the combined effect of the increased children's allowances, plus the turnover tax, very definitely weights this tax heavily in favour of the lower income groups.  It is done much more effectively than it could be done with any existing form of tax and that combined with the fact that half of the extra bill to be met is raised by corporation profits tax, I think, marks this Budget as one which presses very lightly, if at all, on those who are least able to bear taxation.</P>
    <P>I do not know what alternatives are <Col N="370" /> proposed by the Opposition.  They do not appear to complain about any of the expenditure.  Tax on any of the traditional items such as tobacco, beer or spirits is scarcely justifiable because these things are not necessaries, but they are so widely consumed that they almost rank as necessaries.  It is an undoubted fact that such taxes do not favour the lower paid workers to the same extent as income tax or the turnover tax because, as I said, there is many a man on a low income who spends more than very wealthy people on these items, of his own choice no doubt, but some people find it hard to change their habits.  The amount paid on items such as these by even the most wealthy people is limited by their habits and physical capacity and of course expenditure on those items can be avoided by a decision to refrain from buying them. This tax, however, is proportionate to expenditure on a very wide range of goods and services, as Deputies opposite have not been slow to point out, and it cannot be avoided in that way.</P>
    <P>This tax will cause no great hardship. I have shown that as far as social welfare is concerned it does the opposite. I have shown that so far as the person with the low income is concerned the effect is almost neutralised, if he has one child, and if he has three or more children, it is completely neutralised.  I admit that a tax that is directly and absolutely proportionate to expenditure would appear to be unfair to people who must spend nearly all their income on necessaries or near necessaries of life and if this were a tax of significant proportions with no adjustments, such as there are in this Budget, that case could be made.  However, since the tax is so small as to be insignificant even to the single man on a small income, and since all social welfare recipients are more than adequately compensated, and since the increased children's allowances have practically neutralised the effect on low income groups, surely it is a more equitable form of tax than a tax on any of the traditional items or an increase in income tax designed to bring in the same amount.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> I do not agree that it will have any of the adverse effects that Opposition speakers have been trying to claim it will have on the economy of the country in general.  It is certainly very effectively weighted in favour of the people who are least able to bear it, not only because it is proportionate to their expenditure but because the effect of the increased children's allowances is greater in their case than it is in the case of people who have more money to spend and who would find that increase of very little effect.  As I said, I intended to deal with the Budget only from these two points of view, from the point of view of its effect on social welfare recipients and from the point of view of whether or not it was imposed in an equitable manner, which I interpret as being in a manner which will press as lightly as possible on people of low incomes.</P>

      <P>Since the debate started, it appears to have centred around the turnover tax and I suppose some people will call it a &ldquo;turnover Budget&rdquo;. I would prefer Deputy Mullen's description of the &ldquo;Twist Budget&rdquo; because obviously it is designed to twist money out of people who up to now could not be asked to pay any money because their incomes were too low.  Immediately before the vote yesterday, I was struck by the fact that the Minister was not sure how this tax was going to work out, how it was going to affect various types of goods and was not sure that he had the right angle and promised to explain everything when the Bill was introduced.</P>
      <P>Listening to some of the interruptions from Fianna Fáil backbenchers today, one gathers that they have not educated themselves on this particular item of Budget legislation.  Some of the interruptions showed that they had not the foggiest notion about how the Budget was going to affect anybody, even themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may explain it in any way he likes.  It is 75 per cent over the national expenditure, but if you go into a shop to buy a lb. of butter, which at present is 4/7d.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not pay rent in a shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;you will also pay tax on that 4/7d. and since 4/7d. is very close to 5/-, I suggest the shopkeeper will deduct 1½d. in tax.  If the Minister knows of any way in which that can be avoided, I suggest that he should tell his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and have it included in the Bill so that these people will be prevented from collecting the tax in that way.  I would also suggest that if a poor person in the country, no matter how poor, no matter if he has to beg for the price of a loaf, goes into a shop and buys a loaf, the nearest approximation to the tax is a halfpenny and I suggest that the tax on that loaf will be a halfpenny.  We had evidence of that before when Ministers brought in certain types of legislation which resulted in halfpennies and farthings in the price of bread.  A penny-halfpenny will be collected off the lb. of butter; it will be collected off the lb. of tea&mdash;perhaps a little more, if the tea is the dear type.  It will be collected off the packet of cigarettes which the Minister said would not be so much affected.  It will be collected off a lb. of bacon&mdash; perhaps a little more.  It will be collected off the gallon of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> There is no use in saying that because of the fact that the cost of the goods will be less than a unit of 5/-or a fraction of a £1 which can be easily divided, there will be no tax collected.  We all know, and the Minister is well aware, that the tax will be collected by the shopkeeper and the shopkeeper would be a fool, I would suggest, if he did not collect it because if he does not collect it, he has to pay it out of his own pocket.  No one can expect a man to stay behind a counter and sell goods and pay the Government tax on them.</P>
    <P>There is the inducement that for the first £50 in any month, or if the turnover is only up to £50, a nominal 5/-will do.  Correct me if I am wrong. If it is up to £100, 17/6d. will do, irrespective of what is collected.  I would suggest that this tax is put on so loosely that there are certain people who will be running certain types of shops who will do quite well out of it. I would further suggest that the inducement is deliberately put there to encourage them to become tax collectors so that it can be said to them : &ldquo;You will not be so bad.  You will have a few shillings for yourself out of the deal when it is finished.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is all right for the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare to weave airy-fairy tales about how wonderful the Government are in making provision for everybody. Perhaps the Minister for Social Welfare would suggest to me how a poor person who at present has 32/6 to live on and who will be getting 35/- will be able to pay tax out of that of, at the very least, 1/9d.  Such a person will not spend the whole 35/- at one time but will spend it in shillings and two-shillings all over the place when he is buying the small amounts he can afford and may in fact pay double that 2/6d. which he will get from the Department of Social Welfare under this Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be practically nothing and the Minister is well aware of that.  That sort of bluff will not carry.  It may be useful on a Fianna Fáil platform in the by-election but it is no use in this House because we are not all that slow.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare said that it was a very honest Budget. It is the most dishonest Budget ever introduced because the Minister for Finance suggested when introducing the Budget that he hoped to collect £3½ million in the four months from 1st November to 1st March.  Then he estimated that for a full year he would collect £10½ million.  He said from 1st March to 1st April would not be counted in this financial year. He also said in a full year he would collect £10½ million.  What he did not say was that everybody who has money and who requires something will make sure to buy it free of tax between now and 1st November next and, therefore, for the first four months, there will be very little except essentials being bought and on which tax will be paid. That is the correct position and if the Minister proposes in that situation to collect £3½ million, I would suggest that his comment that he proposes to collect £10½ million over a full 12 months is just a lot of hooey and that he hopes to collect a very substantial sum inside the next 12 months when the full tax is in operation and when people have to renew things, no matter how dear they may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear to me that the Minister hopes to have a substantial balance at the end of the year as a result of his 2½ per cent tax.  Why not be honest about the thing?  Why not put the whole facts before the House, or does the Minister think we are all like the Fianna Fáil backbencher who thought the first £100 was not being taxed?  Maybe the Deputy I am talking about usually spends his money in £100's.  Maybe he goes out <Col N="376" /> and buys £100 worth of everything he requires.  That may be the answer. The ordinary people, the people for whom the Labour Party particularly are speaking, are people who can spend only in shillings, two-shillings and half-crowns.  They cannot spend in £100's and thereby avoid the tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We will hear his comments on that at a later stage. If the Minister for Finance needs a lot of money, and we understand he does, unfortunately the unemployment figures are going the wrong way for him, going the wrong way for the country.  We have nearly 4,000 more persons unemployed than we had 12 months ago.  There were a couple of hundred more unemployed last week than there were the week before that. There were 52,000 fewer people in jobs in this country than there were in 1956, which the people opposite refer to as the black year.  That is from their own figures.  That is from a cutting from the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the associate members of Fianna Fáil has decided <Col N="377" /> that he will interrupt and this is going to be good.  The biggest trouble about this tax is that everybody in the country who sells goods will become a tax collector.  All of these must keep accounts and I assume the accounts will be checked, which will, in turn, mean extra staff.  The Minister must be very careful here, lest we reach a stage similar to that reached in other countries where it is costing more to keep a check on the tax collectors than the amount collected in the tax.  We could quite possibly reach that stage if the trend goes the wrong way here.</P>
      <P>In his reference to the goods and services which will be excepted from the turnover tax, the Minister did not mention hospitals and other local institutions or the goods supplied to them.  I am not referring merely to drugs and medicines but also to foodstuffs of various kinds supplied by contract to these institutions.  The contracts have been made for his year and will presumably continue to the end of the year but perhaps increases in prices will be asked for and a clause may be allowed to be inserted into the contracts permitting increased prices.  Even during the few months in which this tax will operate in the current year&mdash; remember local authorities operate to 31st March&mdash;the amount spent on such foodstuffs is so substantial that the 2½ per cent tax will mean a very substantial sum also.  Will this involve the striking of an additional rate in many instances?</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister intends to exempt petrol and diesel for public transport from the operation of this tax.  He says in his Budget Statement that public transport is one of the excepted services but if public transport must pay extra for its fuel does that not mean automatically increased costs, not alone increased bus fares but increased charges for all kinds of goods transport?  The Minister did not explain that.  Perhaps he would be good enough to do so when he is concluding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate, reference has been made to the intention to tax co-operative societies.  Unlike some speakers I believe the people who are running what have been generally <Col N="378" /> known as co-operative societies but which, in fact, have become limited liability companies, should have been taxed long ago.  I do not see why not because some of the co-operative societies formed 50 or 60 years ago and which were run as such, have been allowed to fall into the hands of a few individuals.  I do not see why these people should be allowed to compete under preferential treatment against other kinds of traders.  The Minister was quite right to impose this tax on such undertakings but I do not see why all co-operatives should be included.  I believe there are a number of genuine societies in the country which should be exempt and I would ask the Minister to be very careful in operating this provision.  Some years ago this recommendation was made by the National Co-operative Council which, I suggest, was the brain child of a person who subsequently appears to have had a large influence on the present decision to include this tax in the Budget, and I would ask the Minister to be very careful not to take away, through the operation of this tax, the rights of these genuine co-operatives.</P>
    <P>There is to be a further increase in pensions but is the Minister aware that the increases in pensions mentioned in last year's Budget, but in respect of which legislation is still before the House, in many cases have not been paid?  The provision to level up pensions appears to have been lost sight of by some local authorities, some of which claim they have been overworked and some that they did not get adequate notification.  The result is that many people entitled to pensions still have not got them.  The Minister should ensure that, when he is introducing legislation to give effect to this year's proposals in respect of pensions, provision made for last year has been given effect to.</P>
    <P>In this matter, the Minister mentioned local authority officers.  Did he mean local authority employees?  I do not see why he should differentiate between the serving grade and the officer grade: they are all in the same position as far as the necessity to compensate them for lower pensions is concerned. <Col N="379" /> I am glad the Minister has decided to improve the pensions of a number of retired people.  Representations had been made to him and to his predecessor and while I appreciate it is a slow process, it is good to see some effort being made along those lines.</P>
    <P>The amount which it is proposed to give to social welfare recipients&mdash;mind you, only to those in receipt of assistance from 1st November next&mdash;is not adequate, despite what the Minister for Social Welfare said tonight.  The Minister for Social Welfare should have realised the net benefit of this increase when various deductions have been made from it.  He must be aware that these people spend it in shillings, two shillings and half crowns and that the extra halfcrown will be entirely inadequate.  How did the Minister work out that those in receipt of contributory pensions do not require compensation until 1st January next?  He then decides on 5/- to compensate them.  How does he decide whether those in receipt of contributory pensions are in a better position to meet this new turnover tax with 5/- than the person in receipt of the non-contributory pension, who must meet the new tax with 2/6d.?  I am sure the Minister feels, as I do, that the person entirely dependent on a non-contributory pension, who must live on 32/6d. a week, deserves at least 5/&mdash; the amount being given to contributory pensioners.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am being particularly critical of the new type of tax being introduced here but I suggest we must be critical of it.  While we appreciate that extra money must be found, that it is the duty of the Minister for Finance to find that money, at the same time, we think it is unjust and arbitrary to impose now a tax on people whose incomes were so low that previously they could never be caught for income tax.  Willy-nilly, they are now made to pay a tax of 6d. in the £ for every £1 they spend.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say on the Budget.  Everybody except the clowns&mdash;we know the side of the House on which the clowns are&mdash;knew for weeks or months past that some type of sales tax was to be introduced. Those people went about the country deliberately and at some cost to themselves, trying to give the impression that a tax of about 15 or 20 per cent was being introduced.  Even the leaders of some of the Parties changed their cars overnight simply because they thought they would be mulcted in the new tax.  They did that deliberately to mislead the people.  They traded in good cars before they intended to do so.  That was their own foolishness and no fault of the Government.  The big trouble is that instead of the Government introducing a tax of 15 or 20 per cent, the bottom fell out of the bucket for these gentlemen because a tax of merely 2½ per cent was introduced.  If the Government had introduced a 10 per cent tax the Opposition would be highly delighted. Soon, they would go to the people in a certain area of Dublin and be able to blame the Government for the troubles of these people but nobody except a fool regards 2½ per cent as anything but a mere trifle.  Consequently they have no case to make. That is all that is wrong with them. They are upset and they spent last night in silly arguments which got them nowhere and even many of their own people left the House in disgust and did not vote at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be realistic.  If development is to take place and employment is to be given, money must be obtained somewhere.  We cannot get it by wishing for it, or trying to conjure it up.  It must come from the ordinary man in the street.  No doubt the ordinary man does not begrudge paying reasonable tax so long as he feels a certain sense of security, but if he is placed in the position in which he was <Col N="382" /> placed seven years ago, when he did not know where he would be the next day, he has a much different idea and has good reason for &ldquo;cribbing&rdquo;.  He has no great reason for doing so now. Many of those who come in here to represent the ordinary citizens are doing the country grave injustice.  The people who went to England will have to pay far higher taxes and work much harder, probably, than they thought, and in many cases, will have little in return.</P>
    <P>It is amusing to hear Deputies asking for reduced taxation on three days in the year and spending the remaining days on which they are here asking for improved facilities for the people, higher pensions, higher social allowances and higher wages.  They come in on the day on which these provisions are to be made to ask that less money should be provided.  That is typical of any county council meeting where the same thing happens.  We spend the year asking for extra roads and bridges and employment and when the estimates come to be prepared, we ask for a reduction in the rates.  Nobody but a fool would take any notice of that type of argument.</P>
    <P>It is important that the ordinary social welfare allowances, such as old age pensions and unemployment assistance, should be maintained and increased but it is more important that capital expenditure within the State should be increased because it means giving badly-needed employment and involves a very important social uplift. It is very important that a man should be employed rather than unemployed, even though he gets economically as much when unemployed as when employed.  Any sane person agrees with that.  Therefore, I believe that any money spent on capital outlay is well spent.  When wages increase&mdash; and there is always an outcry for an increase in wages&mdash;the Capital Budget must increase.  That is money well spent and no matter where we get it, we must provide it.</P>
    <P>Today we have in my constituency where we had practically nothing seven years ago, one of the most important power stations in the country, <Col N="383" /> one of the biggest Bord na Móna works ; we have the grassmeal factory going into operation, the peatlands experimental station on our doorstep and up to 500 or 600 persons employed where a man could not get an hour's work in 1956.  I am sure that that applies to many other constituencies and we should be very foolish if we overlook that, or if we overlook the fact that in 1954, 1955, 1956 everything was closed down in that area.  I must be realistic and honest about it.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities fail to co-operate with the Government and in many cases that brings great hardship to the people of these counties.  It means a lessening of expenditure in cases where the Government are prepared to spend money and it is past time that steps were taken to ensure that there should be some type of uniformity in the operations of local authorities.  In the case of the Land Project, where large sums of money are to be spent, some local authorities will carry out the work required and others will just say that they will not do it.  That is causing grave hardship, especially in my county.  It is a circumstance that leaves a great deal of money unspent and is something that the Government should deal with.</P>
    <P>I will not take up the time of the House any further beyond saying that a great deal of play has been made on the operation of co-operatives.  In nine cases out of ten, these co-operatives are fakes established for the purpose of evading taxation.  In many parts of the country, they are not of very high standing.  I see no reason why any organisation of any description should be able to set itself up to operate competitively against the ordinary trader. If these people who form co-operative societies and who get away with murder wish to operate, they should be treated in the same way as the ordinary publican or small shopkeeper is treated.  I have no objection to them selling agricultural goods and being allowed to get away with that but when they go into competition in ordinary branded lines and then expect complete freedom from any type of taxation, I think it is most unfair and <Col N="384" /> it is past time that they were pulled up.</P>
    <P>On the question of the collection of this turnover tax, I would say that it will be open to a tremendous amount of abuse.  It should be collected from the wholesalers.  I know of small shopkeepers in the midlands who keep their money in a shoe box or in a stocking.  How can they be brought to pay this tax?  In all fairness to everybody, the tax should be collected on the purchases of such a trader rather than on the purchases of his customers.  Most wholesalers today are of a fairly high standard and they have to keep some kind of accounts but I cannot see how a man who, in many cases, will sign a cheque with two X's can be brought into this category. It would be only fair to everybody if the tax in this instance were collected from the wholesalers.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to see how the ordinary small publican or grocer could be asked to keep accounts of this kind.  He has not been used to doing it and he is not going to get used to it in a matter of days, weeks or months. The Minister would be doing a good day's work if he collected that tax from the wholesalers rather than from the retailer.  I am sure it is not beyond the imagination of the people in his Department to formulate some kind of scheme to have the tax collected from the wholesalers.  It would be easy to calculate the difference in the tax between the wholesale and the retail prices.</P>

      <P>Sir, no Budget in recent years has caused the shock to the country this Budget has caused. Most people expected that there would not be very much change and that whatever change might be brought about in the Budget, industry would get some kind of a fillip, some kind of a shot in the arm.  The Government, and the Taoiseach especially, have spoken again and again of the necessity for business improving itself, of the necessity for exporting.  I know that incentives have been given to business to export.  These incentives are good but remember that there are very many businesses which do not export, which are not manufacturing, <Col N="385" /> although they may be in the distributive trades.  They do not want to be, and never will be, exporters.</P>
      <P>There are some of them who have been doing something in that line and to these the incentives offered by the Government have been of assistance. But there are firms in this country which did not start up as a result of high tariffs.  These are the older established firms which built up from their businesses on the home market the wherewithal to export.  Many of our exporting firms and many of the most successful of them were in existence before the tariff wall was built.  They built it up out of profits which they made and ploughed back into their business and so eventually they found themselves in a position to start exporting.</P>
      <P>Well, that process, which was a good and healthy process for this country and for the work people in it, could still be going on with Government encouragement but unless the firm is right bang in the export business, it finds that the incentives given by the Government are very few.  In fact, business is nearly taxed out of existence. Before I sit down, I want to talk about the taxes which have been put on in this Budget.</P>
      <P>As I say, the business community expected and hoped that some sort of fillip would be given to them, a sort of shot in the arm.  We heard what was done in the Budget of the neighbouring country.  Industry was given a shot in the arm and has been given many shots in the arm.  Our unfortunate industries have got shots in the back. I do not know how many of them have been able to carry on as they have.</P>
      <P>Some very small increases have been given to old age pensioners, blind pensioners, widows, children's allowances, and so on.  They are very small. However, I think, and I think the country will decide that the amount given to dependent people, whom we are all glad to see getting something, is in no way commensurate with the disbursements which other sections of the community have received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had two Ministerial interventions&mdash;one <Col N="386" /> from no less a person than the Taoiseach and the other from the Minister for Social Welfare.  Perhaps the peculiar province of the Minister for Social Welfare is the welfare of the less fortunate members of the community.  Nevertheless, listening to a great deal of his speech and to the Taoiseach's speech which was on the Budget in general, one might almost be pardoned for thinking there was nobody in this country except people who had to receive relief.</P>
    <P>We all know there are far too many people in this country in receipt of relief and who unfortunately have to be in receipt of relief.  The aim of every Government should be&mdash;I hope it is but it certainly should be&mdash;to look after people who through old age or youth or illness are dependent on us for help.  Whilst, on the one hand, we should do all we can for them, on the other hand, we should also help the people who can help themselves.  One way of doing that is to do everything to speed the wheels of industry and commerce generally and farming also. We want those people in gainful employment to continue their work and we want to give as much employment as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>This Government, with this Budget, have not done that at all.  They have put crippling burdens on industry. First of all, I shall take the corporation profits tax.  The levy has gone from 10 per cent to 15 per cent, which is an increase of 50 per cent.  That tax has gone up 50 per cent.  If a firm paid £5,000 last year they will pay £7,500 this year.  That is what it means.  It sounds nice.  It looks as if it is not very much&mdash;a five per cent increase&mdash; but that five per cent increase is a 50 per cent increase on the tax that will be paid.</P>
    <P>That is a burden which every industry or every business will have to bear after January, 1962.  I have written down the exact words of the Minister: it will be levied on profits arising on or after January 1st, 1962.  The accounts of businesses for the year 1962 are now closed.  The tax computation has been made.  In most cases whatever profits were in a business <Col N="387" /> have now been distributed.  The accounts are closed, finished with. How are those businesses to go back to 1962, which is now finished, and to find 50 per cent extra corporation profits tax which in many businesses amounts to a considerable sum? It is a very big item.  In addition, they have got to find 50 per cent more than they had estimated and budgeted for and shown in their accounts&mdash;but they will have to do that.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I should like to mention certain aspects of the 2½ per cent turnover tax.  I was horrified to hear a number of people on the opposite benches, including the Minister for Social Welfare, say that this is a small tax.  Do not think that for a moment. This is an enormous tax.  That 2½ per cent turnover tax is the biggest tax that has been levied on industry and business in general.  The country does not realise that yet.  It will be levied on every business to which for want of a better phrase I shall say it applies&mdash;and it applies to practically every type of business and industry in the whole country except exports.</P>
    <P>Apparently it does not apply to exports but that is by no means the major part of business in this country. If it were, this concession could not be given to exporting industry.  The day when our exports are so big as to be nearly as big as or bigger than the rest of the turnover of the country, that day the export incentives will start to decrease because the Government will not be able to afford to give them. However, we are very far from that day.  Roughly speaking, they are the only people who will find that this 2½ per cent is not levied on them.  The rest of the business community, shopkeepers, and so on, will all have to find that.  It is an enormous tax because&mdash; and many people except accountants and such people have not realised this &mdash;in the ordinary way when a firm pays taxes, it pays them on profits; after allowable expenses have been deducted and if a firm does not make any profit it does not pay any tax, but with this, you pay it whether you are a bankrupt or not.  If a firm has a turnover of £100,000, even if it does <Col N="388" /> not make a halfpenny profit, it will still have to pay £2,500 tax.  It may not be paying anything like that in its ordinary taxation.  I have been looking into some figures about which I know.  For every £100 tax a business paid in 1962, when this tax is in full swing, that business will have to pay £250.</P>
    <P>This tax will also hit the businesses which are working on a very low margin of profit.  Cut-price shops which are presumably working on a very low margin of profit will have great difficulty in finding 2½ per cent because the greater the turnover the more 2½ per cents have to be found. This tax will undoubtedly put certain businesses out of existence.  The idea that it will not be passed on to the consumer is absolute nonsense.  It must be pased on to the consumer.</P>

      <P>Then there is the question as to how the tax is to be imposed.  What will happen when somebody walks into a shop and buys a bottle of milk for 6d?  This tax works out at a farthing on 10d.  We have no unit of currency lower than a farthing. Farthings have gone out of existence and nobody would like to see them back again.  However, even a farthing is twice too much to charge on 6d and I do not know how a person who is selling 6d. articles will collect the tax. How will he collect the tax on a box of matches?  If you sell enough boxes of matches and do not collect the tax, <Col N="389" /> you will find yourself on queer street. If you are selling matches by the gross, you can get it back but in the ordinary way, it will be very difficult.  I do not say it will be impossible to do it.  Business people will find a way but only with considerable difficulty.  The lower the margin of profit on which a firm are operating, the greater will their difficulty be, or, to put it in another way, the better the value they are giving to the public, the more necessary it will be to pass that on to the consumer because they would have to close down in certain cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is contradicting the Deputy's earlier argument? If it is a tax on business, then it cannot, at the same time, be a tax on the consumer who is purchasing from the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be a tax on the consumer.  My argument is&mdash; and I do not like to call it an argument because I believe it to be an irrefutable fact&mdash;that if the cost of that is not passed on to the consumer, certain businesses will be smashed by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The cut-price trade.  The small shopkeepers will be delighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I have any tears to shed for the cut-price shops.  I do not deal in them because I do not like them but one would think they were the blessed of the Lord who had come to serve the people of Ireland and that the old established family grocer was somebody who was putting sand in the sugar all his life and grinding the faces of the poor.  That argument has been put forward and put forward in this House in my hearing, that the person who sells on the lowest margin of profit is doing the best service to the community.  I do not hold with that but it was the basis on which the Prices Commission operated, fair trade, and so on.  They were based on the idea that business should be a free-for-all. However, if business is to be a free-for-all with a large turnover and small profits and then on top of the large turnover is levied 2½ per cent, make no mistake, that is a colossal <Col N="390" /> levy because up to this taxes were supposed to be levied on profits.  This is not a tax on profits.  It does not matter whether you are going bankrupt in the morning, when they come to make out your liabilities, heading all the other liabilities will be your liability to the Government for turnover tax.  You will not have any corporation profits tax to pay because you will have gone &ldquo;bust&rdquo;, but you will have to find that.  It might be, strangely enough, that very figure which had pushed a business over into failure.</P>
      <P>That is not only an aspect of this tax but it is an inevitable result of it. The corporation profits tax, which shows a 50 per cent increase on the previous figures, is levied now on financial returns which have been closed and assets and so on distributed. It is a monstrous thing to go back on accounts which are balanced and closed and assets distributed and expect them next year to bear a very much higher taxation.  As a matter of fact, the year 1964 will have to bear a lot of strange things.  It will have to bear the full impact of the sales tax, in respect of which it will be very difficult for many firms to recoup themselves. It will also have to bear&mdash; although goodness knows what will be put on in the way of extra taxation before then&mdash;50 per cent extra corporation profits tax.  It will have to bear also the portion of the 1962 extra corporation profits tax which perhaps the year 1963 could not carry.  There is going to be some difficulty when those matters are gone into by business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the Taoiseach speaking here today.  I always find a great rush of excitement when the Taoiseach speaks about our economic expansion.  I feel I am part of a great industrial army moving on.  But then the light of reason floods my brain and I say: &ldquo;What on earth is being done for that army on the march?&rdquo; Nothing is being done.  The Taoiseach talked about economic expansion.  Economic expansion has come about in the past few years.  Nobody quite knows why. He talked about detailed planning <Col N="391" /> and the second economic plan.  All that sounds magnificent to help industry.  But what on earth in the Budget has been done to help?</P>
    <P>The other Ministerial intervention was on the part of the Minister for Social Welfare.  He did not claim that industry was being helped.  He claimed that the pensioners were being helped.  The Labour Party and we do not think that the aged, the infirm, the blind and the children are being helped to anything but a very small extent in this Budget, but we know very well that industry is not being helped. Even the Minister for Social Welfare, with his somewhat inconsequential approach to high finance, did not attempt to maintain that.  But then the Taoiseach comes and claims in regard to a Budget which has pushed up corporation profits tax by 50 per cent and levied the biggest taxation on business and industry that has ever been levied on it, one which is quite out of step with the rest of our taxation code, that it is going to help industry.  I sincerely wish I could see how that is to be done.</P>
    <P>The truth is that, except for certain favoured industries engaged in export, the rest of the business community are finding taxation appallingly high.  Make no mistake: taxation is appallingly high.  This legislative assembly, which very naturally reflects a cross-section of Ireland, is mainly composed of people who understand very thoroughly, I am sure, the problems of the rural community.  This is an overwhelmingly agricultural country, but we also have industry and business. We have not the same understanding inside this House of business problems as we have of farming problems.  I do not think the average Deputy realises the extent to which industry in this country is handicapped.</P>
    <P>Expansion of industry in this country has to be done in the classical way. There is no safe way of planning economic expansion and capital expenditure in a business except out of savings.  It is nearly impossible for business to save and put by the money necessary to equip it.  In business, if <Col N="392" /> you do not keep renewing your plant and machinery and assets, your carpets, curtains, and so on, you go out of business very rapidly.  It is not just for fun that people are always renewing and re-equipping.  It has to be done in order to keep the business right.  If it is not done, the business will suffer. It can only be done out of profits. Very inadequate allowances are made for that.  They are much bigger in most other industrial countries.</P>

      <P>In this particular case, I am particularly concerned about Denis Bowen who gave good service to this nation in its hour of need. He was in the Cork No. 1 Brigade. He was an ordinary agricultural labourer and when everything was over, he went back to that occupation.  Two years ago, that man became ill and when he was visited by his doctor, he was told that he would have to cease work as an agricultural labourer.  He became worse and in April, 1962, he became completely incapacitated.  The cause of his illness was gastric ulcers. He was in Cobh Hospital for two months between April and July, 1962. On 3rd August, he was visited by the inspector who declared him fit.  In November and December last year, he was an inmate of the Mercy Hospital, Cork, and in February and March of this year, he was an inmate of the North Infirmary, Cork.  I have here a certificate dated 19th April, 1963 which reads:</P>
      <P>This is to certify that the above named patient is suffering from gastric ulcers and is completely unfit for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the man who, the Army authorities inform us, should be working in his usual occupation, a man who for the past three years was unable to work and who left his occupation.  He worked night and day for this nation when she needed men.  It is outrageous that this should happen here to-day.  After all, such men were responsible for setting up this Republic. Such men fought for it; many gave their lives or their health for it.  There are not so many of them left now and not a week passes that we have not to attend two or three funerals of those who are left.  The least we can expect from an Irish Department of Defence is that they will give decent treatment to the few who are left.  They deserve better from the nation than to be told after three years' illness that they are <Col N="394" /> still fit to work.  Despite the fact that the doctors in Cobh Hospital, in the Mercy Hospital and in the North Infirmary, and the medical officer for Cobh, all certified that this man is unfit for work, and his own medical officer two years ago warned him not to work, the Department still says he is not entitled to a special allowance or anything else&mdash;he can live on grass until he pegs out like the rest of them who are gone.</P>

      <P>I think that in the case of Deputy Corry and any other Deputy interested in this question of looking after the old soldiers&mdash;and there are a good many Deputies who are&mdash;it would be much fairer when they are generalising, if they would generalise on what, after all, Deputy Corry must admit is the general experience of these favourable decisions.  I find that Deputies, some Deputies anyway, concentrate on the cases that do not go so well for them and such cases stand out more prominently in their minds than the very many good and generous decisions which they received.  Now, I do not want to argue with Deputy Corry as to what the medical condition of this particular applicant is.  I do not know the man personally and in any event, whether I knew the applicant or not, it is not my knowledge of his medical condition that counts but the opinion conveyed officially to me by the Army Pensions Board on which there are two medical men as members.</P>
      <P>With regard to this question of delay, Deputy Corry might advert to the second of the two cases he mentioned to-day.  He will find that the case was dealt with in the most expeditious way.  The application was made on 19th January and inside three months, a favourable decision was given, although the medical and means investigations had to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is anything in what Deputy Corry had to say this afternoon in reply to the answer which I gave him, or if there is anything in what he has said just now of any material value to the Army Pensions Board and which has not already been brought to their notice, I assure him that I shall have it <Col N="395" /> brought to their notice now.  But I must repeat that I cannot give decisions against the weight of the medical evidence offered to me.  I have indicated on more than one occasion to the House that in matters in which I have a choice and where I think the balance is in favour of an applicant, my sympathies certainly lie with the applicant but I cannot exercise a discretion in the very important matter of medical assessment.  A Board has been set up for that purpose and, whether I like it or not, I must have regard to what they say about the medical condition of an applicant.</P>
    <P>The evidence before me with regard to certain matters of disability from which Deputy Corry thinks this applicant is suffering is entirely contrary to what Deputy Corry says.  What am I to do in a matter of disease?  Am I to accept Deputy Corry's lay opinion on it and attach more importance to it than to what the official medical evidence conveys?</P>

      <P>There is my difficulty. All I can say to Deputy Corry is that I will have conveyed to the Board his latest representations on behalf of this applicant, Denis Bowen, and if there is anything in them that will materially affect the decision already given, I am quite satisfied that the Board will concede the benefit of any doubt they may have.  I am afraid I cannot say any more to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion is that the history of the case was not known to whatever medical officer considered it in the Minister's Department.  I can assure the Minister that I have raised this matter with very great reluctance. He is one old-IRA man and I am another and this delay should not occur.</P>
