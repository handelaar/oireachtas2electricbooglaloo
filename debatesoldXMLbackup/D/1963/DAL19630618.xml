    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the fact that it was agreed by the Ministers of GATT, on 16th to 21st May, 1963, at Geneva that it was open to each country to request additional trade concessions, or to modify its own offers, where it is necessary to obtain a balance of advantages between it and other participating countries, in an endeavour to secure a basis of reciprocity; and if he considers such arrangements to be an encouragement to this country to renew its application for adherence to GATT.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the fact that at the meeting of the Ministers of GATT at Geneva, on 16th to 21st May, 1963, they agreed that, in view of the importance of agriculture in world trade, trade negotiations should provide for acceptable conditions of access to world markets for agricultural products; and if, in the light of these findings, he considers that it might now be advisable to pursue this country's application for accession to GATT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the questions refer to certain paragraphs of the Resolution adopted at the recent Ministerial meeting of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and <Col N="960" /> Trade concerning the trade negotiations which the Ministers agreed should open under the auspices of GATT in May, 1964.  The Deputy may be assured that all aspects of that Resolution are being taken into account in our consideration of the position with regard to our application for membership of the GATT.</P>
    <P>I might add that Ireland was represented by an observer at the meeting of GATT Ministers last month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate whether the application is to be pursued or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I should do that yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider, in the light of this Resolution, that it is much more open to this country to apply for membership than heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the consideration we have to keep in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he considers that immediate observer status is necessary for this country at the discussions between the EFTA countries, in view of the fact that agriculture is now one of the main items on the agenda of that group of nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a question by the Deputy on the 30th May, the recent extensions of the bilateral agricultural arrangements between certain member-countries of the European Free Trade Association are of limited scope and we are keeping in close touch with developments in this and other fields.</P>
      <P>In any case, there appears to be no provision for the attendance of observers at meetings of the EFTA Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to tell the House&mdash;the Minister for External Affairs was not, when I asked a question recently&mdash;what facets of agriculture are being discussed by the EFTA group, other than butter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain arrangements of a bilateral kind within the group are involved.  As far as I know, there are no general arrangements being discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs told me in the House a fortnight ago that discussions were going on in regard to agriculture and that he was not in a position to state what matters were being discussed, other than butter.  Is the Taoiseach now in a position to tell the House that or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only matter discussed of interest to us is butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining to the Deputy that there has been no general agreement within the EFTA Council on matters relating to agriculture. There are discussions between individual countries, members of EFTA, in relation to agricultural matters.  The only matter arising on these talks so far of any interest to this country is butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any suggestion reached the Taoiseach that discussions are proceeding also in regard to bacon and of the possibility of a quota system for bacon being introduced in the British market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard no suggestion that such a topic has been discussed in the EFTA Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister feels it inexpedient to answer now, I accept that, but can he say are there negotiations proceeding anywhere which would operate to create a quota position in the British market for bacon from this country, from Denmark and the other EFTA countries which are bacon suppliers to that market?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he now has any proposals to put before the Dáil in relation to the visit to Leinster House of President Kennedy; whether he has seen a report purporting to describe the procedure to be followed; and whether he has caused any investigation to be carried out into the circumstances in which this information, which has not yet been revealed to the Dáil, came to be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals in relation to this matter were transmitted by my Department to the Clerk of the Dáil on Wednesday last, the 12th instant, with a view to having them circulated to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, for consideration by the Committee.  I intend to move an appropriate motion in this House on Thursday next.</P>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper report referred to.  The information contained in it was not furnished from Government sources, and accordingly I do not intend to institute an investigation into the circumstances in which the report was published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that a document was circulated to myself, the Leader of the Labour Party and certain other persons, the contents of which were understood to be confidential?

      <P>Will the Taoiseach say, in view of the answers given by the Leaders of the Labour Party and Fine Gael, that there was no disclosure by either group of what this document contained, how he can reconcile that position with the fact that on one page of the <i>Irish Press</i> a similar statement was published as being made by Deputy Corish and Deputy Dillon that this was a secret document and on an inside page, the document itself was published?  In view of the close association between this newspaper and the Fianna Fáil Party, will the Taoiseach now say which member of his Party or of the Cabinet disclosed this alleged secret information to the <i>Irish Press</i>?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, in view of the importance of the preventive health services to the community and to trade and tourism and of the dissatisfaction of medical officers with these services, he will consider exercising his rights under the Local Government Act, 1941, by making regulations under Section 19, or an order under Section 29, determining the remuneration of assistant chief medical officers consistent with their qualifications, experience and responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a similar question on 23rd April last, I assured the Deputy that I appreciated fully the importance of an efficient public health service and that I would continue to take all reasonable steps open to me to maintain that efficiency.  I am aware that the assistant chief medical officers are dissatisfied with their present level of remuneration, but I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to use the powers mentioned in the question to over-ride, on a nation-wide basis, the statutory powers of local authorities in relation to the remuneration of their officers. The question of the standard of our public health services is one which will fall for examination by the Select Committee in due course and I do not propose to anticipate the result of that examination by commenting now on the Deputy's suggestions in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when he is likely to sanction proposed alterations to the nurses' and domestic homes attached to St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh, Finglas, County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The authorities of St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh, have submitted an application for a grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund towards the cost of providing improved and extended accommodation for nursing and domestic staff.  The application is at present under consideration in my Department in conjunction with similar proposals <Col N="972" /> for improved staff accommodation from other hospital authorities.  In so far as voluntary hospital authorities are concerned, the Hospitals Trust Fund is the only source available to me as Minister for Health from which assistance towards the cost of such projects can be given.  The available moneys in the Fund and the prospective income over the next few years that can be set aside for capital projects have already been practically fully committed for many other urgent hospital works.</P>
      <P>It is possible, however, that where an urgent need can be established and where the cost of the work involved would not impose an undue burden on the Fund it might be feasible to make limited assistance available.  Each case has to be considered, however, not only on its own merits but also in relation to other competing claims.  I expect in the present instance to be in a position to convey a decision to the hospital authorities in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that a considerable number of cases have arisen where tuberculosis patients in sanatoria have been expelled from the sanatoria and sent home prior to the completion of their treatment, on account of their having committed minor breaches of the sanatorium regulations; whether he will have the incidence of such cases investigated; and whether he will now make a statement as to the type of breach which he considers should necessitate the expulsion of a patient from a sanatorium, and the general desirability or otherwise of taking this action in cases of minor breaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position in this matter is as represented by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had inquiries made from health authorities in respect of the three regional sanatoria and five other of the larger institutions.  The number of patients expelled from these eight institutions since 1st January, 1961, was 28.  These institutions between them had, at any time during this <Col N="973" /> period, a population ranging from 1,000 to 1,500 adult respiratory tuberculosis patients.  From the reasons given for these expulsions, I am satisfied that this action is not resorted to without justification.</P>
    <P>Sanatoria are maintained at very considerable public expense so as to provide conditions in which all the patients have the maximum prospect of restoration to health.  To that end, it is necessary to lay down and enforce certain simple rules of conduct.  These rules are conscientiously observed by all but a handful of the patients and I am satisfied that the interests of the very considerable majority, those who observe the rules, require that the few who are guilty of serious or repeated misconduct should be required to leave the institutions.  I do not propose to interfere with the discretion in this matter of the authorities concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that wide discrepancies occur as to the services of clothing, etc., available to tuberculosis patients under the domiciliary welfare scheme, as operated by different local health authorities; and that these discrepancies can result in patients in the same hospital receiving totally different standards of service from such schemes; whether he will issue general directions to local health authorities with a view to ensuring a reasonable degree of uniformity in the operation of such schemes; and whether, in particular, he will now direct those authorities whose operation of these schemes is least satisfactory to take steps to administer them in a more liberal manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The domiciliary welfare scheme, as its name implies, is intended primarily for necessitous patients undergoing treatment for tuberculosis outside hospitals but under it suitable clothing may be provided for necessitous patients undergoing treatment in institutions in circumstances in which, if such clothing were not provided, they would be unable to derive full benefit from the treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant of assistance under the scheme is entirely within the discretion <Col N="974" /> of the various health authorities and, consequently, while an approximate uniformity of standards over the whole country is a reasonable aim, it would be impossible to achieve it.  Such inquiries as I have made, however, would appear to indicate that applications are dealt with sympathetically by the authorities concerned. It should be remembered that since this scheme was first introduced the position has altered substantially by reason of the introduction of the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Allowances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if any circular letter was addressed to health authorities by his Department intimating that the income of sons, daughters, sisters or brothers of insured persons may be sought and assessed by health authorities for the purpose of applying the maximum charge of 10/- per day for services under Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that Health Authorities or their managers are imposing health service charges of up to 10/- per day on insured persons and injured workmen, under Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, as amended, on the basis that sons, daughters, or other family members are in receipt of wages or other income; if he will state the precise provisions of that Act, which enable a county manager to impose a charge on an insured person related to the income of other persons; and if any provisions of the Public Assistance Act, 1939 are used by County Managers for the purposes of imposing, assessing or collecting charges under Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (4) of Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, a charge may be made at the discretion of the health authority on an insured person who is not in the <Col N="975" /> lower income group, as specified in Section 14 of the Act.  Subsection (4), as amended, specified these charges as &ldquo;such charges, not exceeding ten shillings for each day during which institutional services are availed of, as may be determined by the health authority&rdquo;. Thus the amount of the charge in each case is at the discretion of the manager in his discharge of the functions of the health authority and I have no functions relating to the amount of the charge in any case or the factors taken into account in assessing charges.  There is, however, nothing in the Act which prevents a manager, when exercising his discretion in this matter, taking into account all appropriate factors such as family income.</P>
      <P>The Public Assistance Act, 1939 has no direct relevance to the assessment of the amount of a charge under Section 15, but it is provided in Section 31 of the 1953 Act that such charges may be recovered from</P>
      <P>(a)  the person in respect of whom the charge is made or, in case such person has died, his legal personal representative, or</P>
      <P>(b)  any other person liable to maintain such person for the purposes of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, by virtue of Section 27 of that Act or, in case such person has died, his legal personal representative.</P>
      <P>Broadly, Section 27 of the 1939 Act specified that children are liable to maintain their parents, that parents are liable to maintain their offspring up to the age of sixteen, and that spouses are liable to maintain each other.</P>
      <P>I might add that Section 27 of the 1939 Act and Section 31 of the 1953 Act seem to be consistent with Article 41 of the Constitution which stresses the special position of the family as the primary and fundamental unit group of our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the county managers appear to add a little bit on to that, even outside the Constitution, by insisting that the income of brothers and sisters be included when the question <Col N="976" /> of health charges is being considered?</P>

      <P>The Rehabilitation Institution Limited is, for income tax purposes, accepted as being a charity. It is accordingly entitled to the income tax exemptions which are accorded to charities.  It is likewise exempt from corporation profits tax.  If the Deputy intended to refer to another limited company, with which the Rehabilitation Institution Limited is closely associated, the reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  As regards the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to Section 97 of the Finance Bill, copies of which were circulated at the weekend.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the severe damage caused to property by the flooding on June 11th and the losses sustained by many persons in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency and other areas, he will provide compensation from State funds on a basis similar to that provided in 1954.</P>

      <P>Relief of distress is a matter for the local authority in the first instance.  It is not considered that the circumstances of June 11 would justify exceptional relief from State funds such as was afforded on the occasion of the Tolka flooding in 1954 which severely affected large numbers of persons in poor circumstances.</P>

    <P>Persons who have suffered damage of a structural nature to their private <Col N="981" /> dwellings can apply to the Department of Local Government for a grant under the Housing Acts towards the cost of repairing the damage.  Local authorities are empowered to make supplementary grants for the same purpose, if they so wish, and may apply for loans from the Local Loans Fund for the purpose.</P>

      <P>The full text of the resolution referred to and the report of the proceedings of the General Assembly of the United Nations which gives the voting thereon are in the Dáil Library. The resolution contains over twenty clauses but in effect it calls for the breaking off of diplomatic relations with South Africa and the imposition of trade sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained in answer to somewhat similar questions on the 21st November, 1962, we supported resolutions and clauses of resolutions condemning apartheid but that in our belief resolutions calling for sanctions hinder rather than help the ending of apartheid.  At the last session of the General Assembly the Irish delegation voted against the Afro-Asian resolution on apartheid on the grounds that it contained sanction clauses and called on the Security Council, if necessary, to consider the expulsion of South Africa from the organisation. We had supported a motion calling for a separate vote on the contentious clauses.  As these objectionable clauses were retained in the resolution, we <Col N="983" /> were obliged to vote against it.  Had the motion been carried, we would have, as in previous years, voted for the clauses condemning apartheid and calling for its abolition and voted against the clauses calling for the imposition of sanctions and the expulsion of South Africa from the United Nations.</P>

      <P>Why have this Government taken this stand in relation to the use of sanctions, boycott and condemnation of the South African Government when they, not so very long ago, believed particularly strongly in the efficacy and the idea of a boycott and sanctions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think anybody's experience of the attempt to impose sanctions in the middle 1930's would have created grave doubts about the efficacy of sanctions for the curing of international injustice.  If we believed in sanctions, we could not stop at South Africa.  There are a great number of other countries in which democratic and human rights are denied, as the Deputy well knows.  If there were to be a policy of sanctions to cure a grave injustice that exists in South Africa, we could not stop there. I do not think we should begin until a joint policy is thought out and could be made generally applicable, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this argument by the Minister on the efficacy of sanctions would have occurred to the members of the African countries which recommend them?  Furthermore, leaving aside the principle of trying to help these unfortunate people in their struggle for freedom, does the Minister not believe that, on the long view of Ireland itself at some time looking for the establishment of self-determination in the six north-eastern counties, by this action they are alienating the African countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The needs of tourist roads are among the considerations which councils will normally take into account in deciding on the distribution of their roads resources, including their Road Fund grants.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 to 54 together.</P>
      <P>It is a responsibility of the Dublin Corporation to rehouse, in accordance with a statutory scale of preferences, persons displaced from houses condemned as unfit, overcrowded or dangerous.  Provision has been made so that preference can be given to persons displaced from dangerous buildings.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Corporation have taken steps to deal with the present situation both by increasing the number of staff dealing with dangerous buildings and by providing additional dwellings for those who have to be rehoused from the dwellings found to be dangerous.  I have already indicated on a number of occasions that I shall be only too happy to co-operate with the Corporation in every way open to me to assist them to increase the supply of new tenancies to relieve the situation as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Corporation's powers to deal with dangerous buildings, independently of their operations under the Housing Acts, are not subject to any statutory supervision or sanction by the Minister for Local Government, <Col N="1003" /> and there are no statistics furnished to my Department regarding the number of houses classified as dangerous and still occupied.  I understand that many dangerous building notices are served in respect of defective chimneys, roofs, etc. where the houses themselves are not considered dangerous to occupy.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I have directed a public local inquiry to be held into the circumstances connected with the collapse of buildings, involving loss of life, at Bolton Street and Fenian Street and into the administration of the law respecting unfit dwellings and dangerous structures in relation to these buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the heart of this matter is in 1957 we had a surplus of houses in the city of Dublin greater than we had tenants to apply for and that today in 1963 we have an acute shortage of houses in the city of Dublin?  Is this not the root cause of the appalling scandal whereby we are held up before the world as a country with a capital city in which people are suffered to die because of the houses collapsing around them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been made that the powers the Corporation Housing Committee have at present are archaic.  Would the Minister agree that is so and, if he does agree, would he take steps to bring into the House whatever legislation he feels is required to deal expeditiously with this matter in the future, as it certainly has not been dealt with in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not at all agree with the assertions made by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the basic cause of the recent unfortunate accidents arising out of buildings falling down.  I do not think Question Time is the appropriate time to go into the full details as to how the situation has arisen that there is a shortage of houses in Dublin to-day which was not the experience in 1956-57.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Dr. Browne, his supplementary dealt with future housing policy and what powers housing authorities have or have not.  There are so many aspects of this matter that it would be impossible to give any full answer to the specific point raised by him.  In regard to one aspect, however, that is, the lack of power to acquire property in order to carry out proper rehousing, that matter is being taken care of and the reasons behind it are outlined in the Planning and Development Bill now before the House.  Under this Bill, housing authorities generally will be greatly facilitated in their efforts to acquire derelict property or property that is not necessarily derelict but is required in order to ensure proper development.  If the Deputy feels there is neglect of any other aspect, I suggest that he put down a specific question and I shall endeavour to give a specific answer.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 55 and 56 together. The letting of housing accommodation provided under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, subject to compliance with the provisions of the Housing (Management and Lettings) Regulations, is a function of the housing authority concerned, in which I am not empowered to intervene.  I understand, however, that it is not a fact that the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation made a decision on the lines indicated in question No. 55.  The Committee's decision was to suspend the housing of three-person evicted families for a period of six months when the matter will again be reviewed.</P>

Are there no steps the Minister can take to bring this failure to the attention of the Housing Committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to deal with questions Nos. 58 to 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday last, the 11th June, a severe thunderstorm accompanied by torrential rain caused extensive flooding in the Dublin-Dún Laoghaire area. Final figures of the actual amount of rain which fell are not yet available, but indications are that at the heaviest point the fall may have reached about seven inches in the day.  At one place, outside the main storm area, 3.4 inches of rain fell in two and a half hours. This unprecedented downpour resulted in heavy overloading of the surface water drainage system.  The position was aggravated by two additional factors, one, the blocking of certain culverts by debris, the other, the temporary failure of the Londonbridge Road pumping station, which was struck by lightning.  This pumping station was the only one affected.  It deals with discharges from the Pembroke area and its stoppage intensified <Col N="1010" /> the flooding in some degree, particularly in the vicinity of St. Alban's Park.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the flooding, I asked Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation for reports on the causative factors, the measures taken to deal with the situation, the adequacy of the means available and what action was proposed to minimise the effects of any similar occurrence in the future.  Pending the receipt of those reports, I am not in a position to deal with a large number of points of detail which have been raised in the questions.</P>
    <P>In general, however, I am aware that the local authorities have been taking steps to meet the increased need for surface water drainage which arises from extensive housing development in south Dublin.  A major surface water drainage scheme, estimated to cost about £300,000 is being undertaken jointly by Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation. The main interceptor from Kilmacud to Dean's Grange has been completed and operated satisfactorily during the storm.  A further stage of this scheme, prepared by Dublin County Council for surface water drainage in the Roebuck-Belfield-Stillorgan Road area, was fully approved by me in February, 1962, but has been impeded by protracted land acquisition difficulties. Steps have been taken by the council to overcome these obstacles.</P>
    <P>For some time past, Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have been considering the general question of the drainage of the south city and contiguous areas, and, in consultation with my Department, have arranged for a full examination of the position with a view to the preparation of further drainage schemes in the south county and south city areas.  The adequacy of the arrangements for drainage discharge through the Londonbridge Road station and otherwise is one of the matters under review.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to ask the Government to provide compensation for persons who have suffered inconvenience or damage to property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting the fact that the rainfall on this occasion was abnormal, is the Minister aware that in the Kilmacud area of Stillorgan over a number of years, there has been repeated flooding, and is he satisfied his Department and the local authority concerned are justified in permitting further building until such time as the outlet arrangements are made sufficiently satisfactory to carry the excessive quantities of water that have arisen there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the matters of detail that I would prefer not to comment on until I have received these general reports I have requested from all three local authorities.  Having received those, it may well be that we may have to take the steps suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only fair to say that as far as we are aware at the moment, the damage would be somewhat on a parallel with the flood damage that occurred in Cork some time ago.  In those circumstances, it was decided no special fund should be set up in order to pay compensation, but, at the same time, in so far as damage to house property was concerned, it was made quite clear that grants from my Department for repairs to house property that might have been damaged by these floods would be dealt with in the ordinary way and, in addition, that the local authorities would be prepared to operate their supplementary housing grant scheme to help out.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if the Taoiseach is serious about this, but we are.  This Bill arrived in the hands of Deputies yesterday afternoon.  It is admitted the general principles announced in the Budget are contained in this Bill, but there are also matters of great detail in it which were not mentioned in the Budget.  Most Deputies spent this morning travelling to Dublin and I do not think it is fair to ask, having regard to the spate of Bills this afternoon, that the Bill should be proceeded with tomorrow.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite well aware that normally there is no serious debate on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill.  It is regarded as a Bill proper for consideration in Committee <Col N="1043" /> and it is only because of special circumstances that a protracted debate on the Second Reading must be visualised this year.  Deputies are also aware that there is a period in which the Bill must be completed by the Dáil and go forward to the Seanad to enable it to be enacted within a specific period.

In those special circumstances, so far as we in Fine Gael are concerned, we are prepared to discuss the Second Stage and our amendment to this Bill on Wednesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 43, to insert: &ldquo; `company' means a public Company within the meaning of the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1924.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, we had some quite considerable discussion in reference to the manner in which the <Col N="1044" /> company would exercise the functions allotted to it under Section 3.  One of the difficulties that has arisen in any effort made to investigate whether taxpayers' moneys have been expended in a proper way has all too often been the fact that the company to which such moneys were made available was not a public company within the meaning of the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1959.  If a company is not a public company within the meaning of those Acts, then an investigation in the Companies Office by any person anxious to trace what has transpired in relation to taxpayers' money expended by the State is bound to be brought to a most unsatisfactory conclusion.  If a company is not a public company, the only information in the Companies Office consists of the names of the directors, the names of the shareholders and particulars of actual mortgages, debentures or other charges.</P>
    <P>If State money is being made available under this Bill to any particular company, it is highly desirable, not merely in the interests of probity&mdash; about which I make no suggestions&mdash; but in the interests of the company concerned, that the whole payments should be made in a clear and above-board way.  The only way in which that can be done is if the company receiving the benefit files in the Companies Office, and is under an obligation so to file, its balance sheet and its profit and loss accounts.  If it is filing in the Companies Office its balance sheet and its profit and loss accounts, then it is possible for anyone to inspect those accounts and to see whether the ratio of private enterprise money, on the one hand, and the money that is being put up by this new company, on the other, bears a proper relationship to the proprieties of expenditure by the State.</P>
    <P>The possibility of such inspection negatives unnecessary rumours, negatives wild rumours, and will ensure beyond question that the matter will be seen in its true and proper perspective.</P>
    <P>I see no reason whatever why a company that is going to receive the substantial State assistance envisaged in this Bill should shy away <Col N="1045" /> from having its profit and loss account and balance sheet filed in the Companies Office in the ordinary manner. The effect of that could be achieved in another way but the simplest way of all, in my view, to do it is to provide that it will be only public companies which will be assisted under this Bill by the company that the Minister is setting up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has pointed out, the object of this amendment is to ensure that information can be got in the Companies Office with regard to a company that would receive any concessions from Taiscí Stáit.  I can understand the Deputy's anxiety to have information about the financial affairs of any company benefiting as a result of the passage of this Bill but, having considered this matter again since the Committee Stage, I am afraid I cannot agree with the Deputy that that is the only way that this matter can be approached and the only way in which sufficient information can be given to the public of the transactions of any company that may get a loan or subscribed capital from Taiscí Stáit.</P>
      <P>We must visualise that a company that will get this loan will have had comprehensive negotiations with both An Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Credit Company.  There will be negotitions with regard to a grant, first of all and, secondly, with regard to a loan, whether by way of an ordinary loan or by way of capital subscribed to the new company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we all agree that during those negotiations it would be unwise to look for any kind of publicity whatsoever but we have to go a little further because even when the negotiations have concluded and when it looks as if everything has been fixed so that the applicant company will go ahead with its business here, there may be a little time before everything is fairly certain.  The first risk we run, therefore, by bringing in publication is that the company might not go on for one reason or another and it would have done damage both to ourselves and to the applicant <Col N="1046" /> company that publication should have taken place before that decision was taken by the company.</P>
    <P>But, even if it does go ahead, Deputies will agree that in its formative years or, at least, for a period after it has got agreement on the loan and while the factory is being built, it would not welcome any kind of publicity.  For one thing, my experience and, I am sure, the experience of all Deputies here is that these companies that intend setting up business here are rather secretive until they have got a site and a contract, perhaps, for the building and all those other things that must be got before any great publicity is given.  They are afraid, naturally, that prices will be put up on them if they have to give prior publicity.  That means that we must wait a little longer at any rate before any publicity can be given.</P>
    <P>I should like to make this point also: An Foras Tionscal is giving grants, some of them substantial, to companies coming in here and we have been satisfied here with the publicity that is given to these grants by a yearly report of An Foras Tionscal of its activities.  I do not think we should ask for more here because if we are satisfied with a report of its activities for the year from An Foras Tionscal where an outright, non-repayable grant is given, in this case we are giving a loan which would be repaid and which does not cost the State so much as a grant.  Therefore, I do not think we should make the provisions more stringent.</P>
    <P>Having these things in mind, I would ask the Deputy to agree to a more restricted form of publication of information which I am proposing in a later amendment.  It must be remembered that An Foras Tionscal&mdash;or it might be An Bord Fáilte&mdash;will have given very deep and keen consideration to an application before they will agree to give a grant and the Industrial Credit Company which will be responsible for half the loan will have examined it in detail also.  I think we are fairly safe that nothing that might be regarded as slipshod or dangerous will happen under these conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> I would ask the Deputy, therefore, to withdraw the amendment and let us try to agree on the amendment I have put down with regard to publication of the transactions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a little bit of slipshod thinking by the Minister in the statement he has just made.  First of all, this is not a Bill, in Section 3, to make loans alone.  It is a Bill either to make loans or to acquire shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not explain that.  That is a very different thing altogether.  We will be coming to amendment No. 3 presently.  Without being the least bit offensive about it, let me say in relation to amendment No. 3: &ldquo;Thanks for nothing.&rdquo; That will be included in the new Companies Bill, where there is a subsidiary.  It is only a question of the Minister saying that he will have a copy of the accounts placed on the Table of the Dáil and attach it to the report.  Under the new Companies Bill, a company will have to publish its own accounts, the accounts of its subsidiary and the consolidated accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A private company as such does not have to publish a balance sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit I am discussing amendment No. 3 because the Minister has thrown it out as an alternative to amendment No. 1.  Where a private company is a subsidiary of a public company&mdash;and Taiscí Stáit is a public company&mdash;it has to publish its consolidated accounts and the accounts of the subsidiary.  There was very considerable discussion on this point, as the Minister will see in the report of the Companies Bill Committee.  It was made very clear at that Committee that a public company could not be permitted to hive off secretly some of its affairs in the privately poly-owned subsidiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 contains, in effect, what will have to be done under the Companies Bill.  Let me say quite frankly that although I say: &ldquo;Thanks for nothing&rdquo; to amendment No. 3 because it will be in the Companies <Col N="1048" /> Bill, at the same time, I think it is an improvement because it shows a change of view.  It is desirable in this type of transaction that the maximum amount of information that can be made available without harm should be made available.  It is even more desirable in a case such as this where a company will operate&mdash;and correctly operate&mdash; under Ministerial direction rather than by bringing indirect pressure to bear and then coming to the House and saying that the Board have made up their minds as if it were a commercially viable undertaking.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 43, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister shall lay on the Table of the Dail a copy of each direction given by him under subsection (2) (a) hereof, and such copy shall be so laid as soon as possible after it has been given.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know whether in his remarks the Minister intended to cover amendment No. 2 as well as amendment No. 1.  I cannot see any objection to the Minister saying publicly&mdash;and this is the easiest way of saying it publicly: &ldquo;I have given a direction that such and such shall be done.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we take amendments Nos. 2 and 4 together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly, if you wish.  I do not think it is desirable that it should be left until such time as the report comes out at the end of the year for the notification to be made that the direction has issued.  As I understand the situation, the fact that such a direction has issued would have to be referred to in the report.  If it has not got to be referred to in the report, the sooner we change the method of reporting the better.  As I understand it, the report must refer to it.  That comes in a matter of perhaps two months or three months after the end of the accounting year of Taisci Stait. I do not think it is desirable that we should have to wait as long as that to know that the direction has been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> What is the alternative?  It is that I would issue a standing order to the Dail Office that on the first sitting day of every month, a question would be put down to the Minister for Finance asking what directions he had given during the preceding month.  That would be putting an unnecessary strain on everyone concerned.  If I put down the question, the Minister would have to answer it.  He has already admitted that he would have to answer and say whether he had given any directions during the month.  It seems to me that it would be much better if he would do something such as I have suggested rather than have this cumbersome method of asking regular questions.  It has been suggested from time to time that the average cost of a Parliamentary question is about £5.  That would be about £60 a year.  It would also be a most cumbersome, and unnecessarily cumbersome, method of getting information.</P>
    <P>Surely the proper method is for a Minister to come to the Dáil&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;come to the Dáil&rdquo;, I mean give notice to the Clerk of the House which, under the new Standing Orders, will be the appropriate method of placing papers on the Table of the House&mdash;and say that he has given a direction.  When I say he should do that as soon as may be, I am not suggesting that he should send a sprinter across from the Department of Finance with a copy of the direction. Surely it is a matter of ordinary courtesy that it should be placed on the Table of the House as soon as may be. That would be much more seemly than the method of putting down regular questions which the Minister must answer.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I did not go the whole way with the Minister on the last day about giving notice before he made the direction.  Indeed, I think the Minister came a long way to meet me.  He has revised his opinion since then.  The fact remains that whether or not this amendment is accepted I can get the information by putting down a question on the first sitting day of every month.  Surely it is not desirable that we should have to go to those lengths?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to add the following subsection to section 17:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) Where the Company furnishes a copy of accounts pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, they shall annex thereto&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) a copy of the latest balance <Col N="1051" /> sheet of each company which is a subsidiary of the Company and a copy of the auditor's report on such balance sheet, and</P>
    <P>(ii) as respects each such company which is required to lay a profit and loss account before general meetings, a copy of the latest profit and loss account.</P>
    <P>(b) In paragraph (a) of this subsection &ldquo;company which is a subsidiary of the Company&rdquo; means a company of which a half or more of the ordinary share capital is owned by the Company.</P>
    <P>(c) In paragraph (b) of this subsection &ldquo;ordinary share capital&rdquo; means, in relation to a company, all the issued capital (by whatever name called) of such company, other than capital the holders whereof have a right to a dividend at a fixed rate or a rate fluctuating in accordance with the rate of income tax, but have no other right to share in the profits of the company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice the provision which refers to the parent company holding 50 per cent or more of the ordinary share capital which is, I think, a bit better than the provision in the Companies Bill.  I had in mind one company where 50 per cent is held.  That is the difference here.  It refers to 50 per cent or more, rather than 50 per cent.</P>

What the Companies Bill provides or will provide, if the amendments indicated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce are agreed&mdash;I cannot <Col N="1052" /> remember; I think it is in that Bill but I was bemused by that Bill and the number of reports and sections in it&mdash;that if a private company has another private company subsidiary, then it is not bound to publish anything. That is agreed. As I understand it, if a public company has a private company subsidiary, then it is bound, notwithstanding that the subsidiary is a private company, to publish consolidated accounts.  That is the difference that is involved.  I take it I am right in thinking that this company, Taiscí Stáit, which the Minister is inaugurating will be a public company?</P>

The Minister will realise at once from his own commercial knowledge that if a public company were not bound to publish the consolidated balance sheet of its wholly-owned subsidiary company, it would be a very simple method of the public company getting around the Companies Bill, and hence the need for this.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of the Central Fund or the growing produce there-of and out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to provide for matters related to superannuation and pensions in respect of public service.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a question which he might be able to deal with, although I want it to be clear I do not expect him to give me now an answer to the problem I shall put to him.  I shall be quite satisfied if he writes to me in due course because it is a technical matter.  As I understand it, people who retired from the post of local agent, on a part-time basis, in the Department of Social Welfare and the old National Health Insurance Society, were entitled to an award of a gratuity on their retirement.  Whether it was given as a pension or a gratuity under the Superannuation Acts or not, I am not absolutely certain.  It was in the nature of a compassionate gratuity, possibly, and therefore was not, strictly speaking, part of the Superannuation Acts, though I believe the matter was considered for inclusion in these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there is a restriction on the payment of such gratuities.  The annuities have been paid on retirement unless the person concerned happens to be doing anything else under any other Department.  The case I came across was one where a person retired on 1st April, 1961 and after that, was doing some temporary unestablished work in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. He was then told he could not get any consideration of his gratuity until such time as he retired from his <Col N="1054" /> unestablished work with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  He reached the retiring age on 1st April this year and applied for consideration of his other gratuity.  He was told thereupon that until such time as he had actually given up the Posts and Telegraphs work, they would not consider what gratuity he would be entitled to under the Superannuation Acts or otherwise in respect of his prior employment.</P>
    <P>There might be some case for saying to this person: &ldquo;We shall not pay anything until such time as you leave the State service altogether&rdquo; but it seems to be all wrong that the man concerned should not at least be told: &ldquo;You will get x pounds when you do ultimately retire from the service of the State&rdquo;.  To say that there would be no question of considering whether or not he will get it in respect of one employment until another employment is terminated seems to be all wrong and the matter should be clarified under the Superannuation Acts, if at all possible.  I prefer not to mention individuals' names, although I suppose it does not matter in this regard.  He cannot be traced from that point of view; the gentleman concerned is Mr. John O'Brien, and the Minister will be able to get the reference from the Secretary to the Department of Social Welfare who wrote to me in relation to the matter on 6th April last.  I appreciate that it is a matter to which I could not expect any answer now and I should be glad if the Minister in due course would let me know if the passage of this Bill will eliminate the anomaly to which I have referred.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I want to raise a number of matters on the Money Resolution.  I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to say what the cost of the Bill will be or how much is involved.  As I mentioned on the Second Stage, a private Deputy moving amendments to this Bill could expect to find that they would be out of order and although I have tabled a number of amendments, they are out of order because they would, if <Col N="1055" /> accepted, involve a charge on public funds.  It is for that reason that I want to raise certain matters at this stage. The aim of this Bill, so far as one can see any definite objective in it, is to enable a greater degree of mobility to be operated so far as the State or semi-State servants are concerned.  That idea is generally welcomed as it has advantages from the point of view either of the State or of State or semi-State companies.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the House is entitled to some information about the actual policy behind the decision because in some cases it would appear that an arbitrary selection is being made of particular officers, particular companies, undertakings or appointments in the Civil Service.  Therefore, I am anxious to find out what will be the actual cost of this measure because if the principle is accepted that so far as it is consistent with efficient and satisfactory administration of the Civil Service, or the efficient and economic running of State companies, there is a good case for making appointments as mobile as possible, then if the transfer of an officer or official is approved as being in the interests of the service, it should be facilitated.</P>
      <P>It is difficult, because of the wide range of positions covered and affected by this Bill, not to refer to individual cases.  As we proceed, certain individual cases may come to mind.  At this stage I will confine myself merely to suggesting that the Minister should indicate the policy behind it and if the same criterion will apply to all positions where, say, the Civil Service are satisfied that it would be in the interest of efficient administration, and in the case of State companies where similar standards would apply.  If one person is entitled to added years for pension purposes for service, on the one hand, with the Civil Service and, subsequently, say, with a State company, if there are any cases where a person is employed in one branch of the public service and is transferred to another, then the service should count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill that has been taken from a very long list of cases which should be considered for <Col N="1056" /> superannuation.  There are only a few principles in it.  One is the principle of transfer from one office to another. There is a policy of enlarging that idea and I have come to the conclusion that it is a very good thing and we may get very much better officers and we may get very much better service by having this facility, by having this transfer from the Civil Service to a State company, or from a State company to the Civil Service, and so on.  There is the second principle of treating redundancy which has not been recognised in the Civil Service for a long time back.  I think it was there in the early stages but not for many years back.  There are certain classes brought into the Service, some established and some unestablished. There are certain workers in the Board of Works and in the Land Commission as unestablished officers and there are certain bodies such as the Folklore Commission and the School of Art.  There are a few such categories brought into the established service.</P>
      <P>Apart from these general principles, there are a number of individual cases being dealt with.  The individual cases might refer to other persons but it is not likely.  It is a sort of omnibus Bill as the Deputy mentioned and we have to take it as such.  Points in the Bill have come before me several times during the past few years, as to whether such and such a principle should be agreed to or not, and it has taken a lot of consideration and thought to find out how far we should go without, perhaps, going too far.  The cost is not very high.  It is calculated that the annual cost will be about £34,000.  The non-recurring cost will be about £42,000, that is, for these redundancy payments and so on, which will occur only once.  The cost is not very much and I do not know if the annual cost will increase very much.  I expect it will increase a little as time goes on but not a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to certain categories of State servants and I should just like to follow that up because there are two categories which come to mind particularly. One category is that of Board <Col N="1057" /> of Works employees and the other is that of temporary Post Office employees.  So far as the Board of Works employees are concerned, some of them are regarded as holding quasi-permanent positions.  The bulk of them are entitled to no superannuation benefits.  Some of them may be entitled to superannuation.</P>
      <P>I am thinking particularly of a place such as the Harbour Works in Dún Laoghaire where there are a large number of Board of Works employees. To get some sort of comparable case, there are the corporation employees of, say, Dún Laoghaire or Dublin or county council employees or, in the case of Dún Laoghaire, the Irish Lights.  If they are employed with the corporation, the county council or the Irish Lights, they are entitled, in the case of the corporation or the county council, to superannuation under the Superannuation Act, 1948, but, under the present position, the majority of Board of Works employees are not entitled to any superannuation.</P>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would consider the position of these men because they have made representations over a long time.  Where the employment is of a casual nature, there is a difficulty in making the ordinary superannuation terms apply to them or making it operative.  However, in the majority of cases, these men are quasi-permanent which means that, subject to satisfactory performance of their duties and work, they are retained in the position.  Consequently, many of them have many years service.</P>
      <P>Similarly in the case of Post Office workers.  Most of them in that category have many years service.  Very serious consideration should be given to granting them superannuation terms. I do not know whether or not it is necessary to have legislation for it but if not, of course, it is a simpler matter. The question of contributions would undoubtedly arise.  These men would be quite willing and prepared to pay contributions in order to cover superannuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic towards that.  I should like to move, as far as possible, towards establishing those <Col N="1058" /> who are working for the State.  There are limits.  A big number of State servants are not full-time and, therefore, could not be established.  In the case of the State, I think we should not establish any persons unless they came in through some form of competitive entrance examination&mdash;whatever form it might be.  It would be wrong to have people brought in, as they are now in certain of these categories, and to establish them afterwards.  Subject to these two tests, I think we could go a bit further in establishing further grades and I am very sympathetic to that, I must say.</P>

      <P>In page 4, after line 25, to insert after subsection (4) the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Section 4 of the Superannuation Act, 1887, is hereby amended by the insertion at the end of the section of `not exceeding fifteen years and, in case he has served in the employment for more than fifteen years, a further compassionate gratuity not exceeding two weeks' pay for each year of his service in his employment in excess of fifteen years.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appeal was made to me to be a bit more generous in the gratuities paid to unestablished civil servants when retiring.  Deputies will know that before the introduction of this Bill a person had to have 15 years' service before getting a gratuity at all.  That is now brought down to seven years. This amendment says that any service over 15 years will count for two weeks in each year.  It will mean that civil servants who live to normal middle age&mdash;I do not say to full age&mdash;will in all probability receive a full year's earnings when retiring under this <Col N="1059" /> section.  Some of them, indeed, may get a good lot more than a year.  I do not think there is any private employer, where there is no superannuation scheme, who would give more generous terms.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered also that all these workers are insured and, therefore, would be entitled to the contributory old age pension as well.  Taking all in all, I think that the improvement in the old age pension&mdash;which we hope to see improved again before the end of this year&mdash;will mean that their condition will be very much better than it was two or three years ago.  I do not think we can go any further at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments which have been ruled out of order was, in one case, to allow persons who had service as national or secondary teachers to be entitled to have transferable established service for the purpose of the section, and in the other, to permit those who had Army service and who held a military service medal, in the case of those who had Old IRA service, and those who had Army service and had service either during the Emergency or otherwise, to have a transferable established service for the purpose of this section. This matter was discussed on the Second Stage.  I want to urge that the matter be given consideration by the Minister before this Bill is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has, I think, been a very strong agitation on behalf of a great number of Army personnel, particularly those with relatively short service, some of whom had no pension for the Army <Col N="1060" /> service.  Possibly some got a gratuity but many served, say, for a number of years and subsequently secured employment with the Civil Service or with local authorities or, with vocational committees.  There is a wide range of different places where they might have&mdash;and some already have&mdash; got positions.  I think there is a very strong case for including the service for pension purposes.  There is one obvious reason.  Many of the ex-Army personnel are most suitable for and have rendered very good service in other appointments.  Indeed, some of them have left the Army at a comparatively early age because of the prospects of service elsewhere.  In view of the suitability of the Army personnel for particular positions, there is a strong case for allowing service in the Army to be counted for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>In the case of Army personnel who have a minimum period to qualify for an Army pension and who subsequently get a position either with a local authority or a vocational committee or, in certain circumstances with the Civil Service, or with a State body, it happens that although they have had the necessary period for a minimum Army pension, because of the lateness of their entry to the other employment, they are too old to qualify for a full pension.  In such a case, I think the two periods should be aggregated and some arrangement worked out under which whatever contributions are payable would be apportioned between the earlier and the later service.  For that reason, some more reasonable proposal might be considered which would enable service in the Army to be considered for pension purposes subsequently.  I say this because I think everybody recognises whether the personnel concerned are Old IRA&mdash;naturally they are fewer now and will be fewer in the future &mdash;or regular Army, their service in the Army and subsequently in civilian posts reflects the highest credit on them.  Similarly Army personnel who served for shorter periods during, after or prior to the Emergency have enhanced their own reputations and <Col N="1061" /> promoted the efficiency and welfare of the organisations to which they were appointed.</P>
    <P>Many of them are peculiarly suitable and qualified&mdash;and have proved it&mdash; for these posts.  We should encourage that tendency for a variety of reasons, first, their suitability for appointment to non-military posts which has the advantage that Army and military training is beneficial generally and it also has the advantage that if they get such posts it opens up further opportunities for Army personnel, leading to more vacancies and consequential promotion.  I urge the Minister to consider Army service as transferrable established service for the purposes of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy has in mind here legalising what has gone before or what refers to the future.  Previously, where an individual transferred himself, the rule I have tried to apply is: where it is done for the good of the country we should cover it but where it was done for the good of the individual we should leave it out.  In future, the Minister will designate the organisations from or to which transfers can be made and it will be possible&mdash;we have not considered the matter yet &mdash; to bring teachers into that.  If the authority agrees that the teacher might be transferred to another organisation where the persons in that organisation agree or request the teacher to come, the matter could be covered.</P>
      <P>The Army case is more difficult and I could not express an opinion on it because Army pensions are very different from pensions of other organisations.  They are for a very short duration and I think it is seldom an Army man transfers to another organisation until he has got his pension. We would be dealing with a different case there.  It is more often the case in the Army of a man getting his pension and then going into another occupation.  The matter would require special consideration.</P>

      <P>Yes, they are consequential.

Before he went to an Bord Iascaigh Mhara he was in the Fisheries Division of the Department of Lands so that there are two transfers and these three amendments are necessary to deal with them.  If the person had not transferred, or if the transfer had not taken place until this legislation had been enacted he would come under the Act and would have no trouble.  Because he is already transferred we have to put in the first amendment to go back to 30th April, 1963.  The second amendment is necessary because there are two transfers <Col N="1063" /> and, therefore, three people have to give consent.

      <P>(a) service of the person reckonable as pensionable service for the purposes of the former scheme shall, provided he does not get a return of contributions under that scheme, be reckoned as pensionable service for the purposes of the latter scheme,</P>

    <P>This is a similar amendment.  It concerns the case of a man who transferred from CIE to Bórd Fáilte and he was also a civil servant.  The same arguments apply.

    </Speaker>
    <P>When the amendment was brought in to allow added years to professional men who were required to have experience before being appointed to the Civil Service, it was considered by the Departments concerned that the serving men, who also had to go through this, were deserving of some consideration. We could not very well say we were <Col N="1065" /> doing it for the serving men in order to encourage recruitment, but at the same time, we felt it was unfair that a man should come in this year and have six or seven added years, whereas a man who came in last year had nothing extra.  We said, therefore, we would go half way and allow the serving men half of the term that would be given to the man who comes in now.</P>
    <P>This amendment lays down that before appointment the appointee must have had a period of professional experience and also that his appointment to such a position was made otherwise than on promotion or transfer from another established position.

As far as the Bill is concerned, a number of civil servants feel, that, because of the limitations in it, the benefits will be comparatively restricted. I have in mind one particular category I want to mention here.  They were mentioned on the Second Stage&mdash; the social welfare officers.  When these officers were recruited in 1935 they were given, because of their experience, five increments.  Most of them were recruited at ages higher than the normal recruiting age.  They <Col N="1066" /> were given the five increments, but they were not given added years for pension purposes.  One of the difficulties about the present Bill is that their position will not, as far as one can gather, be improved.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of additional years for professional and technical qualifications.  Under this section, subsections (3) to (12), provision is made that notional years may be added to the actual service of certain civil servants in professional positions, who are required before appointment to have a number of years' professional experience. Because these civil servants cannot enter the Service until they have obtained their professional qualifications and subsequently have become experienced for a minimum number of years, few of them qualify for full pension and gratuity under the Superannuation Acts.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, until about the year 1914 there was special provision in an earlier Superannuation Act, the 1859 Act, which enabled the Departments to make appointments to professional situations without going through the normal procedure of appointment by public advertisement by the Civil Service Commissioners. Up to then these appointments under the British Civil Service were regarded as patronage appointments.  In 1914, the section of the 1829 Act was repealed and the power to make these appointments was taken away.  There has, however, been power since 1865 to add years to local authority employees.  This power, as far as the present position is concerned, is contained in Section 13 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Bill, 1956, and the regulations under that section which make provision for the addition of up to ten years in the case of an officer retiring from an office, the qualifications for which are professional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as it stands, allows added years at the discretion of the Minister for Finance of such notional period as the Minister may direct or decide not exceeding the number of years professional experience the officer is required to have to qualify for appointment, or ten years, whichever <Col N="1067" /> is the lesser.  This subsection applies only to positions designated in accordance with subsection (12).  The Minister indicated in the course of the Second Stage it was proposed to add years only where it was necessary as an aid to recruitment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of this section provides in the case of existing civil servants, who hold positions considered by the Minister for Finance to be analogous to positions which were subsequently designated under subsection (12) &ldquo;there shall be added, if the Minister in his discretion so directs, to the civil servant's service in an established position such notional period as the Minister directs not exceeding one half of that provided for by subsection (3) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as recruitment is concerned, added years provide no incentive except where the person appointed is comparatively old.  Younger persons will not be induced into the Civil Service by the prospect of a few added years of retirement.  The justification and the reason for added years by this idea of adding notional service is that a person cannot be appointed to a professional position until he has, first of all, spent whatever number of years are requisite to qualify for that professional position.  Subsequently, he must spend a certain number of years in practice, in the case of a lawyer, doctor, engineer or whatever the profession may be.</P>
    <P>As I say, he must, first of all, spend a certain number of years qualifying and afterwards add to that a number of years of actual practice at his profession. All this means that the person who is subsequently appointed to a Civil Service position will be so appointed at a much later age than would be the case if he were appointed directly out of a competition after leaving school or after taking a university degree.  One of the advantages of the present position is that the State gets the value of the experience which these professional persons acquire. This experience can be got only by a person spending several years in the actual work of his profession.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that one of the objections <Col N="1068" /> to the present legislation is that it will lead to some anomalies.  The subsection cannot apply to an existing officer until the office to which he has been appointed on entering the Civil Service is designated under subsection 12 as a professional office, and that may not occur until after the person retires in certain cases.  It may mean that some existing officers, because of the circumstances, may be treated more beneficially than others because of recruitment difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is also possible the section may prevent rather than assist movement between the Civil Service and the other services.  A professional officer of a local authority who is appointed to a position in the Civil Service will be pensionable only after longer service than he would have been given credit for if he had remained in the local authority service because he will lose the ten years he would gain under the Local Government (Superannuation) Acts and will get only what is granted in the Minister's discretion under Sections 6 and 7 of this Bill.  I would suggest to the Minister that where a civil servant has served in an established position for not less than ten years and where his position involved professional experience, the period be adjudged as a year and four months for each year in reckoning any pension, lump sum or gratuity.  That would cover the position which arises because of the late age at which a number of these professional civil servants are appointed.  The section could apply, say, to all professional qualifications&mdash;architects, barristers-at-law, dentists, engineers, medical practitioners, veterinary surgeons, and so forth.</P>
    <P>In that way, those who are appointed at a later age because of professional qualifications would be granted the added years and this would provide the necessary incentives. One of the objections which retiring civil servants have is that at the most they get credit only for half the specified minimum number of years. The case that has been made to me, and I presume to the Minister, is that civil servants find the terms of the Local Government (Superannuation) <Col N="1069" /> Acts of 1948 and 1956 are more satisfactory and offer more generous or more attractive terms to local government employees than are offered here, and that similar provisions might be included in this legislation.</P>

      <P>A lot of thought still has to be given to this, even when the Bill has been passed, because the classes have to be designated.  I have in mind particularly the medical men, with whom I am most intimately associated, and it will be stipulated that they must have seven years' experience. That is a very simple matter. We could have future entrants to whom we could say: &ldquo;We will add seven years for superannuation purposes.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Seven years' experience. We could also take the technical men in the Civil Service and, supposing that service were laid down for their recruitment, we could add half the seven years or, say, three years.  We can designate the classes to which it refers and we can, of course, alter the number of years, and enlarge it somewhat on the lines advocated by the Deputy, in our method of designation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly concerned in relation to the plight of social welfare officers.  About 55 social welfare officers and ten superintendents are likely to be declared redundant and compulsorily retired within a very short time.  The House will appreciate that the withdrawal of the 55 officers and ten supervisors will mean a very great saving to the Exchequer and it is desirable and necessary in declaring these people redundant, the Minister should endeavour to be as generous as he possibly can in providing for their pensions under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a rather alarming state of affairs that so many officers in the Social Welfare Department are to be denied their means of livelihood, many at an age when they will find it most difficult to secure alternative employment.  We are concerned for the future of these men, their wives, families and dependants. <Col N="1070" /> If we do not provide adequately for their retirement in this Bill, we will have done these men, who have worked for this State so diligently, conscientiously and enthusiastically, a very grave injustice.</P>
    <P>Section I sets out the number of years that may be granted as not more than ten for a man who has been established for 20 years or more, and not more than half his years of service for a man who has served between ten and 20 years.  Not more than five years will be granted to a man who has served not more than ten years.  Subsection (2) provides that the added notional period must not be longer than the difference between the age of the man on retirement and 65, which would be the normal age of retirement. My Party is concerned for the social welfare officers in their particular plight and we feel this provision should be removed since in the case of local government employees, vocational teachers and others, the maximum notional period is ten years, regardless of the age at retirement.  We believe social welfare officers should be placed on the same basis as other redundant civil servants and given the opportunity to make up as much as possible of the 40 years' established service necessary to qualify for a full pension.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have particular regard to that latter point.  In declaring these men redundant, he should be generous and he should award the notional period of service required to bring them up to the maximum years of service thereby permitting them to draw the full pension.  It would be inequitable, unfair and unjust to put these men out on the unemployment scrapheap and opportunity should be taken now to avail of this measure to safeguard their position.  We must avail of this measure now since we may not get another opportunity for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views again on this matter.  I should like to know if he has given consideration to the particular plight of the social welfare officers, the same consideration as he has given to other very deserving cases.  Indeed, we applaud such consideration.  Many of these people are losing their employment <Col N="1071" /> because their positions are being abolished.  Others are losing their employment because of the introduction of efficiency methods which the Minister and his Department regard as necessary.  Before we decide on matters of efficiency or the abolition of posts, we should, first of all, consider the human factor involved and we should provide alternative employment, without loss of benefits or salary scale, or, alternatively, retire these people on the maximum pensions, availing of this particular section in this measure to add years of service, if necessary, thereby ensuring that these will have a sufficiency on which to maintain themselves, their wives and other dependents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, up to this the Minister had power to retire men where positions were declared redundant. They were retired on the pension they would get if they were going out voluntarily on sickness or age grounds.  That was often done in the past.  This scheme is brought in to give better terms to men who have been declared redundant.  They may get up to ten years added to their service for pension purposes.  They may also get a half-year's severance pay, as it is called.  If we were to go further than that it would not pay.  It would be better to keep them there doing nothing.</P>

      <P>There is no compulsion actually.  No officer will be compelled to go.  An officer may accept these terms and go; if he does not want to accept them, he may stay on.  The number who have agreed to accept the terms will, I think, meet the redundancy problem fairly substantially.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number that have accepted the present terms will bring about a situation in which there will be practically no redundancy.  There may be a few but their pay will not be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to another category.  It may even be an individual case.  The Minister has power in this section to designate organisations.  A case has been brought to my notice of a person who served for 19 or 20 years in the Civil Service.  He held an appointment in the Museum.  Subsequently he was appointed to a position in Galway University.  Prior to that appointment, he wrote to the Department of Education requesting a statement that in due course an appropriate pension would be paid to him in respect of the 19 years in which he had worked as a civil servant.  I understand that this was covered by the Superannuation Act of 1914 which provides that in certain circumstances public money may be expended to pay a pension to a civil servant who transfers to other employment.  The circumstances are that (a) the transfer is made with the consent of the head officer of the Civil Service Department; (b) the officer recommends the eventual pay of the pension; and (c) that the new employment is approved employment, that is, recognised as employment to which the Act applies, thus meriting the required recognition from the head officer mentioned and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular person was subsequently informed that the Department of Education regretted that the application could not be acceded to and it is suggested now that the Minister should designate universities in the bodies or organisations so that they would come within the scope of the transfer arrangements and, secondly, by safeguarding the rights of pensioned officers transferring to the universities from posts in the Department of Education, the pension rights earned for whatever number of years in the Civil Service would be included with the subsequent service in the universities. <Col N="1073" /> This particular case is not unique. There have been transfers, not very many, in the past from the Civil Service to the universities.  A number of persons employed in the National Library and the National Museum transferred.  Others have not transferred because of this pension difficulty. I think this case, and similar cases, could be regarded as cases in which the work is of national importance.</P>
    <P>A person engaged on historical or archaeological research in the Museum who transfers to a university position puts his experience and his knowledge at the disposal of the university and its students.  Indeed, these people should be entitled to avail of such experience.  I should be glad, therefore, if the Minister would consider providing in this case, or in any other similar cases, that universities will also be included where persons had the prescribed qualifications and service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I know the case the Deputy has in mind.  Designation, I am afraid, would not solve the problem. Really, what should have been done there in the beginning is that he should have sought&mdash;I do not know whether we could agree to it or not; that is another matter&mdash;transfer to approved employment.  Whether he sought it or not, I do not know, but I think that was not done.  Designation, therefore, would not cover the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would there be any prospect of making retrospective application or of approving retrospectively if an application were made?  Perhaps the Minister would consider it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow up what Deputy Cosgrave has adverted to.  I do not know if what I have to say is relevant at this stage.  I have in mind certain categories of persons who, we feel, ought to be included in this measure.  I dare say the Minister has already taken them into consideration&mdash;to <Col N="1074" /> what extent I do not know. I have particularly in mind certain teachers of Irish under various committees&mdash;cultural committees and vocational committees&mdash;in the early part of this century, who were engaged on work for the Gaelic League and other such national bodies and eventually graduated into vocational committees or some such bodies.</P>
      <P>As an instance of the type of cases we have in mind, there is a man who taught Irish in many parts of the country in the early part of the century as an organiser for the Gaelic League and who cycled throughout the land while engaged on that very noble task of reviving the national language.  He eventually found a place for himself as teacher of Irish in Tyrone and worked there from 1910 to 1911.  He taught Irish and operated as an organiser in Mayo and Galway from 1911 to 1917. He was a teacher of Irish under Offaly Vocational Committee, as a technical instructor, from 1917 to 1920.  He was teacher of Irish under the Kildare Technical Committee from 1920 to 1924 and taught with the Limerick Vocational Education Committee from 1926 to about 1931 and then found a position for himself in the Civil Service. He has now retired.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the great national work which this man performed in the interest of the State and for and on behalf of the State and who was paid very largely out of State funds, would the Minister have particular regard to a claim on his behalf as being a person who could be and should be included for superannuation purposes under this Bill?</P>
      <P>Perhaps, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am taking some liberties in elaborating on a particular case but, if the Minister requires further details in relation to the matter I shall be happy to supply them.</P>

      <P>There were two amendments tabled in my name to this section which have been ruled out of order but I want to raise a particular case with the Minister.  The purpose of the amendments was to cover a particular case.  So far as I am aware, there is only one such case but there may be others.  It is the case of a person who is at present employed in the Houses of the Oireachtas and who has Old IRA service and is the holder of a service medal.  This person was arrested in the pre-Truce period.  He subsequently had service on the staff of Dáil Éireann and also on the staff of the Provisional Government.  Due to some difficulty in compiling the <Col N="1077" /> records during that period, he lacks a particular period for maximum pension purposes.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendments, which were ruled out of order because they involved a charge on public funds, was to ensure that the service he had on the staff of Dáil Éireann and also on the staff of the Provisional Government and the fact that he was unable to take up a particular appointment because of his arrest, would qualify him for pension purposes under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1936.  I am sure it will be possible for the Minister to get details about the person concerned. We have all had experience of his services in the Oireachtas as a member of the Dáil staff.  We have had ample experience of his satisfactory work and service, and his capacity to perform whatever duties were assigned to him in whatever positions he held. I feel, therefore, there is a strong case for sympathetic consideration to ensure that his full service will count for pension purposes.  I should be glad if the Minister would consider this case and ensure that the necessary steps&mdash;either by way of amendment or administrative action&mdash;are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the rule which has operated in these cases has been very just.  Under the 1923 Act&mdash;and it was more or less re-affirmed in the 1936 Act &mdash; the service of any civil servant who worked for Dáil Éireann before the Truce is counted as established service.  If the service was after the Truce, it is unestablished. For service with the Provisional Government, the same rule applies.  Most of those people were established about 1926, and those who had unestablished service did not at that time get any credit but those who had established service were fixed up from the pre-Truce time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel inclined to change that rule.  I do not know where we would make the distinction.  Would it be the time of the Treaty, or the Provisional Government, or 1923, or what time? I think the present rule is perhaps the fairest on the whole.  I think I have an idea of the person Deputy Cosgrave has in mind, but I should like him to send me a note to verify it, because <Col N="1078" /> there were considerable difficulties about that case.  There was difficulty about verification.</P>

      <P>I think the case raised by Deputy Treacy might be to some extent covered by this, but I am not sure that it would be altogether covered.  Some civil servants lost their positions particularly around 1923 and during the Civil War.  Then, again, when the tests came in, in 1931, some civil servants were dismissed and afterwards came back.  This is an attempt to make things right so far as we can.  We are giving them unestablished service from that time until they were established.  Some people were dismissed for political reasons and after some years, came back again.  They will count as established from the time their colleagues were established.  That is the fairest thing we can do.</P>

      <P>I want to raise the case of a person who was appointed a temporary full-time clerk in the office of the Kildare county registrar.  The position was not pensionable.  He was appointed in 1940, and continued in that position until 1950.  He then got an appointment as superintendent assistant officer for Carlow County Council, following an interview with the Local Appointments Commission. He commenced work on 15th May, 1950.  Later in 1950, or early in 1951, persons in temporary employment with the Department of Justice in county registrars' offices&mdash;in similar positions to the position he left&mdash;were appointed full-time civil servants with pension rights, provided they passed a qualifying examination and an oral Irish test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> This person had passed an oral Irish test on the date of his appointment as superintendent assistant officer.  If he had not left his position in the county registrar's office in Naas and taken the new post in Carlow, at a higher salary, it is very likely that he would have qualified in the test, and his earlier service as a temporary full-time officer would have counted for pension purposes.  As it is, he has lost the ten years' service in Naas, and he is now entitled only to his service since his appointment in Carlow.  I could send the Minister a note and perhaps he would have the case investigated.</P>

      <P>The Superannuation Act of 1956 gave an option to the civil servant that he could on retiring sacrifice portion of his pension and provide a pension for an adult dependant if he or she outlived him.  Some civil servants have availed of that and gradually we added to the classes that could avail of it, the Land Commissioners, property arbitrators, employees of the Industrial Development Authority and now we are asked to <Col N="1081" /> include the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There is no reason why he should not be able to avail of it the same as anyone else.  The State does not lose anything on it.  It is an actuarial calculation.  If a person is entitled to a pension of £1,000 a year, if he so wishes he may take only £750 and give £250 to his wife in case he dies before her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows the reason why.  People are given the opportunity under the 1956 Act of saying that they would hypothecate portion of their pension to their widow in the event of their dying.  When such a civil servant reached the age of 65 he got only a fragment of his pension while the other fragment was given to his wife.  Very few of them could afford to allow half the pension to the wife or any portion of the pension to the wife because the pension is at most half pay and if they divided the pension between themselves and the wife it was really down to quarter pay.  That is what they had to exist on and it is because civil servants know that a quarter rate of pension could not keep two people that very few of them availed of the provisions of the Act. It was to that fact I was adverting when this matter was discussed on the Second Stage and I do think there is something to be said for revising the whole superannuation code to provide that when the civil servant dies his widow will not be left with compensation which amounts to no more than one year's salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of civil servants who have served the State for 40 years.  If they die in their last week of service or in their first month of pension, the most the widow gets is roughly a year's salary.  That is the only recognition the State gives in respect of the long and, perhaps, very meritorious service of her late husband.  Something <Col N="1082" /> should be done to ensure that the widow will get some kind of pension after her husband dies or at least will get a pension for some period after her husband's death.  Some of the private companies already do that for their employees.  I have an idea that some of these semi-State companies do it as well but at all events the tendency is in that direction, namely, to try to sustain the widow after the breadwinner has died.  That is particularly necessary where the widow is without children to help to maintain her.  The Minister should undertake to consider this on a more liberal basis with the staff side of the conciliation council in the hope that it will be possible to get agreement enabling such a pension to be provided without imposing any heavy burdens on anybody.  Does the Minister hold out any hope that he will at least discuss it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised on the Post Office Estimate the delay which takes place between the date the officer retires and the date on which he gets his pension.  He is paid weekly but nobody who retires gets a pension the following week or the week after that. When a person is approaching the age of 65&mdash;and the Post Office have records which indicate to them when he will reach 65&mdash;there is no reason in the world why that person's pension should not be paid the week after he retires because that is a substitute for pay.  All the calculations are made by the Post Office Department.  They are sent to the Department of Finance for checking.  The Department of Finance has not an inexhaustible staff and one can understand that the staff would not be able to devote the instantaneous attention that is necessary in this case but I do suggest to the Minister that he should tell the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or any other large Department, but certainly a Department like the Post Office, that it should calculate the pensions of people whose retirement is already well signalled to them in advance so as to ensure that these people will be paid promptly. There may be an error but that can be ironed out later.  The main thing is to ensure that every man who retires will be paid his pension promptly.</P>

      <P>There are three amendments which deal with the Industrial Development Authority.  In amendment No. 28, we are putting in &ldquo;pensionable service&rdquo; because if it were not put in, it might be ruled that service after 65 was pensionable.  That is a technical drafting amendment.  In the second amendment, we want to get a legal definition of &ldquo;whole-time&rdquo;.  The members of the Industrial Development Authority are whole-time in the ordinary sense but, naturally, they have to be members of other boards because of their position and this is to ensure that acting on boards other than that would not deprive them of their pensions.  The third amendment deals with the point that the Chairman of the Industrial Credit Company is also a member of the Industrial Development Authority. Therefore, this will apply only to the chairman of the Industrial Credit Company in this category of pensions.</P>

Amendment No. 1 repeals the power to prescribe the form of direction to voters as to the mode in which they are to vote.  It is consequential on amendment No. 31 which removes the requirement on a returning officer to publish the notice giving directions to the electors as to the mode in which they are to vote.  The requirement is being removed because, under amendment No. 34, the directions as to how to vote will go on the ballot paper.

      <P>These amendments arise directly from our discussions and more or less agreement on the Committee Stage at which point, in regard to these amendments, I said I would consider extending the time for the withdrawal of nominations.  These amendments achieve the purpose and make some changes which are a necessary follow-on.  For the purpose of the record, I might give the various amendments now being considered in the order in which I feel they affect the issue.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 extends the time for the withdrawal of nominations up to 12 noon on the day after the last day for receiving nominations.  That, I think, is what we had hoped to achieve in order that there would be sufficient time for withdrawals if, for any reason, somebody was nominated who had not legitimately agreed to go forward, or for any other reasons.  It will be 24 hours for withdrawals rather than the proposal in the Bill where only three hours were being provided for.</P>
      <P>This period of 24 hours will have to be deducted from the statutory periods for nominations and polling in order to ensure that Article 16 (3) (2) of the Constitution is observed.  The Article provides that a general election for members of Dáil Éireann shall take place not later than 30 days after a dissolution.  At present, nominations must close on the 9th day after the dissolution and polling must take place between the 7th and 17th day after the close of nominations ; in other words, a total of 26 days after dissolution, excluding Sundays and holidays.  To keep within the same over-all limits, it is proposed in amendments Nos. 7 and 8 to reduce the period in which polling must take place to the period between the 8th and 17th day after the close of nominations rather than the 7th and 17th day, as is the practice as present. All this, again, is to facilitate the 24-hour time for withdrawals as against the shorter period we have known in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is consequential. <Col N="1090" /> Amendment No. 3 is consequential on what I have already said on amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 5.  The period of 72 hours, which amendment No. 16 proposes to insert instead of the period of 48 hours, will preserve, again, the <i>status quo</i>, notwithstanding the provisions of amendment No. 5 of 24 hours for withdrawals.  It really is to make provision for a period of 24 hours for withdrawals.  By and large, all these related amendments are merely conforming to that idea&mdash; extending or de-limiting times in order to take in the general pattern dictated for us by the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I have a query to make in relation to the wording of the amendment.  I assume it is intended that a person should not be appointed as a presiding officer who has played an active part in a political campaign. He may, in fact, have played an active part in a neighbouring constituency and not be associated with the campaign of a candidate in the constituency concerned.  Surely it is not desirable that he should, if that is the fact? Is it a candidate or any candidate? Is that related merely to the constituency to which he can be elected or is it any candidate standing in the election?</P>

      <P>In page 22, to delete lines 46 to 50 and substitute the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The returning officer shall, on request, permit a person in respect <Col N="1092" /> of whom he is satisfied that that person has a <i>bona fide</i> interest in the election as either a candidate or a prospective candidate, or the agent of such a person, to inspect the list of persons to whom he has offered or proposes to offer appointments as presiding officers or poll clerks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With this amendment, we might also discuss amendments Nos. 19 and 24. Under Section 25 of the Bill as it stands, the returning officer is entitled to permit a candidate or his agent to inspect the lists of persons to whom he has offered or proposes to offer appointments as presiding officers, the request to inspect the list, to be made not later than 5 p.m. on the fourth day next preceding polling day.  Amendment No. 10 will remove the time limit and permit the inspection at any time by persons having a <i>bona fide</i> interest in the election and will permit inspection of the list of prospective poll clerks as well as presiding officers.  Amendments 19 and 24 make the corresponding changes in respect of Presidential elections and referenda.  These amendments are consequent on my undertaking to look into the matter on being prompted to do so by some members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the intention of the amendment the Minister has moved.  The question of inspecting the list of proposed appointments was discussed but in the amendment now proposed in substitution for the section as it stood, no time limit is mentioned.  If I am a candidate and if I object on the day before the election to the list as it affects my constituency, how is the returning officer to ensure that at some distant polling stations in the constituency the required presiding officer and four clerks can be found? Ordinarily, we know that the existing practice is for the returning officer to have a list of the people doing duty over the years and where they have been satisfactory they are never interfered with but if, at this stage on the day before the poll, however desirable it might be that I should object to a presiding officer or poll clerk, has the Minister considered what opportunity the returning officer would have of <Col N="1093" /> finding a substitute by the following morning?  By this time the ballot boxes will be distributed.  They will have left the centre where the returning officer ordinarily has his office and will have gone out to be delivered to those who are to take charge of the ballot papers.  In these circumstances how does the Minister suggest returning officers could properly fulfil their duties in regard to the conduct of the poll?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What prompted the amendment was the objection by members of the Opposition to this provision of the Bill that the list could be inspected only up to four days before the date of the poll.  Having examined that suggestion, I came to the conclusion that such a limitation might be impracticable since, while you would have the right to inspect the lists it did not necessarily follow that the lists would be complete and an inspection carried out then might mean little or nothing as the lists might be added to afterwards. If this amendment is accepted, it will mean that the candidates or agents or others with a <i>bona fide</i> interest in the election will be entitled to inspect the list almost up to the time of the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good point to ask how, if there is an objection at this late hour when the boxes have been sent to the presiding officers, the returning officer can get out of his difficulty.  The very wise procedure adopted for a long time under existing law is for returning officers to have a small corps of standbys. To my own knowledge, members of the county council staff in my own county may be sent out if there is an objection or if somebody becomes ill.  Another consideration is that, while giving the facility to the candidates and other interested parties to inspect lists and to ensure that they are available for inspection close up to the day of election, it does not follow that the lists may only be inspected at the last hour.  I envisage the returning officer and the candidates and agents co-operating with each other to their mutual benefit and having some arrangement so that when the list is ready, if possible a few days before <Col N="1094" /> the event, the various people will inspect it.  It is up to themselves to arrange.  They might even have copies supplied to them.  This will be a cooperative effort.</P>
    <P>I am trying to safeguard the interests of candidates, their agents and others generally interested in the election to ensure that we will not make the law in such a way that an inspection of the lists would be abortive.  I now hold that would be the case if we insisted that the lists could be inspected only up to four days before the election because, in many cases, the lists would not be complete.  We shall, therefore, leave it to the last hour and no doubt the same sensible arrangements will be made by returning officers with candidates and agents in every constituency in regard to inspection of the lists and no doubt these arrangements will work just as smoothly as in the past.  I think there is no need for any fear of a difficulty arising on the lines suggested by Deputy Jones, although he rightly raised the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very desirable to have the opportunity to inspect the lists.  I can see the force of the point the Minister makes about the lists not being complete as there is often difficulty in obtaining a suitable person to do this work.  In my own constituency, I have seen the returning officer, even a couple of days before an election, having to go out looking for people and having to contact the local Guards in regard to it.

    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were discussing this matter previously, I referred to the Joint <Col N="1097" /> Committee set up to consider all matters relating to the electoral law.  It is as a result of their deliberations that this Bill is now before the House.  This Committee had before them the Minister's proposals in regard to legislation. Those proposals embodied the Minister's thinking and the advice he had from his officials.  Those proposals were considered at length by the Committee. At page 131 of their final report the question of oaths at elections is referred to.  The note in regard to the proposal sets out that it is a re-enactment of the various provisions in the original law.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage, I pointed out that the principal objective of this form of oath was not to deter any individual from recording his vote but to prevent the despicable crime of personation. We should make every effort to prevent an individual coming into a polling booth to take the vote of another.  The effect of increased fines depends on somebody being able to prove that a person was guilty of personation. We provided in our system of electoral law the right of a personating agent to be present at a polling station.  The most important function&mdash;in fact, the only function&mdash;of a personating agent is to ensure that the law is kept and that nobody can take another person's vote by personation.</P>
    <P>The law now proposed would still allow the person coming in to cast his vote.  Under this Bill even the tendered ballot is gone.  But the fact remains that one who wants to personate may come into a polling station and attempt to personate.  His penalty would depend on somebody being able to prove this.  We should regard it as more desirable to attempt to prevent a crime being committed than to punish the wrongdoer.  There is the deterrent of somebody being challenged and having to affirm.  This does not mean he would necessarily have to take an oath if he had a valid objection.  If it offended his conscience, he could solemnly affirm these things.  We believe that is the greatest safeguard the electoral law has.</P>
    <P>This does not happen very often in rural areas for the simple reason that <Col N="1098" /> very few people can come into a polling station there without being known to all the people there.  Certainly there will be more than one person who can recognise him.  In rural areas, challenging does not occur as frequently as it did in the past.  But the fact that there were occasions when this challenge had to be given&mdash;in fact, there were cases where personation was proved&mdash;is sufficient proof of the value the challenge has had in the legislation up to this.  I would submit that when the proposals originally came before the Committee and when they deliberated on this matter they felt that the retention of this type of question and oath in our electoral law was desirable and did not reflect in any way on any individual.  I believe there are very few people entitled to vote in the ordinary way who would take such offence or would be so frightened that they would not vote.  I do know there have been cases where people challenged in polling stations were not prepared to vote because, to the knowledge of people in the station, they were not entitled to the vote they were claiming.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason we seek to have kept this safeguard which has been in the law all along.  It is something not to be used lightly, and we would hope it would not have to be used widely. This is a necessary corrective measure which would do the job it is designed to do.  I do not believe the raising of the penalty would be sufficient.  If a person were brought to court, it certainly would be a salutary lesson at that stage.  But we do not want to have people taught salutary lessons after they have broken the law.  We should have something solemn to prevent people doing what is manifestly wrong so that they would on reflection refrain from committing this type of crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that in the suggestions provided by me for consideration by the Committee who went into this whole matter, it was not proposed to alter the law in regard to the administering of oaths to voters offering themselves at the polling stations and asking for ballot papers.  However, I want it to be quite clear that that has <Col N="1099" /> no bearing on the argument&mdash;that though my proposals to the Committee, if I could call them proposals, did not include any departure from existing law, this did not necessarily mean I was committed to adhering to the Committee's proposals to leave the law as it has been in this respect.  My proposals to the Committee were put up as a sort of agenda to help the Committee to do their work more expeditiously and more effectively on matters requiring their consideration.</P>
      <P>I am not using that as an argument as to why we should or should not accept the amendment put forward by Deputy Jones.  I should like to say again that the proposal in this legislation to eliminate the oath for the ordinary voter at an election was designed to cut out as far as possible various formalities which have been traditionally enshrined, as it were, in our electoral code, perhaps not in any great hope of assisting in the proper carrying out of elections.  The first person we must have regard to here is the voter attending a polling booth whose name appears legitimately in the register, who is entitled by law to be given a ballot paper.  I do not think such a person should be impeded by anything such as the threat to take an oath in doing what he is legitimately entitled to do.  No such impediment should be put in his way unless it is absolutely vital to the proper conduct of the election.</P>
      <P>In circumstances such as those we are discussing, such a situation is likely to arise.  Through the amendment here, we are in fact inhibiting people from voting by the mere threat of having to take an oath.  I believe there is such a danger of inhibition, that it has manifested itself in the past, particularly in country areas where people have passed the word to others that if they went to cast their votes, they would be asked to take an oath. Because of that, people have been inhibited from exercising the franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are proposing the reintroduction of that oath, that inhibition, as it were, and I am afraid it would operate against the hundreds of thousands who are entitled to their vote and who might be prevented from <Col N="1100" /> casting that vote.  The suggestion here is that the reintroduction of this provision would prevent certain other people from coming along to personate. The number coming along to personate in proportion to the total is not great.  We are thankful that is so.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the reintroduction of the oath is not a very effective barrier to personation.  It does not effectively prevent it.  In all the circumstances, I do not think it is right we should insist on having oaths or the threat of oaths being administered in cases of ordinary law-abiding voters. The game is not worth the candle in proportion to the amount of good the retention of the oath might do as a deterrent to those who might be tempted to personate.  Personation will be very effectively discouraged by the presence in polling stations of personation agents who can, under this Bill, request the arrest of any person who they have reasonable grounds for believing is a personator.  The real further protection is in the new and heavier penalties proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that is a better way to approach this matter than through the amendment.  It is on those grounds, after a lot of consideration, that I have come to this point of view.  I am, however, open to persuasion by, as it were, the voice of the greater numbers, the wide experience of every member of the House in so far as the running of elections is concerned.  Many of them were fighting elections before I knew what the word meant.  If the proposers of the amendment insist this is the right thing to do, and since the Committee who considered this Bill did not propose any change in the existing system, I should be inclined to say to the House that I would by agreement, rather than forcing any issues by a division, be prepared to concede that the oath be retained, but let us have oaths for everybody or not have them in the Bill at all.</P>

      <P>I would strongly urge that the Bill be amended along those lines.  I agree with the Minister it is desirable that, in regard to all the Bill's provisions, we should strive to get substantial agreement among us. I want to say in regard to the administering of an oath that I fully agree it is a grave obligation, but I do not think that there is in the context of our civil life any occasion more important, and I do not exclude proceedings in the High Court or any court of competent jurisdiction in this country, than the occasion of recording one's vote. I think the more solemnity with which we can surround that, the better it is for the community as a whole.  I, in my public life, have had experience from time to time of people approaching me for sanction to resist the law and I have been in the position consistently to say nobody in this country, no matter how grievously he feels himself aggrieved by the legislation of Oireachtas Éireann, is entitled to defy it so long as we have the free institutions we enjoy, which give to every citizen the right to demonstrate peaceably for his convictions and to record his vote at elections, thereby, if needs be, changing a Government which he believes to be either capricious or unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any tendency which operates to create the impression in the public mind that the due process of election to Oireachtas Éireann is qualified by any corrupt practice, against which every conceivable precaution is not taken, is a very dangerous thing.  I do not think it is in any way unreasonable, if a person goes in to record his vote, that he should be asked to swear by Almighty God, if he has no conscientious scruple about taking an oath, that he is the person he holds himself <Col N="1102" /> out to be and is entitled to cast the vote he seeks to record.  It is, I think, wholly fitting that with so solemn a procedure, any rational citizen should, on request, be prepared to associate the solemnity of an oath with it.  There is provision for individuals who have a conscientious scruple about taking an oath; they can affirm if they declare their conscientious scruple.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation whatever in saying that the presence of the power to require a person to swear, if challenged, before he records his vote, has operated powerfully, in my experience of ten general elections here, to control personation.  It does not, of course, operate to prevent it absolutely.  Personation goes on and, as long as elections are elections, I suppose there will be some personation, but the oath does operate effectively to prevent personation growing into a real and grave abuse.  It is all very well to say that you will substitute for this device a power to requisition the arrest of a would-be personater.  There is a world of difference between a neighbour, and I emphasise neighbour, calling on the returning officer to ask a voter to swear as to his identity and a neighbour calling on a member of the Garda Siochána to arrest a person beside whom he has to live for the rest of his life.</P>
    <P>In my considered opinion, in more than 70 per cent of cases, if a personation agent in a polling booth in rural Ireland had only one means of preventing personation, and that was to precipitate the arrest of the individual attempting it, that sanction would not be invoked.  Mark you, if I were asked confidentially should I ask the Garda to arrest my neighbour's son sent in by some experienced operator to attempt this offence, I should find it very difficult, with my knowledge of rural society, to say: &ldquo;Yes, you should&rdquo;, thereby precipitating what those of us who understand country life appreciate might be a family feud that would continue for four, five or six generations.  I do not think I need elaborate on that either to the Minister for Local Government or the Acting Chairman, at the moment.  Can you picture in the Rosses, if a neighbour's son is sent in by an old campaigner <Col N="1103" /> to personate, and his next-door neighbour or a personation agent calls the Garda and says: &ldquo;Arrest him&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that right alone is no protection, because, feeling as strongly as I do in these matters, I should be slow in the Rosses, or Ballaghaderreen, or Ballybeg or, more particularly, in Kilmovee, which are rural districts in my home county, to precipitate the arrest of a neighbour's child because I know what that would mean for years and generations to come.  But if the neighbour's son comes in and the agent says: &ldquo;Swear that fellow&rdquo;, in 999 cases out of 1,000, you will not see him for the dust of the road.  There are very few who will come into a polling booth and commit perjury in order to personate.  If such a person is challenged, he will say he has a conscientious scruple, take out the door, and be away down the road as fast as his legs will carry him; and everybody will say: &ldquo;It will be a while before Pat will come in to personate again&rdquo;, and later the Garda may warn him: &ldquo;If you do that again, you may find yourself below in Sligo Jail, you divil, you.&rdquo; There is no harm done.  No feud starts.  Both parties know it was a fair try on and a fair cop.  That will be the reaction.  But call in a Garda to arrest your neighbour's child and you have done something which I, in my judgment, would find it extremely difficult to recommend to a friend of mine in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people might say: &ldquo;If you are so sensitive about people's feelings, why do you not drop all these tests and simply leave it to the presiding officer?&rdquo; The answer is simple; I am confident that if you do that, personation would grow rapidly to a point where it would undermine the confidence of our people in the whole <Col N="1104" /> process of parliamentary election.  I am profoundly convinced that there is no greater guarantee against the growth of such an evil than the power of the returning officer to administer the oath on the application of a personation agent.  There will be some who will say: &ldquo;You ought not to put people in this danger of committing perjury.&rdquo; I do not believe that is any real danger at all.  Looking back over my experience of elections &mdash; my colleagues will, I think, confirm me in what I am saying&mdash;I do not remember a single case of an individual who came in and falsely swore that he was somebody he, in fact, was not.  I have known hundreds of cases where boys and girls have come in&mdash;some of them, if they were hanging since they became boys and girls, would be hanging a long time&mdash;seeking to commit personation but who on being challenged with the oath, backed out and went away.</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy who ever remembers a case of an individual perjuring his soul and swearing that he was somebody he was not?  I know of none and I think I have as much experience of elections as any Deputy and of elections of the stormiest possible kind.</P>
    <P>Therefore, for these reasons, I would urge most strenuously on the Minister to restore to the statute the provision for the administration of an oath.  If he thinks it should go back in respect of all the categories to which he has referred, I accept that but I am certain that for the protection of the institution, this is fundamental and vital.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I rejoice that we have been able to arrive at substantial agreement upon <Col N="1105" /> all vital matters in respect of this Bill and though I am not in the habit of congratulating any Fianna Fáil Minister, least of all the Minister for Local Government, I am bound to say that I think his approach to this Bill has been very prudent and that the Bill will be all the better Bill in so far as in respect of each matter substantial agreement has been arrived at.  I do not deny that it is often very much more difficult for a Minister to secure that by saying: &ldquo;Very well; I am prepared to concede my suggestion in favour of one that is urged on me by everybody else&rdquo;.  In so far as credit is due for that, reluctantly, I am constrained to concede it to the Minister for Local Government and in so far as the Bill proceeds to enactment by that procedure, with profound misgiving, I offer congratulations.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not in for most of this debate but I gathered from the Minister's concluding remarks that he would prefer to do something like this by agreement of the House, without forcing it on the House.  Without any song and dance, I agree entirely with what Deputy Dillon has said.  I assume that what is in the mind of the Minister is that the oath would give an opportunity to one inclined to personate to retract rather than be arrested.  Therefore, the three of us are at one that the oath ought to be retained as a safeguard.</P>

      <P>I agree, but the case Deputy Dillon is making, and with which I agree, is that rather than have him arrested on the say of a personation agent, it would be better to confront him with this oath and ask him to swear that he is so and so, so that he will have an opportunity of retracting. As Deputy Dillon says, in 999 cases <Col N="1106" /> out of 1,000 he will disappear before taking a false oath.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I should like to emphasise.  The inclusion of the oath was a greater deterrent to personation than the term of imprisonment or fine.  The oath is a real deterrent, when we have no other method of preventing personation. In many countries, there is an identity card which must be marked. We have not such an identity card in use here and under our system the oath is a great deterrent.</P>
      <P>On the question of providing for arrest, in my view, it would be fatal, for two reasons.  It would create bad feeling.  The administration of the oath would not create such bad feeling. If a personating agent did, <i>bona fide</i>, challenge a voter for personation and the allegation was without foundation, there would be a cause of action against the agent.  That would deter the agent from asking that a voter whom he suspected of personating should be arrested.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) (a) A polling card shall contain (as in the case of a Constitutional referendum) a statement, prepared and approved of by a Board consisting of a Judge of the High Court (to be nominated by the President of the High Court) who shall be Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of Dáil Éireann (or where he is unable, through illness, absence or other cause to fulfil his duties, the Deputy Chairman of Dáil Éireann) and the Chairman of Seanad Éireann (or, where he is unable through illness, absence or other cause to fulfil his duties the Deputy Chairman of Seanad Éireann).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) In the case of an ordinary referendum the polling card shall contain a statement of the proposal <Col N="1111" /> which is the subject of the referendum prepared by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Chairman of Dáil Éireann and the Chairman of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>( ) The statement to appear on a polling card for a Constitutional referendum or for an ordinary referendum shall be furnished to the Minister (a) in the case of a Constitutional referendum within three days after the Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution has been passed or is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and (b) in the case of an ordinary referendum within three days of the date upon which the President informs the Taoiseach and the Chairman of each House of the Oireachtas in writing under his hand and seal that he has decided that the Bill contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When this matter was under review on a previous occasion, there were long discussions on the difficulties which could arise with regard to referenda.  Reference was made in recent times to the debates which took place in this House on a matter which was being submitted to the electorate. To ensure that the proper proposal will fully appear before the people, and that they will understand what is being done, we propose in this amendment that the polling card which will be sent to the voter shall contain a statement of the subject matter of the referendum.  The fact that the a statement will be prepared by such a board as we have outlined in the amendment will ensure that so far as the people and the House are concerned, it will reflect the intent of the referendum.</P>
    <P>The fact that the board will consist of a chairman who as a judge of the High Court will have the necessary legal knowledge and the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann &mdash; or the <Col N="1112" /> Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in his absence &mdash;and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad &mdash;or the Leas-Chathaoirleach, in his absence&mdash;will ensure that what was in the minds of the members of the Oireachtas who debated the matter which was to be submitted to the electorate for decision is contained in the statement.  If the electors had such a voting card in their hands prior to the actual date on which the referendum is to take place, they would have an opportunity of studying the matter, and would be able to go to the polling station fully conversant with the matter on which they were about to vote.</P>
    <P>This is a very important matter, and I think that on the last occasion the Minister agreed that very important issues could be raised, and that it was a matter of some consequence that there should be a determination of the subject matter of the referendum. This amendment which we suggest to the House, we believe, would give to the electorate a proper understanding of the subject matter on which they were expected to express an opinion. There is no necessity for me to elaborate any further.  I think past history in regard to referenda, the difficulties which can arise and the type of discussions which took place on a previous occasion, led to a certain amount of confusion in regard to the matter being submitted to the electorate.</P>
    <P>If the polling card contains a statement prepared by a board such as we mention in the amendment, there can be no doubt that the constitutional matter would be in order so far as the legal end was concerned, and so far as the intent of the Oireachtas was concerned. The fact that the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann and the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann would be associated with the drafting of the subject matter would be sufficient guarantee that the intent of the Oireachtas would be conveyed to the electorate in a proper fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before and during the Committee Stage, I proposed that certain additional provisions might be made in regard to the polling card, <Col N="1113" /> containing an outline or an interpretation of what the referendum was to be about.  Following further consideration, and after hearing the views of members of the House, and particularly the very definite views of the Leader of the Opposition, I dropped the amendment I had proposed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>At this stage, I am still convinced the dropping of the official amendment was the right thing to do and that the reasons which compelled me to drop that amendment are as compelling now to prompt me to ask the proposers of this amendment to drop it also and to leave the situation as it is, that is, that the polling cards would issue and that on those polling cards there would be no attempt by anyone, no matter who he might be, to interpret what the forthcoming referendum would be or what the decision was that had to be taken, that the polling cards would merely be an indication to the various registered voters that they had a vote and indicate the place at which they might cast that vote.</P>
      <P>My advice on this matter of making an interpretation of what a referendum is about to put on a polling card is that it is not likely to be an interpretation that would be agreed or acceptable to all concerned with the referendum. Neither is it likely to be something we should ask any person to do for the very good reason that there is no guarantee that any person or group of persons would be able to give a fair interpretation.</P>
      <P>I would suggest, therefore, that the proposers of this amendment should look at it again and I am sure they will agree that any amendment of the provision would worsen the position rather than improve it.  It was for that reason that I withdrew my own official amendment and for the same reason I would ask that this amendment also be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Section 14 is designed to ensure that any employees of the company, that is, Ostlanna Iompair Éireann, which runs the CIE hotels and catering services, who may become redundant before 31st March, 1964, will be paid appropriate compensation by the company.  The emphasis is on the company.  In the case of the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958 and the Transport Act, 1958 where redundancy was involved, the compensation was payable by the Board of CIE.  Therefore, it seemed to us to be appropriate to apply the compensation provisions of the 1950 Transport Act, Sections 41, 42 and 43, to compensation payable under either of the 1958 Acts to which I have referred, as the Board is mentioned in those sections.  Under Section 14, compensation is payable <Col N="1126" /> not by the Board of CIE but by the company.  Therefore, if it is desired to apply the machinery in Sections 41, 42 and 43 of the 1950 Transport Act to compensation under Section 14 of this Bill, it seems necessary to adopt those sections of the 1950 Act by substituting the company for the Board in these sections.  That is the purpose of the amendment and it is felt that it is very necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the same thing.  The Deputy is referring to something different.  The Deputy was afraid for the dependants of members who, under Section 15, on being transferred, will qualify for the pension scheme of CIE.  They may retain such entitlement. Obviously, the Deputies had in mind the case where the member died on the transfer from CIE, which would necessitate amending superannuation under paragraph (d), Section 15.  I can assure the Deputy that it is possible to back-date the amending scheme, if it is necessary to provide for such cases, and the dependants of anyone who dies within this particular period would <Col N="1127" /> not be placed at a disadvantage as a result of the changeover.  In my view, it is not necessary to have this amendment.</P>

      <P>Suppose a case of this character arose and we ask a Parliamentary question of the Minister as to why the benefits accruing to Patrick Smith, who died in the critical period, would not go to his dependants as a result of his having died in the period. I think the Minister would reply to me that that is a matter for CIE in which he could not afford to intervene.  If it be true that Deputy Treacy's amendment, in fact, crystallises the Minister's intention, would it not be safer to put it in?  Otherwise, we may be in the embarrassing position that if such a situation arises we are precluded by the terms of the 1956 Act from intervening on the ground that we have passed over all these matters to the Board of CIE.  If the Minister says to me: &ldquo;I have the right, duty and obligation to provide against this contingency and I guarantee it will not be allowed to arise&rdquo;, then I am quite content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to approve of any amending scheme submitted by CIE.  An amending scheme will have to be submitted under the Act and in order that the Revenue Commissioners can make their arrangements for the rebate of the income tax on the contribution. In that way I can ensure that this matter will be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree on what we want to provide against and that is that, by the death of a beneficiary under the scheme at a critical time, his <Col N="1128" /> dependants would be deprived of the benefit they would otherwise enjoy.  If the Minister says to me: &ldquo;The terms of the Act impose a duty on the Minister for Transport and Power to look to that matter himself&rdquo;, I am quite content because then if any of us have a grievance in respect of any individual employee we have the right to raise it here.</P>
      <P>However, if the Minister says to me: &ldquo;After the scheme has been approved by the Minister for Transport and Power its administration is a matter for the Board of CIE&rdquo;, then I want to say this to him.  Under the 1956 Transport Act&mdash;is it not?&mdash;we are precluded from raising any specific case which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of CIE.  With reference to the addition to the terms of this Act the protection that we apprehend might be necessary in the case of the dependants of an individual who died at the critical time, if the Minister says, &ldquo;No, my general obligation to approve a scheme invests me with the right and duty to protect any individual and his dependants&rdquo;, I am quite content that we can raise the matter in the Dáil.  However, if, on reflection, the Minister says to me: &ldquo;Once I have approved the scheme I have no further function&rdquo;, then I would ask him to consider accepting Deputy Treacy's amendment because that clearly places the statutory obligation on CIE to do a certain thing and if they fail to do it we can raise it here.  I take it the Minister follows my point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point but I have to approve of the scheme.  I shall insist that any scheme put forward to me will include this provision of a carry-over period between the transfer of the employees and the operation of the scheme.  I shall ask that the arrangement be inserted, if it is not inserted by CIE. Once inserted, it is perfectly clear.  If Deputies feel they would like to have these amendments accepted, they can be accepted but I do not think they will serve any purpose.  If Deputies feel they would like it made doubly clear, I am prepared to accept these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would welcome that.  We are primarily concerned in this instance with safeguarding the rights of dependants of CIE employees under this scheme.  The purpose is to ensure that in the transfer from employment with CIE to employment by this new company the employee will continue to enjoy the same superannuation rights as he at present enjoys under the scheme operated by CIE.</P>
      <P>Superannuation schemes make provision for widows and orphans and other dependants of employees.  The rights which widows and orphans, and so on, have under these schemes are rights through the employees concerned. The purpose of this amendment is to make quite certain that persons other than contributors to the scheme, that is, the employees, will have all such rights against the company as they have at present or would have against CIE.</P>
      <P>While the existing schemes themselves probably are sufficient to ensure that the rights of persons other than contributors are continued, it is desirable to put beyond all doubt that the widows of contributors will have their rights continued under this present superannuation scheme.  That is why we welcome the Minister's suggestion that he will accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 9, lines 6 to 9, to delete <Col N="1130" /> paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) and to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  either before or after such vesting, and</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) either before the passing of this Act (including a time before the passing of the Act of 1950) or after such passing,</P>
    <P>and (in the case of services of trains which have not been operated since before the date of the passing of the Act of 1958) whether or not orders referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of the said section 21 have been made in respect of the services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 18, itself, provides for the extension of Section 21 which relates to the making by CIE of abandonment orders relating, under the Transport Act, 1950, to any railway line on which all services of trains have been terminated at any time.  The abandonment legislation did not apply to lines on which train services were terminated prior to the transfer of the line, that is, lines operated by the GNR prior to its being taken over by CIE.  It was an omission.  This is being provided for in Section 18 (1). We have added an amendment which will enable CIE to cover such cases as the Broadstone-Liffey Junction branch line.</P>
    <P>The train services to and from the Broadstone were transferred to Westland Row about 25 years ago by the Board's predecessors.  When CIE was established in 1950 it took over the Broadstone line but the Board was not in a position to obtain an order formally terminating train services as the relevant statutory provision does not apply to CIE.  Therefore, this amendment simply adds to the general section the provision that CIE can abandon lines such as the Broadstone-Liffey Junction branch line, which does not alter the principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not completely understand the section but I want to draw the Minister's attention to the situation that exists in regard to 85 people at present employed by Dundalk Engineering Works.  I want to know whether these people are covered and whether it is intended to provide for them, if they are dispensed with before the end of the year.  They know their positions are in jeopardy and that possibly their jobs will be lost before the end of the year because of the movement of railway work, the maintenance and repair of wagons and locomotives from Dundalk to other CIE depots.  Is it intended to prolong the period during which severance pay can be provided for these people?  Is this a change of policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not apply to the employees of Dundalk Engineering Works.  The position is that ex-GNR employees will be exactly the same as employees of CIE in regard to compensation.  There was a defect in the previous legislation and we are now arranging that any ex-GNR employee who becomes redundant as a result of a reorganisation scheme for a department of CIE which is the subject of an order made by me for redundancy compensation, will be entitled to redundancy compensation. It is merely correcting the defect in the previous legislation.  None of the employees awarded redundancy compensation to date is in a worsened position but it is possible that some staff who may become redundant shortly would not be able to obtain compensation because of the defect in the previous Act.  This places them on exactly the same basis as employees of CIE in regard to all redundancy provisions.</P>

      <P>I am drawing the Minister's attention to the fact that this merely changes the company, Dundalk Engineering Works Limited, to the more proper definition of the holding company, which holds all the shares in it, the Industrial Engineering Company Limited.  Going back to the Second Schedule of the Transport Act of 1958 which is, in fact, amended by this section of the Bill we are discussing, one finds that the Minister in 1958&mdash; and he is continuing to do so now&mdash; reduced the amount of compensation payable or the amount of superannuation payable to persons who transfer <Col N="1135" /> to the very company about which I have recently complained inasmuch as there are employees who are now, because of transport policy, being disemployed and being deprived of severance pay or compensation, while at the same time under the Second Schedule of the Transport Act of 1958&mdash;and as continues to be the case now&mdash;the amount of compensation is reduced if they get a job in this company which the Minister says is not his responsibility but the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is like a conjurer with an egg.  You do not know which hand it is in.  It is always in the wrong hand.</P>

      <P>He is not a very good conjurer.  We found him out.  He tells us it is not his responsibility to look after these 85 men.  Nine of them are disemployed and the remainder of them will be disemployed by the end of the year because of the removal of railway work from the Dundalk Engineering Works.  We are told by the Minister that it is the job of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to look after them.  Yet the Minister for Transport and Power in this and previous transport legislation is prepared to reduce their superannuation because they have got employment in a company in which the Minister for Finance holds the majority of the shares.  They lose, no matter what way they go.  They will not get severance pay or compensation, but if they are entitled to superannuation, the amount is reduced.</P>

Paragraph 5 of the Second Schedule of the Transport Act, 1958, says if a person in receipt of a annual sum holds any office or employment remunerated by the Oireachtas or is employed by a local authority or a company in which the Minister for Finance holds the majority of shares and so on, the <Col N="1136" /> amount of the annual superannuation will be reduced by the amount of such excess for the duration thereof.</P>

      <P>This refers only to the abatement of compensation for certain subsidiaries of the Dundalk Engineering Works.  Employees of CIE and the GNR who are in receipt of compensation, if they join a subsidiary of the Dundalk Engineering Works, will have their compensation reduced in the same way as persons joining State companies and boards have their compensation reduced.  It is simply placing them in the same position.  It has no bearing on what the Deputy is referring to.</P>

      <P>I must disagree with the Minister.  I shall put it in plain words.  If one of these 85 men transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Works is now disemployed, he goes out the gate and that is the end, as far as compensation is concerned.  He may get superannuation, but if he had been transferred to CIE, he would be in an altogether different position.  He would be entitled to compensation if a line were closed down.  Deliberate transport policy is closing down the works repairing and maintaining railway wagons.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion, I raised a question in relation to chartered planes coming in and going out of Dublin Airport during certain times and the Minister was good <Col N="1138" /> enough to send me a note afterwards in relation to his inquiries.  With the assistance of that note, I was able to go back to the firm that had discussed the matter with me.  I have ascertained, as sometimes happens, I was told only half the story.  It is a fact that charter planes cannot leave Collinstown during the period I mentioned, but that is not because of Collinstown restriction but because of restriction at the airport at which they would land.  Consequently, they cannot come here during that period because the charter party would be liable to a heavy demurrage in relation to the length of time the plane was kept here after it had been duly loaded.</P>
      <P>The position is most unsatisfactory in relation to our firms who want to export, particularly to Paris, and I would urge the Minister very strongly to take the matter up with the French authorities.  It is not a question, as I thought on the last occasion, of being dealt with at Collinstown.  It could not be dealt with there.  It is a question of ensuring that there will be facilities for charter planes carrying cargo to land at Orly at a time that would leave it convenient for them to come here, load and get away again.  The present situation is that the time at which they can land at Orly is so inconvenient that they could not come here, load and take off again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase in this section &ldquo;any person&rdquo; could mean any professional troublemaker.  Whether this individual was affected by a proposal relating to a right of way or not, he could make trouble for neighbours. The amendment would limit it to the landlord or to any person claiming to have a right of way, for instance, a person who would normally use it.  It is apparent that a person who is sometimes described in the country as &ldquo;a man of straw&rdquo; might use the provision to create an element of trouble for an individual, and in this amendment, we seek to rule out people who have no real interest in the matter; we seek to provide that the interest shall be confined to the landowner himself or to persons who claim to have an interest in the right of way.  They would normally be persons who would use the right of way at times during the year and might seek to establish a claim to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Jones has said, it is true that the amendment is <Col N="1140" /> intended to restrict the right of appeal to the circuit court.  This proposed restriction, however, is such that almost any person could come within it.  According to the wording of the amendment, it is necessary for such person to claim he had been affected by the provision or had an interest in the right of way.  Those two terms are so wide that the purpose of the movers of the amendment would be nullified in that it would not really restrict. What we should keep in mind is that the purpose of the appeal which we are discussing here, and the right of appeal, is not to claim a right over land but rather to prevent the establishment of such a claim.</P>
      <P>It would be fortunate if we could delimit and restrict the persons who would have the right of appeal but we did not, in our examination of the matter, find it feasible to restrict and we have not, therefore, proposed any such restriction.  The proposed restriction in this amendment is more apparent than real.  For that reason we see no real purpose in the amendment.  It does not do what Deputy Jones wishes should be done.  We did not find it possible to bring in any sort of worthwhile restriction.  The proposal here does not restrict in any real sense the right of persons to appeal because all they have to do is claim to be concerned or indicate they have an interest.  Anybody can do either of these two things.</P>

      <P>To add the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  (a) A document purporting to be a copy of the development plan or of a part thereof and to be certified by an officer of a planning authority as a correct copy shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the plan or part, and it shall not be necessary to prove the signature of such officer or that he was in fact such officer.</P>
      <P>(b) Evidence of a development plan or any part thereof may be given by production of a copy thereof certified pursuant to this subsection and it shall not be necessary to produce the plan itself.</P>
      <P>(c) Where application is made to a planning authority for a copy under this section, the copy shall be issued to the applicant on payment by him to the planning authority of such fee as they may fix not exceeding the reasonable cost of making the copy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter of this amendment was discussed earlier and the question of cost was debated on that occasion.  Where an application is made for a copy of this plan, I hope the Minister, by regulation or otherwise, will convey to the various planning authorities that such copy should be delivered within a reasonable time.  It will not be necessary to supply a copy of the entire plan, since <Col N="1142" /> all the applicant will require will be that part of the plan which affects him personally.  What I am concerned to ensure is that the applicant will receive that copy in sufficient time to enable him to exercise his right of appeal, should he wish to do so.  The cost of these extracts, since that is what they will really be, should be reasonable so that those of modest means will be able to obtain them.  In these modern days, it should be possible to provide photostat copies of the part of the plan required.  I ask the Minister to ensure that those applying will receive whatever information they require without undue delay so that they will be in a position to exercise their right of appeal within the specified period. Secondly, the extract should be so costed as to put it within the reach of all, irrespective of how little an applicant may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jones has mentioned two matters: first, the speed with which the planning authority would produce the copy of the development plan or part thereof, as the case may be and, secondly, that the cost of production would be kept within reasonable limits.  Both of these matters can be and will be dealt with administratively.  Any dilatoriness on the part of the planning authority in producing any plan or part of a plan required for court proceedings, on request and on payment of the prescribed fee, would be regarded very seriously by the court and the planning authority would be rapped across the knuckles for such delay.  So, while we would attempt administratively to ensure that there would be no such delay there is the very real deterrent that the court would be held up as a result of the delay and would deal with such delay in an appropriate manner that would bring about speedy production of the documents.  There is no fear under either of the headings referred to by Deputy Jones.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Section 21 is passed, I should like to give notice <Col N="1143" /> that, following very recent and strong representations, it is my intention to bring back to the House on Report Stage a matter which would be pertinent to this section.  It has been represented to me that persons whose property is affected by the provisions of the draft should be afforded an opportunity to state their case before a person appointed by the planning authority.  I am considering that.  I feel it has a certain amount of merit. I have not had sufficient time to give it full and final consideration before dealing with the section here tonight. I am giving notice that we hope to introduce an amendment, somewhat on those lines and bearing on this section, on the Report Stage.  The section says&mdash;subsection (2) (b):</P>
      <P>... that objections or representations with respect to the draft made to the planning authority within the said period will be taken into consideration...</P>
      <P>It has been put to me as a fair request that interested parties should be afforded not only consideration of any case that they might wish to make by written submission or otherwise but should by right be entitled to an oral hearing of their objection or representations before final conclusions have been reached by the planning authority. It is on that basis that I probably will be coming back to the House on Report Stage, as the only possibility of affording the House an opportunity to consider it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister is doing that.  By a previous amendment, we tried to make some <Col N="1144" /> such provision in the case of a person making representations.  The representations might be to some effect and the plan might be altered.  The Minister may remember that I moved an amendment in similar terms.  It is a useful thing in regard to this type of measure that there should be somebody in the local authority area who would hear people in regard to these matters.  I am glad the Minister is bringing in an amendment on those lines because it is sometimes not feasible to put on paper what a person wishes to convey whereas it might be possible to do so across a table.  Such a provision would give interested parties a better opportunity of expressing their point of view.  It is a desirable type of development that might be availed of in a great many cases in so far as the administrative machine is concerned that there would be some officer who would be available to hear people on these matters.</P>
      <P>May I suggest that the Minister should consider providing that where a report is made in this connection to the planning authority or to the Minister, a copy of such report would be available to the person who has made the representations?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 64:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of Section 22 says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may require the development plans of two or more planning authorities to be co-ordinated in respect of matters and in a manner specified by him and thereupon&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the authorities shall comply with the requisition, and</P>
      <P>(b) any dispute between them arising out of any matters inserted or to be inserted in a development plan shall be determined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>elected representatives to decide on a</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill the local authority shall be the planning authority and it will be the function solely of the <Col N="1145" /> development scheme to be put into operation in any area.  The development plan will be expertly drawn up and then submitted to the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I suggest, has sufficient authority already over local authorities. He has sufficient means of making them amenable in the ordinary way to the overall control which the Minister exercises in these matters.  If the ultimate responsibility for planning is vested in the Minister for Local Government, I want to suggest to the House at this stage that it is not the type of development which is most desirable in the approach to planning. Here we have a division of authority as between the elected representatives and the Minister.  I believe there would be a more responsible approach to planning, in so far as it would affect an area, a region or the property of individuals, if there were not the type of control which is envisaged in the section.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I do not wish in any way to minimise the necessity for the overriding control which the Minister exercises, and which I believe he has ample power to exercise.  If the local authorities, the elected representatives, feel that they have not the final responsibility for planning, or that they can be requested, or even compelled, in fact, to do certain things, I want to suggest that that is not the desirable approach to planning which we set out to attain in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been found, particularly in England where they have gone in for this development, and have more experience than we have, that the most essential thing is to get local enthusiasm for planning, and to get that measure of agreement which brings with it civic pride and civic responsibility. It can be shared with the voluntary associations, but if at any stage we are inclined to say we will require people to do things, we immediately change from the voluntary aspect to the compulsion aspect.</P>
    <P>The development on which we are about to embark is new.  The Minister introducing the Bill, and speaking from the House to the elected representatives, in his tour of the country, <Col N="1146" /> and in his addresses to the officials of the local authorities, has impressed on them the necessity for this co-operation. We cannot get co-operation from them by taking all the responsibility from them.  I do not wish to refer to any instances that might be in anyone's mind at present, but I believe, and I have always felt in regard to local authorities and local government generally, that we should have local government rather than local administration.</P>
    <P>I believe that leaving the responsibility to the elected representatives to ensure that what they plan, or what is planned for their area, will have the best results for their area, is the surest way of ensuring that they have a healthy respect for all aspects of planning. If, as the section stands, the elected representatives find that they can be required to do certain things, that they must comply with a requisition, or that when a dispute arises, the Minister can determine the solution, an impasse will be created in the long run.  That will mean that there will not be the reasoned approach to planning which there should be.</P>
    <P>For that reason, and having regard to the overriding responsibility of the Minister to see that the Bill works, we suggest that this subsection of Section 22 should go.  The Minister has sufficient control.  He could inculcate into the local authorities a greater sense of responsibility by ensuring that they are responsible for planning and then they would approach the problem feeling that what they did would be final. They would approach it from that point of view, always remembering that people affected by their decisions have the right of appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Anyone who feels that his property is affected by the type of planning which is contemplated by a local authority can appeal to the Minister but if, having put the onus on the local authorities and made it a reserved function of theirs to plan for their areas, we then turn around and seemingly take it away from them by putting in the Bill a section under which the Minister may require those plans to be co-ordinated in a manner specified <Col N="1147" /> by him, we immediately take away from them their responsibility to plan.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that the Bill would be improved by the omission of the subsection, and that he is entitled to seek that degree of responsibility from the local authorities in matters of planning. Under the Bill, he would have power of direction.  When we say in one section that planning is a reserved function of the elected representatives, and in another section, that the Minister may require certain things and they must then be done, if he so desires, the two sections are at variance.</P>
    <P>I know an occasion can arise when it might be desirable for the Minister to intervene.  Such a thing can be visualised in a sensible approach to planning, but since this is a new departure in this country, and since it will work only with a wholehearted voluntary acceptance of the need for good planning, we should throw the responsibility on the local authorities and their advisers, and trust them not to do anything which would not be desirable in regard to planning at any stage. I believe the weakness of this Bill is that we say in one section that they have the right to do certain things, and then, in another, that the Minister may intervene and direct them to do certain things.  It is for that reason that we put forward this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit I am surprised at the Deputy's approach to these amendments.  At the same time, I must add that the fact that we are going to all this trouble to provide ourselves with better and more adequate machinery wherewith to get proper planning done is, in itself, an indication that we wish to have proper planning done.  To my mind, that denotes a certain amount of co-ordination of our efforts and plans, whether they are of vital regional, national, or in some cases, county interest.  The majority of the professional people, when we requested observations of any and everybody interested in our proposals, felt that we should not have so many <Col N="1148" /> and so small units as planning authorities. Their arguments were quite convincing but I withheld my approval to liquidating a number of the smaller local authorities as planning units and have retained a great number throughout the country, many of which are quite small.</P>
      <P>I have done that because, as Deputy Jones has mentioned, many of these local authorities which will be planning authorities in the future, as many of them are at present, are in very many respects the best people to initiate and ultimately carry through whatever plan will have been adopted by them with a view to improving their own locality. Despite the strong arguments made by the various professional bodies, it seems to me that not having that large number would create the impasse that Deputy Jones has mentioned rather than that an impasse would be created by leaving the Bill as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, the ordinary, typical cases where co-ordination is absolutely vital as between area and area or a number of areas, whether it be an urban within a county or whether it be adjoining counties, a borough in a county or a borough with a county surrounding it, whether it be three or four areas that are concerned, with the best will in the world, the interests of a planning authority may not be the interests of the greater number in the adjoining areas.  Take the question of the layout or the route of an arterial road.  One local authority might want it entering or leaving their particular locality, if they have the last word, at a point that did not correspond with the place where the other county were agreed it should be. There could be also a very great divergence of opinion among local authorities in regard to water supply mains or sewerage facilities and so on.  An intolerable situation could be created. Supposing Dublin Corporation, for example, determined, as they probably will, that Foxrock should remain residential, there would be nothing to prevent the adjoining local authority of Dublin County Council saying that they proposed to have an industrial estate on the boundary.  That seems outlandish but I am giving those <Col N="1149" /> examples of what could happen in order to drive home the reasons for the proposals in the Bill and as to why it should not be watered down by substituting &ldquo;request&rdquo; for &ldquo;require&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If such divergences of opinion emerge and cannot be solved as between neighbouring planning authorities, then a mere request from any Minister is not likely to bring about a solution. If their own goodwill and neighbourly spirit that will have existed down the years have not succeeded in preventing the break, with one saying it is going this way and the other saying it is going the other way, and both fully convinced they are right, then somebody must come in to make the peace, as it were, quite impartially and standing away from the problem as it appears in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately left this great number of planning authorities, as the House agreed they should be left there because of their adherence to the view that local authorities are best qualified to deal with these matters and should be given as much power as we can possibly delegate to them.  I am not proposing now to take that power from them but what I am proposing to do is vital to the whole context of this Bill, that if, in the exercise of the power in the making of their plans, these plans conflict with each other, some outside, disinterested and impartial person must make a decision after hearing all the arguments.  Without that, the whole benefit of our planning as proposed in the Bill up to this point would be nullified as would the substantial progress we have made by way of agreement and which promises to make it a worthwhile Bill.</P>
    <P>I feel most strongly on this and I have gone into the matter thoroughly. Even though it may seem a small matter to change &ldquo;require&rdquo; to &ldquo;request&rdquo; it would blow such a hole in the bottom of the legislation that it would not be worthwhile spending as much time as we are likely to spend on completing it.</P>

      <P>Probably I could add a little to that to make it clearer.  We should keep in mind that the plan as approved, or accepted, or proposed by the local planning authority, will not at any stage have been approved by the Minister.  That is being preserved so that the Minister may, on appeal, approach the matter with an open mind and may be uncommitted, which he would not be if he had approved, at a prior date, the plan about which there was an appeal.  If, on consideration of an appeal or appeals, the Minister finds that a variation of the plan is required, in order that effect may be given to his determination of a particular appeal or appeals, then that variation would be covered by subsection (3) of Section 22, to bring about a change in the plan to correspond with what he had decided on a particular appeal or appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not wish that the type of consideration we have been giving to this Bill, or the ideals we have set before ourselves, should be weakened in any way.  In this approach to planning, I assume we are not going to have, for a start certainly, a planner <Col N="1151" /> for each local authority.  In so far as the boroughs or county boroughs are concerned, anybody could see that a single planner is the kind of individual who is going to deal with, say, Dublin and county, Limerick and county, or Cork and county, and that at the beginning, the type of expert planners we will have will not be restricted in number.  I should imagine that with the type of co-ordination and consultation which is taking place under local government in all its phases&mdash;with the county managers coming together at regular intervals and the health authorities coming under unified control&mdash; something the same will operate in regard to planning and that we will have a number of expert planners who will not plan for a single region but rather for the region covered by perhaps two or more planning authorities; that we will be doing regional planning rather than county planning.</P>
      <P>It is from that point of view that we hope to overcome some of the difficulties to which the Minister has adverted, extreme though they may be. It is unthinkable that men who were supposed to be experts would lend themselves to the type of plan whereby you would have commercial undertakings or industrial undertakings side by side with residential areas.  It is unthinkable that they would even suggest such a type of development to the elected representatives.  In this amendment, I am trying to suggest that this would be more or less in keeping with the type of development which we have been contemplating under subsection (6) Section 19, where the making of a plan or any variation shall be a reserved function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, if you like, going to be two aspects of the planning: there will be the administrative and the executive end.  The administrative end will be the actual planners who will deal with the plan for the region and who will prepare the plan; the executive end will be those who having received the plan will adopt it.  Those are the elected representatives of the people.  It is to maintain our primary interests in good planning that we have submitted this amendment and not for the purpose of weakening any <Col N="1152" /> type of control.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to get some kind of co-ordinated planning and that is not going to be done piecemeal. If the Minister were to give the impression that he contemplated planning of the type that was going to be dealt with by, say, 26 or 28 planning authorities and result in a jigsaw puzzle, I could not agree more with him that there would have to be some type of coordination and direction.</P>
    <P>I should hope that under this Bill there would be a number of officers of such calibre as would be able to plan for regions and not just for the area under the control of a planning authority.  This subsection seems to cut across what the Minister said earlier about a reserved function and I want to suggest that until such time as he finds it is not going to work in that fashion, he should be prepared to leave the responsibility with them. They will be working to a coordinated plan as submitted by the planners rather than piecemeal planning by a number of planners.  If the Minister felt that the opposite was going to happen and that he was going to have a type of jig-saw puzzle which could not be fitted in and would require the over-riding control of the Minister to fit it in, I would be prepared to regard that as a serious defect.  I hope that such will not happen.  If this is a reserved function, then in this subsection the Minister seems to be taking away from it and until such time as he feels that it is inexpedient to do so, he should leave it until the inexpediency has been determined.  I should like to hear the Minister on that in regard to the over-all planning.</P>

      <P>To Deputy Jones's point that if this is a reserved function, it should be left as such, and am I now contemplating taking from the planning authority that which I proposed to give them in an earlier section, I give a direct answer.  I believe this type of planning will be in the national interest.  I would be prepared to take from them what may have been given to them in earlier sections but only in such cases.  When we talk about reserved functions, the whole basis of this legislation is grounded on the fact <Col N="1153" /> that, instead of this legislation being defective, as was the earlier, by way of its being permissive only, we are in fact requiring each of our 87 planning authorities to undertake planning and to produce a draft plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; it is in the Bill. That is the point I am making.  The very fact that there are as many, for our small-sized country, as 87, or any number around that, in itself creates the situation wherein it is even more necessary than it might have been, if we had fewer in number, to have these very terms of the proposed section rather than the section as it would be if amended by the proposed four or five amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>About 30 odd.  Getting back to this whole argument of reserved function, the very first real change in this proposed legislation is that no longer will these local authorities be left to decide for themselves whether or not they are to have a plan. Therefore, though we are making the drafting of the plan a reserved function, we are, in fact requiring those same people to make such a plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as Deputy Jones has suggested, the same planner may be preparing plans for several adjoining planning authorities, we would have this much-desired uniformity.  On the other hand, if this reserved function we talk about is exercised by the elected members of the planning authorities, it does not follow that though they may have a joint planner for several adjoining planning authorities the reserved function <Col N="1154" /> will bring about an acceptance by all of the adjoining authorities of the plans proposed by the one mind.  The very essence of the reserved function is that each of them would have their own mind.  In such circumstances each would have in mind the best interests of their small community.  Difficulties may and undoubtedly will arise in bringing about this uniformity of plan which, in the national interest, is desirable and necessary.  In such circumstances, somebody must be left in the position to straighten the way, as it were, and to say: &ldquo;This is the way that should be done through all of your territories&rdquo;, having heard, in advance, the case put forward by each of those affected.</P>
    <P>Roads, water mains, sewers, even zoning provision, the construction of airports, the provision of harbour facilities at some of our coastal ports&mdash; all of these things can have a very direct bearing on a number of adjoining planning authorities.  How the roads go: how they may have to be developed, for instance, to serve an airport or a deep sea port.  Take Cork, Galway or Dublin city.  Take the road services we need, say, to serve our own port here in the city of Dublin.  It just does not end when you get to the boundary of the city.  It is a question of disseminating to and gathering traffic from all over the country.</P>
    <P>An airport, even with the existence of roads, can quite well have a very far-flung effect.  Therefore, the idea that development of a very real national interest&mdash;with its offshoots, as it were&mdash;should solely be left to the discretion of the planning authority within whose territory such a development may arise, without regard possibly to its effects on others, would strike at the very foundations of what we are attempting to do which is not just plans for towns, counties, rural areas or ports but, in a broad national sense, is the co-ordination of all the plans of the 87 authorities into a composite whole for the benefit of the community as a whole and in order to advance the national economy.  I put it again to the House that it is very vital that we should have this power of requisition rather than request.</P>
    <Col N="1155" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all in favour of what the Minister said in regard to getting things done nationally&mdash;something that will be of broad national and even local benefit.  However, I felt there ought to be a sense of responsible approach by the elected representatives to this matter of planning.  It was in the hope that we would get a responsible approach to this desirable and needed type of planning that we put forward the amendment.</P>
      <P>The whole approach to planning will depend on the co-operation of everybody. If we cannot get this co-operation we are not likely either to get good planning.  If the Minister feels that that is absolutely necessary and that we cannot have responsible planning without this subsection which takes away immediately from them the type of responsibility they ought to have in regard to their approach to planning and to the people advising them on planning, I am prepared to give way on this matter.  In so doing, I regret the Minister feels there is not a sufficient sense of responsibility among the elected representatives of local areas and their competent advisers to sit down and think out what is best, what is in the best interests of the regions and what is in the best interests nationally.  It would be a poor approach to the type of co-operation we expect from the local authorities when they get down to it.</P>
      <P>If the Minister feels he has not sufficient bite in this Bill otherwise, or that this would in any way weaken it and not leave it capable of giving us the type of desirable planning everybody wants, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I appeal to the Minister to reconsider subsection (3).  If that subsection is implemented with force it will mean that local authorities will be asked to prepare sketch plans and the Custom House will be the final planning authority for every local authority.  I do not think that is right.  Being a county councillor, I am anxious to preserve as much authority and as many privileges as possible for local representatives.  The Minister has been a county councillor himself and knows the difficulties.</P>
      <P>There is considerable criticism at present, and there has been for years, of decisions made in the Department of Local Government.  For example, there has been considerable criticism recently in our own council about the distribution of road funds and in regard to money diverted from country roads to arterial and main roads.  Everywhere one finds criticism of the 100 per cent grant schemes designed and planned entirely in the Custom House.  Many schemes that are planned locally never come before the local representatives. The first we know is that a big bend is taken off the road and we are accused by the local people of squandering their money while we know nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this provision is implemented with <Col N="1157" /> considerable force, as it probably will be&mdash;it depends perhaps on the Minister in power&mdash;I believe it will considerably nullify any incentive to local effort and cause considerable frustration to local voluntary associations and county councils in general.</P>
    <P>The Minister has many way of bringing county councils to heel without the power sought in this subsection.  If he intimates his wishes to a county manager at any time, usually the county manager has sufficient influence with the county councillors to get these wishes adopted.  The Minister should at least give a trial to less coercive methods.  I believe that would pay good dividends and that he would get better co-operation.  He would also produce a better Bill.  He said he had to deal with 87 planning authorities.  I do not dispute his point about having taken powers to enforce a degree of co-operation because you cannot get a half-dozen&mdash;or even two&mdash;planning authorities to agree.  I can understand the need for that power, particularly when he has so many to deal with but I appeal to him to reconsider this subsection and, perhaps, he would find it possible, if he does so, to amend it or even delete it altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have some assurance at least from the Minister that only in exceptional circumstances would he invoke the authority sought in this subsection.  I should like to know the circumstances in which he would be likely to require this power.  Like Deputy Jones and Deputy Hogan, I want the maximum power of decision left to the local authority, the people who have local knowledge and who have the interest of the area at heart.  They are perfectly intimate with the circumstances of their area and it is altogether wrong to assume that the Custom House people are in a better position to pass final judgment on a plan than those who have local responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Answering Deputy Clinton first as to the circumstances in which this clause or variation is likely to be used, I should say that the whole system of appeals by individuals <Col N="1158" /> against planning authority decisions would be almost completely nullified if there did not repose in the Minister power to vary a draft plan to conform with what was ultimately decided on an appeal submitted to him by an individual aggrieved under a planning authority decision.  Such a decision in almost every case would be made in conformity with the authority's own draft plan and statement of intention of planning.  If there is any meaning in the right of appeal to the Minister against a local authority's planning decision made in conformity with their own accepted plan, the power of the Minister subsequently to vary the draft plan of such an authority to bring it into conformity with a decision he has upheld on the appeal of an aggrieved party, is an absolutely vital part of the procedure.</P>
      <P>Reverting to subsection (2) on the question of co-ordination, the co-ordination of the plans of adjoining planning authorities will almost inevitably call for variation in order to bring them into conformity with each other and the general pattern in the regional interest, an interest greater than the interest of any one of the parties to the local divergence of opinion.  The power of variation is not being put in so that, in a veiled way, the Minister or the Department of Local Government will, in fact, become the planning authority for every local authority.  I want to give a categorical assurance that that is not the intention and never will be.  I want to put that on the records of the House and let it be specifically understood.  That never will be my intention so long as I am Minister.</P>
      <P>The requirements of both subsections (2) and (3) are a basic part of the whole machinery necessary for planning.  Far from indicating that I lack confidence in the members of our local authorities, the fact that 87 planning authorities are mentioned in this Bill should give all the assurance necessary, even to the smallest urban council, that I, as Minister, am fully satisfied they have a part to play in finding the type of planning best suited to our society.</P>

      <P>As the subsection reads at the moment, it depends on previous subsections in this section.  The Minister has taken power in the previous subsections to give directions and has power to require planning authorities to do certain things and make variations.

If subsections (2) and (3) require the planning authority to make necessary changes, why is it stated in subsection (4)  that the changes must be made with the consent of the Minister?

      <P>Perhaps I should have referred to amendment No. 68 at an earlier stage.  Assume the situation develops that, for one reason or another, a variation is required by the Minister and he makes that known. The planning authority have got notice requiring them to make a certain change.  That certain change must be given the same full range of publicity as would have been given to the original proposals in the draft plan. Consequent on that publicity, certain objections and representations may emerge or a strong case may be made for an alternative variation.  In fact, it may be decided that not all of what has been asked for by the Minister should be done and that another way may be the better way.  In that event, it will not be what the Minister <Col N="1160" /> required in the first instance that will be proposed to be done, but something different.  In that event, the Minister must be asked for his consent to depart from what he himself asked the local authority to do.</P>

      <P>That certainly takes some of the sting out of it.  Recent events preclude me from dwelling too much on these matters.  The Minister has had to make representations, and I do not wish to refer to the matter at present.  Certainly, what the Minister has said clarifies the position.  In my references to the previous subsection, I had that very much in mind.  If the Minister felt in the national interest he required these powers, I would not put forward an amendment to weaken his hand.  What he has said has helped me to understand the intent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 69:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 20, to delete &ldquo;general instructions&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo;, and in line 21, to delete &ldquo;model&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;specimen&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intent of this amendment is to put the planning authority in a superior position in regard to planning.  If we take the words &ldquo;general instructions,&rdquo; there is more there than merely the conveying of ideas.  The suggestions there ought to be followed.  When it is a question of helping them along in <Col N="1161" /> regard to planning, suggestions would be very welcome, if they do not take away from local initiative.  When we use the word &ldquo;model,&rdquo; we are inclined to think of the ultimate in achievement. It might not be always true, but I suggest &ldquo;specimen&rdquo; might be a more apt word to use for the type of planning the Minister may propose to local authorities.  It is from the point of view of leaving it to the goodwill, the good sense of the local authorities, that we move this amendment.</P>
    <P>I recognise, and I said so earlier, that in the new development taking place in this country, there will be great need for preparing and training the necessary personnel to get the best type of planning in the country.  The Minister has already taken steps to ensure that the local authorities will have at their disposal the advice of qualified people.  In regard to this term &ldquo;model planning&rdquo;, what I do not want is that this would be handed down to the local authorities as something that must be followed.  I feel sure the Minister does not mean it in that way.  I believe he means it will go to the authorities as a suggestion and this again involves the question of local control in planning matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Jones on the need for these changes, especially in regard to the proposed change of &ldquo;model&rdquo; to &ldquo;specimen&rdquo;. A model is a thing that in these days all politicians should be anxious to avoid.  Apart from that entirely, the term makes one immediately think of model schools or model farms.  I shall not mention the other models.  As I have said, it would be more reasonable to substitute &ldquo;specimen&rdquo;.  On the proposed change from &ldquo;general instructions&rdquo; to &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo;, although it appears in the Bill as a potential instruction, I do not think it was intended in that way because that term would be nullified by the later reference to &ldquo;guidance&rdquo;.  It would not be mandatory in any sense.  I feel sure the term &ldquo;general instructions&rdquo; was meant to convey guiding suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the <Col N="1162" /> amendment seeks to substitute &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo; for &ldquo;general instructions&rdquo;. The context in which the term appears here is the important thing. The feeling is it would be desirable the same general form of map notation would be followed by all local authorities in preparing their development plans.  This is not merely a facility to be subjected to scrutiny at a later date by officers of the Department. Far more is it to facilitate more readily a recognition in any planning authority area of what is, in fact, intended. If a map is done in the same way, if the outline is prepared in the same way, as the result of the general instructions having been issued, then everybody will be facilitated greatly in that all local authorities will be dealing with the same type and form of approach to planning as a whole.</P>
      <P>In so far as the model forms are concerned, candidly I much prefer &ldquo;model&rdquo; to &ldquo;specimen&rdquo;.  We have had model by-laws, model clauses and Deputies can bring themselves up to date as to what type of models we are having at the moment.  The word has been used in the context in which it is in this section for many years in different types of legislation.  A change of the wording here would not be any improvement: in fact, as suggested, it might be a weakening of the intention in the subsection.  For those reasons, I suggest there is little, if anything, to be argued for the change.</P>
      <P>Reverting to the first part of the amendment, the implementation of the general instruction would bring about uniformity of approach in the preparation of plans.  It is not necessary to get uniformity of planning for the areas but a matter of getting the map notation similar in all areas&mdash;that the general approach to the plans will be faced in the same manner by all local authorities.  All would be facilitated, in that once local authorities got to know the lay-out of the plan in one area, they would be preparing for a similar approach in other areas.  &ldquo;General instructions&rdquo;, therefore, is a more useful term.</P>

Why should we have 30 or 40 ways of doing it when we can be helpful to local authorities by telling them that they should follow a certain line in certain respects?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In the section, as drafted, it is provided that:</P>
      <P>(b)  in the case of a structure which existed immediately before the appointed day and is on the commencement of that day an unauthorised structure, for the retention of the structure.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) requires permission to be obtained for the new development of land and paragraph (b) deals with the retention of a structure erected during the currency of the Planning Act of 1934 and in respect of which permission was neither required nor obtained.  Under the Acts of 1934 and 1938, once a local authority passed a resolution to make a planning scheme for their area, they were required to make this plan with all convenient speed.  Now structures were erected for which permission should strictly have been obtained.  No planning authority, with one exception, made a scheme.  They were in breach of their statutory requirements and that was very forcibly borne out by a court decision in a case in which the Dublin Corporation were sued by Modern Homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No penalty was imposed on local authorities for their failure to observe the law and I suggest to the House that no penalty should now be imposed on private individuals who failed to observe the law.  Very little publicity was given to the making of planning schemes and it may well be that structures were erected by people in ignorance of the law.  Great hardships might be imposed on these people now if they were required to remove these structures.  It would be inequitable, for instance, that a native <Col N="1165" /> of Leitrim should be compelled to remove a structure while his next-door-neighbour in Cavan is not penalised after such fashion, though his structure is identical in every respect.</P>
    <P>If local authorities are not penalised for their failure to comply with the law, I do not see why individual citizens should be penalised.  Up to this, very little thought has been given to planning.  Very little regard was had to the 1934 and 1938 Acts.  Very few knew there was such a thing as town planning.  A great many people learned of the various provisions of town planning and their effect when the action was taken in the court by Modern Homes to insist on certain things being done.  The public are aware that even after judgment was given by the court the procedure was protracted.</P>
    <P>In most counties where there were planning authorities under the previous Acts, while they may have adopted the resolution which brought town planning into operation, there was very little else done.  In a great many cases people had erected dwellings for which they had no permission from the planning authority at the time.  Judging by the types of building one sees on the outskirts of towns and cities it would seem as if building was rather haphazard and did not conform to any plan.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, to the Minister and to the House that it is inequitable at this stage to impose on the private citizen the type of sanction which could be imposed by this subsection. If he did not obtain permission, whether advertently or inadvertently, under previous Town Planning Acts, he now finds himself in peril of being ordered to remove some structure.  I suggest that that is something we should not do.  The private citizen should not be visited with sanctions which are not imposed on local authorities when they were remiss in regard to town planning.  For that reason, we put forward the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> This section embodies the worst type of <Col N="1166" /> coercive retrospective legislation possible to imagine.  Here we have a position arising where a previous Act was passed which some local authorities adopted and some did not but in no instance was a plan prepared. Apparently, there was a hiatus in the Act which some people discovered and found they could flout the local planning authority and did so.  Now this section is introduced to punish these people retrospectively for a fault which lay in the first instance with this House and with the Parliamentary draftsman and in the second instance with individual local authorities who may not have adopted the Act or, where they adopted it, did not produce a plan.  Now the draftsmen who drafted it foolishly go unpunished and the people who had sufficient intelligence to find a gap in the Act are to be punished retrospectively for discovering the gap.</P>
      <P>For years and up to the present time local authorities have been placing controls upon people in the name of town planning without, apparently, having legal power to do so.  This section means that we are going to take legal power.  It looks as if the intention may be to punish those who were bold enough to disobey us previously.  If this is meant and is applied merely to remove some very objectionable thing that may have happened in the intervening period, I can understand it but this is a sweeping section which gives retrospective power to the local authorities everywhere to deal with any flouting of their suggestions over the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is at least one feature of this Planning Bill which comes to my mind in respect of which it is extremely desirable to have retrospective legislation.  I refer to the question of unfinished estates.  However, I regard this subsection as a very dangerous subsection in respect of which to have retrospection.  So many unauthorised structures come to my mind that it would seem, if the Minister were fully to exercise his powers under the subsection that he would demolish half the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to decide in some <Col N="1167" /> cases what is an unauthorised structure. For instance, is a structure in respect of which application for permission was made and permission was not granted and the statutory period of two months elapsed and the person proceeded to build, an unauthorised structure?  The man who applied for permission has no written evidence that it is not an unauthorised structure.  The only thing he has is an application, to which he has no reply.</P>
    <P>What use does the Minister intend to make of the subsection if it is passed?  Does he intend to require a large number of people or a limited number of people to demolish structures, the building of which there was no power at the time to prevent?  I find it very difficult to see in what way the power can be used.  Is it the intention to require people to demolish buildings?  Otherwise I do not see that this power is required.  It is unthinkable that in respect of dwelling houses, factories or other buildings the Minister should now be given power to say that they must be demolished, and demolished at the expense of the persons concerned. That is what the subsection states and I would be very much opposed to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is complete misunderstanding &mdash; an understandable misunderstanding, if I may put it that way&mdash;in the minds of the Deputies who have spoken on this matter.  Let us take the situation as it is.  In a number of counties the Planning Acts were in operation; in a number of other local authority areas they were not.  An unauthorised structure would be a structure for which no permission had been given in an area in which the Planning Acts were in operation at the time of its construction.</P>
    </Speaker>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Where they were adopted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where they had been adopted, yes.  If no such planning had been in operation in a planning authority's area, then no permission could possibly exist.  In such circumstances, the structures, even objectionable <Col N="1168" /> ones, are not and will not be regarded or described as unauthorised. What it boils down to is this: the planning authorities who did not go for, and put into operation, their powers under the 1934 Act, are now facing a situation in which, if there are structures in existence which are objectionable and, for good reasons, they want them removed, and take steps to have them removed, they must pay compensation in full for their folly in not operating the 1934 Act.</P>
      <P>For those counties which operated the Act and where, through alleged ignorance of the planning laws, and through the operations of the &ldquo;wide boys&rdquo; who took advantage of certain loopholes in the law, not through ignorance, but through their great insight into the law, certain buildings were erected without permission, in such circumstances they will be unauthorised structures after the appointed date mentioned in the Bill. That does not mean to say, and it is not intended to convey, that every building erected without written authority must be brought down.</P>
      <P>In fact, the intention of this Bill is to make legitimate, where it is possible, that which is now illegitimate. In other words, we want to end the present situation in as many cases as we can.  The position will be that within five years of the passing of the Act, or the bringing into operation of the appointed day, a planning authority may require a building or structure to be removed.  It could be hoardings or advertisements or any one of many things, none of which may necessarily be of any great value, and their removal may not cause any great hardship.  In fact, a very good profit may have been got from their existence during the intervening years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also provide that persons who own such unauthorised structures can apply for permission to make them legal.  If they are refused permission, they have the right of appeal to the Minister who, on further consideration, may decide against the local authority.  Despite the fact that permission was not sought or got, and despite the fact that the structure may not be <Col N="1169" /> a very desirable one, it might be held that it is not so objectionable as to merit complete condemnation and removal without compensation.  A great many structures that will come to be regarded and named as unauthorised will, for the first time, by virtue of the proposals in this Bill, become legalised and be entitled to exist, and if in the future they should be caused to be taken down by the operations of the local authorities, they will rank for compensation in the same way as any other property, or something that may exist legally at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera has given notice that he wished to raise the subject matter of Question No. 49 on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions on the Order Paper which the Minister answered today and it is the subject matter of those questions which I wish to raise on the Adjournment.  There is a crisis in the city of Dublin which is in part a housing crisis and in part a crisis relating to dangerous buildings, and the two are closely interconnected. It would appear that the local authority, the Dublin Corporation, has not been in a position to deal with the question of dangerous tenements at the speed that now appears to have been necessary.  There is also the question of providing alternative accommodation for the occupants of such buildings, and, generally, the provision of housing accommodation in the city of Dublin has not been adequate to the need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am raising this matter on the Adjournment to urge upon the Minister that there is a crisis and that this crisis requires extraordinary action under one or two heads at least.  From recent experience we realise that it is vitally necessary that a comprehensive and ordered survey of dangerous buildings in the city of Dublin be undertaken forthwith.  The second consideration is that, because such a survey will take time, the measures necessary to deal with emergencies <Col N="1173" /> that are likely to arise should be instituted; in other words, some drill must be there for urgently dealing with buildings that threaten immediate collapse.  I realise that is a difficult thing but already over the weekend the Dangerous Buildings Section of the Corporation did provide such a service and I am satisfied that that section of the Corporation has possibly averted serious danger by the vigorous action it took.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a survey of such buildings we must face the fact that people cannot be allowed to live on in them and, irrespective of the availability of permanent accommodation, emergency measures may be necessary to ensure that people who are hurriedly evacuated from unsuitable tenements are adequately dealt with first on a short-term basis with a view to the longer term basis.  The whole situation is such as to warrant extraordinary measures for speeding up the provision of permanent accommodation in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into details in this discussion because the scope is limited but I want to place this on the record, that I was surprised when I asked to have this matter raised on the Adjournment that I was told that in the interpretation of order in the House I would be in order in raising only the subject matter of Question No. 49, that the other matters did not come within the purview of the Minister for Local Government but were properly matters for Dublin Corporation.  I accept that ruling and I do not wish to go beyond it.  It is possibly all right in ordinary circumstances for Dáil representatives to be precluded on that basis but I do want to suggest that this crisis is of such a nature that powers should be taken to intervene and ascertain the required information.</P>
    <P>The Minister has intervened to the extent of having an inquiry.  I do not wish in any way to prejudice this inquiry by allusions or references of any kind or by casting blame here or there.  The inquiry must not be prejudiced and restraint is called for on our part in this House.  Therefore, I do not wish to go any further than to <Col N="1174" /> make one comment on the inquiry. The Minister in reply to the question today said:</P>
    <P>I have directed a public inquiry to be held into the circumstances connected with the collapse of buildings and the administration of the law respecting unfit dwellings and dangerous structures in relation to these buildings.</P>
    <P>So far so good, but I should like the Minister to extend the scope of that inquiry to cover the ancillary problems that arise in relation to dangerous buildings, namely, the type of housing to be allocated, and so on.  With those remarks, I shall leave the question of both the inquiry and the details that have been raised in other questions.</P>
    <P>From my own personal experience and the experience of other Deputies over the weekend, I think we can say we may be faced at any moment with the problem which arose over the weekend. The Dangerous Buildings Section of the Corporation condemned, and no doubt rightly condemned, buildings without delay last Friday and Saturday. They secured the necessary court orders or whatever justices' orders are necessary for the purpose.  As a result, the tenants of these houses had to evacuate them immediately.  The procedure apparently was that the people so evacuated were then dealt with in the Allocation Section of Dublin Corporation. I have no doubt that every strenuous effort was made to make the allocation as quickly as possible but it is obvious that it was a physical impossibility, even if enough staff were there, to allocate permanent accommodation immediately to people in these circumstances. However, there was no adequate provision in the city of Dublin&mdash;and I say this from my own personal experience&mdash;for dealing with people who through no fault of their own were suddenly projected on to the roadway along with their furniture. We must face the fact that there are psychological factors in this and that there are limits beyond which you cannot expect people to go.</P>

      <P>I wonder if I could raise a point of order?  I understand that Standing Orders allow for half <Col N="1175" /> an hour on the Adjournment Debate and the Minister will have ten minutes to reply.  There is nothing to prevent Deputy de Valera, if he so wishes, from speaking for 20 minutes but I should like to say that I would like to intervene for three or four minutes.  I understand also that Deputy Sherwin would like to intervene for three or four minutes.  I understand, a Cheann Comhairle, that it might not be against the conventions of the House if the Deputy who raised this matter would be prepared to give way to allow two short speeches before the Minister replies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to facilitate the Deputy.  We must be reasonable about this.  There are two sides to this problem.  One is that this emergency was aggravated by the weather. The exceptionally bad winter, the hot <Col N="1176" /> weather we had recently, and then the thunderstorm all undoubtedly aggravated the situation.  I do know that the Corporation made efforts to meet this emergency but they were not sufficient and the situation which arose last Saturday, particularly in Fenian Street, was, from the public point of view, unjustifiable.  We should have been able to cope with it and we were not.  I want to ensure that this type of thing will not happen again.  These are things which should be said in regard to the problem.  We know that in 1956-57, because of a shortage of money, the Corporation were not able to raise the funds required for their programme.  We also know that some time ago, as a result of people going away, there were very many vacancies. Somebody gave me the figure of 1,500.  We know that that happens to be so but we also know that 800 families returned and that that aggravated the position.  We know that there will be 600 more houses built by March.  That is all very well.  I must conclude now to allow the other Deputies speak.  I think last Saturday's events were a crisis which should never have happened.  The matter must be raised.  I do not wish to apportion blame but I would ask the Minister to consider the matter on the basis I outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will only take three minutes.  This is a crisis that has not arisen in the last month but has been with us for several years.  It has taken four deaths to bring it to the notice of the proper authorities and it is most tragic that it required such extreme results to bring about what is very belatedly coming about, namely, a public interest in a situation in the city of Dublin which I believe to be a scandal and a shame in a community that calls itself Christian.  The position is this.  In 1955-56 the Dublin Corporation built 1,311 houses; in 1956-57 the number increased to 1,564 houses.  The <Col N="1177" /> number of houses built by the Corporation declined to 1,021 in 1957-58 and to 460 in 1958-59.  There was a slight increase in 1959-60 and a decline to 277 in 1960-61.  There was a drop between 1956-57 and 1960-61 from 1,564 to 277 houses.  That decline is responsible for what happened in the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>The Corporation have a waiting list of thousands of people who are not able to get houses, people who would not be on the waiting list if the houses had been built.  I do not blame the Corporation for this.  I blame the Government because the Corporation have carried out the Government's stated economic programme of cutting down on social investment in favour of so-called productive investment.  The decline in building in Dublin has been responsible for the disastrous conditions of the past few weeks, for the disastrous conditions which have existed for several years past.  As a result, people are living in un-Christian conditions.  Deputy de Valera talks about a survey; I have correspondence here&mdash;and Deputy Sherwin and every Dublin Deputy has correspondence&mdash; which will obviate the necessity for the survey.</P>
      <P>There are 19 people living to-night in Cabra in a two-bedroom house. There are 12 people living in Cabra&mdash; eight of them young people aged between eight and 20&mdash;living in a two-bedroom house.  There is a mentally handicapped child in my constituency who cannot go out into his front garden because there is a step and he will fall down.  He cannot be transferred to another house because there are not enough houses.  There is a spastic 17-years-old child who cannot be transferred; there are a lot of people living in grossly overcrowded conditions. This is a national emergency.  Deputy de Valera says he will not apportion blame.  I apportion blame and say it is not the fault of the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation and it is not the fault of the inspectors of the Corporation.  The Government must accept responsibility for what has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting that either Deputy de Valera or Deputy Costello is right.  I know they are interested in the problem but I know that most of their data is gleaned from what they have read but I can speak from experience and what I know to be a fact.  There is a great deal of difference.  I am a member of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation and I have attended practically every meeting of it for the past eight years.  I know why the houses are there and why they fell, but I am trying to reserve what I know for the court of inquiry.  It does not make much sense talking about it here.  Too often a matter of this sort is made a political issue.  I am not interested in that.  I am only interested in telling the truth and I will tell it to the court of inquiry.</P>
      <P>I know why there are 550 condemned tenements there and I know why the people are in them.  It has little to do with the fact that there are no houses.  There are 800 single people or pairs of people in those 550 condemned tenements.  Those people do not get houses and let us not say it is because there were no houses. Single people and people living in pairs do not get houses.  If there was a lack, it was a lack of one-room or two-room flats.  The houses are a separate issue. However, I shall make the case at the court of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only asking the Minister to do something.  He can do something. Three weeks ago, I spoke to him and said the position is bad enough.  I asked him if he would do something. I asked him if he would consult the Minister for Justice and get him to amend the Rent Restrictions Act. That Act allows business people to get possession of habitable dwellings. They merely have to give them a few pounds and they can go to the court and tell the court that they want it for a business and the court has <Col N="1179" /> power to give possession.  In my area alone, 80 per cent of all those dangerous buildings are located.  Practically 40 per cent of them are adjacent to my house.  I live in Linenhall Street. These houses are all in front of and behind me.</P>
    <P>I am talking not from what I read but from what I know.  In this same area at present there is an application for possession of 19 habitable dwellings at Phibsborough Road by a supermarket and they will get possession. Only a few months ago, nine habitable dwellings in Abbey Street were taken possession of.  About nine months ago, ten habitable dwellings were obtained in Benburb Street. These are all in an area where 80 per cent of the dwellings crashed in three weeks.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister about this three weeks ago&mdash;there was nothing he could do in that short time.  I asked him if he could get this part of the Act suspended so that no more applications would be entertained for habitable dwellings until such time as there was no crisis.  I am not here to hit one Party or the other.  I shall not rub it in that people talked here out of turn.  You can only know about a thing when you live with it.</P>
    <P>I could speak on this matter for three hours.  I could accuse lots of people.  I could swing people's heads. I shall not do that.  I would ask the Minister to see the Minister for Justice and to arrange to stop until further notice the granting of applications for habitable dwellings in this city.  With that, I shall say no more now.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which, having been raised on the Adjournment, I hoped would be considered and discussed on a basis in keeping with the seriousness of the position.  I am rather sorry to observe that Deputy Costello, of the three who spoke, seemed to have no real intention in speaking but to make what little political capital he could out of getting his voice in first. I shall not give the obvious answer to Deputy Costello but he knows what the answer is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello was not evident in this matter or in any of these questions today.  It is amazing how evident he has become in the past few minutes. I have been appalled that what has happened should happen.  I was stunned.  Until I have found out quite a deal of the facts as to why it happened I shall not commit myself as to what I think or whom to blame. It is not a question at this stage of who is to blame but what is to be done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin has indicated that he will withhold what information he has&mdash;and that he knows others of like mind&mdash;until the inquiry takes place. I do not intend to make any lengthy statement on this matter.  Like all others concerned with and interested in the housing of the people of this city, I am appalled and stunned by what has happened.  I trust that, arising from our inquiry, we may find out why it happened and, more important, may find a way to ensure it will never happen again.</P>
