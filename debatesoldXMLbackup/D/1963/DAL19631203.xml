      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen reports regarding the Citizens Advice Bureaux which operate in Great Britain.  I am of the opinion that the need for them which exists in that country appears to be adequately met here by public representatives and various charitable organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach's attention been directed to the fact that certain old and destitute people, particularly those living in solitary rooms in the city of Dublin and other such places, are frequently discovered not to be aware of the social services available for their relief?  In those circumstances, would it not be desirable to have some organisation, preferably of a voluntary character, to which such people could be referred for assistance in order to bring them into contact with the appropriate social relief provided either by the State or the local authority?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would cause further inquiries to be made to determine whether my information or his is correct&mdash;that there are, not a considerable number, but a certain number of old people whose circumstances could be relieved if full advantage were taken of the available services but who suffer for the want of knowledge of where to turn for that relief.</P>

      <P>The local State Solicitor has been asked to enforce <Col N="311" /> forthwith the court decrees in question. The main reasons given by him for the delay in enforcement were pressure of work and the destruction, by flood, of papers in his office.</P>

      <P>The inquiries into retail prices, made by the Central Statistics Office for the purpose of compiling the Consumer Price Index Number, are carried out at quarterly intervals.  The two latest of these related to mid-August and mid-November, 1963.  The data from the mid-August inquiry, including the national average retail prices for foodstuffs, were published in the September, 1963, issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin,</i> pages 144-5.

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will consider the desirability of providing more immediate facilities for the treatment of accident and emergency cases in the Ballyfermot area, Dublin; and whether he will examine the possibility of erecting an annex for the purpose at Cherry Orchard Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) (for the Minister for Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>In a reply <Col N="312" /> which I gave to a somewhat similar question on 14th ultimo, I made it clear that I had no reason to believe that the existing arrangements for the treatment of accidents and other emergencies occurring in the Ballyfermot area were inadequate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion that an accident unit should be built in the grounds of Cherry Orchard hospital does not commend itself.  Such a unit to be effectual should have available a wide range of medical and nursing skills and experience in dealing with traumatic work.  For this reason such units are usually associated with general hospitals.  I am advised that it would not be appropriate to link an accident unit with an infectious diseases hospital as the Deputy appears to contemplate.</P>

      <P>In view of the doubt and anxiety which a previous question on this subject raised, would the Minister not consider on this occasion making a more comprehensive inquiry? The previous question gave rise to a good deal of adverse criticism about an institution that is giving first-class service.  If the Minister has any notes on it, he should clear up the matter once and for all in relation to the services in St. Kevin's.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is prepared to reintroduce without further delay a system whereby financial assistance shall be granted to local health authorities for the erection of dispensary buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated in the House on a number of occasions in the recent past that it is not possible to re-introduce a scheme for the making of capital grants towards the erection of dispensary buildings.  There are no moneys at my disposal to enable me to do so.  The Hospitals Trust Fund is already fully committed in relation to hospital building works of an essential character and it would be quite impossible for the Fund to finance such a scheme of grants.</P>
      <P>During the greater part of the period from 1952 to 1957 when grants were being made available from the Fund towards the cost of providing dispensaries, the Fund was being assisted to quite a significant extent by the Exchequer. If the State were again to come to the aid of the Fund it would involve further demands on the Exchequer.  As Deputies are aware, it was necessary for the Government to introduce only recently, and in face of the stiffest opposition, special measures to raise the additional revenue needed to meet the present level of expenditure on the public services.  It would, therefore, be unreasonable to expect the Exchequer, with the other pressing demands which it must meet in any event, to bear the cost of subsidising the erection of new dispensaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The replacement of unsatisfactory dispensary premises is the responsibility of the health authorities concerned.  A health authority may, with my approval, obtain the requisite loan accommodation from their Treasurers or the Local Loans Fund.  Loans from the Local Loans Fund can be on a long term basis so as to achieve the <Col N="314" /> situation that the impact on the local rates will be minimal.  As I told the Deputy when replying to the debate on the Estimate for my Department on 10th May, 1962, the Cork Health Authority could, by reason of the special Local Loans Fund facilities and without other assistance, replace all the defective dispensary premises in their area at a cost to the rates of less than a penny in the pound.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can do is to wait to read the reply to know what is in it and I am not finding fault with the loudspeaker system either.  I do not know what the Minister is doing with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, further to a reply of 7th November, he is aware that in the Health Centre, Ballygall Road, Finglas, Dublin no dental treatment can be given which requires anaesthesia by gas; and that for all such dental treatment children must travel to Cornmarket; and whether he will take steps to ensure that this type of treatment will be provided in Finglas, in view of the fact that it is a greater hardship to the children to travel some distance home after total anaesthesia by gas than it is after other types of dental treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Dublin Health Authority that dental treatment under general anaesthetic is not provided at the Health Centre, Ballygall Road, Finglas, and that eligible children from Finglas requiring such treatment are normally referred to the health authority's dental clinic at Cornmarket.</P>
      <P>The provision of dental treatment under general anaesthetic at the Health Centre, Finglas, would be a matter for the Dublin Health Authority in the first instance.  I understand that the health authority propose to review their arrangements for the provision of dental treatment under general anaesthetic as part of the comprehensive review of their dental services which they intend to make shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> I should perhaps add that the Deputy may not appreciate that there is a direct bus service from Finglas to a point about seven or eight minutes walking distance from the Cornmarket centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the answer, I understand that there is a bus service but surely the Minister realises how inconvenient and difficult it is for children to travel in a bus after having had gas.  If the Minister ever had that experience himself, he would know how difficult it is. I wonder if it would be possible to afford the children the facility of having the anaesthetic locally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the distance there is between Finglas and Cornmarket, I think that it is very important that the children should have <Col N="316" /> the facilities in Finglas.  There is no bus service direct from Finglas to Cornmarket.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will reconsider the decision to close the social welfare office in Edenderry, County Offaly, in view of the very great distances that people will have to travel from Carbury to Naas, County Kildare, and particularly in view of the fact that old age pension applicants would not normally be in a position to travel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with a number of questions on the subject of the closing of Social Welfare officer stations in recent weeks.  On 24th October in reply to a question by Deputy Brigid Hogan O'Higgins about the closing of the Social Welfare officer station at Gort, I explained generally the circumstances which gave rise to the closing of a number of Social Welfare officer stations and I would refer the Deputies to that reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As there seems to be some misunderstanding about the effect of the closing of these offices, particularly in relation to old age pensioners, I think it well to elaborate on the information which I have already given.  Even though the <Col N="325" /> number of Social Welfare officer stations has been reduced the service provided for claimants is no different now from that provided before the 1st October last.  The position is that claim forms for old age pensioners are available at all post offices and, if the claimant wishes, the postmaster will assist in completing the claim.  Postage free envelopes for the posting of claims to the Social Welfare officer are also available.  The Social Welfare officer investigates each claim in the claimant's home and discusses with the claimant any problems that may arise. When a pension is awarded the pension book is forwarded to the post office nominated by the claimant and it may be collected there by the claimant at his convenience.  This procedure has been in operation for many years and has not been affected by the reorganisation. There should, therefore, be no necessity for any old age pension claimant to travel a long distance as a result of the closing of a Social Welfare office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reasons why the long form of birth certificate is required in the case of claims for old age and blind non-contributory pensions, widows' non-contributory pensions, orphans' pensions and in respect of children shown as dependants on a widow's claim; and when he proposes to take steps to make the short certificate acceptable for these payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The long birth certificate has been required in the case of claims for old age non-contributory pensions, widows' non-contributory pensions, orphans' pensions and children shown as dependants on a widow's claim, because certain particulars on the long certificate, which are not given on the short certificate, facilitate the establishment of title to payment and obviate the need for further enquiries and consequential delay.</P>
      <P>However, as I stated in reply to a question from the Deputies on 21st ultimo, I am having the matter examined with a view to extending the categories in respect of which the short form of certificate may be accepted.</P>

      <P>Specific proposals of the nature indicated by the Deputy have not been received by me from the Board for the Employment of the Blind.</P>
      <P>I should add, however, that the initiation of a training scheme for blind persons would involve an extension of the Board's existing premises. The Board has recently submitted proposals to me in this regard, and these proposals are at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>No, I do not think so.

      <P>The number of officers whose retired pay is abated is 32.  In 20 of the cases the abatement (partial in ten instances and whole in the remaining ten) is on account of the retired officer being in employment, the remuneration of which is payable out of public moneys. In the remaining 12 cases, the abatement (partial in all instances) is due to the retired officer being in receipt of a disability pension.  The additional annual cost to public funds if the abatement provisions were entirely removed would be £8,300.</P>

A number of these members, the majority of whom have since retired, elected to retain their existing pension rights and not to avail themselves of the new superannuation terms.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="362" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving to report progress last Thursday evening, I said that I accepted this Bill.  Having had the advantage of thinking over the many implications of the Bill during the weekend.  I have not changed my mind about it.  The aims of the Bill are good and, therefore, I am accepting them.  I also said that, in the main, Bills are introduced to solve a problem or a variety of problems.  For that reason, the areas most affected would be the areas that would derive the greatest benefit.  It will be conceded that County Mayo has the greatest problem of congestion.</P>
      <P>I was quoting figures.  They are not often the easiest thing to listen to and, generally speaking, they are not the nicest thing to talk about but they must be accepted because they are factual. In Mayo, 20,125 farmers depend for a living on farms of fewer than 30 acres.  I was about to give comparative figures for other counties.  In County Louth, 1,140 farmers live on less than 30 acres and for County Meath the number is 2,445.  I am quoting now from the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i></P>
      <P>In Offaly 1,138 farmers live on less than 30 acres.  For County Wexford the figure is 1,184.  Therefore, while statistics might not be interesting they confirm my belief that Mayo has the greatest land congestion problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In Mayo, a man living on one acre is a farmer but in County Meath a man living on ten acres is a labourer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have more interesting figures.  I shall now quote them on a valuation basis.  In County Mayo, no fewer than 2,152 farmers are trying to eke out a living on a farm of land of less than £2 valuation.  With a valuation between £2 and £4, the number of such people is 4,642.  On farms with valuations between £4 and £7 the number is 6,186 and between £7 and £10 the number is 4,556.  On farms with valuations between £10 and £15, the number is 5,132 and between £15 and £20 the number is 2,455.  I can see that the Minister for Local Government will give quite a lot of money in my constituency because those with valuations <Col N="363" /> under £25 will benefit most from the new housing grants.  In my constituency there are only 1,801 farmers with a valuation above £20.  These facts reveal that in County Mayo 12,970 farmers with a valuation of less than £10&mdash;and that includes the valuation on buildings and outhouses as well&mdash;depend for their living on those small congested farms.  Farmers with valuations under £15 number 16,062. Even though figures may not be the most interesting things to listen to or to speak about, those are the appalling facts.</P>
      <P>In speaking to the Estimate for Agriculture a few days ago, I said the Minister's speech indicated the red light.  At least there is some green light in this Bill.  Like all politicians, I reserve the right to criticise later any shortcomings in the Bill and I can foresee many shortcomings but there are many commendable points in it which impress me.  I believe these proposals have been brought to the House as a result of much careful consideration.  I do concede that the Minister and his officials stood shoulder to shoulder with the problem. I also believe that many people such as those who were members of the inter-Departmental Committee exposed the great hardships we experience in congested areas.  This Bill is a great tribute to all the politicians who have crossed the Shannon for the past 40 years, whether they be from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or any other Party.  I am sure many of our predecessors from the west of Ireland who spoke on this problem thought they were really talking to the wall and that there was no intention of doing anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is also a tribute to the Leader of my Party and in fact he should get personal pleasure out of its introduction.  While it does not include all the things he has been advocating for many years it goes a certain part of the way.  I have read and listened to his speeches and have listened to criticisms that have been made of his speeches, and he has never hesitated to speak for the small farmer.  While the Bill does not incorporate <Col N="364" /> all that would be in it if he were in office, there is an effort being made to do some of what he has been advocating.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision making loans available for those farmers who are prepared to give up their existing farms and go out into the open market and purchase farms of their own choice.  Our Party have been advocating all along that it is essential that such loans be made available to farmers.  However, the figures available show that the incomes from many farms are so small that the farmers are not able to bear excessive loan charges.  While the Minister says he will make loans available to small farmers to purchase additional farms, he has not indicated what the interest charges will be.  I would ask him to convenience the House and the public by making this information available when replying to the debate.  Again I appeal to the Minister to be reluctant to impose loan charges which are not within the reach of the people who will be borrowing this money.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's intention to make available to farmers and farmers' wives who have become old the possibility of an annuity on giving up their farms.  It can often happen that old people who have no direct descendant, such as a son or a daughter, might be hesitant to pass over the farm to a cousin or some other relative because of their not being quite sure that the person to whom they pass it on will be nice to them and give them the security for which they have been looking.  The Minister has done a good job in offering this added attraction to old people to give up their land.  In the process, he is carrying out a dual responsibility for which I would like to give him credit: first, he is encouraging the old people to give up their land and, secondly, he is bringing in the younger generation who are in a better position to maintain the land.</P>
    <P>I would like to commend the proposal in the Bill to halve the annuities on Land Commission farms that have been passed over to people who give up their own holdings or take over holdings in congested areas.  The Minister <Col N="365" /> will recall areas to which I want to refer where this problem exists, near the town of Ballina where lands have been acquired and given out to tenants; there are also estates near Killala and Crossmolina.  The big problem here is that where there is a holding which has had new outoffices built, the Department of Local Government, in the main, through the county council, put an exorbitant valuation on these places because they are all new houses. I found that in one Land Commission holding of 30 acres, with the annuity added, it was carrying overheads of anything from £60 to £100 per annum before anything was produced on it. I am glad the Minister and his officials have given serious consideration to this problem and I want to commend him for the alleviation he has made in this regard.</P>
    <P>As an auctioneer, I have considerable experience of people's mentality in relation to the issue of Land Bonds as a consideration for the sale of land when the Land Commission are purchasers.  People have been thinking that Land Bonds do not give them the real money value for their land.  Of course that is not true but they have had the feeling that they do not get £100 value for £100 worth of land, that they do not get pound for pound.  Reading the Official Report, I was pleased to note that a Deputy on the opposite side pointed out that not only was that not so, but that in fact Land Bonds give them £102 for every £100.  It is hard to convince people that such is the case and I do wish to compliment Deputies and others who have endeavoured to do so.  I hope the Minister will touch on that aspect when replying.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty which section 27 of this Bill should remedy is the delay between the time somebody offers a holding to the Land Commission and the time the sale is finalised.  First of all, the local inspector hears representations from perhaps a local Deputy or other interested person in the area. There is then a delay in sending particulars of the holding to Dublin and again before an inspector comes down to examine the land.  Very often it takes two years from the time the <Col N="366" /> offer is made until the sale is finalised. The Minister now proposes to appoint four senior inspectors, one for each region, and I feel sure this will help to eliminate these long delays and expedite acquisition of holdings.</P>
    <P>That is my general attitude to this Bill.  In the two years I have been in the House, this is the most attractive piece of legislation that has come before us and I offer to all concerned my most sincere congratulations.  I certainly shall do everything in my power to encourage my constituents to co-operate with the Department in helping to operate it.  If the measure is not operated to the full, I shall, of course, be critical later on.  I have no great reason to be critical at the moment because, as the Minister says, a start must be made somewhere and we can work from there.  The provision of 40 to 45 acre farms may be a big target but it is not impossible of achievement.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will pull me up in what I am about to say, but I should like, if I get the opportunity, to call the attention of the House to the fact that this Bill will be a failure if the Minister is not assured of the full co-operation of the Department of Agriculture.  That is one Department which is not fulfilling its obligations to the congested areas.  To-day when I came in, I found in an envelope a report from the ICMSA on the prospects of expanding the Irish economy.  I have not had time to persue it fully, but from a quick look through it, one statement, by Mr. Crotty, struck me as being of great significance.  He says, in relation to the different sectors of our economy:</P>
    <P>It is clear that agriculture is the one which lags...</P>
    <P>That is a complete exposure of the lack of co-operation from that Department to which I have been referring. The report continues that there could not be any question of an expanding Irish economy while there was a lag in agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I begin my remarks on this Bill, I should be obliged if the Minister would give me the figures for the number of holdings which, in the opinion of the Land Commission, need rearrangement, improvement and so on, if he has got the figures handy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got them readily available, but I will have them looked up for the Deputy.  Did he say the number of unsold holdings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of unvested holdings still earmarked for improvement.  I am sure the Minister has that information somewhere.  Such figures will give us a clear picture of the size of the problem we have to tackle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 9,000 unvested holdings, mainly in the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that figure roughly means the number of holdings that yet require something to be done to them before vesting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect so, in most cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so bad because we can go to the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> and find a huge number of <Col N="368" /> holdings, but from my experience in the Land Commission, that number could be very misleading.  I think the way the statistics people got these figures is from the number of receivable orders of the Land Commission. That means additions and so on, and most of us from the western counties are well aware that many farmers may have half-a-dozen receivable orders.  I have heard of one man who had 21 receivable orders and could almost keep a postman going at the annuity period.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies seemed to welcome this Bill.  Looking at it, trying to digest it and see what is behind it, the only conclusion I could come to is that it is a cross between Deasy's Act of 1860 and my own Act of 1950.  I hope I am wrong but I fear the hybrid, which this Bill is, has all the bad points of both Acts and very few of the good ones. What made the Minister introduce a section in the Bill prohibiting the letting of land, something never sought by the Land Commission before?  For the past 30 years, Fianna Fáil were busily engaged in chasing the people, particularly the young people, off the land over to England.  Now that holdings are deserted since these people are driven out and now that the father and mother are too old to change their means of living and go to England themselves and also too old to work the land, it becomes a crime, according to the Minister, to let that land.</P>
      <P>What else would they do with it? What was all the fight for from Michael Davitt's time to get ownership of the land if we do not have a little control over it?  It should not be labelled as a crime under this section to live on a holding and not be able to work it and it should not be the occasion for the Government to grab it and turn people out of house and home.  Does the Minister know what is in this section in which he prohibits the letting of land?  I do not mind a prohibition on subdivision which is a different matter.  The Minister rather slipped over this section when introducing the Bill.  I think it is a desperate provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be only a small thing but I <Col N="369" /> have in mind several cases it would hit.  We had a very tragic case recently in my area.  I do not know the circumstances of the family concerned.  A young man was electrocuted, the father of nine children, of whom the eldest was only 13½.  These are neighbours. I hope the widow and family are well enough off to continue stocking the holding and running it to the best advantage, as the breadwinner himself did up to his death.  Now if the widow is not able to work the land while saddled with the rearing of nine children, she must go on her knees to beg leave to let the holding.  I suppose she will be criminal No.  1 in the locality if she lets that land.</P>
    <P>There is a second type of case, where the youngsters as well as the father and mother have been waiting year after weary year for the Land Commission to increase the size of the holding but it never happens and eventually they have to go to England. The old people are unable to work. The youngsters send back remittances, part of the £16 million emigrants remittances that come in every year. The old couple have no option but to let the land.  As far as I can see, that land is producing just as much as, or very little less than, it would otherwise produce because the farmer still owns it, is living on it and will not allow it to be abused.</P>
    <P>People stand up here, not one of whom so far as I know, owns a perch of land, and tell us what should be done with farmers, how they should run their holdings and try to paint a picture of farmers as a type of criminal out to undermine the economy of the State.  These are people who took care to have nothing to do with land themselves. When I hear a Deputy who owns and works land speaking, I have the greatest respect for his experience, but when other Deputies who have sought from childhood other means of livelihood and would not be seen dead on a farm say that farmers who sublet land are this, that and the other and that people who let the land and go to England are another type of criminal, it feeds me up, particularly when I hear it from people who should know better.  Deputies might have the <Col N="370" /> decency not to stand up unless they know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>There are some good points in this Bill and I shall do my best, as far as I can, to help the Land Commission to implement them.  The principal innovation is the cash grant and allowing the old couple to live on the land, if they so desire.  I hope this will not be used as the thin end of the wedge for wholesale compulsory acquisition and as a means of dumping these people into the local town later on with some other Minister banishing them from the land.</P>
    <P>The man who has lived all his life on a holding has put a great deal of his personality into improvements, drainage, fencing, liming, fertilising, improvement of outoffices and of access to fields.  He takes great pride in it and it is his death sentence when the State comes along like a huge steamroller and crushes him out of his holding.  In no other livelihood or profession does a person become so wrapped up in his property.  While every inducement should be offered to the small farmer to sell his holding, compulsion should be used most carefully.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing a section to take over to himself one of the excepted matters under section 12 of the 1950 Act which I think was set out in the 1933 Act in section 6, that is section 27 which states:</P>
    <P>For the removal of doubt, it is hereby declared that the determination of the land to be inspected under subsection (6) of section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, as amended by this Act, is not an excepted matter for the purposes of section 12 of the Land Act, 1950;</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell us why he wants that power, or what good it will do him, or in what way it will expedite acquisition or the relief of congestion? Does he know, from a purely political point of view, what he has landed himself with by taking on that power, or has he done it deliberately?  I do not know the answers to these questions but I know the House should have them.  For the first time, the Minister is now taking on himself the power to send, without reference to the Lay <Col N="371" /> Commissioners, a divisional inspector on to anyone's land if he sees fit to do so.  Everyone knows the terror created in the heart of anyone who is a land owner when he hears that a Land Commission inspector has walked his land.  That was not the case when the function was being exercised by the Commissioners, who, whatever their faults may have been, were very strict, impartial and fair in the administration of the functions which this House placed upon them in the various Land Acts introduced by both foreign and home Governments.</P>
    <P>Now any Fianna Fáil group sitting around the fireside can decide that one of their neighbours is to be liquidated. They can say; &ldquo;We will tell Mr. Moran.  We will get him to send an inspector on to that land&rdquo;.  It is not much good to that man to know that the inspector's report has to go for final consideration to the Commissioners. The very fact that a political head can order an official of his Department on to another man's property is an outrage of a type that would not be found in any country this side of Russia.  I cannot help turning my mind back to the time when the 1950 Act was going through this House and remembering how vocal the Minister was and how determined he was about two things: the excepted matters and the purchase of land for cash.  The end of the world was to come when the 1950 Act became law because the Land Commission were being given power to purchase land for cash.</P>
    <P>It must be pretty clear to him that I safeguarded first the Land Commission and secondly, the owners of land, and that that has been lived up to and adhered to ever since.  The Minister is doing a desperate thing when he takes on himself the right to prohibit the letting of land.  I do not care what legal definition is placed on the word &ldquo;letting&rdquo;.  We have only one meaning for it in the west.  If we are not able to stock the land ourselves it is a desperate thing to take from us the right to let the land, for the time being until we overcome a period of difficulty, to a neighbour who will pay <Col N="372" /> us perhaps as much as we would make in profit from the land.  I could never see anything very wrong with letting land.  Members of this House, solicitors, schoolteachers and others, are very vocal about the letting of land but the man who pays conacre will produce as much off the land, in all probability, as would the owner.  The only thing about it is that neither the owner nor the conacre man may fertilise the land as much during the period of conacre letting.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 27, the Minister is extremely foolish to take one of the excepted matters on to himself.  It is an excepted matter whether the Minister likes it or not and I do not care what he may say when replying.  There are other excepted matters and I would not care if they went overboard during the night but the two big things are the determination of the lands to be acquired and the determination of those to whom the lands will be allotted.  These two should be sacrosanct. The Minister is knocking down the barrier around the first of these when he takes to himself power to send a divisional inspector on to the land.</P>
    <P>I would object just as strongly if the Minister took power to send one of the Commissioners personally on to the land.  That should be purely an executive function and the Lay Commissioners and the political head of the Department should have nothing to do with it, both for the Minister's good and the good of the country.  It is the first time that a crowbar has been levered under the foundation stone of fixity of tenure in this country.  There are a few excellent sections in this Bill and it is a pity that it should be marred so grievously by these two other sections.</P>
    <P>Everything in this measure designed to relieve congestion will receive my wholehearted support.  After 20 years in this House, there is no need for me to re-affirm that, but it is no harm for me to say so.  The same applies to any other measure which the Minister brings in to relieve congestion.  There is very little that will help the Commissioners, the inspectors or the Minister in relieving congestion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> A good deal has been said about the purchase of land by foreigners. Personally I have not been alarmed by the amount of land purchased up to the present; nevertheless I cannot help feeling that the time has come when something much more definite will have to be done about the matter.  Personally, and I say this for what it is worth, I cannot see what is wrong with denying foreigners the right to purchase farmland, and I could never see anything wrong with it.  When I was Minister, I met with fierce opposition in that regard.  If a prohibition or embargo were placed on the purchase of land by outsiders, I would be the first to support it and I cannot see what is wrong with such a move.  The statistics are there, published by the Statistics Office, for everyone to see and there is little enough land in the country for our own flesh and blood. I do not think foreigners would take umbrage if they were told: &ldquo;Ireland is very land-hungry, and there is little enough land for our own people.  We have nothing against you&mdash;we like you and we are very friendly with you and your Governments&mdash;but it would be like stealing bread from children to take land from us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The time has come for additional measures to those taken in the past to discourage the purchase of land by foreigners&mdash;the 25 per cent duty and, later, the keeping of a register.  I do not know what good the keeping of a list of names in the Land Commission will do.  I should like some more positive action.  The keeping of a register may be a useful statistical exercise giving information as to how many foreigners have bought land, but it will not stop one outsider from buying land.</P>
    <P>Another argument is that some of our own people have acquired the nationality of the country in which they have been living and would, therefore, be classified as foreigners. That difficulty could be surmounted very easily.  There should be no trouble in saying that a person who was born here, and whose parents lived here, who has taken out citizenship of another country, will be allowed to purchase land in the same way as if <Col N="374" /> he had never left the country or taken out citizenship elsewhere.  Remembering the list published by Macra na Feirme, and it has not been denied, showing lands purchased by foreigners, particularly in the midlands and in the Minister's and my county, I think it is time we sat up and took notice.  The figure has not reached alarming proportions when one remembers the total acreage but it has attained a size that should give us pause.  Steps should be taken and these steps need not cause any friction or difficulty with foreign Governments or their nationals.  The longer the present position is allowed to continue, the more difficult it will be ultimately to right the wrong.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of this whole measure is deciding what is an economic holding.  An economic holding has never been defined except in the loosest terms.  During the 12 to 18 months in which the Minister was trying to hatch this Bill, I was hoping that he would bring forward a proposal to give the Land Commission powers to enable them to speed up the relief of congestion.  I was also hoping that those parts of the Department of Agriculture and Local Government more germane really to administration by the Land Commission would be taken over by the Land Commission.  The time has come when the mere giving out of land is no help in stemming the flight from the land.  Whole families are now turning their backs on the 40 acres about which the Minister has talked so much.  As far back as 1951, under my direction, the Land Commission were giving 40 and 45 acres to migrants in the midlands; they were to get 33 acres of good land, or its equivalent.  In most cases the acreage was 40, 45 or 47 acres.</P>
    <P>It is time the Land Commission took over the functions of the Department of Agriculture in regard to the production of food and also in regard to the cost of producing that food.  That part of Local Government which deals with rating on agricultural land should also be brought within the scope of the Land Commission.  I have studied the problem deeply.  I have talked to hundreds who have left the land.  I know I speak truth when I say that the flight <Col N="375" /> from the land is occasioned not so much by the size of the holding as by the fact that no holding up to 100 acres pays any more.  Suppose the Minister had all the ranches of the mid-United States and started to carve them up, like a sheet of postage stamps, into 40 or 45 acre holdings, with conditions as they are at present in relation to agricultural produce, plus the cost of overheads, people would be flying from these holdings in four, five or ten years' time just as quickly as they are flying from small holdings today.</P>
    <P>This Bill falls far short of what is really needed.  I should like to quote here what Most Rev. Dr. Fergus had to say on 15th June last at a meeting at Charlestown.  That meeting was composed of farmers from all over the west; there were three or four bishops present and several priests, including Fr. McDyer, who has done such trojan work and who has virtually brought about a revolution in his part of Donegal:</P>
    <P>It is here that the importance of this meeting comes in.  The meeting has a plan for small holdings which has been tried and tested, under the auspices of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, at Glencolumbcille, in Co. Donegal.  Father McDyer, to whom the project owes so much, is here this evening to tell us of its success. What is asked is that facilities be provided for the establishment of similar projects all over the west.</P>
    <P>Two things are necessary for success, first the provision of an adequate subsidy and, second, the co-operation of the small holders themselves.  This very representative meeting is a guarantee that the necessary co-operation will be forthcoming. The initiative in the case comes from the people concerned. It is something that should be welcomed by any Government.</P>
    <P>A certain amount has already been done for the west in the way of setting up industries and making grants to farmers, and this should be duly acknowledged.  But it is not enough.  What is needed for the west is an enlightened agricultural <Col N="376" /> policy vigorously pursued.  The only suggestion made so far in this connection is to increase the size of holdings, which, of course, cannot be done unless many more of the small holders leave.  I have no confidence whatever in a policy of this kind, and I hope it will never be implemented.  It is based on the faulty assumption that the mere acreage of a holding is the sole test of economic sufficiency.  It also leaves out of account the human factor.  There is no guarantee whatsoever that men possessed of holdings of forty acres or more will be more conscious of their social responsibilities than they are at present.</P>
    <P>Most Rev. Dr. Fergus put the position very neatly.  It shows he knows intimately how the small farmer lives and also how he thinks.</P>
    <P>Deputies blame the Land Commission for slowness and so on, but the real reason for the flight from the land is the policy of successive Fianna Fáil Governments since 1932, Governments who have looked upon the agriculturist as a kind of donkey, there to work, to produce cheap food, cheap fuel, and provide taxation for every wildcat scheme in the head of every wildcat Minister.  The farmers are being taxed out of existence.  Down through the years, they have got absolutely no assistance.  This is not the appropriate occasion on which to deal with agricultural grants but I should like to point out that the grants given are only a quarter or one-fifth of what farmers in Northern Ireland get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume I will be allowed to deal with agricultural grants when I come to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely mention that by way of example, to show how the farmers are treated.  They get little or no subsidy.  They get little help towards the cost of fertilisers.  The help the inter-Party Government provided towards the cost of ground limestone was taken away virtually completely by the subsequent Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of living affects farmers. <Col N="377" /> When a holding becomes vacant, we are inclined to lay the blame on 24 Upper Merrion Street, but they are not the cause of the trouble at all. It is economic factors outside the scope of the Land Commission that cause the trouble.  I would welcome the Department of Lands taking over all aspects of agriculture affecting the production of food on the land and the costs of production.  Until that day comes, it is not much use blaming the Land Commission for something for which they have no responsibility.</P>
    <P>The third volume of the 1961 Census of Population has been published. From that we see that in 1951, 509,324 people followed agricultural occupations. In 1961, this had fallen to 392,000.  The number of farmers decreased from 235,000 to 210,000.  These figures must make it plain to everybody what is wrong: that living on the land does not pay any more. That is why people are clearing off it.  The Land Commission have been blamed for this and that.  I am not standing up for them simply because I was Minister for Lands for so long. If they deserve blame, I would be the first to hand it out to them.  Really the blame is due to other Departments, plus the absolute carelessness of the Government in regard to our principal industry.</P>
    <P>I pity the Land Commission being saddled with the problem of trying to salvage something out of the wreckage. I could quote townland after townland where there has been a wholesale clearing out.  If the Land Commission go into these places in the morning, I do not know what they will do.  Not so many years ago, when I was going to the national school, I went to school with 18 other children out of one village of 13 houses.  Today there are only five children from one house going to school out of that whole village.  I want to tell Deputies from other parts of the country, who might not be familiar with conditions in the west, about village after village where only the old people are to be found in the houses.  The Land Commission have no business going into those places.  Suppose they take up the land, they have no one to give it to.  Deputy Burke, <Col N="378" /> who came from my county many years ago, knows whole townlands that remind one strongly of Goldsmith's village, the deserted village.  I could quote many villages where there are no marriages because all the young people have gone over to England and have settled down there.  They just send sufficient money to keep the old folks going.  Perhaps some of them are hoping for the day when they can come back, put up new houses and out-offices and live on the land themselves. If they do, we will have to give them the same conditions and the same incentive to work and improve their land as they are getting at present from a foreign employer.  We have no business asking them to come home to slavery&mdash;to sink their capital in and work land they get either from their parents or the Land Commission only to find that after a few years they have to able out and start afresh when they are many years older.  What I am afraid of is that most of our farmers, particularly our small farmers, have become so despondent that it is nearly impossible to rouse them out of it.  Some of the younger farmers in the NFA and Macra na Feirme&mdash;and of course, Father McDyer in Donegal&mdash;are making manly efforts that command our admiration.  They are doing something for a new generation and they deserve every help and assistance.</P>
    <P>In Mayo we have 2,183 holdings of from one to five acres.  If the Minister wants to turn all those into 45 acre holdings, he would want over 7,000 acres.  To bring all the holdings in Connaught up to that standard would require 181,600 acres.  The same set of conditions exists in the other three Provinces.  I do not know who it was said that in other countries the small farmers can make a good living.  In Holland, Belgium, France and Germany they are making a very good living on much the same size of holding as we have here.  But there is this difference.  They have a Government that protects them, gives them a guaranteed market and takes good care that they are not overloaded with taxation to pay for madcap schemes in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I must admit that when I first went <Col N="379" /> into the Land Commission I thought that everything that had been said in this House for years was right&mdash;that the Land Commission were an out-of-date crowd determined not to do what they were expected to do.  But I found such was not the case.  I found they were being smothered because other Government Departments were not helping them out.  When the Land Commission give a farmer a decentsized holding to work on, it is the duty of other Departments to come to their assistance and at least to give them fair remuneration for their output.  But that did not happen.  The result was that, if holdings were rearranged and improved and if some of the tenant farmers left them after a short number of years, it was not the fault of the Land Commission but the fault of the Government, of this House and of other Government Departments, whose duty it is to protect the farmers in the same way as the Department of Industry and Commerce protect the industrialists.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Department of Agriculture are doing the best they can.  If we could lift the curtain and have a peep inside, I am sure we would find that the Government have had several suggestions from the Department of Agriculture on how to stop the flight from the land.  So far, however, they seem to be completely against it.  All I am saying could possibly be twisted to mean that I am opposed to industry. I am not.  I only wish we had a lot more of it.  At the very least, it would keep more of our young people at home.  However, our principal industry is agriculture.  We are allowing these people to vanish.  If the Minister takes up every vacant holding in the morning, his difficulty will be to find people to accept the land.</P>
    <P>One matter mentioned by a few Deputies was the fact that an official of the Land Commission is now a Lay Commissioner and that that is not correct. From my own knowledge of the Land Commission I do not mind that in the least.  The only aspect of this matter that might be objectionable is entirely for the person concerned.  If a person has two separate duties to <Col N="380" /> perform, it might mean he would be overworked and would not be able to give the same attention to each job as if he had only one.  But I cannot say that is wrong, and I am not alarmed by it.</P>
    <P>As far as the good parts of the Bill are concerned, I wish the Minister and his officials luck.  But there are at least two highly objectionable parts to which I referred earlier in my speech.  One is where the Minister is taking to himself the prevention of the letting of land.  I do not know who wants that. I do not know who suggested that to him, whether it was a draftsman or not, but it is highly objectionable and it is most impertinent to interfere in a private person's business to that extent. The second matter that is extremely wrong is the taking on of something that all down the years has been regarded by the Commissioners as a purely judicial matter.</P>
    <P>A third matter which is not so serious is the complete revision of the section of the 1933 Act which relates to the redemption of land annuities.  I wonder if a person in these circumstances is entitled to an allotment of land at all?  If he is well enough off to pay the double annuity, which is what it amounts to now, is he suitable for the allotment of land in view of the scarcity of land for the relief of congestion? In a few rare cases there may be the heel of an estate that nobody wants to take.  If some local person is willing to take that I could understand the point of asking him to pay the full annuity.  If that is the type of case envisaged in this section I will say no more about it but if it is going to be an all round thing I would ask the Minister to think twice as to whether it was wise to give land at all to a person who is well off enough to pay the full annuity.</P>
    <P>When we come to deal with the Committee Stage of the Bill, I will ask the Minister to withdraw Section 27.  I do not know what he wants of it but I will hear what he has to say in justification of bringing it in at all.  I think it is foolish in the first place and, secondly, I think he is placing dynamite at the foundation of fixity of tenure in doing so.  Fixity of tenure is <Col N="381" /> the rock on which rests the whole ownership of land and it has rested firmly on that rock because the power to take over land has been always in the hands of professional men.</P>
    <P>These officials have discharged their duty honourably and well having regard to the long history of land troubles we have had in this country. Whatever else we may think of them from that point of view they deserve our highest admiration.  The Minister is doing a very dangerous thing in introducing that section.  He certainly got no advice from his Department for it because I am sure that he did not get the backing of one single official in the Department, from the office boy to the Commissioners.  For the people in the Land Commission, whatever their faults may be, the safeguarding of security of tenure was one of the things held highest.  That was so when I was in the Department and I am sure they have not changed since then.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to say about sub-division, even though I am not happy about the taking away of the rights that existed where land was purchased under the pre-1923 Acts.  Farmers who were vested in estates purchased before 1923 could sub-divide their farms. Efforts were made to make me bring in that section but I refused to take away the right given to these farmers by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and maintained by successive Fianna Fáil Governments.  I object to its being removed now.  Would the Minister tell us how many uneconomic holdings were created by the sub-division of pre-1923 Act farms?  I do not believe there were two in the whole country.</P>
    <P>The right to sub-divide was there but it was never availed of.  It was useful in the case of a farmer who wanted to sell a building site of some square roods.  Of course, he would have to go through all the trouble of getting a map of his holding and then waiting in the queue before permission was granted but permission was always granted.  The principal reason for the prohibition on sub-division was that farmers would not re-create congestion all over again.  How many holdings have been split by reason of the <Col N="382" /> fact that the section which the Minister is bringing in now was not previously in existence?  I never knew of one in my years in the Department.</P>
    <P>Most of the farmers knew that if they wished to sub-divide their land, they had the right to do it but none of them did it for the reason that the need did not arise.  I could understand a big farmer with 100 or 200 acres of land sub-dividing it between two or three of his sons but in our circumstances in the west of Ireland, this occasion did not arise.</P>
    <P>The cheekiest section in this Bill and the most undeserved insult to the farmers is the prohibition on the letting of land.  The Minister may tell us that, in law, letting means something else but, to my mind, letting means that where a person is no longer able to run the holding, he lets it to a neighbour who takes as much care of it and gets as much produce off it as the owner did.  Where land is let in conacre, it may not get the same amount of fertiliser as it would get when used by the owner but all the land that I know which is sub-let is producing as much under the letting as it was when worked the other way.</P>
    <P>The good parts of the Bill I welcome but it reminds me of a poisoned chocolate.  It is a chocolate-coated piece of poison.  The poison is in the section I have referred to, section 27, and the section that proposes to revise the halving of the annuities under the 1933 Act.  The light chocolate coating is the section which deals with the voluntary taking over by the Land Commission of a holding on the annuity basis.  That is a good point but it is being used to disguise a poison. I was going to say that the Bill was like the curate's egg, good in spots, but that does not describe it.  It is more like chocolate-coated poison.</P>

      <P>If I had come into this House only recently and had been told that Deputy Blowick had been a Minister for Lands at one time I would have been inclined to expect a constructive speech from him but, having listened to him on many occasions, I find that his speeches are made up of the same old cry, that everything Fianna Fáil did was bad and everything that he and the Coalition Government did was good. Of course, the people are tired listening to that same old record now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is not true.  Deputy Blowick mentioned his Bill and told us what it would protect but we in the House and everyone outside it know perfectly well that what it protected and what it was designed to protect was the Exchequer at that time and, in effect, as much as was possible by legislation in this House, to prevent land division.  We have been urging the Minister here for years to make the necessary changes so that that situation could be overcome and I am glad to see that he has now brought in a Bill which will be of very considerable help.</P>
      <P>I shall refer later to the remarks made by Deputy Blowick with regard to letting.  He has not read the Bill properly or has not listened to the Minister or has not read the Minister's speech.  Otherwise, he would not have made the speech he has made in relation to letting in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House is designed fundamentally to improve the use being made of the land of Ireland and thereby raise the standard of living of persons engaged in agriculture and, as this is impossible to attain while there is rather widespread congestion and so many uneconomic holdings, it follows that this Bill must deal with these problems and endeavour to effect their solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> The problems facing any Minister in this matter are very great and, to a very considerable extent, down through the years have defied solution, despite the efforts of various Ministers and the Department.  It is heartening, therefore, to find the present Minister endeavouring to make a new approach to this whole question, I would say, a radical approach, which, because of its nature, will not get 100 per cent approval from everybody but which, nevertheless, will in the long run improve the position with regard to congestion and uneconomic landholders.</P>
    <P>The Minister has laid down a figure of 40 to 45 acres for an economic farm.  For this he has also been criticised by Deputy Blowick.  I would suggest to Deputy Blowick that the Minister has laid down this figure, not necessarily from choice, but taking practical considerations into account, such as the fact that there is only a certain amount of land available for distribution.  It is an extremely difficult thing to define an economic holding for the very obvious reason that there are so many factors involved, for example, the quality of the land and, perhaps most important, the quality of the individual farmer.  What would be an economic holding to one might not be an economic holding to another.</P>
    <P>To help to provide the land necessary for the changes visualised by the Minister in his Bill, he intends taking power to move in on vacant and under productive farms, where necessary, to control letting of land and, in some instances, the sale of land and, finally, to induce aged persons having no dependants and incapacitated persons who are unable to continue to work their farms, to accept an annuity and to hand their lands over to the Land Commission.  These are understandable changes.  We are all aware of the damage done by absenteeism and the evils of short-term letting.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention at this point what Deputy Blowick said regarding letting.  He referred to the widow who was left with a small farm and nine children and who must of necessity let her farm.  He also referred to people temporarily in financial difficulty who would have to let their lands and he <Col N="385" /> said their lands would be taken from them.  If I understood the Minister aright, he does not intend to move in simply because of letting, as such, but rather on the basis of vacancy.  This would allow him to discriminate and to protect people who need protection.</P>
    <P>I found particularly gratifying the section in which the Minister takes power to grant an annuity to old persons without dependants and to persons who are incapacitated and unable to farm their lands where they are agreeable to hand up their lands to the Land Commission for division or allocation to others.  There will be many people who will be interested in this section and who will be anxious to hand up their lands in return for an annuity because it is more than likely that the return they receive by way of annuity will be very much better than the return they get from letting the land.</P>
    <P>Despite the complaints one hears about the high price paid for conacre, it is the general experience that the letting of land gives a very poor return having regard to the various factors which are involved, such as the expenses attaching to the letting of land and the fact that the land has to be kept in reasonable condition.  For that reason, a number of people will be anxious to make this change.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the proposal is that it will relieve old persons of the responsibility of the farm at an age when they would prefer not to have responsibility.  While they have the land, they have the responsibility of having it let and of looking after it, of seeing that it is re-seeded, fenced and kept in proper order.  This in itself represents a problem for aged persons.  I feel that they would be glad to get rid of this responsibility while at the same time getting a worthwhile cash return.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister for the fact that he has taken the humane view and will allow these people to retain ownership of their homes and of a few acres of land around the house.  Aged persons like to remain in the area in which they have been in the habit of living, where they have their friends.  They dislike <Col N="386" /> transferring to areas in which they would be strangers.  The provision in the Bill dealing with that matter, even more, perhaps, than the annuity, will help these people to make up their minds to hand over the lands to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I am gratified by the provision that a farmer can move from a congested area and buy a farm in an uncongested area, with the aid of a loan as well as the money paid for his own farm.  This is an excellent idea, and apart from the fact that it will help to relieve congestion, in my view, it is only the more efficient and energetic young farmers who will take advantage of this provision and therefore when they buy a farm, we can always be assured it will be efficiently run and will be an improvement not only for the young man concerned but will also help very considerably the economy of the country generally. The very fact that the young man will buy this farm with the help of a loan, as well as the money he will get for his own farm, will give him an added interest in his holding. He will feel he has worked for and earned the farm and I feel he will be all the better for it and that the country generally will be all the better for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that some areas in North Leinster could be classified as congested and that he intends to make Ministerial orders in relation to some of these areas when the Bill is passed.  Despite the figure given by Deputy Browne, in various areas of County Louth, there is a congestion problem.  It is an intensive tillage county.  There are a very considerable number of small farmers there.  I feel that in the sections which are congested because the land is worked so intensively, every square inch of it is needed and the only opportunity a young man would have of providing himself with a farm would be to avail of the loan the Minister mentioned.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, the Land Commission itself has been responsible for a certain amount of congestion.  I have in mind a small area where there are about 20 farmers with farms of from 14 to 17 acres.  Years ago, these farms <Col N="387" /> were given to them by the Land Commission. It is possible that because the low standard of living at the time this land was divided was such that a farm of from 14 to 17 acres was regarded as economic.  That is not the position today and it is particularly obvious in a constituency such as mine where there has been such a very rapid advance in the development of industry.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, many people who are now working in factories in the rural part of Louth are getting relatively good wages.  The comparison is very striking between what they earn and what the farmer on 14 to 17 acres is earning.  As everything in this life is relative, it is obvious that it will be necessary to help these people improve the size of their holdings.  It is obvious that the farmers I am speaking about would be inclined to leave the land and to go into industry where possible. We do not want that to happen.  These are highly-skilled men who are vitally necessary to the country as farmers because agriculture is the basis of our economy.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister has decided to control, to an extent, the selling of land.  It is a pity he was not able to do something sooner in this connection.  When it was first suggested that the Minister would take certain control in relation to a continuous letting of land, people in my constituency who owned land which was being constantly let threw it on the market and sold it.  That had a very serious effect on the small farmers in the areas in which this land was situated who had been taking conacre on these farms for years.  Their position was made much worse than it had been.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, an intensive tillage area, where a person has been in the habit of taking a field or two fields and then loses it for any reason, it is impossible for him to get alternative land because all his neighbours are doing the same thing.  Prior to this, in an area which I have in mind, the small farmers were in the habit of taking land in a number of farms which had been let for years.  They <Col N="388" /> came to be completely dependent on it and built their whole economy on it.  They reared their families on the basis that this would always be available to them.  When the land was thrown on the market, some of the people who bought it, were the very people who were constantly being reported in the newspapers as crying out on behalf of the unfortunate small farmer and pointing out how difficult he finds it to live.  These are the people who shed the crocodile tears but when the land came on the market which would have helped make the small farmer economic if he had been allowed to purchase it, they are the very people who made absolutely certain that the small farmer would not get one sod of it.</P>
    <P>At present, the rule is that where land of any description is being divided, some of it is given to the uneconomic holders in the area but they must be within a limit of one mile from the estate.  Up to the present, that was reasonable enough.  However some small farmers in my constituency take land which is perhaps 1½ miles or 2 miles from their farms; they have been doing this for years.  It would be a very severe hardship on them if land were taken by the Land Commission for division and given to people within a radius of one mile of the estate and if there are not sufficient people within that category to give it to allottees from outside thereby leaving the people who had been taking the land without this land.  It would have exactly the same effect as the position in relation to the land I mentioned earlier which had been bought up when this Bill was mooted.  I feel the mile limit should be changed.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Minister to try to make as many economic farms as possible.  Once they are made, there will be no permission to break down the farms again.  I should like to know if he has considered the opposite point that is, when these farms are allotted, if the allottees, after a number of years when they are vested, decide to sell them, it could happen that one person might buy four, five or six of these farms.  That would also frustrate the achieving of the objectives in the <Col N="389" /> Bill.  I expect, however, that the fact that the Minister has power to go in and prevent the sale of a farm at any time he should so wish will prevent this from happening.</P>
    <P>We are concerned on this side of the House to keep as many people as we can in rural Ireland.  However, it is only right to say that these people should not be asked to stay on the land unless they can make a decent living from it.  It is only natural that if we divide up all the land into 45 or 50-acre holdings, there will be fewer people on the land than there are at present, but if we take this Bill in conjunction with the development of rural industry, we can see the possibility of success in keeping the people in rural Ireland.  I have a good knowledge of what the position is where it is possible to have industries established in rural areas.  In my own district, there is a very large number of people from the surrounding parishes employed in an industry in rural Louth.  When they feel like getting married, they build their houses in rural Louth and they are able to remain in the rural areas and are content to remain there because they are making a decent living.  When a farmer has a number of sons, he can give the farm, generally speaking, only to one son.  It should be our aim, and it is our aim on this side of the House, to ensure that the other sons can remain at home and in rural Ireland if possible and there is a perfect example in my own constituency of how that can be done.</P>
    <P>We in this Party are endeavouring to give our people in rural Ireland a decent living and thereby keeping our people there by giving subsidies on lime and fertilisers so as to increase the production on the land.  We are doing it through the Bill now before the House which is endeavouring to create economic holdings and we are doing it by providing as many factories as possible in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Once again, I would like to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill.  He need not expect to get one hundred per cent support for it, but it is, in my estimation, an excellent Bill and will go a considerable <Col N="390" /> distance in achieving its objectives.  I feel sure the new and enlightened approach of the Minister has a resonable hope of success in overcoming this great problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Representing as I do one of the western constituencies, I feel I should make some remarks on this Bill.  There are some sections in it I think very good and some sections about which I am not too happy.  The decision to increase the acreage of economic holdings to 40-45 acres is a good one because there is a large number of uneconomic farmers in the west of Ireland, in my constituency alone.  The only way this can be achieved is to migrate a considerable number of them to the midlands and the eastern seaboard.  This will take time and certainly will not cure the problem overnight.  Doing that will create another problem.  It will depopulate still further the western area.  That is not a good thing but at least those who are left behind will be a little better off.</P>
      <P>About a year ago when the Minister first mooted this idea of 40-45 acre farms, he made the announcement, I think, at a dinner somewhere in Mayo.  Like most important Government announcements that come from after-dinner speeches, it got headlines in the morning Press and nobody was quite sure what exactly the position was.  In this case it was very wrong because it created innumerable difficulties.  People were not quite sure what was going to happen and some farmers who felt they could not manage their own farms and thought they might be virtually confiscated, rushed to the auctioneers and offered their farms for sale thereby disposing of a large proportion of land that, had the people got time to consider, they might have offered to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another instance of the trouble the Minister's speech created was in regard to one estate beside Loughrea&mdash;Deputy Carty referred to it here before&mdash;which the Land Commission was in the process of dividing.  Naturally every small farmer in that area felt: &ldquo;Here is my chance.  Now I am going to get 40 <Col N="391" /> acres of land.&rdquo;  And knowing it was the last large tract of land in that area, their hopes were very high.  The Land Commission officials whose instructions were, I suppose, to continue as before, allotted seven, ten or 15 acres to these farmers.  The result was chaos.  Farmers who were allotted these small portions felt they were victimised in view of the Minister's speech and the Land Commission officials had great difficulty in trying to get them to accept these allocations.  The unfortunate Deputies who represent the area had more problems to solve and, goodness knows, we have enough without the Minister adding to them.</P>
    <P>Another section in this Bill which I regard as a good one is the section that encourages old and incapacitated farmers to surrender their land to the Land Commission in exchange for annuities.  This is a good thing because it is the only way a considerable pool of land will become available to the Land Commission.  However, I warn the Minister that though it looks very good on paper, if will require a considerable amount of encouragement and in some cases pressure on these farmers to surrender their lands.  This question of land goes back into Irish history.  It is a very troubled question in this country.  People think that ownership of land is a great thing and do not like surrendering land, no matter how old or incapacitated they are.</P>
    <P>There are some good provisions in this Bill.  There is a great deal of good in it in regard to the west of Ireland, but there are certain parts of it which are not so good.  For instance, I consider section 27 a very dangerous section. It gives for the first time to a Minister the right to a say in the acquisition and division of land.  It used to be said in a rather jocose fashion in North Galway that a certain Deputy divided all the land in the constituency with a poker on the kitchen floor.  If this section goes through, it may well be said of any Deputy in the Government Party, no matter what Party are in office, that he can divide the land of the constituency on the kitchen floor.</P>
    <P>I see also in the Bill some danger <Col N="392" /> to the personnel of the Land Commission. Heretofore the public have always been able to consider the Lay Commissioners as being completely free of politics, completely in an independent capacity.  Now this cannot be said to be so and I do not think it is a good thing.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 are not the best we could have got.  They do away with two of the three F's which we held in such esteem throughout the country for so many years.  These sections encroach too much on the rights of the individual.  One Deputy from my constituency advocated that the Minister should put a ceiling on the amount of land anybody could hold.  I know these Deputies were referring to large farms in the eastern part of my constituency where one family might hold a large tract of land, perhaps up to 1,000 acres.  The suggestion is that the Minister should be empowered to say that they should hold only X acres and that the remainder should be confiscated. That would be most unwise, in my opinion.  It would be a trend in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>The big failing in this Bill is the absence of provision to deal with the acquisition by foreigners of the good land in this country.  I know this does not sound logical in relation to my earlier statement on the rights of individuals, but then a woman is not expected to be logical always.  It may be said that the Minister would be interfering with a man's right to sell his land to whomever he wished, but if we are to have farms of from 40 to 45 acres, we must have some legislation to deal with the wholesale acquisition of land by foreigners, by non-nationals. It is the duty of everybody in the House to appeal to the patriotic instincts of our people to save this land for our own people.  It is a sad admission that something must be done to stop this sale of land to foreigners.  It is all very well to promise us another Bill later dealing with this problem.  I tell the Minister that something must be done immediately.</P>
    <P>Throughout last week I heard Deputies speak here, and I read their speeches in the Official Debates.  They laid all sorts of faults at the door of <Col N="393" /> the Land Commission.  I agree some of the criticism was well founded.  Most of the criticism was that the delay between the acquisition of land and its reallocation is far too long.  I hope the Minister will now tell us why that is so.  Perhaps it is because the Land Commission must recoup the money they spent on the purchase of the land. If that is so, it is a matter of Government policy and it is something the Minister can remedy.</P>
    <P>I have always had a soft spot for the Land Commission.  My grandfather was a Land Commission inspector and my father, as a member of the Government, had long dealings with the Land Commission.  I know many people who have given long, loyal service to the Land Commission and it riled me to hear statements such as that made by Deputy Leneghan and reported at column 166 of volume 206 of the Official Debates.  I hesitate to put the matter on record again by quoting what the Deputy said, but I feel the Deputy should be asked to withdraw his remarks, which were:</P>
    <P>It has often been alleged that if you were a tradesman and wanted a job from the Land Commission, you should not go looking for it with a hammer sticking out of your pocket, but that you should go to the inspector's wife with the head of a turkey sticking out from under your coat.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle then intervened and said:</P>
    <P>I do not think the Deputy should criticise officials in that way.  The Deputy is criticising people who have no opportunity of replying to him.  However, it is the same down in my part of the country.</P>
    <P>I think the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was wrong there.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear it.  It is a shocking thing that any Deputy should say these things.  If there are irregularities, and I have no doubt there are some, the Deputy knows what to do.  He should go to the Secretary of the Department concerned and lay his complaints at his door instead of getting up and flinging them across the floor of the House.  The only chance of success for this Bill is that the people will co-operate with the Land Commission by selling any land they do not want. If people are refusing to give this help to the Land Commission at the moment, it is because they have lost faith in the Land Commission and this loss of faith is largely due to statements of the kind I have just quoted. When people read such statements in the <i>Irish Press</i> or the <i>Irish Independent,</i> they say they are true.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully complained about the standard of independence enjoyed by the Land Commission.  It is true that when we write to the Land Commission, we often get a stereotyped reply which is useless later for circulation among constituents, but in the west we have solved that problem by writing to the divisional office.  I have always got prompt, courteous and explicit replies in that way.  It is the duty of every Deputy, and of everybody in influential positions, to encourage people to put their trust in the Land Commission, to accept the fact that the Land Commission are there to help them and not for the purpose of doing them out of their rights.  If we do not do that, we have no hope of ever attaining our aim of 40 to 45 acre farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a number of speakers.  Deputy Blowick criticised the Bill and many others could see very little good in it.  To my mind, the Minister has tackled the problems which this Bill seeks to solve in a most courageous manner.  Through the Bill, he is endeavouring to solve a problem which has existed since the State was founded.  While successive Bills have gone a bit of the way, the Minister in this Bill is trying to get to the hard core of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> Deputy Blowick said Fianna Fáil never did anything for the farmers except to squeeze them out.  What about the £40 million in subsidies to agriculture?  I do not propose to follow that line further except to say the problem we are dealing with now is the biggest in our history of native government and if the Minister succeeds, he will deserve to have a monument put up to him.  To eliminate the problem created by the old rundale system I have known since childhood would be well-nigh miraculous.  Unless the Minister takes proper powers to deal with it, he will find that certain contrary people who refuse to co-operate will defeat the object of the Bill.</P>
    <P>That has been one of our chief difficulties.  You might have ten farmers in a district who agree to a division but two would disagree, the result being that division is held up for years.  It is up to the State, therefore, to take authority into its hands and the Minister is wise in attempting to do just that in this Bill.  He should know the problems, representing an area where there is congestion.</P>
    <P>People have expressed fears of section 27.  I do not think there is any need for that because I know that the Minister, or any other Minister for Lands, will not interfere with people who have had, through economic circumstances, to let their land to tide them over a difficult period&mdash;it may be caused by sickness or death&mdash;until prosperity returns.  All the Minister has in mind is to deal with absentee owners who have large tracts of land continuously let, people who do nothing else, who have no other interest in their land except in its letting value.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt we have had here a serious problem because people have had to leave their land to go away to earn money.  Opposition Deputies have been saying it was only during Fianna Fáil administration that small farmers had to go away to make a living.</P>

      <P>This has been going on since I was born.  Farms have been so small that they were unable to maintain anybody unless the farmer went to the United States or to Australia to earn money and send it back to his wife.  The Minister now is trying to make farms economic and the only way of achieving this is through co-operation between farmers themselves. We have seen the fruits of this in the co-operative creamery movement where such great work has been done.</P>
      <P>I might say in this context that the old Congested Districts Board in the west of Ireland did a very good job in fostering such co-operation.  Their officials advised them and the members knew beforehand the difficulties with which they were faced and which they were able to eliminate by co-operation. This board was amalgamated in the Land Commission but I am afraid the same degree of co-operation has not been in existence.  What has been happening is that if people do not like John Murphy down the road, they will not co-operate and jobs will be held up.  A lot of the blame seems to lie with the Department of Agriculture. In my constituency, individual farmers have been paying up to £2,000 for machinery which would cater for five or six small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a problem which the Minister, the Department and previous Ministers have resisted.  I am dealing with the problem which we have in County Dublin.  We have here a large number of conacre farmers who lived on conacre alone.  For one reason or another, some of them have succeeded in buying a few acres.  Although some of them have succeeded in buying farms, a large number, on account of their overheads being so high, never seem to be able to get on their feet in order to buy a good farm of land. While a farm is divided and a number of the conacre farmers, as we call them, will have had land for donkey's years, under the present administration of the Land Commission and under present Government policy, they are <Col N="397" /> looked upon as landless men.  While we look upon these as landless men, will the Minister consider giving such conacre farmers a loan to buy a farm? I think it is mean that people who have proved themselves to be very good farmers should be thrown out on the road side.  We have that problem in County Dublin.  I have spoken on it on numerous occasions&mdash;the conacre farmer with a small bit of land and a cottage.</P>
    <P>Another matter that concerns us here is this idea that nobody will get an allocation of Land Commission land on any holding, to be divided in the future or which has been divided in the past, if he is over a mile away from that holding.  I believe when we had horses and donkeys on the road, that was wise, but now in the days of motor cars and lorries, it is an outmoded system.  It has outlived its usefulness completely and I feel the Minister should increase that distance to at least two miles, and that is only asking for another mile.  By so doing, it will bring people near a divided holding, or a holding that will have to be divided in future.  I know a number of conacre farmers in County Dublin who have to travel ten, 12, or 15 miles to try to eke out an existence and some of them pay £20 and £30 an acre for conacre.</P>
    <P>This is a problem.  While we may eliminate uneconomic holdings in one area, we will displace a number of agricultural workers and conacre farmers in another.  I feel the Minister should consider this on Report Stage. Perhaps he could consider doing something for the poor well-known conacre farmers who have been an asset to the country and who have been, to a large extent, excellent farmers.  He might be in a position to consider them even for a loan to buy land when, under the present policy, they are looked upon as landless men and not considered suitable applicants.</P>
    <P>Another thing we have in County Dublin is a number of very bad houses for farmers.  Some of them do not come under the scheme but the Minister for Local Government is dealing with the matter as best he can at the present time.  We have approached the Land Commission on this matter over the years.  The Dublin County Council <Col N="398" /> cannot house them because they are nobody's children.  We have a number of very bad mudwalled cottages in north County Dublin, and indeed in south County Dublin, owned by small farmers who are not in a position to get a loan.  This is one of our big problems. I have already discussed this with the Minister for Local Government on quite a number of occasions. I know the Minister for Lands has enough problems on hands without taking on the administration of Local Government and Agriculture, but I am merely pointing out to him what he should do here.  A good house is essential.  It is little use having 40 acres of land unless you have a good home to live in.  That is part and parcel of our way of life.  Anything the Minister can do in this Bill to see that the homes of our people are improved, and to give them at least a home of which they will be proud, will be an encouragement to achieve greater things.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as a courageous measure dealing with a very vexed problem.  The Minister, the Land Commission inspectors and the Commissioners and all concerned have a huge problem to cope with and, during the Minister's time of office, if he improves the position, he will have our backing.  We wish him luck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of Deputies who have spoken on this Bill is evidence of the fact that legislation for land division is more than necessary.  I suggest that the Minister should allow a considerable period between this Stage and the next so that he can fully consider the contributions made by different Deputies in regard to land legislation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept the fact that some things in the Bill are satisfactory, I must criticise it for several reasons. First, I believe it is a Bill that is more suited to the west and conditions there than to the country as a whole. Secondly, I criticise it because it has many notable omissions of things that must have come to the notice of the Minister and the officials of his Department.  The first things that is advantageous in it is giving the older people an opportunity of retiring <Col N="399" /> without uprooting them.  They may stay where they were born and reared and still have a means of livelihood, independent of the younger people who follow them on the estate.  They may also retain a certain portion of land to give them a continuing interest in the holding they have tended and to which they have probably devoted a greater part of their lives.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the structural alteration of land holdings to a level of 40 or 45 acres.  That is in keeping with overall European agricultural policy but I should like to draw his attention to this.  You can give a man 40 or 45 acres in Kildare or Meath and you can give him 45 acres in the west of Ireland or in the hills of Wicklow.  He still may not have an economic farm.  In a sense, it is a mistake to establish the size of farms by legislation.  Although it is a basic approach to the problem, we should not be too rigid in our outlook in this matter.  When you pass laws setting the size of farms at 40 or 45 acres, to a certain extent you tie the subsequent administration.  The Minister should have qualified that statement. It is a subject I have heard discussed in several countries.  It has been considered by FAO and other organisations dealing with lands but it has always been considered that it depends on where the land is and its condition.</P>
    <P>There are certain things in the Bill I do not like.  One of the good things about land legislation has been that the final arbiter in all things is a quasi-judicial body, the Land Commission. No matter how the Minister glosses it over&mdash;I read his speech&mdash;the fact remains that he is removing from that body the final say.  For the past 30 years, it was outside the function of the Minister to acquire or divide land. The purpose of that was to ensure that land acquisition and division would not be a political matter; that the best and most suitable people would get land. The new legislation seems to alter that and once more places in the hands of the Minister and his inspectors, who are his servants, the right to acquire land.  That is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> I believe the Commission have acted fairly in carrying out a difficult job, perhaps somewhat laboriously and rather slowly as is the way of all legal bodies, but at least they have done it in an unbiassed manner.  They have tried to meet conditions laid down for them and evaluate all the facts.  Whenever there is a question of uprooting people or taking land that appears to be suitable for division amongst small-holders in the area and where it would cause hardship to elderly people, the Commission have left these people there.  This Bill is an attempt to meet that problem of old people but there are other problems in which the Commissioners have shown great humanity and commonsense.</P>
    <P>It very often happens that a farm is in the position of one that I know in my constituency.  The farm may be owned by elderly persons and the land has been taken by farmers in the area over the years.  They have farmed it well, perhaps getting greater production than if it were divided.  The Commission were satisfied to leave that as it was because as a quasi-judicial body, they have the right to take an independent decision on the views placed before them as a judge does in court. It is a retrograde step to interfere with that function.  This is a point of view that may be argued strongly by the other side.  Whatever Government are in power and whoever occupies the Minister's position will always find themselves in great difficulties if the decision to acquire or divide land is a political matter.  Ultimately, I feel that portion of the legislation will lead in that direction.  Perhaps the Minister would have another look at the matter between now and Committee or Report Stage and see if he could alter it in some such way as to leave the Commission the rights they have exercised so well over the years.</P>
    <P>I may be misinterpreting the Minister's mind but it appears in another section of the Bill that I do not like that anybody who acquires land outside the congested areas&mdash;that will apply to counties like Wicklow, Wexford and many other counties possibly &mdash;will revert to double the existing annuity, to the annuity that existed <Col N="401" /> before the annuities were halved, before the Economic War of 1933 or 1934.  One can only assume that the Minister is introducing a Bill to place the financial implication of the Bill on these areas, on the counties outside the congested areas.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the land charges already in existence are heavy enough. We know that farmers are going to face increased rates and if the small farmers are going to face double annuities, it will impose an extra charge on them. Everyone in this competitive world has to be put in a position in which he may produce as economically as possible. This is a retrograde step.  It may be that I am misinterpreting the mind of the Minister, or what is in the Bill, but that is how I read it, that anyone in my constituency, or in Deputy Brennan's constituency in Wicklow, or in any other constituency outside the congested areas, will have a double annuity if he gets a portion of land from the Land Commission.  If such is the case, I would ask the Minister to consider the matter again between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have mentioned the question of foreigners buying land. There is no doubt that throughout the country there has been a great deal of disappointment because the Minister did not introduce legislation to preserve the land for those who need it. It is not that we have enough land to go around.  Even with the best possible Bill introduced by any Government, there would never be sufficient land to meet the requirements of those already sited on the land.  To obtain for them the 40 or 45 acres which the Minister has in mind, it would be necessary to take quite a number of people off the land.  It is all very well to say that foreigners are not buying very much land.  I should like to stress that they are only beginning to look for land here.  I will give the Minister my reasons for saying that.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister has been advised of the value of the land in European countries.  The market value of first-class land, apart from building sites and so forth, in Ireland, purely for agricultural purposes, can go as high as £150 per acre.  That would be absolutely first-class land in the Golden <Col N="402" /> Value or Kildare or Meath or somewhere like that.  To take the question of Germany alone, when I heard that this Bill was coming.  I consulted several German Deputies and I discovered that first-class arable land in Germany may run as high as £1,000 an acre.  That is apart from land immediately around cities or for building sites or anything like that.  The Minister will note the enormous danger there is here and the tremendous incentive there is for rich industrialists to come here to purchase land as an investment or a safeguard or, if you like, a bolthole in case a European conflagration broke out.  Land has been steadily rising and this is a problem that not only Germany has to face but which other countries have to face <i>vis-á-vis</i> Germany.  There has been considerable anxiety in France because of the high value of land in Germany and the number of Germans crossing the Rhine to acquire land in France. That brought about great differences within the EEC and special legislation was introduced in France and they are in the process of introducing further legislation to defend their homesteads.</P>
    <P>It is incomprehensible to me, that after so much discussion in the country about this problem we should have a Land Bill in which there is no specific defence for the national so that he may acquire the land.  Very recently, there was a pool of land for sale in my constituency in an area in which there were many small farmers. I went to the Land Commission to ensure that they would take an interest in this particular farm as there were 20 to 25 small holders in the neighbourhood who were interested in the 200 acres involved.  This land was widely advertised and I went to the official concerned and asked him if a foreigner came to buy the land, was there anything the official could do and his answer was that under the existing legislation, there was nothing he could do.  If the Minister can tell us that there is a safeguard in the matter of foreigners buying land, then I will stand corrected but I cannot see any such safeguard in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is extremely necessary that a matter of such paramount importance <Col N="403" /> should be dealt with when we are discussing a Land Bill and should be incorporated in the Bill.  There are many ways in which the Minister could do it.  One way was suggested by the Fine Gael Party when they introduced a Bill some years ago and which the Government did not see fit to accept.  They had a big majority then which of course has dwindled since and may dwindle more.  It was a simple Bill and provided that any foreigner buying land should be asked to register in the Land Commission. That seems to me to be a simple answer to the problem.  It means that the Land Commission, wishing to acquire the land and to do all the things the Minister advocates in this Bill, will be secure in the knowledge that they can do that.  I do not see how the matter can be dealt with otherwise.  Perhaps the Minister may think out some other scheme between now and Committee Stage.  It must be crystal clear to him from the viewpoints expressed by Deputies on all sides that this is a really live problem that must be dealt with if we are to have satisfactory land legislation.</P>
    <P>There is another very notable omission from the Bill.  This is in regard to a problem which does not apply to the west.  Perhaps the Minister is not conversant with this problem as conditions in the west are quite different from those in other parts of the country.  It is the problem of the landless man.  Theoretically, under existing planned legislation, it is possible for a landless man to get land. When everyone else is satisfied, and all the small-holders have been dealt with, the landless man comes into his own.  This, in effect, means that he never gets any land at all.  In the area I represent in Leinster, and the same applies to Munster, there are plenty of small farmers with 40 or 50 or even up to 70 acres who may have three sons.  There is sufficient living on the land for one son, aided perhaps by engaging in the hiring of machinery; there may even be a certain amount of living to be got for the second son; but if there is a third or fourth son, he may take the <Col N="404" /> emigrant ship because there is no living to be gained there for him.  If a third son were able to get a division of land and were assisted by the Department of Lands to acquire land, that state of affairs would not exist.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why, when this problem must have hit the Minister and his Department day in day out, and week in and week out, there is not within the confines of this Bill provision to deal with that problem.  As the Minister knows there are many people who have no land of their own, who take land from people who do not know how to work it, who keep stock and who give employment and help greatly towards the national production. Such people see a farm of perhaps 500 acres up for division but under existing legislation they cannot get one rood of land.  Surely the answer is to introduce legislation so that the landless man should be able to get land where it is within the power of the Land Commission or the Commissioners, as I hope it will be, to consider these men, provided they show that they are able to work the land, and that they are productive.  I know many men in Leinster who take out land, who are very fine farmers and very useful members of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to consider this matter when he comes to amend this Bill, as I hope he will amend it.  I do not know if the Minister will accept amendments from this side.  Our experience so far has been that the Government are unchangeable, are immutable, unless amendments come from their own side of the House.  One of our functions as an Opposition is, of course, to discuss Bills and put forward to the House the points we believe should be covered in measures brought before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, when we were discussing these pensions, I was dealing with broad, general matters. On this occasion I want to come down to detail.  We have the pitiable situation at the moment that almost half the CIE pensioners are receiving only a paltry 12/- per week.  The Minister has sought to justify that by suggesting that the transport pensions are an addition to certain social welfare benefits.  I should like to point out to him that these pensions were instituted at a time when many of the welfare benefits were not even thought of and they were designed primarily to provide an adequate pension to ensure to those who retired from the transport services reasonable comfort.  They were intended to keep those who retired free from want and worry in the latter days of their lives.  It is no excuse to say that these people contributed only 1/- a week.  Many of the 960 male pensioners who are now receiving pensions of 12/- a week began to work about 1905, certainly most of them before 1910.  If they were being paid 12/- a week in those days, and if society had not devalued money, then the 12/- a week then, which the Minister <Col N="406" /> relates to that 1/- a week contribution, would give them a tremendous amount of comfort and security in old age.</P>
      <P>It is the obligation of modern society and of the transport company to ensure that these people receive a reward equal in kind to their contribution.  It should not be a question of relating it to the nominal value of the contribution. It should be related to what the contribution was worth when it was made.  If these men had received pay equivalent to what people are now earning, they would have paid a much higher nominal contribution.  Nevertheless, the 1/- paid by them when they were earning 12/-, 15/-, 20/- or 40/- a week represented a considerable levy at that time and I believe there is an obligation on us and on the transport company to see to it now that these people are rewarded in relation to the value of the contributions they made.</P>
      <P>Many of us have been arguing for some years past for a different conception of the meaning of pension.  Many of us have been advocating a departure from the idea that pension is deferred pay.  If, however, we stick to that idea, we should realise at the same time that, if we compel people to defer their pay, we should equally ensure that we pay them according to the value of the contributions they made when we later devalue that pay.</P>
      <P>Can the company afford it?  Within the past five years, the pension fund of CIE has doubled itself.  That is not a bad investment.  A fund which can double itself in a short period like five years is, in my opinion, in a position to pay at least 24/- a week to half of its pensioners.  The argument is, of course, that this fund is for pensioners of the future.  The pensioners of the future, unless they realise their obligations today, will face the same dire need and distress and it is obligatory on us, therefore, to see to it that working men and women and the trade unions realise their obligations where pensioners are concerned and, if there is an increase in current pay side by side with a depreciation in the value of money, pensioners must be immediately and adequately compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that many members of <Col N="407" /> this House in common with myself could tell heartrending stories about the misery of transport pensioners. Some of them are denied the social welfare benefits which the Minister apparently assumes flow easily to them. Many of them lived in houses belonging to the railway or transport company. Many who have retired have lost these houses.  In some cases the widows of transport employees have been evicted.  In all these cases, people suffer an unwarranted degree of hardship. These contingencies are certainly not guarded against in a measly pension of 1/- per week.  The unemployment or disability benefit, which the Minister assumes is available for men between 65 and 70, is not in actual fact available to many because of the very stringent, artificial safeguards under the benefit code.  It is easy enough to boast of these benefits, but, when one comes to apply them in individual cases, all too often one finds that the particular people are excluded.</P>
    <P>The Minister quarrels with the wording of the motion.  I am not sure whether it is the word &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;severe&rdquo; with which the Minister quarrels, but he says that &ldquo;To say that is to utter something which is entirely invalid&rdquo;.  There is no point in getting into an argument on semantics but if a person has not got sufficient to feed himself and his wife, to provide adequate medical services, to live in frugal comfort, then there is something radically wrong and he is certainly suffering severe hardship and much more pain and discomfort than it was ever intended he should when these schemes of pension were originally initiated.  The sad position is that, because of the little he is getting, he is denied medical services by the local authority.  We certainly believe such a person is suffering severe hardship.</P>
    <P>Deputy N. Lemass suggested last week that this motion was put down for the purpose of queering the pitch of the Commission which is now sitting to inquire into the welfare and pension schemes for workers.  May I underline now that this motion was tabled by my colleagues about this time last year, <Col N="408" /> long before the industrial dispute which compelled the Government and the transport authority to set up a commission. It is a matter of which we must take serious note that even the existing work people of CIE were so dissatisfied with their pensions provisions and so disgruntled with their trade union in fighting for improved pensions that a serious industrial dispute took place.  I do not want to harp upon the difference which grew between the men and their union, but it is indicative of the manner in which we as a society have neglected the needs of pensioners.  It is clear proof that we need to approach the whole pension code in a different way.  If provision can be made, as we know it has been made, for financial assistance to this company for less humanitarian reasons, we feel the time has come to provide financial assistance for this company in connection with the pensions of the 960 people now receiving only 12/- a week.</P>
    <P>The sad thing about these people is that they cannot hope for any more. Rather than the pension increasing, when a man is in receipt of only 12/- a week, he is at the end of the pension stage.  At one time he received a higher pension, but once he receives 12/- a week, under the present code, that is the end and he cannot hope for any more, no matter what hardships he may suffer.  That is very wrong.  Somehow or other I believe the existing workers in CIE would not be slow to respond to the please of these elderly transport people and that they would contribute something towards the relief of these men.  Now would be the time to do that.  If we establish that precedent, we would build up a new pension idea to see to it that the existing workers would pay for the current pensioners.  If we intend that CIE or some other national transport company will last, we should be able to make an arrangement whereby the workers at that time will pay for the pensioners of that time and that they, in turn, when they come to pension age will receive their support from the existing workers.</P>
    <P>It would be ideal to continue the present system if money retains its <Col N="409" /> value, but we have no reason to believe from the economic and social history of the last half century that there will be stability in the value of money.  So long as we can expect a continuation of the depreciation of the nominal value of money, I believe we are obliged to introduce a fairer pension scheme to ensure that a person will receive the pension suited to his needs and adapted to the cost of living in the day in which he is living.</P>
    <P>The number of people in relation to the national population is small, but it is a very large number in itself &mdash;2,399 pensioners.  The fact that they are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land should not remove them entirely from our consciences. Many of these pensioners live in my constituency, particularly around the old hub of the railway world, Inchicore.  It is really pitiful to go into their homes and find them frequently without adequate fuel, undernourished, trying to keep up a good appearance, and in so doing denying themselves some very necessary nourishment.</P>
    <P>These are problems which are hard to translate into statutory regulations and a pension scheme, but unless we meet this challenge, we are going to impose additional hardships on these people in the latter days of their lives. We have a transport system of which we can be reasonably proud.  The worst the Minister can say about it is that it is more than adequate to meet our needs at present.  However, it is there; it is what we have received from these men.  We should be grateful for it, and we ought translate our gratitude into a little real kindness by providing more to give them better pensions.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would in any way affect the work of the existing Commission. Those people are planning for the future.  Most of the 960 men in receipt of 12/- a week will not be with us in another five years, and very few of them will be with us ten years hence. It would be a very small gesture on our part to provide the moneys, if necessary out of the national Exchequer, at least to double the pensions made available to these men.  On that <Col N="410" /> account it gives me great pleasure&mdash; it is only the fulfilment of a duty on my part &mdash; to support the motion so ably proposed by Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion moved by Deputy O'Donnell. Many Deputies have from time to time raised this matter of an increase for CIE pensioners who retired prior to 1956.  It seems that the efforts of those on both sides to do something for these pensioners have been met at all stages by a blank refusal, from the Minister, who says he has no function and refers the matter to CIE, and from CIE, who say they are not prepared to give any consideration whatever to this matter.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to reconcile the Minister's amendment with his speech. If I were to comment on his amendment, I would say he was guilty of dishonesty, but he withdrew that dishonesty in his speech.  In his amendment, which seems to suit Deputy N. Lemass, he tries to give the impression that the Commission established in July of this year is dealing with the matter contained in the motion.  To his credit, one must refer to what he says later on in his speech.  He stated, at column 111 of volume 206:</P>
      <P>While I understand that the Commission will not deal with the position of existing pensioners, I consider that the matter is to a certain extent <i>sub judice.</i>....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this motion, I am not concerned with what pensions the present CIE wage-earners may receive when they retire.  What I am concerned with, and what I know Deputy O'Donnell, Deputy MacEoin and others are concerned with, are the pensions of those who retired prior to 1956.  The Commission are dealing with those who may find themselves on pension in the future.  Contrary to what Deputy Lemass said, the motion is not an attempt to disrupt the work of the Commission.  The remarks of my colleague, Deputy Treacy, were not designed to disrupt the work of the Commission, and I certainly have no desire to do anything to harm the work of the Commission, which was appointed last July and is to report <Col N="411" /> by 31st of this month.  There is a plea from all sides, including Deputy Lemass, that those pensioners who now have 12/- a week should get some increase.  The Minister would have been much more honest with the House if he had said here last Wednesday night that he would not agree to it.  He did not do that.  His amendment, which seems to me to be designed to placate people like Deputy Lemass, was also designed to evade the main issue contained in the motion put down by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass makes his usual contribution in describing this motion as a cheap political trick.  That seems to be the only argument Fianna Fáil Deputies have when any criticism is made of them.  I do not think it is a cheap political trick.  As far as I can see from Deputy Lemass's speech as reported, he seems to be confident that the Commission is dealing with the pensions of those who retired prior to 1st April, 1956.  Would the Minister tell him that such is not the case? Deputy Lemass describes how he wrote to the Minister for Transport and Power, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to the Chairman of CIE and all the different things he did merely to advertise himself whilst accusing those who are genuinely interested in these things of cheap political trickery.</P>
    <P>In column 128, volume 206, of last Wednesday night Deputy Lemass said:</P>
    <P>One of the matters to be considered, according to the letter from Mr. Leo Crawford, was the matter of the pre-1956 pensions.  I am informed that they worked out the contributions and benefits on an actuarial basis.  I am informed that these people have applied to be heard.  I have not found out if they have been heard&mdash;I sincerely hope they have been&mdash;but I just have a note that it will be considered at the next meeting of the executive.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that the case for increasing the pensions of these people will be heard by the Commission and Deputy Lemass is foolish to believe that.  If that is the basis for his support <Col N="412" /> of the Minister's amendment, he is entirely wrong.  I do not think that social welfare benefits have anything at all to do with this.  These social welfare benefits are not being given out in a spirit of generosity by the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Finance or the Government. These are benefits that are due to the old age pensioners on the basis of their own contributions, the contributions of their own employers and the legal obligations of the Government to fill the balance.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that because old age pensions have increased so much in recent years by reason of the introduction of contributory old age pensions, the last increase and the increase they are to get in January, they should be satisfied and that they should not expect any increase on the 12/-.  He quoted other examples where pensions have not been increased over the past 12 or 15 years and he gives examples of workers who did not have their industrial pensions increased.  I would remind him that roadworkers have had their pensions increased and that the local authorities and the Minister for Local Government did not relate the pensions these people get from the local authorities to the amount they get by way of contributory or non-contributory old age pensions.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to these people.  They are people who, because of the service they gave to CIE and to various other railway companies before that, get a pension of 12/- a week, nearly 1,000 of them.  The Minister for Finance believes that roadworkers should receive an increase from the local authorities and I believe that the Minister for Transport and Power or CIE should consider providing an increase to those who have suffered on pensions of 12/- a week, and in many cases less, for years.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions themselves believe and subscribe to the idea of the Commission.  They are genuinely under the impression that the case of the pre-1956 pensioners is being considered by the Commission.  I do not know where they got that impression but I <Col N="413" /> have it officially from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that when the commission was being set up the case for an increase for these people would be considered.  Can the Minister explain why the Commission is not considering these people and how it was that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions got the idea that the case of these men would be heard?</P>
    <P>The Commission have denied that they have power to deal with the problem contained in the motion put down by Deputy T. O'Donnell.  The Congress has asked the Commission to inquire from the Minister whether they have power to consider existing pensions and they have refused to do so.  The Commission have refused to ask the Minister whether the case for the existing pensioners should be considered. That strengthens our belief that there should be a greater responsibility put upon the Minister for Transport and Power to answer to the Dáil for bodies like CIE.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will have no opportunity to speak again because he has spoken already but there has been some confusion and I would not object to his clarifying the position by way of interjection.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is a national body for which I know the Minister has respect, for which I know the Taoiseach and the Government have respect.  I would like to know how the confusion arose as to whether the Commission would deal with existing pensions.  It seems to me that these people whose case we are considering now have been nobody's children for years but their colleagues in the trade union movement are concerned about them and they genuinely believed that the Commission would consider what could be done.</P>
    <P>Whether the increase in their pensions would come from the superannuation fund or by way of a Government subvention, I will not not say but the Commission should have been charged by the Minister with considering whether they would get increases and from what source these increases would be forthcoming. I would ask, on behalf of Congress, whether or not the Commission is going to deal with this question.</P>

If what the Minister states is the case, I suggest that his amendment is a phoney and should be withdrawn.  I agree that Deputy O'Donnell's motion, in the strict sense of the words, embraces the question of all pensions, whether it is pensions for those who retired prior to 1956 or after 1956 or pensions to be paid in the future but the amendment put down is asking, in effect, that the Fine Gael motion be defeated and that we all should wait until the Commission had arrived at their conclusions and reported to the Minister or to the Board of CIE.  That is not like the Minister.  Certainly it seems to me that, if it is not ambiguous, it is dishonest.</P>

I wonder, now, is the Minister assuring us that consideration is to be given to the question of an increase for pre-1956 pensioners?</P>

In any case, I want the Minister to clear up the confusion that exists.  He is not able to do it now, I appreciate. I want the Minister to clear up the confusion in the mind of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that the pensioners about whom we are now speaking were to be considered by the Commission that is due to report by 31st December, 1963.  The time is long past when these people should have got an increase and I trust that as a result of this discussion in Dáil Éireann, consideration of an increase for them will not go on for months and months or years and years but that they will get some increase in the immediate future because, as Deputy Ryan pointed out, many of them are so old that if there is a delay of six months to 12 months, they will not be with us.  They have suffered hardship for long enough.  That is the reason I support the motion.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to you for calling me at this time instead of calling Deputy Burke because we would have had a feast of Fianna Fáil claptrap such as we had from Deputy Noel Lemass the other night, if you had called Deputy Burke.</P>
      <P>I am one of the Fine Gael Deputies who put their names to this motion. This motion has been down for nearly a year.  When I got my copy of the Dáil Debates, I discovered that Deputy Lemass had come in here and said&mdash; volume 206, column 125&mdash;that he considered the motion put down by Fine Gael to be one of two things, a cheap attempt to make political capital out of whatever the present Commission decided to do or, alternatively, an effort to destroy the smooth working of that Commission.  That is an ignorant statement, because the Commission was not formed until six months after we put in this motion. We, as the principal Opposition Party, consider it our right to put down motions, or to bring the Government to book, when we think wrong is being done.  That is a duty of any Opposition. I do not think we should be brought to book by Deputy Lemass who said we were trying to make political capital by putting down the motion.</P>
      <P>I moved to put down this motion because of the great injustice that CIE are doing to the pensioners in question. I am referring only to pensioners who went out before 1956.  There are 1,040 pensioners in receipt of 12/- a week; 327 in receipt of £1 a week; seven in receipt of 33/6d. a week.  There are 954 in receipt of 51/3d. a week&mdash;these would be some of the later ones.  The 1,040 pensioners in receipt of 12/- a week are all over 70 years of age.</P>
      <P>I remember the railway companies of Ireland before CIE came into existence, of which these fine people were the servants.  The trains ran to time. It was a most unusual thing for a train not to run to time.  These men worked for long hours and small pay.  They were a highly disciplined and devoted band of people.  It is forgotten and has not been mentioned here that during the Anglo-Irish war, whenever the crown forces boarded a train, the train crews walked off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When they walked off, they lost their jobs.  They had no home assistance or dole.  They had to go home to their wives and tell them that their jobs were gone.  That was a time when jobs were precious and scarce.  These men walked out of what they considered to be comfortable and pensionable jobs.  Then, when the Civil War started, they had to drive their trains over rickety bridges that had been repaired only with sleepers. I was talking to some of these men the other day.  They are fine, decent, brave men who considered they had a duty to perform and that the trains should run.  They carried out their duty at great risk.  Then they reached the day when they must retire and come out on this pittance.  It looked all right, maybe, at the time they came out and the Minister or whoever is responsible for it in CIE can say: &ldquo;We made a deal with these men&rdquo;&mdash; and that is that.</P>
      <P>However, a deal was made with all classes of workers in Ireland&mdash;civil servants, Garda, the Army, workers in industry and even with Deputies&mdash; they were to have a certain sum&mdash;but they looked for a rise and they got it. Since 1949, there have been eight increases in pay but these poor men were forgotten by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to make the position clear to me, because I never trusted his figures, when he says the fund is only solvent.  My information is that in 1962 the total amount in the fund was £3,428,000.  That sum, invested at five per cent, would yield some £170,000 odd.  The annual income of the fund is £200,000 approximately from the Board of CIE and £82,000 from the men.  That comes to a total of £452,000.  In 1962, £213,000 was paid out.  There is more than double that in the fund, according to my figures, and I have no reason to doubt them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be delighted if the Minister would make something clear.  His image all over the country is that of a ruthless and hard-hearted man.  The Minister now has a chance to prove to the people that that image is not correct.  There are 1,040 unfortunate men with 12/9d a week from the company with which they worked all their lives.  They have only a few years left to them in the world.</P>
      <P>The decent thing would be for the Minister to come before this House in relation to this matter because if he wants legislation, he will get it faster than he has got anything in his life.  If he wishes to introduce amending legislation to enable CIE to pay just and equitable pensions to these people, he will get that legislation as quickly as possible so that these poor men will have the increase in their pensions for Christmas.  There are 1,040 of them in all.</P>
      <P>The total number of CIE pensioners is 2,399.  If the 1,040 were to get £1 a week extra, it would be, say, £1,000 a week or £52,000 a year.  According to the figures I have already given the House, the Minister could do it without any amending legislation.  If the Minister could not do it without any amending legislation, if he could not see the officials of CIE and say: &ldquo;I think you should do this&rdquo;, and if they would not take any notice of the recommendation of the Minister for Transport and Power, then the set-up between the Minister and CIE is very bad.  I would ask the Minister to consider doing this.  It is the kind of thing we in this House would like to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are Deputies on all sides who would like to see the Minister stand <Col N="420" /> up and say: &ldquo;Very well, I shall do it&rdquo;&mdash;and it would be as easy as that to do it.  God knows, we have given some &ldquo;hand-outs&rdquo; during the year but this would be the right kind of &ldquo;hand-out&rdquo; to give because it is for people who served this country well. They worked long hours.  They made the trains run on time.  That is something which I would recommend to the present Board of CIE.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Commission will bring in their findings at the end of the year.  Their findings will have nothing to do with the pre-1956 pensions.  Why wait until the end of the year?  Let the Commission do their own work in their own way.  The Minister should be concerned with the plight of these old people.</P>
    <P>If the Minister gives us that old CIE line of talk and that old Minister for Transport and Power line of talk: &ldquo;We shall wait until the Commission bring in their findings at the end of the year and we shall then consider what we can do about it and we shall see what suggestions can be made&rdquo;&mdash;he is just wasting time.  I have heard him say on many occasions that this matter will be considered.  When this Minister for Transport and Power says that something will be considered or that a man's case will be considered, it is the equivalent of saying that the man is for the block.  If the Minister says he will consider not digging up a railway line, then that railway line will be dug up on the following Monday.  I do not attach any value to the Minister's statement.  The only way in which he can change the image of himself among the people is to state that he is prepared to introduce legislation or to ask CIE&mdash;either one or the other&mdash;to give these unfortunate people a substantial increase in their pensions immediately.</P>

      <P>I wish to quote from the Minister's speech:</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, a five-man Commission was established in June, 1963, to examine the pension schemes and sickness benefit payments for regular wage grades of CIE and to make recommendations not later than 31st December, 1963. The establishment of the Commission was in accordance with the proposal agreed by the parties concerned in negotiations for the settlement of the CIE bus dispute.  While I understand that the Commission will not deal with the position of existing pensioners, I consider that the matter is to a certain extent <i>sub judice</i> and that the consideration of the position of existing pensions could most appropriately take place at the same time as the Commission's Report is under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated here that it is his intention to ask the Government to introduce legislation dealing with the pensioners referred to in the motion and I welcome that from the Minister.  Deputy Lynch's contribution here was to say that the Minister did not intend to do anything.  Any contribution that has been made to the country's progress has been made from this side of the House.  The other Parties, Labour and Fine Gael, are crying now but while they were in <Col N="423" /> office for six years, they never tried to improve anything.  During the past two years, they voted against every increase.  We had a proposal in regard to social services covering the less fortunate people we have to look after.</P>

      <P>I am wholeheartedly behind this amendment because the Minister has told the House what he intends to do.  There is a number of CIE pensioners living in my constituency and I know the position deserves the serious and sympathetic consideration which it will get.  Deputy Lynch said he would welcome legislation in the morning but if the Minister for Finance wants to increase taxation to make this money available, the same Deputies who are carrying on this propaganda will vote against this increase. They voted against the Budget which gave increases in social services.  We are trying to improve the lot of pensioners and we will give them anything the State can afford to give.  The Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party never made any contribution towards improving the lot of these people.  They left us in 1957 with not a shilling there for anybody.</P>

      <P>I am sure that when the Minister introduces legislation to give increases to deserving CIE pensioners, the Labour Party and Fine Gael will start the same thing again and will vote against any increases.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief but I am sorry Deputy Burke is in such a hurry out of the House because I would like to refer to the last comment he made.  If we thought the Minister for Transport and Power intended introducing legislation which he said would be required for the purpose of increasing these pensions, then we would be in a position to support his amendment here tonight.  In fact, we know the Minister has nailed his flag to a mast and does not intend to move from it.  On 27th November last, speaking on this motion, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I have no statutory authority, however, to require CIE to amend an existing superannuation scheme, in which the initiative rests with the Board.  In confirming a new scheme or an amending scheme which has been submitted to me, I may, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, modify the scheme as I think fit whether by deletion, addition or otherwise.  Deputies will appreciate, therefore, that in the absence of amending legislation, any proposal for an increase in the pensions at present paid to CIE wages grade pensioners must come from the Board.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the Minister told Deputy Corish today that when the Commission submit their report, he is prepared to consider the matter, though he knows quite well his previous record here where pensions are concerned, though he knows he will not agree to give increases in pensions because he wants to tie the pensions to the social welfare non-contributory old age pensions.</P>
      <P>We had the example of the Bord na Móna pension scheme, and he quoted it during the same speech, at column 110 of the Official Report for 27th November:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> The Bord na Móna pension scheme, on the other hand, is designed to supplement the social welfare benefits to which its employees are enitled so as to secure for them a reasonable all-in retirement income.</P>
    <P>In fact what the Minister is doing, and he knows it quite well, is that he is applying a means test at the one end, that having removed the means test from the contributory old age pensions under the social welfare scheme, he now comes along and applies the means test at the other end.</P>
    <P>If he can get people to practise what he is preaching, every pensioner will have his pension reduced, although he has contributed to it for so long from his hard work.  It is fraudulent to suggest that all we have to do is sit back and wait for this Commission to decide what will happen about the current pension scheme and that the Minister will then make arrangements to bring in the necessary legislation to increase the pre-1956 pensions.  The Minister should honestly tell the House before the vote is taken that if the Commission bring in, as they must, a favourable recommendation in regard to pensions, he must and will bring in the necessary legislation to increase the pensions.  I challenge him to do that. If he does, the Labour Party will take a different line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>He promises to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration is no use because his record on this question is too bad.  It is the worst record of anybody in the House.  The Minister has made his point; he has nailed his colours to the mast; but this is one case where he will not ring the change. He succeeded in doing it in the matter of the Board na Móna pensions when he and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, substantially altered a scheme recommended to them and brought out a pension scheme which is a disgrace to the good name of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion now asks him to mend his hand.  It asks him to say whether or not he considers that CIE workers will have the prospect of retiring <Col N="427" /> to something better than the pensioners now have.  One meets old people down the country who are vitally affected by this.  One of them happens to live in my village.  He worked for 40 years with the GNR and subsequently with CIE.  The Minister says that man paid only 1/- a week out of his wages.  Does the Minister know what 1/- a week meant to that man?  How does the Minister know what 1/- a week means to a man with 12/- a week, a person who has nothing else to live on?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not making a point of the 1/- a week, only giving a description of the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have in this instance as we had before, people dealing with matters about which they know nothing. We have people dealing with cases, talking about how much it takes to keep a person in ordinary comfort when they never in their lives had experience of families living on less than £1 a week.  If the Minister would come down to earth and accompany some of us into the houses of people who have given 40 years' service to the railways, during the latter part, to a State-sponsored body, he would pretty soon find out what 1/- a week means to them.  The Minister says the pensions were specifically designed so that people could qualify for them, but now when those people have qualified for a better pension, all the Minister can offer is the hope that if they live for another 12 or 18 months, the Dáil might consider doing something.  The Minister knows well that as long as he is Minister nothing will be done about the matter because he has already made up his mind that nothing will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Commission were appointed, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, of which I am an executive member, were satisfied that arrangements would be made to have pensions reviewed.  If the Congress had not thought that, the strike which occurred his year might not have been settled so easily.  This sort of thimble-rigging is simply enticing or encouraging people to use the only strength <Col N="428" /> they have, the strike weapon, to force those in authority to stop taking advantage of them, because when those people go on pension, they have no strength.  The only strength they have is while they are working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put my name to this motion because I thought it was important and was deserving of the support of every reasonable member of the House.  The case for the motion was very ably and clearly put by Deputy T. O'Donnell who seemed to have a very clear picture of the situation. His case was supported not only by members from these benches but by Deputies Corish, Treacy and Tully of the Labour Party.  As I see it, pre-1956 pensioners who have reached the age of 70 get 12/- a week and those who retired subsequently get pensions of £1 a week when they reach the age of 70.</P>
      <P>The first thing that strikes me is: why men who worked so hard prior to 1956&mdash;as Deputy T. Lynch said, much harder than their counterparts in later years&mdash;should be penalised in this way.  In 1956, the pension was fixed at £2 11s.  3d.  between the ages of 65 and 70.  At 70, this is reduced to £1.  A married man gets in addition to £2 11s.  3d., £3 2s.  6d., leaving him a total of £5 13s.  9d.  between the ages of 65 and 70.  When he reaches 70, the £2 11s.  3d. is reduced to £1 and the pensioner gets for himself and his wife a contributory old age pension of £4 which means he now gets £5 a week, a reduced income at the age of 70 of 13/9 a week.</P>
      <P>How can anybody suggest it is a reasonable thing to happen?  A man who has reached the age of 70 has to suffer a loss of 13/9 because there is some peculiar calculation about social welfare benefits that I cannot understand. If he is a single man or a widower, he is reduced to £3 and with this he has to pay for his house and live.  How can he do it?  I do not envy the Minister who tries to defend a pension of that sort for an employee of a State body.  It is a most disgraceful pension and one which no reasonable man could defend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the pension is so bad.  The Minister says the worker <Col N="429" /> pays 3/- and CIE contribute 6/6d, a total of 9/6d and that can only buy a pension of £2 11s.  3d for five years and after that, £1 per week.  If instead, we ask the Irish Life Assurance Company to provide a pension and if we paid 10/- a week instead of 9/6d, the day after that arrangement was made, if the worker died, his nearest relative would get £200 as the first benefit. If he lived to 65, he would get £325 for the rest of his life, £6 5s.  a week. If he were prepared to pay 10/- a year extra and if he died at 65, his wife or nearest relative would get £325.  I do not see how we manage to purchase such a bad pension for these employees. I do not know why the Minister is not ashamed to come into the House and defend that scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy forgets that these pensions are given without regard to the length of service. It cannot be compared with a private pension scheme.  Technically, it is quite impossible to compare a private scheme with such a scheme.</P>

      <P>CIE pensioners are the worst paid pensioners in the world.  No private industrial or other concern today pays its pensioners at such disgracefully low rates as CIE. For the records of the House, I want to quote from a letter I received from a constituent whose name I am not prepared to give but who lives at Healy Street, Tullamore.  He writes:</P>
      <P>I retired in June of last year on reaching the age limit of 65.  I had 33 years' unbroken service, all of it on the Tullamore-Dublin route as driver.  My pension is £2 11s.  3d. for five years, after which it will be reduced to £1 when I qualify for the old age pension.  My basic weekly wage at retirement was £10 10s. although my average weekly earnings would have been around £14. Thus, the pension is one-fifth of my basic pay and one-seventh of my average weekly income....  I may say I have been unfairly treated.</P>
      <P>I also got a gratuity of £100 on foot of a paid-up life assurance policy, the premiums on which were paid by the company.</P>
      <P>I have a second letter for the Minister's information which comes from Roskelton, Kilbrickin, Portlaoise and which says:</P>
      <P>I would like to bring to your notice that I am a retired platelayer of CIE.  I had 48 years' service.  I was 39 years appointed to the permanent staff.  My pension is 33/6 a week.</P>
      <P>This man is supposed to live on that miserable allowance.</P>
      <P>A third letter comes from New Road, Clara, Offaly and states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I served 50 years on CIE and I was in a key position.  I was head <Col N="431" /> porter from 1914 to 1951 when I reached retiring age of 65.  When I came to 70 I had the magnificent pension of 6/- a week.  After some years it was increased to 12/- a week and that is my present pension.  I am supposed to live on that miserable allowance.</P>
    <P>A further letter is from Town Parks, Borris-in-Ossory, Laois, and states:</P>
    <P>I worked as a platelayer on the railway for 46 years, 1906 to 1952, without a break.  Then at 65 I had to retire when I got a pension of 37/6 a week, until I reached 70. Then it was reduced to 6/- a week for two years and since then only 12/- a week.  I think this is very unjust after such long and faithful service, never even missing a day's work.</P>
    <P>The next letter is from Clonreher, Portlaoise, and it says:</P>
    <P>I am a pensioner of CIE and I am 72 years of age.   I joined the railway in 1915 and reached the age limit of 65 years in 1955.  I had 40 years' service with the company.  I received a pension of 37/6 a week for five years and when I was 70 my pension was cut to 12/- a week.  I paid 1/- per week contribution to the pension scheme.</P>
    <P>A letter from Trumera, Mountrath says:</P>
    <P>I was granted 37/6 a week until aged 70.  I was reduced to 12/- per week then.</P>
    <P>The last letter I shall quote comes from Derrykearn, Abbeyleix, and states:</P>
    <P>I started my employment on the railway on the 18th March, 1919 and retired on the 19th June, 1957 with over 38 years' service.  I retired just eight years before the age limit owing to unforeseen circumstances. I am 63½ years of age now and the pension I am receiving, and on which I am supposed to exist, is 40/9 a week.</P>

      <P>I think that every aspect of the question has been covered in the course of the debate.  The fact that it has run right through the allotted time, together with the fact that so many Deputies have contributed, indicate the merits of the motion.</P>
      <P>We in Fine Gael are satisfied that our action in tabling the motion has been fully justified and we are more than ever convinced that the steps suggested in the motion hold out the only hope of ever securing justice for this badly victimised group of pensioners.</P>
      <P>We do not and, in fact could not, accept the Minister's amendment which is merely a typical ministerial gimmick of passing the buck.  Acceptance of his amendment would only have the effect of still further prolonging the hardship, misery and frustration of this unfortunate group of pensioners.  The efforts of these men to secure justice have gone on for far too long and unless steps are taken now to give them some measure of fair play in their declining years they will all have passed away before anything is done.  We must bear in mind that we are dealing with a group of men the vast majority of whom are over 70 years.  In fact, the youngest of the pre-1956 pensioners will be 74 next April.  The numbers are being depleted not alone every year but every month through deaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies may have noticed a difference between the figures I gave when I was moving the motion last week when I stated there were 1,040 pensioners in receipt of 12/- per week, and the figure given by the Minister when he was introducing his amendment of 960 for the 1st November, 1963.  My figure was the figure given by the Minister in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 13th February, <Col N="433" /> 1963, so that from the 13th February this year up to 1st November the number of pensioners has gone down by 80.  Eighty of these unfortunate men have died since 13th February. Another figure which I have here shows that in 1960 there were 1,210 men in receipt of 12/- a week and in the three years since then 250 of these unfortunate men have passed away.</P>
    <P>There is no time to be lost if we want to give these men some comfort in the few remaining years of their lives.  It is true to say, as some Deputies have pointed out, that in five years' time very few will be there. Certainly in ten years' time, none of these men will be left.  Surely it is not beyond the capacity of the Minister or the Government&mdash;who can come in here and look for millions of pounds for many less worthy objectives&mdash;to provide a few thousand pounds to enable these 960 men to live in comfort for the last few years of their lives. Surely the Minister and the Government have not lost all sense of fair play that they cannot take the simple step of providing adequately for these men.</P>
    <P>Quite a lot has been said during the course of the debate by the Minister and some Deputies regarding social welfare benefits.  I was glad that Deputy Clinton pointed out that at the age of 65, a man gets £2 11s 3d pension from CIE, plus £3 2s 6d welfare benefit, making a total of £5 13s 9d, but when he reaches the age of 70, his total income is reduced by 13/9d.  I agree with other Deputies who said that the question of social welfare benefits should be kept clear of this matter altogether.  I should like to point out that the men for whom we are fighting have for the past five or six years taken every step that was humanly possible to secure justice.  The officers of the Pensioners Association in Dublin and in the provinces have left no stone unturned to bring their plight to the notice of the Government and the scandalous inadequacy of their pensions, but nothing has been done.  In the course of my consultations with these men during <Col N="434" /> the past 12 months I have gone through a mass of correspondence with the Minister and Deputies from all sides of the House and even with the Taoiseach.  When the Fine Gael Party was approached by me one and a half years ago to make some move on behalf of these men we quickly realised, when confronted with this mass of documentation, that it was futile to proceed with further correspondence. We felt that our only step, as a responsible Opposition Party, was to table this motion.</P>
    <P>I will not comment on Deputy Lemass's remarks as they are unworthy of comment.  This motion was put down several months before the Commission was set up.  I was glad that Deputy Corish adverted to the Commission and to the fact that the men for whom we are fighting are not being considered by the Commission.  I was informed by the secretary of the Dublin Pensioners Association that when this Commission was set up, an approach was made by the Pensioners Association to the Secretary, Mr. Jenkins.  A deputation waited on him and he then suggested that the Association should make submissions to the Commission, but a week later when the pensioners went along with the submissions, they were informed that the Commission could not receive any submissions from them by reason of the fact that their terms of reference precluded them from doing so.  The Minister admitted that the Commission was not examining the case of the pensioners.</P>
    <P>As time is running out I will conclude by appealing to the Minister, in the interests of justice, equity and fair play to accept this motion and by so doing, give those unfortunate men a little comfort and hope in the few remaining years of their lives.  Justice and equity demand it and public opinion supports it and I am quite convinced that a majority of Deputies on all sides are in agreement with the motion.</P>

      <Col N="437" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been covered fairly extensively and I propose to comment on only a few aspects of it.  I am particularly worried about section 4 but, before I deal with that, I want to remind the House that not so very long ago the Minister declared portion of north Longford a congested area.  I notice it is now excluded from the Schedule.  Does that mean that we shall have again to petition the Minister, becoming mendicants to the Minister, to have that area included?  I submit it does.  We succeeded in getting the area declared a congested area after many efforts.</P>
      <P>Under this section, and this is the serious point, the Minister can declare, if the Bill becomes law, any area outside the congested districts a congested area.  That gives him so much power that he will be in a position to bestow very substantial favours personally. While that may be good politically for a Minister, I do not know that it is wise to put that power into the hands of any Minister.  The Minister will not be here for all time and I would ask the House to remember that, when passing legislation such as this, we are passing it not for today, or for tomorrow, but for the future.  If we give this particular power we shall do something that is dangerous.  It will open the door to abuse.  I do not say the present Minister would be guilty of abuse, but it would be a stepmother who would blame him if he were guilty, because it is too much to expect that, when you get power, you will not use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 7, the Minister can, by order, create a congested area and he can give certain people whom he will send in to lands acquired the benefit of a halved land annuity and put the obligation on other allottees in similar circumstances of paying the full land annuity.  I suggest the Minister should have included North Longford in the Schedule.  That was promised by every Fianna Fáil Deputy, without exception, in Longford-Westmeath <Col N="438" /> since 1932.  It did not eventuate until last year or the beginning of this year. The advantages of it have not been fully secured yet but, with one stroke of the pen now, this is removed.</P>
    <P>I come now to the difficulty of the small holdings of 22 acres established in what are known as the Gaeltacht areas or the Irish speaking areas in Meath.  Remember, when Fianna Fáil were boasting about an economic unit, they decided 22 to 25 acres were an economic unit.  They brought these people up from the west and planted them in Meath.  Now they find this is not an economic unit.  These poor people with 22 to 25 acres will now become eligible for an addition to their holdings.  When they get that addition they will have to pay the full economic rent.  Land in Meath is making approximately £100 per acre. When you give 22 more acres to these people to bring them up to the 40 or 45 acre limit, which is now supposed to be the economic unit, they will have to pay a new rent of £127 per year. Is there either sense or reason in that? I know it will be argued that they are taking conacre and paying high rents for it.  I submit it is not the intention, and never was the intention, of this legislature, no matter what anyone may say to the contrary, be he Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, to create a new rackrent.  Yet that is what this Bill will do.  Remember, this will be at the nod or wink of a Minister. It is a serious matter and I ask the House to think twice about it.</P>
    <P>Despite adverse criticism by some I believe the Land Commission has done a very good day's work.  I submit, however, that no person, inspector or would-be inspector, has the right to force his way in on any man's holding without that man's consent, except by a judicial order.  When the Minister takes to himself power to direct an inspector to go down and inspect Martin Corry's farm and see what he is doing, I submit that is an intrusion on Martin Corry's rights as a citizen and, unless Martin Corry has slipped very much, he will meet that inspector with a few well chosen words as to his right to enter on his farm, and more power to Martin's elbow for resisting.</P>

      <P>I would not go quite so far.  I would say there is a very big difference between them, but it is hard to disentagle them.</P>
      <P>The Dáil or the Government should not give power to any person to forcibly enter on a man's holding or house without his consent except under judicial order.  It could certainly lead to very great abuse, and I am afraid of it.  The inspection of land cannot be carried out at present unless the Land Commission give notice to the landholder that they propose to inspect and he has so many days to object.  When they inspect, he knows they are coming with an order, not from any political personage but from a judicial body that has the confidence of this House, no matter what Government is in power.  That is something that should not be thrown away lightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it can be argued that this new provision will speed up the acquisition of land.  That may be.  Speedy acquisition has great merits, but we know that where land has been acquired for a considerable period, it has not yet been divided.  Will this new section speed up the division of land already held by the Commission?  I doubt it.  I do not know what the cause of the delay is.  I do not think the Minister should take this power to himself.  The former Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, used what I thought was an expressive phrase.  He said this new section was the crowbar put into the foundations of land tenure in Ireland. <Col N="440" /> He meant, of course, that if you put a crowbar into the foundations, you wreck the whole structure or at least badly shake it.</P>
    <P>The purchase of land by aliens is a question that should be kept closely under review.  I know it is hard to tell a farmer anxious to put a substantial holding on the market that he is not to accept the highest price he can get. It is not easy to tell him that he must sell to a restricted number of would-be purchasers.  I do not like to see aliens acquiring these holdings, because it could beget something that none of us would like.  Even where the foreigner has acquired land, the Land Commission can still serve notice of intention to inspect and acquire.  When foreigners buy land, they do not secure any rights which Irish citizens have not already.  They are no more protected than the ordinary Irish citizen. But it could easily happen that the Government of the day would be charged with taking hostile action against the citizens of another country. The Government should emphasise that the acquisition of land by foreigners, no matter how much they pay for it, does not give them any more protection than that enjoyed by Irish citizens already and that their lands are liable for acquisition.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far the Minister has kept the register of land purchased by aliens to which he referred.  I hope it is an accurate record.  There is a conflict of opinion about it.  I take it, however, that the Minister and the Land Commission have a fair idea and, when they say the amount of land purchased was not very much, I will not go further.  The fact that land has been bought here shows one thing: that the purchasing power of our monetary system, as such, has been reduced so far that the hard currency countries find land cheap.  That is an indication to all our people, no matter what their politics, of the dangers that can lie ahead.</P>
    <P>Amendments will be put down on the Committee Stage.  However, we know from experience that amendments put down by the Opposition are nearly always resisted by the Government of the day.  Therefore, I <Col N="441" /> respectfully suggest that the Minister himself, knowing the equity and justice of all I have said, will put down the amendments removing the statutory power he is now acquiring and restoring it to the judicial authority that has exercised it for so long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has introduced this measure.  It is only in keeping with the experience we have of him since he has come into office. He has been most energetic.  Where he finds legal difficulties left by his predecessors, he is removing them.  I cannot see what Deputy MacEoin's complaint is.  There is a definition of congested areas, but there is no Deputy representing a rural constituency who has not a congested area in it.  Take my constituency.  In Gortroe, Ballymacoda and Ballycotton, there are very small uneconomic holdings.  It is about time those people were considered just as well as the gentlemen from Mayo and Galway.  I consider the Minister should have power to act in those areas the same as in any of the congested areas.</P>
      <P>I found an appalling state of affairs in the Rockchapel and Newmarket area, which came into my constituency on the last occasion.  Here you have whole districts with holdings of a poor law valuation of from £10 to £15.  I had to intervene on one occasion when a farm of 90 acres went on the market and the Minister, acting with his usual promptitude, instructed his officials to take over that farm.  Seven unfortunate, so-called farmers&mdash;the largest with 21 acres of land&mdash;had that divided up amongst them.  They were happy and satisfied that they would have a fair livelihood in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wherever a holding is put up or can be acquired in areas where there is very grave congestion, the Land Comsion should step in immediately.  That is the only chance the people in that area will have in their lifetime of getting a fair holding.  I had two instances recently and, unfortunately, the holdings went in both cases.  These were cases of two people jumping the gun, jumping this Bill.  One was in the Youghal area in a place where <Col N="442" /> there is a large number of uneconomic holders.  I handed in a list of some 25 smallholders to the Land Commission but the land was let go.</P>
    <P>On a more recent occasion in Cloyne, there was a holding that had been let on the 11 months system for the past nine years.  As soon as this Bill was mooted, the lady who owned that land decided that she would sell and she succeeded in getting out from under, without any benefit to the unfortunate smallholders of the district.  I suggest to the Minister that until this Bill becomes law, he should exercise a very careful eye on those holdings that are being put up and he should step in immediately they are put up.</P>
    <P>There is too much land being held in this country on what is purported to be the conacre system.  The effect of this on the ordinary tillage farmer has been practically fatal.  These gentlemen have driven the tillage farmer completely out of the grain market.  You have people living in other countries sending instructions to auctioneers over here and I saw a cheque for £25,000 paid for wheat to one of these gentlemen.  Does anyone want to pretend to me that he was an ordinary farmer, a gentleman who had £25,000 worth of wheat to sell and I do not believe he owned 50 acres of land in this country himself?</P>
    <P>What hope has the ordinary tillage farmer of going up against such a gentleman?  If he had a profit of half a barrel out of each acre, that was all he wanted.  What hope would a man with ten acres of land have who is trying to get something out of it on which to support his family?  That kind of thing is becoming far too common here, particularly in the midlands, and it is time it was ended. I am glad the Minister has taken power to step in in these cases.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy MacEoin mention what Deputy Blowick did in his time in office but I have a very vivid picture of what he did.  There was a holding of 700 acres in Cloyne and when it came up for sale, the Land Commission took 17 acres of it.  That is the kind of thing that has brought contempt on the Land Commission but, thank Providence, that is going to be changed.  I am glad the Bill has been <Col N="443" /> brought in but I would advise the Minister that there will be a rush on the part of the worst offenders under the conacre system to get out from under and I suggest to him that whenever one of these holdings is put up he should be prepared to step in immediately. That is the only hope that these big holdings will ever be divided and that our people will be able to remain at home and earn a livelihood in their own country.</P>
    <P>As things stand at present, that cannot be done.  The Minister now has an opportunity to do it and I am sure he will avail of that opportunity.  I compliment the Minister on the Bill, although there are certain phases of it with which I may not agree.  We will have an opportunity of dealing with these on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry has made a strong appeal to the Minister to exercise a very careful eye on those engaged in conacre letting.  I am not quite sure what Deputy Corry means by that appeal to the Minister. I do not know to what extent the Minister is supposed to exercise his eyes or in what way the Minister might exercise a careless eye but Deputy Corry appeals to him to exercise a careful eye in regard to conacre lettings.  I am glad Deputy Corry mentioned that subject because I find myself somewhat confused as to what is meant by the provisions of the section which Deputy Corry had in mind, the provisions of section 12 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>That section provides that an agricultural holding shall not be let, sub-let or sub-divided without the consent of the Land Commission.  There does not appear to be any definition of what letting or sub-letting may mean.  It seems to be the law at the moment that a conacre letting is not a letting or sub-letting of a holding.  If that still is to be regarded as the legal position, section 12 of the Bill, to my mind, appears to be meaningless because it does not prevent or prohibit conacre lettings of land and, if that is so, I cannot understand what the object or purpose of the section may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood the position to be that <Col N="444" /> under our existing law if any person made a lease or letting of agricultural land then, automatically, under the Hogan Act of 1923, the land so let was vested in the Land Commission and, for that reason, since 1923, there has not, in fact, been any leasing of agricultural land in this country because the person who effected a lease achieved a position which obviously he did not desire&mdash;the freehold of the land passed from him to the Land Commission.  Perhaps the Minister in closing the Second Reading will explain what, in fact, is intended by the provisions in section 12?</P>
    <P>I should like to go back to an earlier section&mdash;section 10&mdash;of the Bill. section 10, if the marginal note is to be accepted, is a section which is designed to exonerate the Minister for Lands and the Land Commission from certain obligations and liabilities and these obligations and liabilities are stated to be any obligation to cleanse, maintain, repair or restore any works on land which has been divided or under the care of the Land Commission. These works are referred to as drains, embankments, and so on.  I should like to know from the Minister why it is proposed that the Land Commission should be relieved from any obligation in regard to drains or rivers or embankments of that kind.  In fact, where an estate is divided or where a number of allottees get land, if it is necessary to build ditches or embankments or if it is necessary to provide a proper channel for drainage, and so on, it would appear to me that for so long as the Land Commission continue to exercise responsibility for land divided and continue to control that land in relation to subdivision, sale, and so on, they should certainly continue to exercise responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of the works they had carried out.  That, in my view, is particularly essential when we consider that through other Departments of State a vast capital investment has been made in land reclamation and in improving the quality of land.  If we permit a section of this kind to pass unchallenged it may mean that what is the responsibility of no particular person becomes a problem affecting everyone and the drain which <Col N="445" /> is not maintained very rapidly will cause a flooding problem over a divided estate and nothing, in fact, will be done because there will be no authority to point to.</P>
    <P>Also in section 10 there is an indemnity given to the Minister for Lands and the Land Commission in respect of any act or omission of an officer, servant or agent of the Minister or the Land Commission which amounts to a tort or a wrong in relation to the construction of any drain or the making of any of these embankments.  Why should that kind of section be passed in a Bill of this kind?  If, in fact, the Minister for Lands or the Land Commission or any of their officers so carried out any works in relation to the division of an estate that they left behind for the unfortunate tenant a heritage of flooding or some other difficulty by reason of negligence, why should the Land Commission under a section of this kind be exonerated from responsibility?</P>
    <P>We are far too prone in our legislation here to legislate preferentially for the big bodies in the country, to exclude them from a liability, giving them an exclusion which would not be available to any other individual in the State.  I would suggest that to exclude the Land Commission from being amenable in the ordinary courts of this land for any negligence or carelessness on the part of their officers and servants in works of that kind would be legislating in a very wrong way.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer, if I may, to section 13 of this Bill.  Section 13, as I understand it, is intended to ensure that after a notice has been served providing for the inspection of a holding, then that holding may not be sold, transferred, let, sub-let, or sub-divided without the consent of the Land Commission.  I should like to say in relation to that section here in this House: <i>quo warranto?</i> By what authority do we legislate in that way? We have a Constitution in this country and the Constitution, so far as I understand it, protects the rights of private property.  On what basis do we propose in relation to land not owned by the <Col N="446" /> Land Commission, owned by some citizen of the State, to say that he may not sell his own land ?  I do not want to be prophetic but I would hazard a guess that if that section is contained in this Bill when it becomes an Act, very quickly it will be declared to be unconstitutional by the courts.  I cannot understand on what basis it can be suggested that the Land Commission should have power to prevent the sale of lands which they have not acquired, in which they have no particular rights except that they have given a notice that they propose to inspect.  I think the section, if it is contained in the Act, will be clearly held to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>It is well to bear in mind that that section&mdash;section 13&mdash;must be considered in this Bill with the provisions of section 27, under which power is now given to a senior inspector of the Land Commission, by a letter posted by registered post, to give notice of an intention to inspect anyone's land. There are, I understand, according to the White Paper, four senior inspectors who are officers of the Land Commission. Each of these four senior inspectors, presumably, is an ordinary, frail human being.  Any one of these now, if this Bill becomes law, may serve&mdash; not with the seal of the Land Commission and not in any formal way but by ordinary registered post&mdash;a notice to an owner that his land will be inspected.  Once he does that, for the next 12 months, that person's land, under the proposal contained in this Bill, cannot be dealt with by him as owner of that land.  If he was considering selling his land and was balancing the probabilities between two or three possible purchasers and if one of these purchasers for some reason known to himself could achieve the service of a notice of that kind and if it had any validity in law, then that person's land and his possible bargain just disappears as far as he is concerned. This is a most reprehensible provision.</P>
    <P>Section 27 is a proposal which takes from the Lay Commissioners a right which, under our existing law, was exclusively a right of the Commissioners themselves.  We have had in <Col N="447" /> this country, in the years before the State was established, experience of land division.  We are aware of the problem in this country of the necessity for the division of land which has to be balanced against the rights of property, however those rights may have been acquired.  In that regard, we should now be able to legislate with experience.</P>
    <P>It is worth recording that, after the first Fianna Fáil Government came into office in 1932, an amendment of the Land Acts was proposed and passed by this House.  Those who proposed and passed those amendments very shortly afterwards realised they were in error and they proceeded to undo what they had done.  Eventually, a stage was reached, which is now represented by our present Land Acts, that the Lay Commissioners had certain exclusive rights.  They decided and are entitled to decide under our present Land Acts what lands should be considered for acquisition and division. That was an excepted matter, taken out of the political field and taken out of the control of the Minister, peculiarly a right of the Lay Commissioners themselves and, in addition, the Lay Commissioners have the exclusive right of deciding who should get land.</P>
    <P>These excepted matters&mdash;there are others, of course&mdash;were excepted to the Lay Commissioners in the light of actual experience earned in this country in the early 1930s.  It was found undesirable that political considerations should enter into decisions affecting what land should be selected for division as it was equally found undesirable that political considerations should enter into a decision as to who should be allotted land. I should like to put on record my appreciation of the fact that a Fianna Fáil Government in the early 1930s saw the necessity for these provisions, having, in fact, proceeded in another direction before that.</P>
    <P>Under, I think, the Land Act, 1936, the charter of the Lay Commissioners was laid down.  Since that, the Lay Commissioners have operated as a very worthwhile stabiliser so far as <Col N="448" /> any Minister for Lands might be concerned. While the Minister was entitled to lay down policy so far as land division was concerned, the Lay Commissioners&mdash;and only they&mdash;on the other hand, removed from political pressure or political considerations, were entitled to take the first step with regard to the division of any particular land or any particular estate.  In this section, this is proposed to be changed?  Why?</P>
    <P>Are we now to go back to the mistakes of almost 30 years ago?  Are we now to go back to a situation in which pressure groups can grow up in the country and the Minister for Lands, as the political chief, can direct a senior inspector of his Department to serve a notice of intention to inspect on a decent farmer in this country? We have no more big landholders.  We now have no absentee landlords.</P>
    <P>The people who will be affected by this Bill are all citizens of this country. They are all men who have land which they themselves or their fathers probably acquired initially as a result of land division&mdash;the Ashbourne Acts, or whatever it may be.  Are these people now to be put under the thumb-screw of political pressure?  There is a danger in section 27 that that can happen and the threat of its happening could cause considerable concern and dislocation throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If a notice is now served under section 27 there will be no quiet appraisal of the merits by independent people, by a judicial or semi-judicial body.  There will merely be the decision of a senior inspector who may be a Johnnie-jump-up for all we know&mdash;a fellow who possibly may have conceived a dislike of some farmer.  Just by dropping a letter into the post office, he now can serve a document on that farmer which will, if the Bill is enacted, destroy that farmer's right to let, transfer or deal with his land for the following twelve months.  This is an atrocious provision.  I cannot understand the necessity for a provision of this kind.  I urge the Minister to have second thoughts in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that a proposed amendment of this kind should be associated with a decision by the Government to appoint as one of the Lay <Col N="449" /> Commissioners the Secretary of the Department of Lands.  The Secretary who is concerned in this appointment is a man for whom personally I have the highest possible regard.  He has been an excellent officer and a first-rate civil servant.  I think it is embarrassing for him and for everyone who knows him that associated with a proposed change in the law of that kind, we are to have as one of the Lay Commissioners, the permanent head of the Department of Lands.  Where are we going?  Is there to be an end of any independent examination of ministerial decisions with regard to the Land Commission?  Will we have a situation that, on a Minister's orders, a senior inspector may go into a farmer's land, serve a notice and destroy his right of dealing with his own land for the next 12 months, and if the action has to be called in question, one goes before the court of the Irish Land Commission to arraign that inspector before the person who is the accountable officer, the permanent head of the Department of Lands?  It is quite reprehensible that a provision of this kind should be contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters perhaps strongly but this is a good Bill which is destroyed by provisions of this kind. The Minister could achieve and would have achieved everything he seeks in this legislation without including sections of the kind I have mentioned, section 13 and section 27.  I do not think the Bill would lose any of its merit if on the next stage the Minister agreed that section 13 and section 27 should be deleted.  If that were done, I would feel the appointment of the Secretary of the Department of Lands as a Lay Commissioner would lose much of the very undesirable implications it carries with it.  It was done before and it was objected to by many people but certainly to associate that appointment with these proposed changes in the land code is very hard to understand or to appreciate.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a word or two with regard to what has been said in this debate in relation to the purchase of land by foreigners.  This is a matter about which one can become illogical and, perhaps, unreasonable.  I have <Col N="450" /> endeavoured to keep a balanced view on this problem.  Nevertheless, I feel myself in entire agreement with what Deputy Blowick said earlier in this debate.  I cannot understand why we in this country permit foreigners to purchase our land.  I believe quite sincerely that, irrespective of the amount of land purchased by aliens at the moment, whether it is a problem or mounting towards a problem or whatever way one qualifies or describes what is going on, it is absolutely essential that we, by our legislation, should prohibit the purchase of any Irish land, particularly agricultural land, by non-nationals.</P>
    <P>I am certain that if we do not provide for a prohibition of that kind in our land laws, in a few years' time, we shall regret very bitterly the lack of such a prohibition.  At the moment arable or agricultural land on the continent of Europe fetches, in terms of our money, something approaching £750 or £800 an acre.  At present the best barley land in the midlands would fetch £120 or perhaps £130 an acre.  If in the foreseeable future we join the Common Market, that is an investment very well worth making by continental purchasers, when they can buy up the best agricultural land in this country for £130 an acre.  Certainly in the midlands there is very big money chasing good land.</P>
    <P>I know this has not become a prolem yet.  Of course it has not because most people prefer to hold on to the land.  Most Irish farmers fought hard enough to own the land they stand upon and they will not lightly or easily sell it.  However, slowly, bit by bit, their understandable pride in their own land and their natural reluctance to sell is being eaten away.  It may not be a problem but it will become one. In certain other parts of the country our coastline is being bought away.  In parts of the country with which perhaps you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, should be familiar, the north-west of Ireland, there is an influx of money in buying large tracts of the seaboard and we are permitting this country to be sold bit by bit.</P>
    <P>I would regard this Bill as being excellent if the sections I have mentioned <Col N="451" /> were not in it and if instead, a provision were contained in it prohibiting absolutely, without, say, the consent of the Land Commission, the purchase of land here by any person who is not a national or a citizen of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know&mdash;I am sure the Minister knows&mdash;but I would be surprised to learn that in any country on the continent, there is such a freedom of purchase of land as is emphasised here.  I would imagine that in most other countries some form of control is exercised and that they are very careful to ensure that no one may blow in with a bag of money and just buy whatever his eye happens to fall upon.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the Bill is a good one and I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.  However, it is a Bill which is affected adversely by the sections I have mentioned and by the deficiency that it does not contain any provision with regard to alien purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Land Bill gladly.  The amazing reception it has received and the general interest it has created throughout the country have been reflected in the number of Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  Apart from any criticisms that may be made of the Bill, I think it is generally agreed the measure is at last a serious attempt to grapple with land tenure and congestion problems in this country.</P>
      <P>This is the 14th Land Bill introduced in Dáil Éireann since we got our freedom and many of the previous measures were ultra-conservative.  In this Bill we have got something revolutionary by comparison with the past.  The Minister is to be congratulated in his approach to the framing of it.  Reading through its sections, it has struck me there is something in each that Michael Davitt, in his day, would have worked for, and I am glad it is left to a Mayoman to pilot it through an Irish Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In piloting this measure through Parliament, the Minister for Lands is striving, by the process of trial and <Col N="452" /> error, to introduce for the future, legislation that will deal once and for all with land tenure and congestion. As a rural Deputy and as one who, so to speak, represents an area outside the Pale of congestion.  I have one criticism to make of section 5 of the Bill, which deals solely with loans for congests who wish to migrate, but it leaves outside its scope people living outside the old Congested Districts Board areas.  They are not to be entitled to the same facilities for the provision of capital as are available to congests in the already defined areas.</P>
    <P>I can give the Minister an example of the unfairness of that schedule.  I suggest to him an area from the Shannon at Foynes, cutting right through the western part of Limerick to the Cork border at Tullylease and moving to the Kerry border at the river Feale and northwards to Tarbert. I am now stressing the point already made by Deputies that within that area we have uneconomic holdings as numerous and congestion as dense as in either Roscommon or parts of Mayo.</P>
    <P>We have been looking at this Bill as a promise for the future and I should not like it to go abroad or to be accepted generally that the Bill is parochial or provincial in its scope. I think the old criterion of the standard of the Congested Districts Board as outlined in British days should be removed from the Minister's mind and congested areas reframed, whether in North Longford or in the part of West Limerick I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have attacked various sections of this Bill but they have also welcomed the Bill generally. I listened carefully to the contribution of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins who took severe exception to section 27, saying he feared it would take away from the quasi-judicial body, the Land Commission, the powers already vested in them.  Under 13 previous enactments of land legislation, the power of acquisition in section 27 has been advocated over the years and that power of acquisition of land does not interfere with its subsequent division by the Land Commission.  Therefore, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins has failed <Col N="453" /> hopelessly to sustain the serious objection he has made to this section.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of his speech I did not like was his reference to the Secretary of the Department of Lands when he said it was a very undesirable move that he, as Secretary of the Department, should be appointed as one of the Lay Commissioners.  His exact words were: &ldquo;Such an appointment creates undesirable implications&rdquo;. Deputy O'Higgins forgot to tell us there was a precedent for that appointment, that during the Cumann na nGaedheal administration, the late Mr. Deegan was not only Secretary of the Department of Lands but also a member of the Land Commission.  I do not think it would be fair to that deceased gentleman that any member of this House should say his appointment had very undesirable implications. We must also be fair to the person recently appointed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied section 27 will serve to expedite the acquisition of land. Deputy O'Higgins also made the point that we should be careful of non-nationals coming in and buying up our land.  To my mind, the foreigner is not the greatest danger in this respect.  We have in our midst the old vested interests, the gentlemen who came here in British days and who have been doing immense harm to the acquisition programme by purchasing up large tracts of land throughout the country.  In this Bill there is adequate provision in a number of sections to ensure that where such people are not working their farms in the required manner, the land will be acquired by the Land Commission for division. They are the foreigners who are doing all the harm in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick, a former Minister for Lands, also attacked section 27 and by implication, said that the operation of that section would be tantamount to bringing back the crowbar again into the land question.  Since he mentioned the crowbar, if he is free on Thursday evening next, I suggest that he watches the Telefís Éireann programme dealing with this subject.  In that programme on Thursday night next they will see exactly what we know and experienced of the days and <Col N="454" /> effects of landlordism and the crowbar brigade in my native parish.  That is something very important and educational and enlightening for Deputy Blowick if he can watch Telefís Éireann that night.</P>
    <P>I hope, in dealing with section 5, I have made clear my point that the Minister must adopt a more elastic and flexible method of defining congested areas.  That can easily be done by his chief officers in the different counties if they include pockets of congestion where they occur.  Where there is a desire to migrate voluntarily, the same facilities should be made available.  The Minister is taking on a very large burden in this Bill.  Even though we may be unanimous here about it, the problem of congestion, I fear, is beyond solution.</P>
    <P>The most attractive feature, for the really congested areas of the west, is section 5, which provides necessary capital and helps holders of small parcels of land to go out and buy land for themselves.  In order to create viable units in the west of Ireland, I think that side by side with our efforts to grapple with land congestion, there must also be industrial development in the towns and cities.  No matter how big we make the farms in the west of Ireland, in that part of Limerick that was mentioned or in the part of Longford mentioned by Deputy MacEoin, the best that can be done especially with our entry into the European Economic Community imminent, is to provide a living for one member of the family on a holding.  If we must co-relate the flight from the land with relief of congestion, I believe, after the surveys in West Cork and Limerick and elsewhere as outlined in the thesis published by Dr. Noonan of Maynooth, that the answer to the stabilising of viable units in the areas I have mentioned will depend solely on the industrialisation of the main towns of the counties.  That is one of the best solutions we can find.</P>
    <P>Before going on, I should like to break down the serious objection or the point made by Deputy O'Higgins against section 27, and the appointment by the Minister of senior officers to go into any province and point out, <Col N="455" /> or by letter designate certain land, saying: &ldquo;We have this earmarked for division.&rdquo;  When I said that some of our previous Land Acts were ultra-conservative, I meant that was so because we had not taken that power. We allowed too much time to elapse and too many avenues of escape which defeated the desires of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>It is very encouraging also that we are now trying to gain the co-operation of our own people in helping the Land Commission and the nation as a whole. There was complete reluctance on the part of many owners of large tracts of land in the past to have any dealings with the Land Commission.  If they wanted to sell, they were anxious to dispose of their land for cash and did not want to accept Land Bonds from the Land Commission.  I am glad that is being completely changed and that land can be purchased openly in the public market and the vendor given the choice of accepting cash or bonds which, at the moment, bear the very high value of 102 on the Stock Exchange.  That will be attractive to owners of large tracts who are coming near the end of their tether.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is also welcome because it will provide life annuities for old farmers with no sons to succeed them. This is all very far from any insinuation of compulsion because the section clearly states that life annuities for old farmers are on an entirely voluntary basis.  Also&mdash;and we know this is traditional for Irish people&mdash;if they want to remain where they were born, under this section they may have a free house for life and if they need rehabilitation or a life interest, they may be provided with a garden.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that section 13, taken with section 27, seemed to cancel out.  I do not understand that because when you read section 13 carefully, you find an effort is being made to prevent what we all mentioned here, the quick moves made to frustrate the efforts of the Land Commission in the past to acquire land where a fair case for acquisition was established.  I do not think any Deputy on any side should object to that <Col N="456" /> section because no matter what we did with the 13 previous Acts, the flaws were there.  We have had Deputies saying that the Land Commission should be there to deal with the operation of land acquisition and division and that section 27 and section 13 were bringing the crowbar back into play again.  I do not think that is a fair interpretation or a fair analysis of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is simple in itself but it is a right that should always have belonged to the tenant farmer but never did.  It gives the ordinary farmer control over the sporting rights of his lands where formerly they were reserved functions of the landlord.  It is a very welcome section.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy O'Higgins's speech.  I must say that I read the speech made by Deputy Dillon and I could see his points being redelivered by Deputy O'Higgins in a kind of caustic criticism of the Bill.  Over the years, western Deputies from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have been making capital of the great harm caused by absentee landlords.  If any Deputy has studied the Bill carefully, he will see that section 34 is a vital section in so far as it leaves the absentee landlord very vulnerable to acquisition. That is something for which we have all been striving, that the Land Commission should have the power to deal with these gentlemen.  Not alone will this apply to the absentee farmer or the absentee landlord but it will apply to the foreigners who are now absentees and who have bought some of the pool of land in recent years.</P>
    <P>Another matter with which it will deal is the effort which was made in the past to come in under the guise of companies&mdash;in order to get away from the heading of foreigner or absentee landlord&mdash;and buying land through the company.  The motive behind this will no longer be effective because section 34 will definitely circumvent such efforts.</P>
    <P>Section 34, which is a repeal schedule, makes it possible for the Land Commission to purchase land for cash in many cases where at present they could not do so. Previously they could pay cash in <Col N="457" /> certain cases, and in other cases they could pay with Land Bonds.  Under section 43, cash can be paid in all cases and it is clear that this will make for greater speed and greater convenience in the purchase of land, especially from old persons and under section 5, from migrants.</P>
    <P>The most important item in the Bill is in section 26 which provides for an additional £5 million for land reform. I heard no mention of that from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all the points I wished to raise.  I started by saying that I am very glad to be associated with all the Deputies who welcomed this Bill.  The criticisms which have been expressed may have been to an extent confused.  It is easy to have confused thoughts and arguments if you do not go to the trouble of dealing with the sections that affect your own area.  We are a small country and the pattern of land husbandry varies greatly.  I come from a dairying area; other Deputies come from grain-growing areas; and western Deputies come from congested areas.</P>
    <P>By and large, this Bill represents a very courageous approach.  Over the week-end, I went to the trouble of reading the speeches made by the various Deputies on both sides and the extraordinary thing is that it is the first land measure ever introduced here that has received so much support. That is a good thing.  I was glad to see that Labour Deputies took an interest in it because it deals with a very serious problem in our economy, something we would all like to see removed.  The Minister is to be congratulated. This Bill took a bit of courage.  It is revolutionary, if you like, but, if it is revolutionary, it is also evolutionary.  It is a step in the right direction.  Thank God, it has been received as well as it has.  I should not like to see anything taken away from this Bill in the Committee Stage. Perhaps something more might be added to it.  As one speaker said, it is not legislation for today, or tomorrow, but for the future.  Within the framework of this legislation, I hope the aims and ambitions of Michael Davitt will at last be realised.</P>

      <P>The last speaker referred to the crowbar.  I thought we were about to have a little history.  He could have added the battering ram and the baitín boys who smashed the rafters over the heads of the widows in my county.  I could go a bit further than that, if I wanted to.</P>
      <P>I come from the most congested area in the country.  Some speakers have talked about the very favourable provisions in this Bill from the point of view of the west, including the promise of 40 acres of land to everyone who applies.  This has brought a smile to many a face in the west, brought a smile to the faces of those who have been crying out for years for land, to the faces of those who saw the Land Commission taking over land across the wall and letting it on the 11-months system.  That land was held by the Land Commission while those with holdings of four and five acres were crying out for additions.  These people were ignored for years.  Many of them threw up their hands in despair, packed their bags, put the hasp on the door, and never opened the bags again until they arrived in Birmingham.</P>
      <P>It has been said by many that the Land Commission are the biggest landlords in the country.  The way they have held on to land is a disgrace. This promise of 40-acre holdings prompts me to ask if there will be enough land to go round or is it that there will be less people who will get land?  The Land Commission has been quite extraordinarily slow in dividing lands taken over.  I should like to see the straitjacket taken off the Land Commissioners.  The delay is not altogether their fault.  It is the fault of the set-up.  Something should be done to expedite division.  People are sceptical of these 40-acre holdings.  They sound like a Fianna Fáil pre-election promise. People have lost faith.  They have seen the foreigner coming in and buying up land from under their feet, while the Department looked on.  There is nothing to prevent that practice continuing in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has some good points.  It has some weak points.  The main problem <Col N="459" /> is to make the land more fertile and more productive.  That can only be done by using more lime and fertiliser and doing more drainage.  In other words, the Dillon scheme.  It is all very well to divide land.  It is useless unless we ensure we get full value from it.  If we are serious about the Common Market land division will have to be given a new look.  More speed will be necessary in putting the land of Ireland into the hands of the people of Ireland.  This Bill is not the be-all and end-all as far as the problem of land division is concerned.  I wish it every success.  Perhaps the Minister will have another look at it and strengthen the weaker points in it.  I suggest he accept some of the proposals made by this side of the House.  Let him get on with the good work and his Bill will have the backing of everyone here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take a fairly wide view of this Bill. We should, I think, first of all consider targets.  If our target is increased production at a cost which will enable production from the land to be disposed of competitively in the home and foreign market then we should consider the type of person to whom land should be made available and the type who should be assisted to either acquire land or increase his holding of land.</P>
      <P>The relief of congestion in the West seems to be the main ambition of many Deputies.  It sounds good but, if it results in retarding increased production from the land, then the relief of congestion alone should not be the be-all and end-all of land legislation.  We cannot take the land and divide it up like a chessboard into 40- to 45-acre holdings.  All types of holdings have their place in an agricultural country like ours.  We cannot confine ourselves to a standard pattern of 45-acre holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farm has its place in modern industrialised agriculture. Across the water and in western European countries we have highly-geared industrial agriculture, where, for example, up to one million turkeys can be produced in one place.  That <Col N="460" /> pattern of largescale production in small areas can and should be operated here.  We cannot succeed in many branches of agriculture until we do that.</P>
    <P>The relief of congestion should not be our sole aim.  We should also aim at having more people employed on the land.  And we can have more people employed on the land, even on our small farms, by promoting the type of modern, industrial agriculture to which I refer.  The type of person who is a landowner or who will become a landowner under this Bill is important, and the use to which he is capable of putting his land is important.  Not all congests are good farmers, although many of them are very good farmers.  Congests who are good farmers can also be and are good fishermen.  Our aim should be to put the best-qualified farmers on the land whether they be small farmers, landless men or conacre farmers, those who have shown themselves to be able to make good productive use of the land and to farm it scientifically.  Those are the people who should be given land and assisted in the purchase of land.</P>
    <P>The system up to now has been to take a congest's farm and give it to his next-door neighbour or nearest small farmer, whether they be good farmers or not.  The congest is given a farm somewhere in the eastern part of the country or in a less congested part of his own county.  Under that system we provide a large amount of money for an individual.  There are many people at present who, although they are good farmers, cannot afford to purchase farms costing from £5,000 to £8,000.  They may have no land or a small bit of land or they may be conacre farmers.  In this Bill there should be a section whereby the Land Commission would purchase those larger holdings and make them available at the cost price to suitable persons of the classes I mention.  They should be allowed purchase them for a lump sum, if they can afford it, or, if not, they should be allowed to place a deposit and pay the remainder over a period of years.  In other words, when a 200-acre farm is up for sale the Land Commission should take it over <Col N="461" /> and subdivide it into four or five holdings, depending on the type of person to whom they will give it.  Each portion of land should be sold at the cost price, either for the full price or a deposit and payment by way of an annuity over a period of ten, fifteen or twenty years.  Under that system you could determine the most suitable type of landowner, and the State would not be involved in very great expense as at present by having to provide holdings. That is what is happening under the present Act and possibly will happen under this Bill.  My suggestion does not rule out the relief of congestion or migrants getting land.  They deserve to get it where they have shown they are capable of using that land to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>Exceptional circumstances exist in some counties, including Donegal.  Any Bill catering for the whole country which does not take exceptional circumstances into account may not benefit the areas where these exceptional circumstances exist.  In one half of Donegal we have the larger type of farm, while in the other half we have migrants.  Strangely enough, there is no great desire on the part of migrants to move into the holdings offered to them by the Land Commission.  I know of one case where 24 different people were asked to look at a holding of 40 acres on which a new house and outoffices had been built.  They came one by one but returned to their homes saying they would prefer to stay where they were.</P>
    <P>In that same area there is a demand for land by local conacre farmers. There is a tradition of conacre farming on the larger farms.  The system of conacre farming has been handed down over three generations.  While they are prepared to pay very high prices&mdash;last year up to £40 per acre&mdash; for conacre land, they cannot afford to purchase an entire farm with farm prices reaching £6,000 or £7,000.  Those conacre farmers have built up cattle stocks and a pool of modern farm machinery, and they should be specially catered for.  An exception should be made in the order of priority which probably will be operated under this Bill.  I understand the order of priority <Col N="462" /> is that the first to be considered are the workers on the estate to be divided. Naturally when conacre lettings have been made or the farms have been let over a long number of years, you do not have workers on them.  It is not the workers' fault that they have not been workers on these particular estates or farms.  They could not be because their fathers before them have been taking those lands in conacre and they are doing the same now.  Therefore, they will not qualify under the first heading.</P>
    <P>The second type of person to qualify is the smallholder but in areas where there are no smallholders, that class falls by the board.  The third class are migrants or congests and the fourth are landless men.  Therefore we have a situation which is unsatisfactory, a situation which tends to a frame of mind which is illustrated by an example in East Donegal.  There a person bought a number of farms totalling 3,500 acres.  I do not think there is any district in Ireland where a person could acquire so much land and not cause local agitation but there has not been any agitation against the purchase of those lands.  They are being worked.  It was hoped that there might be an industry on them but instead 40 to 50 people are employed on them at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister can well imagine the situation which would arise if the Land Commission decided to take over those lands and allocate them to migrants or congests.  What would happen to the 40 people now employed there?  Would they have to emigrate or join the ranks of the unemployed?  There has been no agitation there for the simple reason that the practice operated by the Land Commission up to now of bringing in migrants means that these people know that, no matter how industrious they are or how well they have farmed conacre in the past, they cannot hope to acquire land because they are landless men.</P>
    <P>This is something the Minister should consider and I would ask that he do so.  It may be a policy matter and it may not be necessary to have it included in the Bill, but if it is necessary, I would ask that a section be put <Col N="463" /> into the Bill to cover that point.  We know that these people who operate the conacre system are first-class farmers. They must be because they start off under a very severe handicap by having to pay high prices for conacre land.</P>
    <P>In that area of East Donegal, there is a certain pool of land available for conacre lettings every year.  The practice of taking conacre is a bad system but it is a system which was forced on those people.  They have been at it for years; they have built up certain stocks and pools of machinery of the most modern kind and each year they have available to them a certain pool of conacre land.  Every farm that is taken out of that pool by the Land Commission, divided and given to migrants, reduces the pool available and increases the number of conacre applicants the following year because the migrants who come in and are allotted 30, 35 and 40 acres of land find it is not enough to carry on the necessary rotation. In the following year they themselves are candidates for the pool of conacre available.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these points before and they are important.  I would urge the Minister to give special consideration to them.  I would urge that in carrying out the provisions of this Bill and the policy enshrined in it, he take cognisance of what I have said and that any acquisition of land, sub-division of land and movement of farmers, be they large or small, should be done in such a way as to benefit the community at large and benefit the economy of the country.  Specialisation should be undertaken in such a way that the production from every acre of our land will be increased, that more people will be able to live on less land.</P>
    <P>A uniform pattern of 40 acres of land is not the best pattern.  It has been said in this House that the small farmer in the west cannot keep a family on a farm of that size and that they must have subventions from the State by way of unemployment benefits to exist.  But by specialisation in certain aspects of agriculture, a livelihood <Col N="464" /> can be obtained on some of those farms.  If we go into intensive production, whether it be poultry, pigs or vegetables, we can get better yields and better incomes even from the small farms, and if the Department of Industry and Commerce follow up by assisting to place industries in the smaller towns where these congests live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be pretty general in my comments on this Bill because it is a Bill that can be more properly debated in detail on Committee Stage.  It is a Bill containing a large number of sections ranging over a wide variety of aspects.  Therefore, the Second Reading would be best employed in the way Deputy Cunningham employed it and as I hope to do, in giving a general view of the matter.</P>
      <P>One of the jobs that I would hate if I were in the Civil Service would be to be in the land division section of the Department of Lands, because I believe it has failed in the objects for which it was instituted, land division. On the institution of the State, it was necessary that something be done. There has been a period when &ldquo;To Hell or to Connacht&rdquo; was the phrase. This produced a large number of uneconomic holdings in the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I would join other Deputies in saying that this situation is not entirely confined to the west of Ireland.  I come from Louth which would be regarded as one of the best agricultural counties in the country, a place of prosperous farmers.  Yet, there are many uneconomic holdings in Louth, holdings on which the farmer, unless he has fantastic industry or ingenuity or can do something like market gardening, finds himself unable to support his wife and children by the ordinary agricultural activities pursued by his neighbour. Indeed, it would be a mistake to accept that the congest is a problem largely related to areas of the west of Ireland. It is obvious that most of the work that has to be done must be done in places such as exist in the west of Ireland where there are so many more congests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was foreshadowed in a speech by the Taoiseach some months <Col N="465" /> ago in which he gave the details.  I remember being very critical at the time of that speech because I felt that to suggest 40 acres of land and not to vote any more money for it, would merely reduce the number of people who could be served.  That is a truism. It appears to apply to the present situation.  Therefore, while I agree that anything less than 40-45 acres at the moment, taking into account the general overheads and high costs that have invaded farming, would be quite uneconomic, at the same time, even though we have taken a step in the right direction, we do not seem to have made any great or real progress in this problem of clearing up the congestion that remains in large areas of the country.</P>
    <P>Land division is something that I personally abhor.  I know it is a necessary evil in many cases but, notwithstanding the fact that it is well known that a landless man cannot get land, if one walks into a country public house in the middle of one's constituency and if there are ten men there, I will lay an even shilling that seven of them would be with some Deputy of some Party seeking land and very often specifying a farm belonging to their neighbours which is not being worked, a farm belonging to their neighbours that was apart from the main holding, where only ordinary grazing was carried out, as the land that they would like.  While it is a necessary evil, is is something that, with the exception of the movement of the migrant from the west of Ireland to Meath or some similar place, produces greed and envy that does not bring progress to any community.</P>
    <P>A step could have been taken in this Bill away from the restriction of this whole effort to land division.  That is not the answer.  One has only to look back at the farms that were divided because their owners were grazing them, because their owners were going to the west of Ireland, to the very places where these congests could live only by breeding milch cows and bringing young cattle to market. Owners in the east of Ireland, who were in reality the finishing shops for those people, who represented the only <Col N="466" /> income these western people could get, had their lands divided because they were not ploughing them and growing wheat.</P>
    <P>Over the years it is a question of what is fashionable.  We have seen changes in Government policy.  That must be the case.  I do not suggest that there is anything wrong with the Government changing its policy from &ldquo;grow more wheat&rdquo; to &ldquo;grow less wheat&rdquo;.  I do not say there is anything wrong with the Government now lauding the stock farmer, now seeking as a main plank in their agricultural policy an increase of 50 per cent in the output of cattle from the land.  But, remember, there were many people whose lands were taken from them because they participated in what is now the main plank of Government agricultural policy.  What may be fashionable and right today may be a reason for acquiring land tomorrow. We who have to interpret policy, whether we are politicians, civil servants or lay commissioners, have to make our decisions on the basis of what pertains at the moment.  In fact, we may be wiping out a holding that in five or ten years' time might be doing the very thing that would be the policy of the Government of that day. The question of land division and compulsory acquisition of land for division is a matter that one cannot be very dogmatic about.</P>
    <P>The only time that I was ever in the Lay Commissioners' court was when I went with my parish priest to try to stop the division of land, and succeeded. It was the case of an old woman, who is dead now.  She was physically disabled.  Four miles away from her farm she had 18 acres and, naturally, she set it because she was not able to work it.  It remained set for 10 or 12 years.  She was served with notice that it would be compulsorily acquired.  It was her only source of income.  Her nephew was waiting to step in.  He is farming that land today. At that time he was not old enough or competent enough to do it.  The stage of land division should never be reached in that sort of case but I am sorry to say that over the years land has been divided in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> Another step could have been taken in this Bill to help congests.  At present Lieutenant-General Costello is setting up four factories for the processing of vegetables.  The production of vegetables for such purpose requires a very small acreage, a high degree of rainfall and gives a high level of employment on the land.  A figure given is seven hours' work on each item of production for one hour's work in the factory. The Land Commission could co-operate with the technical schools in training boys to participate in Lieutenant-General Costello's scheme on their own small holdings and make holdings bigger as far as they were concerned.  That is something that could be done in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I sincerely believe that if the Land Commission could acquire voluntarily a few holdings from those people who have turned the key in the door and gone away and if they could then get down to the education of young fellows who are there in many cases, it would be possible to get a good income from them so long as the market was there or, alternatively, by the setting up by the Department of Lands of a co-operative selling organisation that would give these fellows who were trained in horticulture a chance of living where they grew up rather than taking them and putting them into different types of soil, without any advice but to sink or swim as they liked.</P>
    <P>I know plenty of migrants who have succeeded exceedingly well in County Meath.  I know some who have been an abject failure.  A root cause of the failure was that they had a certain type of husbandry where they came from.  It worked very well in Mayo or in Galway but when they came to a different type of soil, they just were not able to make the change-over. They just were not able to look across all the ditches around where they were and to watch their neighbours who had been there all their lives tilling their lands and to note the changes they had to make in their own practices.</P>
    <P>The first thing the Land Commission would have to do is to integrate, just as in agriculture now, advisory services <Col N="468" /> with the advancement of credit.  You must integrate the issue of land, the placing of men on land, with the building-up of a confidence within them to produce the money from it.  If you do not do that you will have your percentage of failure constantly far higher than it should be.  I am sorry to say that the percentage of failures in those men who get land is too high.  It is great to see the ones who succeed but it is not so good to see the failures.</P>
    <P>I welcome this figure of 45 acres but, at the same time, if the same money is voted, it means fewer units divided. The house grants are also an excellent step forward.  They are the things that should be done and must be done. Some of them are being done in this Bill.  The retirement pensions are good but, as I read it, the provision is restricted to incapacitated owners.  I know decent old men who come down to the publichouse for a &ldquo;half one&rdquo; and who go home again and who are not incapacitated.  I do not know whether or not they will be in on this: they should.  If they are not it will be a highly restrictive measure and will not live up to the grandiose advertisement it got as it was introduced here.</P>
    <P>There are so many things that must be done which are not included in this Bill which follows the stereotyped pattern of all that has been done for congests in the past that it is difficult to list them.  Any Deputy can, from his experience and work, make up a list of all that should be done but it is something which a Government Department could more readily do.</P>
    <P>Surely there are opportunities for co-operation and joint action between the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Lands in order to keep more people on the land?  I believe this is the most important thing of all. There is no use in throwing somebody 40 acres and saying: &ldquo;Goodbye; do your best.&rdquo;  He may&mdash;and it may be good enough or not.  But, as well as agricultural education, as well as a farm apprenticeship scheme especially designed for those who are to go on the land in the congested districts, there is also necessity for the production of some sort of marketing organisation for the crops they grow when <Col N="469" /> we have helped and taught them how to grow them.  It is no good if the Minister for Lands tries to do it himself because the vast resources of knowledge, and skill, and efficiency in the Department of Agriculture should also be there.  I believe that if we could get the two Ministers and the two Departments working together on this particular problem, almost as one unit, we should find the task far easier than it seems at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins said land should be taken from those who are not working it in the required husbandry manner: I do not know what that phrase means.  It sounds like something out of the Kremlin&mdash;that if you do not plough a field from north to south, you are out or if you do it from east to west, you will immediately be liquidated.  Must we be so absolutely dogmatic and conservative about ths situation ?  Must we always believe that the fellow who for ten years has not been working his holding must be got off the land ?  I know of families who, for four or five generations, worked their land hard and then for ten or 15 years, it was in the hands of a fellow who was taking too many drinks or was going to too many race meetings.  Is it right, with the family record there for generations, to take that fellow's land from him compulsorily ?  I do not think it is.  I believe that most of these purchases must be voluntary ones.</P>
    <P>The industrialisation of the towns in the congested areas, mentioned by Deputy Collins, is a bit of a pipedream. I should love to see the west highly industrialised but when you meet an industrialist and you are from an east coast county, your trouble is to get him a mile away from Nelson Pillar, much less west of the Shannon. Even when you have an excellent number of ports and an area that lends iself to industry, those people still want to be beside Nelson Pillar.</P>
    <P>Not long ago, I heard an industrialist mention, as one of his requirements, a first-class hospital of very large size within ten miles at least of his factory. Those people have choice.  I do not think there is anything in the suggestion <Col N="470" /> by Deputy Collins.  We have to do what we can for the people on the land.  We should do the maximum where they are and, after that, we should do our best by moving them over but let us not move a man over until we have taught him the difference in the soils and in the problems he will have to contend with.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of Land Bonds. It was mentioned that the recent issue of Land Bonds is standing at 102.  I do not know whether that figure is correct: I have not seen it.  There was grave dissatisfaction about Land Bonds issued over the past 20 years.  Many times they were issued at such a low interest rate that the very moment they were given into the hands of the fellow whose land was being acquired, they were worth about 20 per cent less. An old man said to me the other day: &ldquo;You have robbed the savers and now you are asking them to save.&rdquo;  That is the problem.  Interest rates have gone up.  I do not think the Government of the day&mdash;whatever Government it was &mdash;in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s which issued Land Bonds really meant to do this.  However, there should be some insurance for the man who gets the Land Bonds and keeps them.  The man who gets the Land Bonds and sells them has the money and if they stand at 102 at the moment, he gets a little odds on the price.  If he keeps them and if the interest rate goes up, it is only fair that he should be covered for the difference in the prevailing rate as against rates in the future because that is where he is getting his income just as surely as he was getting it in the letting of his lands.</P>
    <P>The first necessity, as I have said, is a farm apprenticeship scheme; the second necessity is an integration of effort between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Lands; and the third necessity is to acquire most of the land voluntarily. Anything that comes from greed and envy does not succeed.  I hate to meet a constituent who, although I know he needs land and that he has an uneconomic holding, says to me: &ldquo;Will you put my application in for Mr. Moran's land down the road. <Col N="471" /> He is not farming.&rdquo;  I know that Mr. Moran had a heart attack, say, three years ago and that he will not farm it.  He has no son who could farm it and he will dispose of it to a relative or in some other way.</P>
    <P>In that connection, let me say this Bill does go very far forward in some aspects.  It would be inappropriate to discuss those on the Second Stage but on the Committee Stage we shall have a full and detailed debate on all the sections of it from which we hope will come changes recommended to the Minister not only from his own side and from his Department but from this side.  This is a measure where a degree of non-political action could help and where the pooling of knowledge and advice from all sides, as happened with other Bills in the last few years, could result in a better Act at the end of its passage through this House and through the Seanad. I feel sure the Minister will look at the matter in that light and I can assure him that not only will he get every co-operation but that there will be a good deal of hard work in an endeavour to improve a measure which goes forward to a certain extent but which should also, in my view, take steps in the direction I have indicated and which it does not seem to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are most anxious to see the great majority of small farmers getting a transfer or an extension to their present holding.  In part of my constituency, Leitrim, there are 8,710 uneconomic holdings.  I cannot give the figures for Sligo but I know there are very many uneconomic holdings there, too.  Due to that fact and that fact alone there are whole families leaving the homes they occupied for generations and going off to England or America.  This is not a craze as has been suggested.  It is a case of people being forced off uneconomic holdings because the whole pattern of life has changed and the cost of living has reached such a height that it is not possible for these people to struggle as they did heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told of our people coming <Col N="472" /> back to engage in industry.  Only last week I sent a letter to the Minister from a farmer who told me that nine years ago he applied for a transfer from his small uneconomic holding and since then he has been seeking a change.  He said in that letter that his two sons were in England and that if he got a farm they would be only too glad to come back and work it with him.  These cases come before us very often and bring home to us the fact that if the broad acres that are often lying idle were put to use there would be many more people working on the land instead of in England and the various other places to which they emigrate.</P>
    <P>Since I was elected, the two big problems that have come before me most often are land and unemployment. If the land problem were properly tackled, it would solve the unemployment problem because in the constituency which I represent, the people who are always making an approach for employment, particularly in the winter months, are the people who find themselves living on those uneconomic holdings.  If they got this employment, they would be able to hold on a little longer in the hope that something would turn up.  At least 50 acres of the type of land in Sligo-Leitrim would be necessary to make a livelihood for a family there.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the Minister that the Land Commission hold 4,818 acres for division in Westmeath, that they have been in possession of 7,843 acres in Meath since 1957 and that they have 2,578 acres in Kildare.  We agree that would not provide enough land for all those hungry for it, but it would ease the position appreciably if it were divided.  When so many approach me personally, I realise the enormity of the problem when I multiply that number by the number of Deputies who have been similarly approached.  Yet there are some thousands of acres of land lying idle in the various counties.  In my county a holding of more than 300 acres has been let at top rent during the past ten or 15 years, while there are so many neighbouring farmers clamouring to have those broad acres divided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> I would respectfully urge on the Minister the need for speeding this division up.  It is true to say this cannot be done overnight, but I feel a lot more could be done to expedite land division, and if this Bill serves to do that alone, it will be doubly welcome. If more people had more economic holdings, we would have in agriculture a thriving industry with resultant benefits to all.</P>
    <P>Instead, we have young men, tired of waiting, leaving the country.  They are young men who, under the present system, have not got a hope of being allocated land.  We have now come to know them as the landless men.  I attended a meeting the other night and even in that small gathering there were four or five of those young people, for all of whom I could vouch as potentially good farmers.  If they were given land, they would certainly make the best of it.  Many of them in fact are setting land but because it is far away from the labourers' cottages in which they and their families are living, they can raise only dry stock on it and therefore have to buy the milk and the other farm produce which they could well be producing on their own farms.</P>
    <P>The upshot of all this is that in my constituency the countryside is becoming more depopulated every day, more houses are being locked up, more of our young people who could very well be making comfortable livelihoods at home are getting the boat for England. To give an example of how beneficial it would be to have large tracts of land acquired and divided, only last night I was speaking to a man from Carrick-on-Shannon who told me that the division of the Rockingham estate meant that 12 families were given holdings of up to 60 acres each and that it also enabled surrounding uneconomic holdings to be extended. That meant that not only were 12 families who would otherwise have emigrated been settled at home, but that many other farmers who had been struggling for years on uneconomic holdings can now make comfortable livings.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion that many migrants have been unsuccessful when <Col N="474" /> placed on holdings away from home. There are failures in every sphere, and I submit that the proportion of failures among migrants is no higher than in other fields.  Of course, as Deputy Donegan pointed out, the extension of advisory services in the education of farmers and their families would eliminate many of the failures in future, and the Minister should see to it that there is the fullest co-operation possible between the public bodies concerned to ensure that better advisory services are available generally.</P>
    <P>A question I often ask myself is if it is possible in 1963 for somebody to walk in and say to a farmer: &ldquo;You are too old; you are not working the farm satisfactorily.  We will give it to somebody else and give you an allowance for it.&rdquo;  Coming from a rural area, I know the small farmer is as proud of his little bit of land as are the bigger men on their broad acres. The power to take their land from such men constitutes a disruption of their pattern of life.  It would be a sad day when the Land Commission would get such powers.  Personally, I do not think they would use such powers.  I think, also, that the Minister would find himself in a very awkward position if he sought to exercise these powers.</P>
    <P>It would be all very well to invoke such powers in the cases of persons who have spent all their lives in America or England and who have nobody to take over from them when they die, but I should like to point out to the Minister that this might be applied to people forced, through a stroke of bad luck with their stock or some other difficulty, to go abroad. Those people will certainly come back. The cases I mentioned earlier of farmers sons&mdash;they will come back.  I occasionally have letters from other people in England who are only too anxious to get back when the opportunity arises.  It would be a very serious matter to interfere with the rights of those people.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was first mentioned about 12 months ago, we Deputies had many people coming to us to inquire what would be the outcome.  These were people who had relatives abroad. <Col N="475" /> Those people should be protected and also those who for years have been asking for a transfer.  I hope the thousands of acres that are being set at top prices by the Land Commission will be given to people who are hungry for land.  I say: the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that we want the maximum number of Irish families living on the land of Ireland. It is difficult for anybody to speak on the land question, as I see it in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, without also having regard to agriculture because without land you cannot have agriculture.  That brings in another Department as it embraces the question of drainage into which I do not propose to go.  I merely mention this because in my contribution on agriculture, I made a suggestion about our special problems and the manner in which I thought they should be handled.</P>
      <P>There are 17,000 holdings in my constituency and of those, 13,000 are under £20 valuation and therefore uneconomic. Various speakers here went back to the days of the Land League and Michael Davitt.  In those days also we had a Dillon very interested in the land problem in the west.  He did a tremendous amount of work and his name has been remembered and will always be remembered as &ldquo;Honest John&rdquo; Dillon for his work on behalf of the smallholders of the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill or any Bill which tends to improve the situation of the smallholders in the west.  Perhaps it is a happy circumstance that the Minister introducing this Bill is himself a west of Ireland man.  There may be shortcomings in the Bill but it is a step in the right direction and I heartily congratulate the Minister on it.  So far as its implementation is concerned, it will have my full support.  Before it is <Col N="476" /> finalised, I am sure the Minister will accept amendments, if necessary.  This is an important contribution towards the relief of congestion in the west which is a very serious problem and one that will not be solved overnight.</P>
    <P>My first reaction to the Bill was that the Minister had my sympathy because the problem is so great that it will be very difficult to solve even given time.  I doubt if it will be solved in the next 20 years.  I believe the Minister will make the Bill work; I know he will do his best and I hope that we shall give him every facility to do so.</P>
    <P>Probably the first snag that arises is that the land is not there to divide. If we want to have 40-45 acre farms in the west, we know you must get people out one way or another because the land is not there.  The only solution I see is migration.  The number of acres in the midlands in the hands of the Land Commission&mdash;15,000, I think&mdash;has been mentioned.  That would solve a problem for 200 or 300 families, but I hope I do not drop a bombshell on my countymen in Sligo when I say that I have discovered, by question and answer here, that in spite of the fact that Sligo is in the congested areas for all purposes and all Departments, it is not, and never was considered to be in the congested areas from the point of view of migration through the Land Commission. We had one migration in the past six or seven years and that man was actually across the border in Mayo. He had some land in Sligo and consequently he was regarded as a Sligoman. I ask the Minister to look into this point and to ensure that Sligo will be regarded by the Land Commission as a congested county in respect of migration.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, December 4th, 1963.</P>

      <P>In the school-year, 1961/62, classes and courses were given under the auspices of vocational education committees at 456 centres, other than permanent vocational schools, throughout the country.  The types of premises used were very varied, and included parish halls, hospitals and other institutions, national schools, industrial schools and private dwellinghouses. The drawing up of a comprehensive list of the premises used for the purpose of these classes and courses and of the further information requested by the Deputy in regard to them would entail such an expenditure of time and labour on the part of Vocational Education Committees and the Department as would not be warranted by the result.  In general, however, classes and courses provided at non-permanent centres are conducted by full-time and part-time teachers whose main employment is in permanent vocational schools.</P>
