      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach if, in view of his statements that no matter what the outcome of the EEC negotiations free trade was inevitable, it is the Government's intention, irrespective of the outcome of these negotiations, to adhere to the tariff dismantlement policy suggested to the EEC as the rhythm most likely to suit the Irish economy.</P>

    <P>I have already indicated that, as soon as a clear situation emerges out of <Col N="442" /> the crisis in the negotiations for Britain's application for membership of the European Economic Community, it is my intention to make a statement of Government policy on our position.</P>

Should the Deputy wish to repeat this portion of his question in, say, a fortnight from now, I expect that the information will be available.  With regard to the other two years mentioned the number of deaths from tuberculosis (all forms) was 468 in 1960 and 420 in 1961 and the number of deaths from cancer (including Hodgkin's disease and leukaemia) was 4,761 in 1960 and 4,704 in 1961.</P>

The association operates in all areas except Cork where the local health authority provides its own mass-radiography service.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that much hardship is caused to the people of Kenmare, County Kerry and the surrounding areas, because no permanent appointment has been made to the post of dispensary and hospital doctor in Kenmare, and because the dispensary doctor at Tuosist has for some time been carrying out the duties of this post in addition to his own; and what steps he proposes to take to remedy the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy. According to my information, for more than a year, since 11th January, 1962, the duties of the post have been discharged by a medical officer appointed <Col N="445" /> on a temporary basis following advertisement.</P>
      <P>The future organisation of the medical services in this area is under examination and permanent arrangements cannot be made until that examination is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that since the permanent officer took up a position in Dublin at the end of 1961 the county manager has found it almost impossible to get a substitute? At various times the Tuosist dispensary doctor had to attend to two dispensaries and Kenmare hospital under great hardship and at great inconvenience to himself, working almost day and night.  Almost four months elapsed before a temporary doctor was got.  That is why the people want this post filled permanently&mdash; immediately if possible.  There is another matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In normal circumstances, my policy normally has been that a local government doctor should not hold more than one local government appointment, that is, we cannot have one practitioner monopolising all the official posts in the dispensary district or other administrative area.  With regard to the position in Kenmare, there has been no great difficulty. Occasionally, of course, dispensary posts become vacant and are vacant for a few weeks, but in those circumstances the neighbouring doctor always acts as <i>locum</i> or in a temporary capacity, until the vacancy is filled. This appointment has been filled since January last year quite satisfactorily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a statement of the conditions governing the grants payable in these cases.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">CONDITIONS OF PAYMENT OF GRANTS FOR THE PROVISION OF FREE BOOKS FOR NECESSITOUS CHILDREN IN NATIONAL SCHOOLS.</P>
      <P>1.  The State grant will be paid on the basis of the number of children enrolled in the second and higher standards in the school on the 1st July of the preceding school year.  No grant will be payable in respect of children enrolled in infants' or first standards.</P>
      <P>2.  The grant will be paid, on application, to the manager, to be applied to the best advantage in the provision of school books for necessitous children attending the school.</P>
      <P>3.  The amount of the grant will, except as provided at (4) and (5) be calculated on the basis of eight pence per pupil on all pupils enrolled in second and higher standards.  (Note: The fund thus made available must be applied in the provision of books for necessitous children only.  It is not necessary, however, to divide the fund equally among the necessitous children concerned).</P>
      <P>4.  No grant will be paid in respect of schools in which there are no children enrolled who are deemed to be necessitous for the purpose of this scheme.  The Minister may, at his discretion, refuse a grant, or allow a reduced grant only, to a school in which the number of necessitous children enrolled is small or a school enjoying an endowment or other grants which may be applied in whole or in part for the provision of free books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> 5.  The Minister may, at his discretion, allow an increased grant to schools in Gaeltacht areas or in the County Boroughs in which at least 50 per cent. of the pupils are deemed to be necessitous for the purpose of this scheme.  The grant in such cases, however, may not exceed one shilling and fourpence per pupil on the number of children enrolled in second and higher standards.</P>
    <P>6.  The principal teacher shall keep a record of the amount of the grant received and details of its disbursement.</P>
    <P>7.  Books supplied to necessitous pupils under this Scheme shall be deemed to be the property of the school.</P>
    <P>8.  Each pupil should be instructed to keep the books clean and have them covered.  The books should be collected from each pupil at the end of each school year or when the pupil passes on to a higher standard or leaves the school.</P>
    <P>9.  In the operation of the scheme claims of very necessitous children such as those whose parents are in receipt of home assistance, widows' pensions or financial aid from charitable organisations, or are casual workers in receipt of very small wages, should be met as fully as possible before the claims of the less needy are considered.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONDITIONS FOR PAYMENT OF GRANTS FOR THE PROVISION OF SCHOOL REQUISITES IN NATIONAL SCHOOLS.</P>
    <P>1.  A first stock of school requisites is furnished gratuitously to each school in proportion to the average number of children in attendance.</P>
    <P>2.  When an unsuitable schoolhouse has been superseded by a suitable schoolhouse or when there has been a considerable enlargement or structural improvement of a schoolhouse, a special free stock of school requisites may be granted on the recommendation of the inspector.</P>
    <P>3.  Money expended on furniture, apparatus, or repairs cannot be taken into account in deciding a claim for a special free stock.</P>
    <P>4.  These requisites should be kept as <Col N="466" /> a school stock, for which the master or mistress is held responsible, and must not be sold or taken out of the school.</P>
    <P>5.  The school record books are furnished gratuitously to the schools, and are State property.</P>
    <P>6.  No school record book may be removed from the school except by the inspector, or with his express sanction.</P>
    <P>7.  Scale of grants of school requisites made to new schools, etc.</P>

The Commissioners of Public Works will prepare working drawings for the first two schools when a water supply has been made available in each case.  In view of the declining numbers in the Ellybay district the question of providing a permanent school transport service for the children instead of erecting a new school is being investigated by the Department at the Reverend Manager's request.</P>
      <P>The site originally offered for the proposed new school at Doohoma was found to be unsuitable.  The Commissioners of Public Works have been asked to inspect an alternative site offered by the Reverend Manager.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I propose to take together the two Bills, one amending the Industrial Grants Acts and the other the Undeveloped Areas Acts, because of the close connection of the two and because the Deputies will wish to compare the changes which are being proposed in the legislation covering the two areas of the country.</P>
      <P>The existing legislation is due to expire on the 31st December, 1963, and I think it necessary to continue it beyond that date.  The emergence of problems in relation to certain projects, such as those projects with a relatively high capital and low employment content, also makes it necessary to seek amending legislation.  Industrial firms, moreover, have now to adapt themselves to free trade conditions and will incur expenditure in doing so.  It is desirable, and this is the appropriate time, to provide special financial assistance to industry to enable it to prepare for the new situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main changes proposed in this Bill and the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Bill are the removal of the limit of £250,000 for grants which may be authorised by An Foras Tionscal outside the undeveloped areas; the fixing of new limits for grants which may be given by the Board; the substitution of a single composite grant for the separate grants for buildings and equipment; the introduction of adaptation and extension <Col N="470" /> grants for the purpose of enabling firms to prepare for free trade conditions; the extension of the powers of An Foras Tionscal to enable them to give grants in areas outside the undeveloped areas for the training of workers and the construction and repair of roads, bridges, etc; the increase in the amount available for grants from £15 million to £20 million and the revocation of the expiry date of the present legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the present scale of grants, buildings rank for higher grants than plant and machinery.  In the undeveloped areas, for example, the grant for sites and buildings may be as great as the full cost, while the grant in respect of machinery and equipment may not exceed one half the cost.  Outside the undeveloped areas the grant in respect of sites and buildings may be two-thirds of the cost, while the grant in respect of machinery and equipment may not exceed one-third of the cost.  As the relationship between the cost of buildings and plant and machinery may vary widely from one industry to another, it is not considered necessary to preserve the present distinction between grants for building and grants for plant and machinery.  It is, accordingly, proposed that the amending legislation should provide that a composite maximum sum should be paid towards the cost of buildings, sites, machinery and equipment.</P>
    <P>Taking first the case of projects involving smaller grants, that is grants not exceeding £250,000, the proposal is that the composite grant should not be more than two-thirds of the cost of the fixed assets in the case of projects in the undeveloped areas.  Outside the undeveloped areas the grant will normally be limited to half of the fixed assets, but provision is made that a grant of up to two-thirds of this cost may be given in exceptional circumstances and where the Board are of opinion that there are sound economic reasons why the industry cannot be established or developed in the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>There has been strong pressure from various quarters in recent times for the removal of the distinction, in the maxima for grants, between the undeveloped areas and the rest of the <Col N="471" /> country, and the Government have considered this aspect of the grant legislation very carefully.  They have come to the conclusion, however, that it is still necessary to preserve a distinction in favour of the undeveloped areas and this is being provided for in the case of grants of up to £250,000.  At the same time it will be easier to secure such grants up to a maximum of 50 per cent. in other areas as it will no longer be necessary for promoters to establish that their projects are of exceptional national importance and cannot be established in the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>An Foras Tionscal will be able, in certain circumstances, to apply the undeveloped areas scale of grant to projects located outside the undeveloped areas.  Unlike the provision in the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, which enabled An Foras Tionscal to apply the undeveloped areas scale of grant to projects outside the undeveloped areas only where the Minister for Industry and Commerce had previously made an Order extending the scope of the Act to the particular area concerned, under the new provisions An Foras Tionscal will have power, in certain circumstances, to give higher grants for projects outside the undeveloped areas without any action on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>While An Foras Tionscal will have a greater degree of autonomy in so far as they will have power to give higher grants without a prior ministerial order, the circumstances in which higher grants may be given are more stringent than in the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation lays down no criteria for ministerial orders extending the scope of the undeveloped areas and, where an order is made in respect of a particular area, An Foras Tionscal are not obliged to have regard to any considerations other than those generally applicable to grants for projects in the undeveloped areas.  Under the new legislation, before giving a higher grant, An Foras Tionscal will require to be of opinion that there are sound economic reasons why the <Col N="472" /> particular project cannot be established in the undeveloped areas and, in addition, must be of opinion that other exceptional circumstances exist.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of this Bill will also be relevant in the approach of the Board to requests for higher grants outside the undeveloped areas.  In addition to the specific requirements laid down in Section 2, this section imposes on the Board the obligation of having special regard in their general operations to the need for attracting industries to the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>Large-scale projects&mdash;most of which have so far been located outside the undeveloped areas &mdash; in respect of which promoters seek grants in excess of £250,000 and also, in some instances, loan finance accommodation, have presented serious difficulties under the present arrangements and the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal have stressed the need for providing a means of resolving these difficulties and removing the present state of uncertainty in the minds of industrial promoters as to what grants would ultimately be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The test now applicable&mdash;that is a substantial employment content&mdash;in a case in which An Foras Tionscal would recommend to the Government that there should be a grant in excess of £250,000 has been found unsuitable for major projects.  After long consideration of the problem and the examination of various possibilities, including that of State participation in such projects, the following proposals appear to the Government to offer the best solution: (i) the removal of the limit of £250,000 so that the Board of An Foras Tionscal will be able to give grants in excess of this figure.  The Board, however, may not give grants in excess of either 50 per cent. of the fixed assets or a sum calculated at the rate of £1,000 per worker, estimated by An Foras Tionscal to be employed in the industry when in full production, whichever of these two sums is the lesser.  Should, however, the proposed grant exceed £500,000, the Board will require my consent and that of the Minister for <Col N="473" /> Finance.  These proposals have been written into the two Bills which also provide that, if either of the two limits I have mentioned, namely, 50 per cent. of the fixed assets or £1,000 per worker, be exceeded in the case of any proposed grant, it will be necessary to obtain the consent of the Government before the grant can be approved.</P>
    <P>(ii) the setting up of a separate Finance Company, which would be managed by the Industrial Credit Company and financed directly by State funds to provide, on preferential terms, in lieu of a larger grant than would be available under the limits I have just mentioned, a proportion of any loan finance required.  The Industrial Credit Company, itself, would be available to provide further loan finance on commercial terms.  The Minister for Finance has under consideration at the moment the legislation which will be needed for the formation of a semi-State holding Company, to be managed by the Industrial Credit Company which may, <i>inter alia,</i> grant loans where An Foras Tionscal make a grant.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the combined amount of grant and loan, on preferential terms and otherwise, to be provided by the Board, the new Finance Company and the Industrial Credit Company, for any project will not exceed two-thirds of the fixed assets thus ensuring that promoters themselves will provide at least one-third of the fixed assets.  Subject to these arrangements, the Industrial Credit Company and the proposed new Finance Company would between them provide loan capital up to a maximum representing the full amount of the balance of the cost of the fixed assets, over and above the total provided by way of grants and promoters' contribution.</P>
    <P>One half of the loan would be a contract loan provided by the Industrial Credit Company at commercial interest rates, repayable over 12 years, with no capital repayment for the first two years.  The other half of the loan would be made by the new Finance Company on the basis that it would be repayable only at the option of the <Col N="474" /> borrower and would be free of interest for seven years.  Thereafter this loan would bear interest at a rate not less than that of the contract loan and at such a level as to act as a spur to promoters to repay the loan.  If the promoters do not repay it then the State through the proposed new Finance Company, would share in the profits of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>The question as to which of the two limits&mdash;50 per cent. of the fixed assets or £1,000 per worker &mdash; will be the effective one will, of course, depend on the employment content of the project. For a project with a sizeable employment content, the effective limit will be 50 per cent. of the fixed assets. The case of the capital-intensive project is also catered for, and for such a project the effective limit will be £1,000 per worker.  So, for example, if we take a project of which the total capital cost is £1,200,000 and which is estimated to give employment ultimately to 300 workers, the maximum grant which the Board may give would be £300,000.  In the same case the promoters could, subject to the decisions of the appropriate bodies, obtain a further £500,000, of which £250,000 would be a loan from the Industrial Credit Company and £250,000 an interest-free loan from the new Finance Company.  The balance of £400,000 representing one-third of the cost of the fixed assets, would be provided by the promoters themselves.</P>
    <P>It is my view that these new grant and loan arrangements are very necessary at the present time and, indeed, I fear that, failing their introduction, the possibility of attracting to this country large-scale projects will be seriously diminished.  I believe that the adoption of these proposals will considerably improve the prospects of securing the establishment here of really worthwhile industries.</P>
    <P>It has already been announced that the Government intend to introduce special grants for the purpose of enabling industry to adapt itself to free trade conditions and proposals for such grants are contained in the two Bills&mdash;Section 4.  It will be seen that the Bills provide for the making <Col N="475" /> of grants up to one-quarter of the cost of schemes for the enlargement or adaptation of industrial undertakings. Adaptation expenditure on plant, equipment and buildings will qualify for these forms of assistance, provided the project satisfies the test of competitiveness. Capital programmes of a kind designed to expand productive capacity, which would not qualify for a grant under existing legislation, will be covered by the proposed arrangements, as well as re-equipment not involving expansion.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that these grants should be an alternative to loans on special terms from the Industrial Credit Company for industrial re-equipment. In a case where a firm might not consider the 25 per cent grant to be adequate, it would have the option of applying instead to the Industrial Credit Company for a special re-equipment loan.  These special loans will cover a proportion, to be settled in each case by the Industrial Credit Company, of the expenditure involved and will be granted where that company is satisfied that there is a definite prospect that the re-equipment project will make the undertaking fully competitive.  Firms will, of course, also be free to obtain ordinary loans either from the Industrial Credit Company or from some other source.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that the purpose of these grants and loans is to help finance re-equipment and re-adaptation, not simply routine replacement. In this connection, it is likely that, amongst the criteria to be observed, will be a comparison of the expenditure proposed by a firm with its capital expenditure, together with expenditure on renewals and maintenance, in recent years, for the purpose of ascertaining whether, in fact, the firm's proposals involve accelerated expenditure.</P>
    <P>The object of these adaptation and re-equipment grants and loans is to enable firms to make themselves fully competitive and so the position could well arise that their effect would be to help a firm to compete with an existing <Col N="476" /> Irish competitor.  This is a position which must be accepted.  Even when the home suppliers are already meeting the home market in full, applicants would still be regarded as eligibile for grants, provided that there is some possibility that they could break into the export market.  Such a situation could, in fact, provide an incentive to seek export outlets rather than engage in unprofitable competition on the home market.</P>
    <P>A further change proposed in the Bill, Sections 5 and 6, is to enable the Board to give grants for the training of workers and for the construction of roads, bridges, etc. in the case of projects situated outside the undeveloped areas.  The Board already has power to give such grants in the case of projects within the undeveloped areas.  No upper limit for the amount of these grants is being proposed.  It would be unrealistic, if not impossible, to attempt to arrive at any estimates on which maxima could be based.</P>
    <P>However, expenditure for these purposes in the undeveloped areas has been quite small and there is no reason to suppose that the position in this regard will undergo any radical change in the future.  Up to the 31st December, 1962, grants towards the cost of training workers, totalling £134,000, were approved by the Board.  No grants have been given specifically for the construction of roads, bridges, etc.</P>
    <P>Little needs to be said about the remaining provisions of the Bills.  The existing legislation is due to expire on 31st December, 1963, and it is proposed to revoke this provision and leave the date of expiry indefinite.  The aggregate amount of the grants which may be given under the existing Acts may not exceed £15 million.  With the removal of the expiry date, the introduction of new limits and new types of grant, it is necessary to increase this figure and a revised limit of £20 million is specified in Section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen the CIO Report on Industrial Grants which has been published and the announcement made by the Government indicating their attitude towards the proposals in the Report.  One of the principal <Col N="477" /> proposals in the Report is that a small number of centres should be established for development and provision made for a grant differential in favour of these centres.  This proposal will be considered with the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  The remaining proposals in the Report are acceptable generally and effect is being given to them in the Bills, or will be given administratively within the framework of the revised legislation.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to understand fully the implications of these two Bills, it is necessary briefly to summarise the provisions of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, and the Industrial Grants Act, 1956.  The 1952 Act established An Foras Tionscal and empowered them to buy land, build factories and provide other services, such as drainage, sewerage and so on. The Board were empowered to make grants for the provision of machinery and equipment to an industrial undertaking in any undeveloped area.  The grant in this case is not to exceed more than half of the cost.  There were further grants for the training of workers for new industries in the undeveloped areas which the Board were empowered to make.  The total to be provided under the 1952 Act was fixed at £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Grants Act, 1956, empowered the Industrial Development Authority, where the Authority were satisfied that the money was needed to establish an industrial undertaking for the manufacture of a commodity, to make a grant for the acquisition, construction and adaptation of buildings or works required for the purposes of the undertaking. The maximum grant which could be made was two-thirds of the cost involved or £50,000, whichever was the lesser.  The total under the Act was fixed at £2 million.  In 1957, the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Act increased the grants under the 1952 Act to £4 million and the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, repealed the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, completely and transferred the functions from the <Col N="478" /> Industrial Development Authority to An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>Under Section 2 of the 1959 Act, provision was made for making grants in respect of industrial undertakings not in undeveloped areas as follows: two-thirds of the cost of acquiring land, constructing buildings and providing other services in connection with the land; one-third of the cost of providing machinery and equipment for an industrial undertaking, the maximum grant to be £250,000.  Power, however, was given to the Government in subsection (5) of Section 2 to approve of grants being made in excess of £250,000 where the Government were satisfied, having regard to the amount of employment likely to be afforded by the undertaking and where they thought it proper to give such approval.  The total of the grants to be given under the Act was fixed at a maximum of £10 million. These provisions of the 1959 Act are now being altered by the present Industrial Grants Bill.  The grants, as I understand it, are to be divided into two classes, depending upon whether or not the total amount of the cost of the industrial undertaking is less than or exceeds £250,000.  Subsection (2) provides that where the total cost of the undertaking is not more than £250,000 grants up to two-thirds of the cost may be made where these relate to the acquisition of land, construction and so on, and grants up to half the total in any other case.  This proposal will be generally welcomed as an effort to meet the needs of industrial development and expansion.</P>
    <P>It is relevant at this stage to refer to the different attitude which is available to the Minister from this side of the House when he introduces these proposals, compared with the attitude adopted by the present Taoiseach when the 1956 Act was going through.  At that time the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, criticised the 1956 Act which was introduced by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, although subsequently in the Act repealing it in 1959 the provisions were continued. It was obvious that he had by then accepted the wisdom of the policy operated by the inter-Party Government and covered in the 1956 Act. <Col N="479" /> Deputy Lemass at column 1950 of volume 160 said:</P>
    <P>It is not easy for a Party in opposition to vote against a measure introduced by a Government in office to give money for nothing to anybody and Deputies will appreciate my political difficulty in that regard but, speaking quite frankly and honestly, I believe that this Bill introduces an undesirable principle in the operation of industrial policy, that it is unnecessary, that the aid which industry requires is not this type of aid and that the whole origin of the Bill is the inability of the Government to think beyond the surface of things, to get down to an understanding of real causes which are holding up national development, their desire to appear to be doing something, whether they get results or not, in order to safeguard their political position for the time being.</P>
    <P>As I say, subsequently Deputy Lemass accepted the wisdom of the inter-Party Government and on a number of occasions the present Minister and the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, have given facts and figures of the number of undertakings that have been established, their employment content and the general industrial expansion that has flowed from the policy initiated in the 1956 Industrial Grants Act which was subsequently developed and extended, and which is now being further developed under these two measures.</P>
    <P>One comment that falls to be made on the present measures is that some time it would be an advantage to get all these grants and the various provisions of the Undeveloped Areas Act and the Industrial Grants Act into one measure.  It is extremely difficult to follow in view of the changes that have been made and the fact that different titles deal with more or less the same thing.</P>
    <P>At a certain stage a person dealing with the Industrial Grants Act has to refer to the Undeveloped Areas Act and on another occasion has to refer back to the Industrial Grants Act.  I believe <Col N="480" /> there is a very strong case for amalgamation of this legislation into a single Act where it will be clear to all concerned what is involved.</P>
    <P>There are certain other aspects of the matter which I believe require attention at present.  The purposes behind these two measures have already been indicated in the CIO reports where problems concerning industrial development in the context of the Common Market were exhaustively examined.  The problems which will arise, the difficulties to be surmounted and the changes necessary to meet conditions were considered in the CIO report under four main headings. Paragraph 16 of the interim report on what had to be granted to industry to adapt itself to meet Common Market conditions states:</P>
    <P>Four broad problems can be distinguished, namely: (1) re-equipment within substantially the same field of activity; (2) adaptation which involves a switch from one field of activity to another; (3) inducements to new enterprises to go to places where workers are being unemployed in significant numbers; (4) the continuing problem of diversifying and deepening the industrial base.</P>
    <P>These four headings cover the major difficulties which are likely to arise.  The proposals in the Bill provide the means whereby financial assistance can be provided for industrial undertakings.  It is because of these reports and because of the provisions included in these Bills that I think it necessary to ascertain what Government policy on the most important aspect of the problem is and to consider Government policy in the light of the comments made in two published documents, one of which is <i>Economic Development,</i> chapter 16, paragraphs 13 and 14 on page 160. Paragraph 13 states:</P>
    <P>Since the home market has been largely catered for, further industrial development must depend largely on exports.  Tariffs and quota protection are at best only of limited use in this context.  A realistic appraisal indicates that if we are to have any hope of success and, <Col N="481" /> indeed, if not deliberately to add to our already severe handicaps we must site our industries at or convenient to, the larger centres of population where internal and external transport facilities are best and supplies of skilled and unskilled labour, fuel, water etc. are readily available.  This is not to ignore the possibility that there may be special economic advantages in doing otherwise in certain cases. Even with such siting transport costs to and from external markets will be a heavy handicap on our exporters as compared with their competitors who are, in most cases, better placed in such matters as capital resources, experience and techniques.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 14 which follows, states:</P>
    <P>In our present circumstances, with virtually the whole country undeveloped, it seems wasteful to subsidise remote areas especially by providing more extensive grants. Such subsidisation of this kind entails additional burdens on the community as a whole and retards progress in the most suitable areas where a concentrated effort could give better results.</P>
    <P>This problem is further considered in the fourth interim report by the CIO in paragraph 22 on page 10 which states, having reviewed the matter and having expressed the opinion that in certain areas a number of small towns were prospering and that these towns offered advantages for industrial enterprises:</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we are satisfied for the reasons set out in the succeeding paragraphs that direction of industrial grants policy towards achieving a widespread dispersal of industry would in the circumstances facing us under free trade, be economically unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>They go on to give a variety of reasons why that is so.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to read the report further because it is available to Deputies and they can see the reasons advanced there.  What I want to impress on the Minister is that those are two published documents, one of <Col N="482" /> which has been approved by the Government and the other issued as a Government White Paper.  I want to know what exactly is the policy being pursued when one considers Section 8 of the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill now before us? Anyone who reads the section, of course, will realise that it is meaningless. It states:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions the Board shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of decentralising industry and of attracting industries to the undeveloped areas and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
    <P>I believe that Section 8 should be deleted because it imposes no effective direction or control on Foras Tionscail or on the Industrial Development Authority.  The Board may read the section at the meeting but they are not obliged to implement it in practice and there is no machinery whereby the Board can be forced to implement it or whereby some sanction will operate if the Board refuse to implement it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is directly in conflict with the views expressed in <i>Economic Development</i> and with the opinion expressed in the CIO report which considered this matter exhaustively. There are already in the Undeveloped Areas Act ample directives to the Board to consider the needs of these areas and the changes being made in these two measures have been made in the light of the experience that has been gained as well as the practical, economic, transport and other difficulties which arise in the context of freer trade and which will face industrial undertakings should we become a member of EEC.</P>
    <P>The other great problem which these two measures are designed to deal with is the retraining of workers and the provision of financial assistance for the retraining of these workers who will be disemployed.  I am anxious to find out something which I believe is a matter which is uppermost in the minds of most workers who may be affected by any changes or dislocation attendant on membership, or in the light of the developments <Col N="483" /> which will result from our membership of the Common Market or any other consequences of the development of the Common Market elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As I understand the Treaty of Rome, there is provision whereby financial assistance may be provided from the Social Fund for the retraining and readaptation of workers whose employment has terminated because of the Common Market.  That is reasonably satisfactory so far as it goes, but it deals with only part of the problem. It depends to a very great extent on what is involved for each individual worker and for each individual group of workers.  Some types of industrial employment and some occupations will readily lend those employed in them to re-training, although a short course in special techniques may be necessary, but there are other factors besides re-training involved.</P>
    <P>The question of the age of the worker when re-training must be considered. If a person is obliged to leave his employment when he is in his twenties or thirties, he is necessarily easier to train than a person in his forties or fifties.  At the same time, if a person is in a highly specialised type of employment, it may be less easy for him to be re-adapted or re-trained to other categories.  Individuals differ, of course, and the training involved for one may be inadequate for another, although both have been engaged in the same occupations.</P>
    <P>While that may deal with the question of the worker being re-trained, re-equipped and above all, re-employed, the real problem will arise for those workers who, because of the effect of the Common Market, will find themselves permanently disemployed. I believe this will affect a great many in the upper age groups.  What I want to ascertain from the Minister is to what extent, should this country become a member of the EEC, we will be entitled to draw on the Social Fund for retirement or pension purposes.  As I understand the Social Fund, as it at present operates or as it would operate in the event of membership being <Col N="484" /> extended, it will only apply to re-training or re-adaptation for the interim period between ceasing in one employment and being re-employed in another occupation.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, a great many workers will be affected to the extent that they will find it impossible, or virtually impossible, to get worthwhile new occupations.  Those workers and their families are naturally most anxious to ascertain what are their rights and entitlement.  Will these persons have available to them resort to the Social Fund to provide adequate retirement pay or pensions, in addition to the provisions which apply to those who will be retrained?  We have had here limited experience, mainly in the case of the transport undertaking, where, due to the closure of lines, persons employed in CIE find themselves moved from one district to another. Those of us who have had experience of these cases realise what difficulties are involved for the individual concerned, particularly for married people with families, and what complete dislocation it means in the whole domestic position of these workers and their families.  The problem has not been a very great one because the numbers involved are relatively small.</P>
    <P>If the EEC develops to the extent envisaged, the effect on a great many workers will be considerable.  The prospect of re-employment for some may be reasonable enough, but for a great many the future will be one in which they and their families must naturally feel considerable anxiety.  For that reason I believe a clear and authoritative statement should be made of the position which will arise and of the entitlement of workers to resort to the Social Fund to meet these problems and to meet their needs and requirements.</P>
    <P>These are the two main matters involved in this&mdash;the extent to which attention is being paid or official policy implemented in respect of the recommendations and comments made in <i>Economic Development</i> and the other comments made in the CIO Report, and the problem which will arise for workers disemployed, either temporarily or permanently.  The legislation <Col N="485" /> involved here is directly attributable to the consideration of some of these problems that has been undertaken by the CIO.  Everybody recognises the value of the reports which have been furnished by that Committee.  The various matters that have come before that Committee have already been the subject of exhaustive and intense examination and investigation.  The findings reported in these various CIO Reports&mdash;so far as these measures are concerned, the fourth Interim Report &mdash;enable us to consider the matter in the light of the specialised knowledge of the members of that Committee as well as the experience and information available to them from what has appeared elsewhere.  It will undoubtedly be generally recognised that the financial and other changes made in these two measures are designed to provide the incentive, both financial or otherwise, necessary to meet the changed conditions.  It is to some extent difficult to discuss this matter in the light of the present stage of the EEC negotiations.  But whatever the ultimate result of the present discussions, it is obvious that freer trade generally appears to be on the horizon, not only for the members of the EEC but for Europe as a whole.  That situation will inevitably have reactions and repercussions here.  To face that situation the changes made in the legislation now before us offer the prospect of at least meeting it in a better position than if the measures were not introduced.</P>

They take cognisance of developments which have taken place in recent years and clearly indicate an appreciation of the society into which we are likely to be precipitated on the <Col N="486" /> setting up of the European Common Market and of our possible adherence to it.  Like Deputy Cosgrave, I remember that when we introduced the Industrial Grants Bill, in 1956 we were told by the present Taoiseach that it was a needless Bill, that it was not necessary at all.  We were told we were giving money away to people for nothing and that, as far as he was concerned, it was quite an undesirable precedent to establish, especially in areas outside the undeveloped areas. That was in 1956.  This is 1963, seven years afterwards, and the purpose of these two Bills taken together is to provide even much more money, free of charge, outside the undeveloped areas than was contemplated in 1956. In other words, the Taoiseach has swallowed all he said in 1956.</P>
      <P>By the introduction of these Bills he admits he was guilty of a fundamental economic misconception and he now comes to the House and says: &ldquo;Pass these two Bills which not only do what you did in 1956 but in this case do it even more generously&rdquo;. I suppose everybody has to be pleased that the effluxion of time and years brings wisdom, and the fact that the Taoiseach now realises that what he was talking about in 1956 was just so much hastily ejected hot air is an occasion for congratulation.  It is also an occasion for congratulation when you see a more sane approach to the problem of industrial development as envisaged here.</P>
      <P>One of the characteristics of the Industrial Development Act of 1952 was that it did put a substantial emphasis on the establishment of new industries in the undeveloped areas at a time when there was general agreement in the House that everything possible should be done to rescue these areas from the plight of no industries and, in consequence, a low standard of employment and a low standard of living.  The House at the time generally approved the idea of giving these areas every possible chance to make good and survive and, at the same time, to make a contribution towards the development of our economic fabric.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> As time went on, and through the medium of the grants made possible under the Undeveloped Areas Act, many of these places were enabled to secure industries and, in time, became better off than many places outside the undeveloped areas.  The result of that you will find if you look at the undeveloped areas to-day and look at the areas outside which are presumed inferentially to mean the developed areas.  You will find that in the so-called undeveloped areas more industries exist to-day than exist in the outer areas, the so-called developed areas. In other words, in many instances&mdash; I do not say in all instances by any means&mdash;towns outside the undeveloped areas are less equipped and less well off from the point of view of industrial development than many towns inside the industrial development areas.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that that process continues and now there is a recognition, as there was in the 1956 Industrial Grants Act, that something should be done to help the areas outside the undeveloped areas, that, in other words, there should be some attraction for an industrialist to go to a town and establish an industry outside the undeveloped areas.  The Industrial Grants Act was an effort to meet the needs in that respect and to some extent to meet the needs, without, at the same time, harming the undeveloped areas.  Now, because of the fact that the European Economic Community has projected itself on the European scene and is calculated possibly to change the whole course of Irish economics and, indeed, of Irish political history, we find it necessary to have another look at the whole situation.  The other look at the situation, produced and crystallised in the Report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation, has shown the necessity for bringing about a much greater equalisation in the grants available to the undeveloped areas as well as those areas outside the undeveloped areas, and these two Bills taken jointly provide that the grants will be available both in the undeveloped areas and outside.</P>
    <P>Even when the present Government <Col N="488" /> amended the Industrial Grants Act of 1956, as they did in 1959, I think there was a provision in the amended Act that you could not get a grant to establish yourself outside the undeveloped areas unless you could establish that the industry was of a kind which could not be established within the undeveloped areas.  That, of course, meant that quite a number of industrialists who wanted to establish industries along the eastern seaboard saw that they could not do so unless they could establish that the same industry could not be established in the west or along the western seaboard, but if they were unable to show that the industry could not be established in the undeveloped areas their prospects of securing a grant from An Foras Tionscal were not bright.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister has now recognised the necessity for a change in that respect because, recommending the Bill to the Dáil, he says:</P>
    <P>There has been strong pressure from various quarters in recent times for the removal of the distinction in the maxima for grants between the undeveloped areas and the rest of the country and the Government have considered this aspect of the legislation very carefully. They have come to the conclusion, however, that it is still necessary to preserve a distinction in favour of the undeveloped areas and this is being provided for in the case of grants up to £250,000.  At the same time it would be easier to secure such grants up to a maximum of 50 per cent, in other areas as it will be no longer necessary for promoters to establish that their projects are of exceptional national importance and cannot be established in the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, there has been a substantial easement of the whole situation by reason of this change in the Bill&mdash;that is in the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill which has been effected by the repeal of a section in the 1959 amending Bill.</P>
    <P>While, as I said, the general objective aimed at in both Bills is praiseworthy, there are some aspects of the matter to which I should like to make <Col N="489" /> reference.  One is the suggestion contained in Page 7 of the Minister's circulated opening statement.  He refers to the facilities which will be available in future for the establishment of industries: grants will be made available and there will be two new bodies functioning side by side with An Foras Tionscal.  One is the Industrial Credit Company and the other is a new finance company which will take over certain activities from the Industrial Credit Company.  In his speech the Minister refers to new industries which may require money and says they will get a certain part of the capital by way of grant, and goes on to say:</P>
    <P>One half of the loan will be a contract loan provided by the Industrial Credit Company at commercial interest rates repayable over 12 years with no capital repayment for the first two years.  The other half of the loan will be made by the new finance company on the basis that it would be repayable only at the option of the borrower and would be interest free for seven years.  Therefore, this loan would bear interest at a rate not less than that of a loan at such level so as to act as a spur to promoters to repay the loan.</P>
    <P>Am I right in interpreting that as meaning that the firm in question can get a loan of half of what it requires from the Industrial Credit Company, repayable over 12 years, with no capital repayment for the first two years, and that it can get another half of the loan from this new finance company, free of interest for seven years?  Am I right in thinking that it may operate on the second loan&mdash;that is, the loan from the new finance company&mdash;for a period of six and a half years without paying interest and that its obligations can be met at the end of the seven years if it passes back the entire sum which it borrowed from the new finance company?  In other words, are we to assume that the new finance company will be completely satisfied once it gets back its capital at the end of seven years&mdash;say, in one sum&mdash;and, if that is not possible, that the rate of interest only starts when the firm is entering its eighth year, still holding <Col N="490" /> the money which it borrowed from the new finance company?  I should like the Minister to confirm that: it seems a reasonable interpretation of his speech.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the position of small industries.  The figures used in the Minister's speech are all on the large side and by no means reflect the classification of our industries.  Most of our industries are very small industries with a relatively small amount of capital and, strangely enough because of that fact, in many instances employ much more labour per £ of invested capital than does the large highly-capitalised firm.  May I take it, from what the Minister said, that within the scope of this Bill, it will be possible for people to get these loans and grants even if the projects which they contemplate establishing are much smaller than those indicated by the sums of money mentioned in his speech?  Can a group which hopes to establish a business of say, £50,000, £80,000, £100,000 or £40,000 get facilities to establish an industry under the terms of these two Bills?</P>
    <P>We have to remember&mdash;and this is true not only of Ireland but of Britain and Germany &mdash; that in countries where there are very large industrial projects and very large and heavily-capitalised industries, by far the bulk of the employment given is in the smaller factories.  I think that the aggregate of firms in England employing over 100 workers is probably less than 25 per cent of the total number of industries and I think the German figure is not very dissimilar to that.</P>
    <P>At home here, one has only to let one's mind dwell on the employment that one knows of in the various cities and towns to find that, in the generality of cases, the number of workers employed is small.  It has been said and repeated over and over again that in many of these instances a small firm often gives more employment on invested money than the large firm. In many instances, too, because of the closer personal supervision and the avoidance of doubtful administrative <Col N="491" /> superstructures, they can be administered more efficiently and with less cost than that involved in the overheads of the very large firm.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will say, without question, that there will be a place, on merit, for these small industries in this Bill.  I hope he will say that they will be encouraged in every possible way and diversified as much as possible so that people will not be tempted to abandon the facilities because they are not able to get into these large-scale industries which one conjures up in the mind with the mention of figures like £250,000, £500,000 and figures above that.  I hope, therefore, the Minister will emphasise that aspect of the matter, that aspect of the provisions which does not seem to me to have been stressed in his speech to-day.</P>
    <P>On the question of the provision of grants to 25 per cent of the cost of re-adaptation, it is a pity the Minister set the percentage so low, and indicated that in these circumstances one may not get any more than that by way of a grant.  It is true that it can be got as a loan.  However, it seems to me that in some cases, in order to save the industry, almost a complete reorganisation may have to take place to equip it for the battle in the conditions of the Common Market, that is, if we are admitted a member of the EEC.  This percentage seems to be just a haphazard figure which came into somebody's mind.  There should be more flexibility about it.</P>
    <P>If there is a likelihood that a firm may need a bigger grant to save it, then it would be better if it could be given.  It would be cheaper for the nation to help to reorganise industries now, to keep them in existence and to keep them providing employment, than to have to pay out, with seemingly no end in sight, unemployment benefit to persons who will not be able to get employment unless we take some steps to equip our industries to meet the battle of the Common Market and the keener competition which is likely to surround us on all sides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> While I am on the subject of adaptation and the establishment of an adaptation council, I should like the Minister to avail himself of this opportunity to tell us the Government's plans or his Department's plans for dealing with this question of re-adaptation. I know that in every industry you will find somebody interested in adaptation.  In some industries, whole groups of people will be interested in getting on with the adaptation of their business to meet the new situation. I am not worried about these people&mdash;energetic, zealous, restless persons who want to get the best possible tools so as to produce the best possible goods and to market them under the best possible conditions and brand them in the best possible way.  They are not the persons to look after at all.  They are all right. Their resources and industrial restlessness will probably carry them to victory all right.</P>
    <P>It is the inert, indolent fellow who says: &ldquo;This Common Market is a great problem.  I do not know where to start&rdquo; who must be watched.  He probably does not know where to start and he is not too energetic about finding out where to start.  He draws consolation from the fact that there will be other people in the same jam as himself.  His attitude is that somehow or other something will happen; that a meeting will be held; that everything will be all right.  He tells himself that he has got these frights before and survived them and that he will probably survive this fright.  He is the kind of fellow who must be watched.</P>
    <P>I should like to know will anybody supervise these adaptations, will any public relations officer in the Department or elsewhere deal with those firms which show no evidence of any adaptations and where the owners of the capital may very well say: &ldquo;We have had a good time over a long period; we cannot just jump these hurdles now.  We made a lot of money and the premises are worth a lot; the fixed assets could be sold at a pretty good price.&rdquo;  It is all right for the owner of the capital to decide to sell out but the problem is the employment <Col N="493" /> of the people in the industry. Therefore the Department ought to supervise these adaptation grants in such a way as to encourage firms to get on with the job as quickly as possible, to ensure that they will be helped in every way possible to overcome the difficulties and, if necessary, almost taken by the hand and shown where they should start making plans to deal with the problems which project themselves on the industry for the future.</P>
    <P>These adaptation grants should not merely be given as a palliative to industry who would be told: &ldquo;Take that and see how you get on; we hope you will survive and be fit and well to compete in the production of goods.&rdquo;  They should be told they are expected to take such steps as will ensure that the grant is not just dissipated and that it will, in fact, be utilised to the best possible advantage. Any shortcomings in regard to knowing how best to use it should be ironed out for them by people in the Department who have a competence for dealing with matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>In regard to the retraining of workers, we are probably not giving sufficient attention to that problem. Retraining of workers is an unknown art in this country.  We have never had the problem of the depressed area as other countries have had it.  The retraining of workers is something that never previously had been attempted by industry in the sense of an organised scheme of retraining workers.  It is new and, like everything else that is new, it will be subject to much suspicion and doubt.  Many people will say: &ldquo;It is a pity this thing cropped up at all.  Everything was going all right until we had to retrain people&rdquo;; but retrain them we will have to do if we are to save employment for many people now engaged in industries which will feel the blast of Common Market conditions.  Some organised effort ought to be made to produce a scheme showing the steps that should be taken in order to provide for retraining.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that before you can decide how you will eat the rabbit, <Col N="494" /> you have to catch him and cook him. In this case, you have to find out for what type of work you will retrain the worker and that will arise only when the existing machinery has been surveyed and its prospects for the future appraised.  However, this survey and this appraisal will have to be done within a relatively short time and until such time as we reach that stage, we should work out a scheme, maybe a draft scheme or a skeleton scheme in relation to what will happen in providing for the retraining of workers and possibly for the re-deployment of workers, that is, the movement of workers from one place to another which will be capable of absorbing them if they and their families could be moved.</P>
    <P>Again, that is a problem with which we have never had to deal.  It is a problem for which we have no case book.  However, it is a problem that ought to be studied and to which we ought to devote some thinking so that at least we shall be able to find out what are the latest methods to adopt rather than proceed on the wasteful and time-consuming basis of trial and error.  We ought, for example, to find out what some of these continental countries are doing.  There are some astounding cases reported in the continental papers of whole firms transferring not from one part of the country to another but to a different country.  We ought to try to pick the brains of these people who have had to deal with this retraining and re-deployment of labour and thus save ourselves and the workers many cruel headaches, some of which will be unavoidable in the conditions of the Common Market changeover.  At all events, our retraining and re-deployment should be regarded as urgent tasks so that when the time comes, we shall be able to take down the blueprint and operate it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the possibility of getting pensions for our aged workers and probably not so aged workers from the Social Fund envisaged in the Treaty of Rome.  There is no provision in the Treaty that I can see for providing pensions.  There is provision for paying the cost of retraining, <Col N="495" /> for the cost of re-deployment and of maintaining the worker's standard of living while he is retraining and when he is in passage from what might be called redundant employment in one industry to new, lively and current employment in another.  I see nothing in the Treaty of Rome which justifies any belief that pensions will be available for the redundant worker.  Everybody would like to think that was a possibility so as to ensure that people who had served in industry for a long number of years and who found it difficult for obvious reasons to switch over to a new craft and new methods of operating would at the end of their days have a reasonable modicum to sustain them for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>Probably we are thinking the Treaty of Rome will do too much in that respect.  I am afraid it will not and because it will not and because of the disappointment which might ensure by expecting that, the only other measures to resort to are retraining and re-deployment. In any case, it will be quite difficult for us to get money from the Social Fund under the Treaty of Rome.  If, in fact, that money is to be put up by other countries which have a condition of full employment and perhaps a scarcity of labour, we may very well be confronted with this situation that while there is a certain redundancy in Ireland, there will be a scarcity of workers somewhere on the Rhine; if you look for money for severance pensions or severance pay, you may be told: &ldquo;There are jobs on the Rhine; come over and take them&rdquo;, rather than be permitted to enjoy a pension without such burdens at home.  I do not think the European partners will be anyway soft in providing pensions for our people here while they are insisting on their own workers working as hard as they can and as long as they can for the purpose of increasing the productivity of their countries.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I want to welcome these Bills.  I believe that taken together, and with efficiency and unceasing supervision, it should be possible to get industries to measure up to the responsibilities involved in <Col N="496" /> meeting the threatened competition of the Common Market.  That is not the primary purpose of the Bills.  The primary purpose of the Bills is to attract new industries but I feel there are no great grounds for terrific enthusiasm, because it may very well be that many of these people will prefer to keep their industries in places where the heaviest concentration of population is and where the heaviest demand is.</P>
    <P>The Minister is conscious of the difficulties, I think, because at paragraph 15 of his circulated speech, he says:</P>
    <P>It is my view that these new grant and loan arrangements are very necessary at the present time and, indeed, I fear that, failing their introduction, the possibility of attracting to this country large-scale projects will be seriously diminished. I believe that the adoption of these proposals will considerably improve the prospects of securing the establishment here of really worthwhile industries.</P>
    <P>That is an admission by the Minister that he fears that unless they do these things, the possibility of attracting large-scale projects will be seriously diminished, and that with these Bills, he thinks the prospects of establishing worthwhile industries here will be considerably improved.</P>
    <P>I think the whole House will wish that the second hope of the Minister will be fully realised, and that the attractions provided, attractions which are unique in relation to the establishment of industries in Western Europe, will induce many people to come here and avail of the various facilities in the form of capital grants and capital loans and the abundance of intelligent and highly-trained labour, and that our facilities for exporting, our reasonable taxation and stable political conditions will attract many potential industrialists, not merely from Europe but from the United States also, in the realisation that in these circumstances, they will have justification for the establishment of industries with the assistance and other ancilliary <Col N="497" /> advantages provided in these Bills and will be able to sow the seeds of what will ultimately be far-flung and rewarding industries for those who invest in them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to welcome these very realistic Bills and I should like to be associated with those, outside and inside the House, who have congratulated the Minister on the very efficient manner in which he is facing up to the problems which will confront us when freer trade is something with which we will have to contend, whether or not we become members of the EEC as the Taoiseach has said.</P>
      <P>The two previous speakers mentioned that the introduction of these Bills brings back to their minds certain statements made by the Taoiseach in 1956.  I was not a member of the House then.  What 1956 brings back to my memory&mdash;coming from a highly-industrialised constituency&mdash;is that during that period industry was collapsing around our ears, and if the Taoiseach had not once more come back into the saddle, I dread to think what conditions would be like to-day.</P>
      <P>Some changes being made in these Bills are in keeping with changes which I advocated during a number of speeches on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce over the past few years.  I freely admit that, as a Deputy concerned mainly with industrial development in my constituency, it was easy for me to make those suggestions.  The Minister had to consider the problems of industrial development throughout the whole country and had to concern himself with many other factors outside the simple problem of industry itself, such as social problems, and so on.  The Minister and the Government had to develop a policy for industry which, in their opinion, suited the country generally, while I was concerned with a specific area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are aware, of course, that the Undeveloped Areas Act was brought in to endeavour to contend with a very great social problem and to deal with the difficulties being experienced <Col N="498" /> from the point of view of unemployment in the western parts of the country where there were many people who could not get sufficient employment on the land.  It was decided that some effort should be made to attract industrialists into this part of the country.  I felt that while some industries sited there &mdash; and particularly those which had raw materials available to them locally&mdash;would be successful in freer trading conditions, there was always the danger that other industries would not be quite so successful.</P>
    <P>If an industry is to be successful in any area, it must concern itself with the question of costs.  Costs must be kept down to a minimum.  When one speaks of costs, one of the first types of costs that strikes one is transport. In many industries, it is necessary to import the raw materials and to export the finished product.  Where industries are established close to the source of supply of the raw material, and close to the markets, they have a headstart in foreign markets and they are, generally speaking, a sounder economic proposition.  If the industries which are established here are to be successful, consideration must be given to the locations in which they are established.</P>
    <P>In my estimation, large variations in the amounts of the grants put a very considerable pressure on industrialists who are interested in establishing industries in this country.  It can happen that when an industrialist decides that a certain location is best for his industry, and when he has come to the conclusion that it is in that particular location his industry will not only continue in existence but also expand, he can be lured away from that area by a very large grant, to establish his industry in an area where it will not be as successful as it would have been if it had been established in the original area.  For that reason, I am glad to note that there is at least a certain amount of levelling up in the grants system, between the undeveloped areas and the rest of the country and that, even where there is a differential&mdash;there are, of course, differentials there still&mdash;they will not be of such dimensions as to <Col N="499" /> cloud the judgment of the individual interested in establishing an industry.</P>
    <P>Under this measure An Foras Tionscal have a very much freer hand as compared with formerly in dealing with grants, especially the larger types of grants to what we call the developed areas.  I note that, in the case of my constituency, grants under £250,000 may not exceed half of the total cost, but where the Board are satisfied that, for economic and other reasons, it is not possible to set up an industry in the undeveloped areas, a grant equal to two-thirds of the cost can be given. There was a somewhat similar provision in previous Bills, but it was not so clearly defined as it is in this measure.  I have no doubt that when an industrialist comes to set up an industry here, the Board will give full consideration to the points of view put forward by the industrialist as to what he, the particular individual responsible for the industry, feels about the location in which the industry should be set up.</P>
    <P>Where the grants are over £250,000, there are two bases of calculation.  I am in full agreement with the decision that the grant will be calculated on the basis of £1,000 per man put into employment. When one considers the cost of putting a man into industrial employment at the moment, this appears a very reasonable and fair arrangement. In a constituency such as mine, where we have a considerable amount of industry, we are very happy with Section 4 which provides for grants for the enlargement and adaptation of industrial undertakings.  There have been complaints, very rarely justified, that Irishmen who started their own industries were unable to get grants to enlarge or adapt those industries to procure increased efficiency.  This section of the Bill will remove any vestige of grievance.  Many industries in my constituency were established by local people.  Because of the energy, skill and efficiency of both management and workers, they have expanded out of all knowledge.  When they reached a certain point, they found that it <Col N="500" /> would be impossible, without a further financial injection, to develop to the extent to which they might have expanded.  While there were loans available to help industrialists further, human nature being what it is, many of these industrialists felt they should get grants and they were very slow to look for loans.  The result was that much needed expansion and development of these industries was slowed up.  A considerable amount of valuable time was lost.</P>
    <P>I know from the Minister's statement that these grants are not being made available simply for routine re-equipment.  They are being made available to help these industries to reach the peak of efficiency which will be necessary under the trading conditions just ahead of us.  I have no doubt that the Board will deal expeditiously with all applications for these grants.  The very fact that the Government over the past year have been asking concerns, which are considering adapting their industries to increase efficiency to enable them to be in a position to compete in foreign markets and to make application for assistance for that purpose long before the introduction of this measure is an indication of the urgency the Government feel with regard to this matter.  I have no doubt that that sense of urgency has been transmitted to An Foras Tionscal and I am sure some applications have already been dealt with.  It is very important that industries which have already got a foothold in foreign markets and which are anxious to improve their position in these markets should have their applications dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the introduction of the grants for the training of workers in skilled processes.  A well-equipped factory with up-to-date machinery is very important in the development of industry, but the most important factor in the development of any industry is the efficiency of management and workers.  Even for the purpose of holding our place in foreign markets, it is essential that the management should give every encouragement to workers to avail of all opportunities to acquire <Col N="501" /> skills.  Some of the industrialists in my constituency are already sending their workers for specialised training, even without the aid of grants, but there are not sufficient of them doing so and I think this offer, which is a very reasonable one, should encourage management generally to ensure that their workers get opportunities of acquiring skills and passing them on to others.</P>
    <P>I expect this provision has also been inserted to deal with the retraining of workers.  That, again, as has been mentioned earlier, is a matter of very considerable importance.  It is difficult to say very much on it at the moment because we do not know exactly what conditions will be when we enter into freer trade, but it is obvious that some industries will be in difficulties and there will be redundancy.  It is essential that workers likely to become redundant should get opportunities for training in other types of work.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the CIO report regarding development areas, and stated that the Government will be considering this matter in the future.  These measures should help towards this particular objective.  Some of these industries will be established in the undeveloped areas.  If we take cognisance of the CIO report that projects, to be eligible for a grant, must satisfy An Foras Tionscal that they are capable of surviving in free trade conditions, then it is essential that some of these development areas, if they are decided on, will be located in what might be termed now the developed areas.</P>
    <P>If I were asked what areas I would select in the developed areas, I would be inclined to suggest areas where there is an industrial tradition, areas which have proved themselves industrially, where there are good ports, and also, areas which, in freer trade conditions, might incur redundancy.  It is clear that wherever there is a fairly large accumulation of industry, there are bound to be some casualties. I need not add that my constituency of County Louth would fill the bill admirably as a development area.  We have the tradition there.  We have <Col N="502" /> first rate ports and sea connections, not only with our principal market in Britain but with European ports.  I would commend that area to the favourable consideration of the Minister for development.</P>
    <P>There is a section of the Bill which deals with grants for roads, bridges, and so on.  There is a section dealing with the provision of houses and other dwelling accommodation.  I am convinced that there is no single factor so important in the development of industry as this matter of housing.  In my estimation, we cannot achieve any major industrial development unless we concern ourselves very deeply with this matter.  In order to develop an area industrially, it is essential to be in a position to attract workers to the area.  That applies whether the area is already industrialised or whether there is no industry existing in the area.</P>
    <P>We as a people have been used to emigration, for historical and economic reasons, but we have very little experience of migration, except perhaps to Dublin.  That also is due to economic reasons.  Up to the present, there were very few employment opportunities, apart from those available in Dublin, and very little reason why people would transfer from one part of the country to another, but that situation in now changing.  Over the years, people living in areas where emigration was relatively heavy were quite willing to go to Britain to secure employment and, in the initial stages to live in very poor housing conditions.  The main reason for that was that they found in the cities in Britain many of their friends and relatives and did not feel that they were isolated from their own people. In the event of the east coast becoming fully developed industrially and migration becoming a necessity, we must have the houses ready if we are to get workers because the same factors will not obtain.</P>
    <P>If we are to develop areas industrially, it is essential to provide houses for the people in those areas. If there are houses available, there will be no difficulty in getting our exiles to come back to areas where industry <Col N="503" /> has improved to the extent that it is necessary to get workers.</P>

      <P>The building of houses, both urban and rural, is in arrears in my constituency, even for present needs.  While the Drogheda Corporation and Dundalk Urban Council are doing a very considerable amount of work now to improve the position, if we are to deal with a development of industry, we need to do very much more.  It is necessary to make use of every possible method. There is local authority housing and private housing and there is the National Building Agency and now, under this section, industry can get grants towards the building of houses. If we are to develop, it is essential that everything possible should be done to improve the housing position.</P>
      <P>Finally, I just want to say that our application for membership of the European Economic Community may or may not be successful but the intense interest our people have displayed in our application and in the effects our application will have on employment and on their lives generally has done a world of good and certainly the need for greater efficiency and a greater effort by all of us has been highlighted.  I can say that the efficient manner in which the Minister has faced up to the problems involved in the whole question of free trade is greatly appreciated in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that I should say a few words of welcome for both these Bills which are to be operated jointly.  I think I am right in the assumption that these Bills <Col N="504" /> indicate the acceptance by the Minister and the Government of the fact that the majority of the people of this country felt that the time had arrived when areas outside the undeveloped areas should be brought in line with the undeveloped areas for the purposes of State industrial grants.</P>
      <P>No one, I am sure, quarrelled with the idea that the undeveloped areas west of the Shannon did need, at the time of the original Act, a shot in the arm.  The land was poor; emigration was prevalent; and industries were scarce.  The effort to alter that position in favour of development of that portion of the country was not resented by those who lived and worked in better agricultural areas or in more industrially developed parts of the country.  However, the time has come, I suggest to the Minister, for a review of the position.  In fact, I would say that &ldquo;undeveloped areas&rdquo; can be a misnomer as applied to some portions of some counties west of the Shannon at the present moment.  I would suggest that my constituency of Waterford, with its ghost towns of Lismore and Tallow, as far as industry is concerned, would qualify as being an undeveloped area more than many places which now go under that title.</P>
      <P>In Lismore and Tallow, emigration is practically 100 per cent.  That means that every boy and every girl on reaching working age have to leave the area to seek employment either in some other more developed part of Ireland or, as is usual, unfortunately, in some other country.  Had Lismore and Tallow qualified, as they very well might, as undeveloped areas, and had the liberal grants that were available in the undeveloped areas been available to them, there might be now in Lismore and Tallow industries which would have given a new lease of life to both these towns and, in fact, a new lease of life to the whole of west Waterford.  Were it not for the good fortune of a home industry being established in Youghal, taking up a percentage of the unemployed, the position would be much worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Bill helps, in my opinion, to redress that position.  I notice in the <Col N="505" /> Industrial Grants Bill under Section 2 that should a certain condition be fulfilled, the two-thirds grants may be given, similar to those in the undeveloped areas.  I trust that the Board, which will administer this Act when it becomes law, will accept and act in the spirit of that as well as in the very letter of the law.  When considering grants under that section, the Board should give due consideration to whether or not that area has been endeavouring to help itself. There is an old saying that God helps those who help themselves and I would suggest to the Board and to the Minister that that is a very good principle to be followed in industry. If there is a development association in an area and due to their efforts they have attracted an industry there which might not have come to the country otherwise, they should not be penalised because of the success that crowned their efforts.  It should not be held against them when considering the question of a two-thirds grant for a further industry being attracted there.  It should not be held against them that they have already succeeded in attracting one industry.</P>
    <P>I feel that if the Board interpreted Section 2 (a) in that fashion, you might very well break the spirit of any development association and it should act in a contrary fashion.  If a development association realise that their own efforts will be helped, and will receive the co-operation of the Board, they will be influenced to exert themselves to the utmost in seeking further enlargements of their town.  I am particularly glad to welcome Section 4 and that part of the section which states that any industries which have, without waiting for this Bill, come into operation, and since December, 1961, endeavoured to equip themselves for the struggle which they believed was facing them at the time, and is still facing them, and enlarged their industries, will qualify for the percentage grant, the same as those who have waited until this Bill was published.  I merely stood up to say to the Minister that I am glad that those of us who reside in the south of Ireland, on the seaboard, and who <Col N="506" /> are anxious, and are endeavouring in every possible way to secure additional industries, outside industries, will have his co-operation and the co-operation of the Board and that, better still, we will have improved grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill, as I see it, is to attract new industries to the country, to provide additional employment and thereby raise the standard of living of more of our people.  In so far as it may achieve that purpose, it should be welcomed by every Deputy.  I welcome the Bill because it appears to indicate a more favourable attitude toward the establishment of industry outside the undeveloped areas.  I believe there are many would-be industrialists who come to this country to investigate it but who refuse absolutely to go to remote parts to establish their industries. Their reasons for that may not always be purely economic.</P>
      <P>One of the references which I was sorry to see in the Minister's speech is that on page 4 to the fact that, under this legislation, before giving a higher grant, An Foras Tionscal will require to be of the opinion that there are sound economic reasons why the particular project cannot be established in the undeveloped areas and, in addition, must be of the opinion that other exceptional circumstances exist. Those are difficulties with which people are confronted when they come here.  They have to prove, first of all, that it is not possible to establish their industry in a remote part of the country and they also have to prove that it is of exceptional national importance.  These are very difficult things to define and will, I think, create a lot of trouble and frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of some discrimination in favour of the undeveloped areas but it should be a graded sort of discrimination.  We should have grants available to industries which are prepared to go to these remote areas and which can normally be carried on there, and certain other lesser grants available to industries who refuse to go there but who, nevertheless, are anxious to come to a part of the <Col N="507" /> country where their top executives and top technical people will be prepared to live.  In many cases these people have come from cities and urban areas and just will not go to remote parts of the country in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another matter which disappoints me somewhat about this legislation is that, again, it seems to favour the establishment of big industry only.  I think that, when people go to the Industrial Development Authority with a proposition which does not indicate a very big expenditure on building and equipment, they get a very poor hearing.  They are met with very little enthusiasm.  We are losing many small but valuable industries on this account.  There is no enthusiasm for the small industry and a small industry very often can grow into a very big industry.  I have come across people who are not allowed to take big amounts of money out of their own country to establish industries here.  They were people with very well established organisations in their own country, with a very big export trade from their own established industry at home, but they could not come in here and get any encouragement to establish themselves in a small way to begin with.  That is a very definite defect.</P>
    <P>There are many small industries which will have quite an important employment content for areas where there are no large pools of labour available.  Nevertheless, quite a number of people require employment. During the year, I tried very hard to get industrial grants for the establishment of mushroom farms.  I believe that is an industry and I know that an ordinary economic mushroom unit employs 25 to 30 people at good wages.  They should get every encouragement. I referred also to the industry of hatching and exporting day-old chicks.  At present we are losing a valuable industry because we refuse to give any aid whatever and we refuse to allow the industry to sell day-old chicks in the Irish market.  That industry can go to Northern Ireland, as it has decided to do, because of lack <Col N="508" /> of interest on our part and it can set all the chicks it likes to hatch and sell them here across the Border and we cannot do anything to stop it, so that it has the Irish market when it goes across the Border.  We are losing these very important employment opportunities, due to lack of interest and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that there is provision for the training of workers in areas outside the undeveloped areas because I have contact with a number of industrialists who have to meet big expense in training workers.  Also, workers when trained often change their jobs or leave for some reason and more training has to be undertaken. I am told this causes considerable expense and deserves the consideration which it is getting in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is reference to the provision of housing and this is important especially to us in County Dublin because there is quite an inclination to come in here and set up in County Dublin, which creates a very big housing problem for the local authority.  No matter how many houses are provided, there will always be people waiting for houses.  I do not know if it would be possible to allocate this grant to the local authority, in addition to the existing grants, and have the houses built in that way in the areas of new industries where it is obvious that there will be considerable employment.</P>
    <P>Another thing that has kept, and continues to keep, industry out of the country is the continued existence of the Control of Manufactures Act which requires 51 per cent. of the capital to be held by Irish nationals. People come in here to establish industries and a very large element of the products of these industries may be for export.  They get no manufacturer's licence or a restricted licence because there is somebody who is perhaps manufacturing in a very small, tinpot way and not manufacturing for export and who says he is in a position to supply the market even though he is not supplying the market adequately and is not exporting.  That matter should get serious attention and I think should be rectified as soon as possible. <Col N="509" /> It operates very much against employment in industry here.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, we propose to set up still another organisation to deal with the establishment of industries but there is already a considerable amount of confusion and frustration for people coming here because of all the organisations that have to be contacted and dealt with.  They should be able to come in here and meet one organisation and finish the business with them. They should be able to get whatever they are entitled to through that body and as far as possible, there should be greater definition of what industrialists are entitled to.  I have often found that when somebody goes to the IDA, they meet an attitude of suspicion, a suggestion that somebody is making an effort to foist something on the country.</P>
    <P>There is no indication that we believe this is something we should go out after as a person selling insurance would do.  If at all possible, we should show enthusiasm and excitement about a possible industry and make every effort to follow it up.  If you are looking for a grant, there seems to be very little interest and even a discouraging tendency.  I have seen people going away with a very bad impression, perhaps not well justified, because of the attitude and the excessive caution of the Civil Service type of mind they meet with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton, in his otherwise able speech, justified very fully the attitude of the present Taoiseach seven years ago towards the development of industry.  Deputy Kyne has confirmed that.  From other speeches that followed, we can well understand that if the undeveloped areas at that time did not get priority and if an effort had not been made to bring them into some kind of generally-balanced economy, they would have been left to their sorry fate and we would now have the same problem facing us in a general way again. Deputy Norton admitted that the Undeveloped Areas Act was a success and that many parts of those areas are now far better fitted industrially and financially to meet the present trends than are some of the contiguous areas between the developed <Col N="510" /> areas and the big centres of population, the various cities and their suburbs.</P>
      <P>That is the problem now to be dealt with in these Bills but it can be dealt with on the basis that the country has now been generally brought into a position where they all more or less stand on the same ground.  Undoubtedly there are areas that have not yet been touched.  There are some in my constituency which stretches from the Old Head of Kinsale to the Limerick boundary and the same would apply elsewhere.  I am sure the provisions of this Bill will tend to get rid of that situation and help out these areas because if there is an industrial centre in the area, it not only helps the town where it is sited but also those in the neighbouring districts who can have no hope of employment in agriculture and would have to go further afield.  It keeps them nearer home and encourages development in every way by increasing the population.  Seaports undoubtedly attract industry but there are some industries which will be very favourably located in those districts that have not yet been touched.</P>
      <P>It is very important that housing be taken into consideration.  Some of the bigger industries established here in recent years have met a problem in that respect.  The workers have to travel long distances and this is expensive, to the industry itself, if it subsidises the travel of its workers, or to the workers' paypackets, if they have to pay for it themselves.  Recently I have heard some of the directors of the Whitegate Refinery deploring the fact that they built houses for their workers removed from the lines of public transport and are now finding difficulty in getting workers to occupy them.  They also built the houses to too high a standard with the result that the rents and rates were too high.  They did not build them to the general standard suitable for their workers.  As we go along, we learn of these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be said that over the past seven or eight years, since industry was tackled in the way it was by the Taoiseach, wonderful progress has been made and that a spirit of confidence <Col N="511" /> has arisen.  Every town now hopes for some development to give employment to the rising generation.  These Bills are to be commended for their progressive outlook.  The Minister has let no opportunity pass of bringing before the House Bills to assist our industrial potential, to develop local industries and to attract other badly-needed industries to bring up the standards in parts of the country where, up to this, employment was not possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pleasant to sit here and listen to the welcome extended from all sides of the House to this Bill. It is a solid indication that, as a result of the introduction of present legislation, progress has been made and that that legislation has done what it was intended to do, to encourage industrial development here.  The lessons learned from the undeveloped areas in the west are being gradually extended now to the whole country.  The Industrial Grants Act, 1959, went some distance towards helping other parts of the country but this Bill goes the whole way and puts both areas on an equal basis.  I have no doubt in my mind from speaking to industrialists that many of them do not like to be located in the undeveloped areas.  Many of them would like to be located near the larger towns, such as Dublin and Cork, where there are many more services, much more technical know-how and indeed all-round facilities to help industry.  Anything to encourage industry here, be it east or west, is to be welcomed.  However, I should like the Minister in a quieter moment seriously to consider the position that might arise having regard to the drawbacks in the undeveloped areas and to consider, for the purpose of maintaining and improving the good work already done there, whether further facilities might not be granted.  I need not suggest anything in particular because it will occur to the Minister himself.</P>
      <P>The improvements in the grants themselves are to be welcomed.  The figure of £2,000 goes as far as anybody would wish, unless they would wish the Government to finance the project entirely.  I will not deal further with that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> The Bill deals with the training of workers.  If there is one field in which we are somewhat weak, it is in regard to technical training for industry and the provision of the right outlook to encourage such training.  Speaking from experience, it is sometimes a painful experience to take in a green worker and try to get him to do any kind of technical job.  It is doubly difficult when that worker is in his middle thirties.  One finds that the youth is by far the easiest person to train, but in the west the small-farmer-cum-industrial-worker presents a problem.  Whereas the young worker after gaining a couple of years' experience sometimes decides he will go abroad for a few years, the settled man usually stays.  In the training of workers, there is the operation that takes very little training, the operation that takes a long time and, occasionally, the education of an operative in the development and use of his hands takes five, six or seven years.  No full provision had been made heretofore and for that reason I welcome this very clear-cut provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The introduction of these two Bills at this time speaks well for the progress that has been made and the need for further expansion and development. Coming as it does when there is talk of greater and freer international trade, I think it becomes more necessary for the Department from time to time to emphasise the progress being made.  Many of us in industry must now look as far ahead as ten years to see more clearly the picture in respect of capital needs and this calls for new thinking, for replanning and redesign.  It is well to know that most industrialists to-day are thinking along those lines and if the advent of the Common Market did nothing else, it did a wonderful job when it put the gun to the industrialist's head, so to speak, and forced him either to modernise or get out of business.</P>
    <P>The grants being provided here for replacement and adaptation, at one quarter the entire cost, are generous but I think that in certain sectors industrialists will probably find difficulty, even with these generous grants, and the Minister might, in certain <Col N="513" /> circumstances, look into the possibility of increasing the amounts of such grants.  The provision of houses for industrial workers has been mentioned before and it is high time we did something about it.  Previous legislation made provision for assistance to industrialists to provide houses for their workers but I do not think very much use has been made of such provision. While industrialists who decide to build houses for their workers are eligible for the normal grants for house building, I think they should get special consideration, in addition.  The provision in this legislation to give effect to that suggestion is therefore very welcome.</P>
    <P>Watching industrial development in the west of Ireland particularly, it seems to me that industrialists have no idea of where they are heading&mdash; they are like a dog chasing his tail. Therefore I submit to the Minister that there should be in Dublin an office or at least an officer of some kind capable of compiling local history and of selling, as it were, towns to industrialists coming into the country.  At the moment industries go only to towns which have energetic groups to put their claims before the public; towns where there are no such energetic communities are neglected from this point of view.  The efforts of such an office could be directed to areas where there are pools of labour and where the other necessary facilities for industrial development are in existence.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Industrial Organisation recommended that industries should be concentrated in seaport areas.  I thoroughly agree.  In such areas, existing industries complementary to the newly-established industries should be developed.  Where there can be a concentration of one type of industry or of kindred industries in the one area, that should be done and labour, management and technical problems which exist in such localities could then be overcome by local discussion. I look to the benefits of such concentration for Sligo, particularly. In Sligo, we have a number of industries, some allied to one another and some not so allied.  Sligo has a good seaport and can draw on an excellent <Col N="514" /> labour pool from surrounding towns and villages as far away as Leitrim and even Donegal.</P>
    <P>An ambitious programme of that kind would have far-reaching effects and would give tremendous encouragement to areas interested in industrial development for the good of the citizens.  We all admire what has been done at Shannon.  If something like what is being done there could be extended to other areas which have the same natural facilities, we would be heading in the right direction.  Some Deputies who spoke earlier described this measure as not being designed to cover large undertakings.  I see this legislation as providing for industrial development, large and small.  I do not see that it mentions minimum amounts of grant; it merely says that provision will be made for two-thirds of the cost of undertakings.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate that on the whole small industries employ the most people because there is in such small undertakings more work in the handling of the goods they manufacture. Wherever possible, we should see that use is made of locally-produced raw materials as against imported materials since this would affect industrial costings to a considerable extent.  I would again urge the necessity to concentrate on keeping similar industries in particular localities&mdash;that like should go with like and the manufacture of complementary products should be restricted to areas where the main product is manufactured.  In that way we would be providing a comprehensive pattern of our national industrial effort.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the continuance by the Electricity Supply Board of the special services charges, and feels that the time has arrived when these charges should be abolished, thus removing this unfair burden on rural dwellers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. It is generally agreed on all sides of the House that one of the greatest Acts passed by this Parliament was the rural electrification Act.  That measure dealt with the provision of electricity for our rural community.  It was decided to give to rural dwellers the amenity which was enjoyed by urban dwellers in the previous 20 years. Rural electrification was designed to benefit most those living in isolated areas&mdash;the small farmer, the cottier and the housewife.</P>
      <P>It is now accepted that rural electrification is essential for the social and economic betterment of country life.  The dependence of farmers and people in the country in general on electricity is quite obvious.  It was illustrated in the recent bad weather when the ESB workers had to work night and day to maintain a supply to those people.  In passing, I should say that great credit is due to those workers for the manner in which they kept a very necessary commodity in good supply to the people in rural Ireland.  Conscious of these facts, we ask the support of the House for this motion.</P>
      <P>We feel that anything that is beneficial to rural life is in the long run beneficial to the community as a whole.  The special service charges are supposed to concern people in remote areas and people in areas whose neighbours did not or would not avail of the supply.  From the numerous complaints Deputies receive from those people and also from people in not too remote places&mdash; places within 10 miles of Dublin City &mdash;we find that these special charges also affect them.  The Labour Party had a similar motion on the Order Paper since about last November twelve months.  We believe that, because of that motion and because of the numerous complaints which the Minister and his Department and the ESB have been receiving, the recent relief was given in the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That announcement in the Budget brought hope to many people.  In practice, it has worked to the detriment of a great many more because not <Col N="516" /> alone were some charges not reduced but they were considerably increased. The types of people most affected by these charges are cottiers, small farmers and the tenants of houses which are being erected from time to time, and which were not in existence when the particular area was being developed, as well as new tenants of houses.</P>
    <P>Among the grievances which I have had to deal with was one from a man who had a cottage in an area and who, when it was being developed, accepted the supply.  He got electrical gadgets in the house.  After some time, he found he had to move house.  He moved to an area which also was developed but the cottage to which he transferred was not connected.  This man, who was a very good customer of the ESB, found himself penalised to the extent of a very heavy special charge.  It is to these types of people that these charges refer.  In general, we can take it that the low income groups are affected.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why this charge should be abolished.  From 1927 up to 1947, when the rural electrification scheme was started&mdash;for those 20 years&mdash;the people in rural Ireland got no benefit whatsoever from the scheme.  Even at present, there are people who, as taxpayers and as members of the community, are still contributing indirectly to the ESB, who are not getting any return for their money and who have little or no hope of getting any return for their money.</P>
    <P>The fact that the consumption of electricity by rural dwellers is steadily increasing should also help to bring about the end of these charges.  There is a bigger percentage of people in rural areas seeking supply and there is a bigger use of electricity for farm purposes &mdash; for milking machines, grinding machines, improved water schemes, and so on.  There are prospects of further increases in electricity consumption in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Just yesterday evening, I read in one of the evening newspapers that the ESB had quoted to connect a housing scheme in Drogheda.  Having quoted their figure, they said that for each house which would instal an <Col N="517" /> electric cooker they would deduct a sum of, I think, £27 10s.  That illustrates the influence which an increase in the use of electricity should have on these special service charges. Definitely, there is an increase in electricity consumption.</P>
    <P>I submit that the whole method of financing the scheme has led to a great deal of wastage.  The House was recently informed that there were 112,000 unconnected dwellings in developed areas.  Why were these unconnected in developed areas?  We can take it it was because the charges quoted to those people were too high. They were so high as to be beyond what those people could pay or felt they could pay.  Now it is decided, after the development of these areas and after workers have packed up and left these areas, to give an extra subsidy to help those people to become connected.  The result we are told is that 77,000 of those people will benefit and that no special charge will be required from them.</P>
    <P>That is a deplorable overlapping and wastage in the working of the rural electrification scheme.  If that had been decided upon at the time the areas were being developed there would have been a far greater number of acceptances in the areas; there would have been a far greater amount of electricity being consumed since the areas were developed and in the long run the whole scheme would be much more economic.  The ESB crews now have to go back to those areas, erect their workshops and go over all the work that was done in the last number of years.  Even though it is late in the day to be doing it now it is better late than never and the benefits which those 77,000 people will get are very welcome.  If it had been done at the time of the original development of those areas, however, there would be much more money now available to give the service to the remainder of the people at a reasonable charge.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us recently that there were under consideration 17 uneconomic areas&mdash;he referred to them as uneconomic areas&mdash;and that there are about 6,000 dwellings in those <Col N="518" /> areas, half of which will be connected at the normal charge and the other half of which will have to pay a varying special service charge.  What will be the result of that?  It will mean that 60 to 70 per cent. of those 6,000 dwellings will accept supply.  It would be much more economic in the long run to offer the supply to the whole 6,000 dwellings without any special service charge rather than do it in years to come.  The cost per installation is very reasonable and to bring the percentage up to what it is in other countries, up to 90 to 96 per cent. of rural dwellings, we should do away with those charges.</P>
    <P>Apparently there are now 11,000 people paying those charges and if the recently announced subsidy has the desired effect, there will be 37,000 people paying those charges, that is, excluding 12,000 dwellings to which the £10 grant for bottled gas applies under the relevant section of the Act. There are 12,000 people who are almost completely disowned by the Government and by the ESB and told that the cost of connecting their premises is completely prohibitive. The people who live in those 12,000 dwellings have been taxpayers since 1927 and as long as those 12,000 dwellings are there, there will always be taxpayers living in them.  It is not good enough completely to disown those people.  The £10 subsidy for bottled gas is no compensation for them.  There are 37,000 people paying varying special service charges and most of them have been paying them for some time and under the present regulation, their children and grandchildren will have to pay those charges.  If those charges are designed to cover the cost of connecting the supplies from the nearest line to the house, we believe that after a certain time those charges should cease but that is not the position.</P>
    <P>For those reasons and because people especially in remote areas, are in dire need of electricity, we ask support for this motion.  Measures have been brought in here by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government to <Col N="519" /> improve rural life.  Some of these measures cannot be availed of unless the people have electricity connected to their premises.  People cannot effectively avail of a group water scheme unless they have a supply, and when the cost of supply is prohibitive, people are very reluctant to take it, and it is only the very well-off people who can do so.</P>
    <P>In regard to the 12,000 dwellings which are completely ignored, the position will eventually be that the farmers among those 12,000 will sell their holdings because they will not be able to brings their equipment and the working of the farms up to date. The people who will buy those places will be foreigners who will be able to afford these charges.</P>
    <P>I notice that the ESB spent well over £100,000 on publicity last year. I presume that was spent to attract customers and to encourage increased consumption of electricity.  If most of that money had gone on helping, say, the 3,000 dwellings in the 17 uneconomic areas, it would have been much more fruitful expenditure.  I am sure that every Deputy has from time to time received complaints about these charges.  We do our best to explain to the people the implications of these charges but the people still cannot see any justification for them, and we cannot see any justification for them either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to correct the impression about the origin of the rural electricity scheme.  It was initiated and planned by a Fianna Fáil Government during the period 1943-46.  Rural electrification actually started in 1946 and plans were laid down at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next, I should like to point out to the House that the taxpayer does not pay any subsidy to cover the normal operations of the ESB.  They are a self-supporting body and the only burdens on the taxpayer are the charges required to bring about rural electrification, that is, the annual <Col N="520" /> capital subsidy provided for this very excellent purpose.</P>
    <P>Next, I think I should correct the statement made by the Deputy who suggested that 37,000 people were paying supplementary charges prior to the inauguration of the present scheme. In fact, there were 15,000 consumers of this category and of these the charges have now been abolished in the case of 3,000 and reduced in the case of the other 12,000.</P>
    <P>On 31st March, the number of rural consumers was 280,000.  To deal with the motion, I think I should point out, first of all, that the result of the increased subsidy has been that the ESB are getting a very greatly increased demand for connection.  In October of 1962, the demand for rural connection was four times what it was in October of 1961, indicating that the number of people thinking of joining their houses to the network of the scheme is progressing satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>If we are to debate this motion, we must have a clear understanding of the supplementary fixed charges and their place in the accountancy of the ESB. When the ESB connect urban or rural consumers to the network, they are liable for an annual expenditure in respect of, first, the servicing of the capital involved in the connection; secondly, the depreciation of the system; thirdly, its maintenance; and fourthly, for a sum to cover the overhead charges for accountancy and so forth.  Those charges have to be met if no electricity at all is used, and before a single light is turned on in respect of any dwelling.</P>
    <P>Most electricity authorities adopt two-part tariffs consisting of a fixed charge which meets the cost I have already indicated, and a unit charge which meets only the cost of providing power, the cost of generation.  It has been found from long experience that that is the fairest way of allocating the charges among the various types of consumers with their varying incomes.</P>
    <P>The level of the fixed charge in the rural districts is such that after excluding uneconomic connections, the receipts will meet the outgoings after <Col N="521" /> taking account of the capital subsidy. In the case of premises where the income from the fixed charge falls short of the minimum return required by the ESB to make it a viable proposition, after they have taken account of the subsidy and of the surplus that arises in some connections, they add a supplementary charge.</P>
    <P>The whole of the rural electricity system has been subject to a very serious annual loss which has been rising through the years.  In other words, in spite of levying some supplementary charges on a percentage of the consumers, and in spite of all the current consumed, the rural electricity system was losing at a recent date some £700,000 per year and that had to be subsidised or, you might say, cross-subsidised by the urban consumers. It is true to say that, as the years go by, if the amount of current consumed increased very largely, that situation might alter.</P>
    <P>I have noticed with great delight that the increase in the purchase of farm machinery and equipment of various kinds in the past two years has been of the order of anything from 40 to 100 per cent.  Of course, when I say that, the total amount is so small still &mdash;we are starting from a very low basic figure of farm machinery utilised. Farm machinery power consumption is growing but will have to grow for a long time before there will be any likelihood of the urban consumer ceasing to subsidise the rural consumer.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is possible to ask the urban consumer to go any further in the direction of subsidisation.  I should say that one of the complications in this is the fact that the subsidy for rural electrification was abolished by the Coalition Government in 1955 and was only re-established in 1958. That resulted in a loss of income to the ESB of about £529,000 a year.  I read through the debate that took place here in 1955 on a motion moved by Deputy McQuillan in which he called on the Government to abolish all service charges and I find that Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party took the attitude then that, if the Government really thought they could abolish the <Col N="522" /> subsidy, it would be ridiculous to ask the rural consumers to pay any extra service charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Next, I should point out that the capital subsidy has been increased from 50 to 75 per cent with the provision that there is a maximum expenditure of £75 on each dwelling. As a result of this, a much larger number of householders will be able to secure supply without paying any special charges.  I have heard no word of that from the Deputies who moved this motion.  Before the Act was passed increasing the subsidy, there were 54,000 persons who could secure supply without special charges.  Now there are 77,000.  In addition, there are 23,000 households whose connection can be secured with charges of up to 50 per cent., but in many cases it will be very much less than 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>I want to give an idea to the House of what that subsidy means where it is required and where the figure does not exceed 50 per cent.  The electricity charges for a typical county council cottage amount to 14/- per two months, or 1/8d. per week.  A typical usage of electricity is 300 units a year, at 3d. per unit, making a total charge per two months of £1 6s. 6d., or 3/2d. per week.  If there is a supplementary charge of 25 per cent, then that is an extra of some 3/6d. per two months, or 5d. per week.  If the supplementary charge is 50 per cent, the addition for a typical county council cottage is 7/- per two months, or 10d. per week.  In respect of that particular group of consumers, it cannot be said that the additional charge, whether it be 25 per cent or 50 per cent, is a very burdensome one.  It obviously means something to the household budget but, nevertheless, in relation to modern wages, no one could say that the addition of 5d. or 10d. per week, according to whether it is 25 or 50 per cent., is an excessive or a crushing burden upon the householder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention that because I do not want the House to feel that these 23,000 consumers, or those amongst them who are persons of very modest <Col N="524" /> income, would be in the position that this could in many cases make the difference between their taking power and not taking power, having regard to the increase involved.  I would say that, if they could not take power, it would be because they could not afford the basic figure anyway or because they felt, in relation to the way they lived, that they would not want to afford the basic figure.  I do not think the extra could make it impossible for them to have their houses connected with the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They are just peasants!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take the 77,000 people who will not have to pay any supplementary charges and the 23,000 who will pay a very moderate supplementary charge, the total becomes 100,000.  There are then only 12,000 consumers left in the developed areas, and these 12,000 will be asked to pay 100 per cent. or more service charge. I am advised by the ESB that, in respect of the very great majority of those, it is unlikely that they would take connection.  Under the previous system, in relation to the small number of cases in which charges have been increased beyond that, because there is a limit of £75 per household in the Act, only in a very small number of cases would these people have taken power anyway, so I doubt if we have made the position very much worse in respect of the majority of them.</P>
      <P>If the whole of the 100,000 households take connection, that will mean virtually 96 per cent. of the population will have power, which is a figure that compares very satisfactorily with the figures to be found in other northern European countries.  We shall have achieved the almost complete rural electrification of the country, counting urban and rural consumers. I think that is a reasonable aspiration and a reasonable target at which to aim.  In relation to the national income, to the need for growth in industrial development and the need for capital for all the purposes for which it is required, to aspire to 96 per cent. connection is, I think, something of which we can be proud.  I am perfectly prepared to defend it at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> Next, I want to deal with the 12,000 dwellings which will have to pay 100 per cent., or over, special charges.  The average cost for connecting these dwellings is, I understand, about £200 per dwelling.  That is a very heavy cost and we decided that it would be better in the circumstances to offer these people a £10 grant for bottled gas; that would cover a considerable part of the cost of installation.  In regard to the 100,000 houses, the total cost will be £9,000,000, of which no less than £6,000,000 will be subsidy.  If all the houses in the country were connected, and supplementary charges eliminated, the cost would be up to £11,000,000. Even if we decided to connect all the dwellings of the country without making special service charges, there are some 3,000 of the 12,000 where the cost would be no less than £300 per dwelling and there would be a loss even after that to the ESB in respect of their connection.</P>
    <P>It is too much to expect the taxpayer to pay for the connection of every isolated house in the community. We would be asking too much.  I should say that the abolition of the special service charges would cost twice as much in subsidy as the subsidy required to secure the connection of the 100,000 houses to which I have already referred.  Again, as I have said, we must establish some upward limit of costs somewhere.  It is impossible to do everything to the limit of 100 per cent. in a growing community where there are such tremendous demands for capital and I think it would be wrong to ask the taxpayer to accept that burden, a very, very heavy burden, for a comparatively few houses.</P>
    <P>I should also say that, again excepting the 12,000 houses, in respect of a great number of the 23,000 dwellings which have to pay some extra service charge, the extra will not reach the figure of 50 per cent. and from my own experience as a Deputy I find that a great many people are accepting the small supplementary charge in that group of householders.  In my view, to describe these generous arrangements as an unfair burden on rural dwellers is really ridiculous, an abuse of the meaning of the word, and irresponsible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> Deputies are perfectly entitled to criticise anything my Department does. I do not blame anybody who looks for perfection and it is quite natural to ask in the course of a motion why we cannot do the whole job absolutely perfectly.  My answer is, as I have said, the extra cost of subsidy for this group of 12,000 would be prohibitive in relation to all the other kinds of assistance the Government give, in relation to the housing grants, grants for farm buildings, grants for industry.  If we look at the whole panoply of grants, the vast majority of which were initiated by the present Government at one time or another, it would seem to me we are doing, relatively speaking, a good job in securing the connection in time of 96 per cent. of all the dwellings of the country.</P>
    <P>I might add in that connection that the cost of rural electrification is extremely moderate.  Statistics prepared by the United Nations have to be looked at with reserve in this sense that when you compare costs of rural electrification you are simply using a common currency with which to compare them.  All I can say from looking at the figures published by the United Nations is that the ESB is doing a very good job at very reasonable cost, particularly allowing for the fact that, with Sweden, we are the most unvillaged community in the whole of Northern Europe.  We have lesser formation of villages and hamlets than any other community in Northern Europe, with the Swedes.  Bearing in mind that fact, I think the costs as I know them of rural electrification are as low as they could be expected to be and I do know that there have been people coming over to our country to find out from the ESB the technical methods involved in carrying out rural electrification and they have been able to get a good deal of useful advice.</P>
    <P>I should say in reply to Deputy Tully that although I have sympathy with the people who live adjacent to Gormanston Camp, as I have already said, that is a matter for the Department of Defence in so far as security measures have to be taken in relation to overhead cables.  The extra cost of putting electric cable underground is <Col N="527" /> very, very high indeed and in relation to anything that is done under town planning in future the authority concerned will have to bear in mind the cost.  I would hope that there will be greater investigation in the future, particularly by those who are building industrial estates, to see whether they could not provide underground cables where there are a large number of houses being constructed together.  I hope there will be more co-ordination in the future, particularly under the operations of the new Town Planning Bill if it passes this House, but we have to bear in mind that while, if the whole scheme is planned in advance, the extra cost of underground cabling may not be as much as it would be if it were done piecemeal, nevertheless there is an extra cost involved.  While I sympathise with what Deputy Tully said about looking at a village in Meath from the sea and seeing how the electric poles spoil the horizon, the cost element is still there.  I hope there will be some helpful solution to it later but I can see there will be difficulties and any extra cost has to be paid for by somebody, either by the taxpayer in general in the form of greater subsidies or in the form of rents by the householders concerned. I think it would have to be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also spoke of some firms in County Dublin where there was a question of milk cooling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told it is not over-costly and that if the firm is a fairly well established one and it is worth having that equipment, the cost of the diesel motor plus the gas cooling equipment is not so great as to prevent the operation of milk cooling. Perhaps Deputy Tully might ask his <Col N="528" /> constituents to consider that, if they have not done so already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point is, the ESB have always been fair in their application of charges.  I am sure Deputies have had a great deal of experience in checking the ESB supplementary charges, sometimes very small, sometimes large.  The very careful methods used in assessing, show absolute impartiality all over the country, are a great credit to the ESB and show there can be no possible question of political influence arising in regard to this matter.  Indeed, in my experience I have very rarely found they have made miscalculations.  The calculation is based on a rigid principle: They decide they must get a return of so much per cent. on the total of the annual costs which I have already given the House and after allowing for the subsidy, if they cannot get that percentage, they then add a supplementary charge to the point where they then are able to receive the minimum required.</P>
      <P>In the present scheme, the percentage now is 4.7 and no one can dispute it or suggest that some officer was prejudiced in some way.  As a result, the scheme has progressed very satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the House to regard this motion in a reasonable light.  As I have said, we are doing a fairly good job.  I would be delighted if I could announce a scheme which would satisfy every single person in the community but I do not think I am likely to.  I do not believe any Minister following me is ever likely to satisfy everybody.  While I quite understand the reasons why this motion was framed, we must not allow unusual cases of additional charges being made to create anomalous argument.  We <Col N="529" /> have to take into account the fact that in this country there were, at 31st March, 1962, 363,000 urban consumers and 279,000 rural consumers and that the people who are the subject of this complaint number only some 12,000 and they are all, as I said, in exactly the same position in regard to their isolation from the main system.  They are more distant from the main system than those who do not have to pay charges and they are being treated more than fairly, in the sense that there is no prejudice against them.  The basis is the established system of charging and I do not think we should exaggerate this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope every Deputy will encourage local organisations, and Muintir na Tíre, the ICA and Macra na Feirme, to encourage people to apply to join the network as quickly as possible because the more people who apply in an area, the cheaper it is for the ESB to make a connection and the less burden there will be on the consumers in the area.  I would also ask all Deputies to encourage the farming community to make enquiries from the ESB in regard to electrical equipment. The growth in the use of electrical equipment has been so rapid that it must have been found to be productive and economic to a great many farmers and the more quickly that consumption grows, the better will be the economics of rural electrification on the whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister with some interest on this question of special charges.  There is one type of special charge he has not mentioned, that is, the special charge involved where the ESB seeks a contribution from a local authority when they wish to provide services for a new building scheme.  It is something which has been paralleled all over Ireland, that where a local authority has a gas works of its own, the ESB demand a special charge and where the local authority has no gasworks, there is no special charge.  In Drogheda Corporation, of which I am a member, the whole matter is being discussed and fought at the moment and I seek not to abuse or criticise the <Col N="530" /> ESB but perhaps to introduce a spirit of amelioration or some sort of compromise into the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The whole thing was brought into the open when the ESB said that unless the Drogheda Corporation refrained from putting gas cookers in 100 odd houses we had built, they would demand a special charge of over £8,000.  The Minister and the House know enough about local government finance and housing finance to realise what that means.  It means higher rents which must be passed on.  If it does not mean that, it means higher rates.  We can take our pick which way we charge.  It seems extraordinary that a housing estate right beside the town and beside heavy cables, and which eventually over the next five or ten years will be an estate of 500 houses&mdash;a fact which is known to the Government and to the ESB&mdash;should have a special charge levied on it of £8,000 just because we have a gasworks.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that we in Drogheda do not regard the gasworks, the property of the Corporation and therefore of the citizens, as a dying concern.  To ensure that it is not a dying concern, we have spent, or are in the process of spending, £60,000 on a new wharf, on a new retort which is at present working and on machinery in order to provide cheap and good gas for the people. It is quite extraordinary to me and quite impossible to believe that the argument which the ESB put forward in this case, namely, that if they do not get the opportunity to have a number of cookers in this built-up area, the revenue will be such as not to merit electrification without a special charge, is a proper argument.  It would not appear to me that there is any parallel between giving me electric light in a house I am building 300 yards from the nearest source of supply, without an extra charge and the giving to 500 houses in one block beside the power lines a new service and a new supply &mdash;and I will not have an electric cooker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been paralleled in Kilkenny and in Clonmel and it cannot be tolerated if we are to allow a company <Col N="531" /> sponsored by the Government, with Government funds, to proceed to give an essential service to the community. If perhaps I have been too hard on the ESB, I want to say that what I am trying to do is to introduce a compromise and I want to make this plea that in high places, at the very top, this will be looked into.  I have deliberately refrained from putting down questions about this to the Minister for Transport and Power.  He had better look at it and discuss it with the ESB so that this extraordinary anomaly can be straightened out.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I think I have made it clear to the House that 500 houses in one block are an economic unit to the ESB, whether or not there are electric cookers in them and that the comparison is quite incorrect, and that this sort of unfair competition with Government funds against the money and the enterprise of the ratepayers is something that must be stopped.  I appeal to the Minister and the ESB to see that it is stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion which has been put down by my Party as it is essential that we give a service to the people in rural Ireland.  The Minister made the point that the ESB are very courteous.  I can say that in any dealings I had with them, as far as replying to correspondence goes, they were very courteous, but when it came to trying to get them to take off something, perhaps a special charge or an extra charge on some poor person, I was never able to make any headway.</P>
      <P>When the ESB began the rural electrification programme, local branches of Macra na Feirme and the National Farmers' Association went about in groups and canvassed their parishes and submitted lists of names to the ESB.  If we got between 75 and 85 per cent., the ESB would consent to take over the area and give a service. We went wholeheartedly into that with the ESB officers and in some cases we got almost 100 per cent. of the people willing to accept and pay for the service they were offered.  But when the ESB actually laid out the scheme, we found it was a different service from that which the ESB officer in the parish had indicated when canvassing and the charge was a different one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> I could name areas where houses were inspected and measured as houses in a group making up a number willing to accept electricity but when the ESB came to instal the current, they by-passed many of these houses.  I can understand the Minister's point of view in regard to people who refused the supply at first or where the ESB could not at the time take over the area, but where they did take over an area and supplied little more than threequarters of it and then came back in six or nine months and put an extra charge on the people they by-passed previously, I think it is very unfair.  These people should get the same service as those connected six or 12 months earlier.</P>
    <P>In North Tipperary, we find that in cases where a labourer's cottage is less than 40 yards, or in some cases only 30 yards, from the nearest ESB transformer, the ESB have quoted £40, £50 or £60 for providing light for the cottier.  These are matters that could easily be remedied without imposing a big financial burden on those who pay through the ESB.  The burden should be spread over the whole population.</P>
    <P>The Minister made, I think, a very good point in calling on farmers to use more machinery and thus more current but most farmers in my area have to pay a very heavy special service charge as many of them live on by-roads and were by-passed.  Some of them have been called upon and asked if they would buy out the line completely for £600 or £700 cash down.  After about 12 months' negotiation, the ESB have agreed to put in the line and put a service charge on these people which makes it impossible for them to use much current, seeing that they have to pay a very heavy bi-monthly charge.  Even though the light is very cheap, the ground rent, so to speak, is so heavy that it leaves little room for further expenditure. Many people would be inclined to use more electricity, if it were not for that charge.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, said there were actually only 12,800 paying the extra special service charge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even 35,000 would not still mean a very heavy charge on the ESB.  When the ESB started, we were told they were a non-profit making concern, that they would plough back into the service any profits earned. The Minister said they were running at a loss at present.  Is that not hard to understand, especially for country people, when they can read the papers and see where the ESB propose to demolish the whole side of a street to provide a new building?  It is hard to understand where the profits from the rural dwellers are going.  Certainly, they are not going back into the service.</P>
      <P>The average small farmer's light bill is only 12/6d. but his special charge is £2 10. 0.  That man is paying the ESB more than his rent and rates amount to and he will not use any more current when he has to meet that charge. It would not break the country or the Government or the ESB if the special charge were abolished for these 35,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December, 1955, Deputy McQuillan brought in a private member's motion in relation to rural electrification charges and I think he made a wonderful case.  He was very ably supported by many Members of the House.  Deputy Hilliard, who is now a Minister, seconded the motion calling for the abolition of the special charge and the present Taoiseach made a very <Col N="535" /> good speech.  In the Official Report for 8th February, 1956, at column 169, he said:</P>
    <P>Why should the ESB supply one rural dweller with electricity at a loss and refuse to supply another unless he pays something towards the minimisation of the loss?</P>
    <P>I could understand such a statement from a man who had never been a Minister and who would not know the workings of the ESB but this was a speech by the present Taoiseach who was supporting Deputy McQuillan and he charged, rightly or wrongly, that the inter-Party Government had withdrawn some subsidy.  It was after the subsidy was withdrawn that he made the statement.  He said to the ESB: &ldquo;Your job is to give a supply of electricity at a uniform rate of charge to every rural dweller and to carry the cost.&rdquo;  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>There is no justification for it.  So far as I am concerned, I will give an undertaking that if ever again I become Minister for Industry and Commerce, I will abolish it forthwith as unjustifiable and immoral. I hope Deputy McQuillan will put this amendment to the House and divide the House on it because it is entirely wrong to maintain that extra charge in the circumstances in which the subsidy was abolished. How much would it cost?  Is it not a mere bagatelle in relation to the charges you put on the ESB last year?</P>

I hope Deputy McQuillan will put this amendment to the House and divide the House on it because it is clearly entirely wrong to maintain that extra charge in the circumstances in which the subsidy was <Col N="536" /> abolished.

I went down to the voting list and I found that Deputy Aiken, Deputy Blaney, Deputy Brennan, Deputy Eamon de Valera, Deputy Lemass, Deputy Lynch, Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Ryan, Deputy Smith all voted to have the special charge abolished.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies find themselves being continually approached by constituents to have supplies of electricity extended to various groups who have been forgotten up to now or refused a supply. I have a small notebook in my pocket containing the names of about ten people on whose behalf I had to go to the offices in Sligo to ask to have the special service charge reduced.  In some cases, the charge had been almost doubled on those people.  They refused to pay it, because small farmers in my constituency could not possibly meet such a demand.  I would appeal to the Minister to give a supply to people who are within a stone's throw of those who <Col N="538" /> already have the current but who find that they cannot get it.  I do not think it would make all that difference if an effort were made to extend the supply, particularly where there are groups of four or five and sometimes up to nine families, as there are in the Sligo and Manorhamilton areas where I can point out groups of nine families most anxious to get supplies.</P>
      <P>It is easy to understand why such people refused to accept current at the beginning.  Some unfortunate farmers thought the price demanded for current was too high.  They refused to take it and that was responsible for depriving many others in these areas of current.  All those people are now most anxious to get the current and if they made a mistake originally, the Minister should overlook it now and provide them with supplies.  Had I more time I could give figures but I shall finish by pointing out the advantage of current in these areas of dwindling population.  Young farmers with families, and others in outlying areas, would find life on the land much more attractive if they had the advantage of electric current.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this is the second motion of its kind within a few years has been referred to during the debate and since the Minister commented on a quotation by Deputy Tierney from the Official Report, I should like to continue that quotation. It is from column 169 of the Official Report for 8th February, 1956.  We have Deputy Crotty saying: &ldquo;We did not put them on&rdquo;&mdash;I assume he was referring to the special charges.  Then the present Taoiseach continued</P>
      <P>This pretence that we can only get a rough estimate is nonsense.  If you telephone the ESB now, they can tell you the exact amount that came in last year in respect of extra charges and they can give you the estimate for this year, too.  I say that the only reason why the Parliamentary Secretary will not name the amount is because he is ashamed to do so.  The amount is so small, in relation to the charges they put on the ESB, that he would not humiliate his Government by mentioning them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> According to that, the amount must be very small in relation to the amount by which the subsidies had been reduced. It was alleged there was a charge of £250,000 a year on the ESB because of the renewal of the levy.  If it were only a small amount, a fraction of the £250,000, I do not know what the Minister is worrying about.  Deputy Lemass was not the only person who was very much in favour of passing Deputy McQuillan's motion.  Deputy P. J. Burke went a little further and at column 64 of the Official Report for 5th July, 1955, he said:</P>
    <P>I wish to protest strongly against the special charges that the ESB are making in respect of a number of people in my constituency.  Quite recently, I put down a question in the House about these extra, special charges.  I maintain that these charges are totally against the spirit of the Rural Electrification Act.  It is completely wrong.  I go further and say that these people should be refunded the money that they have been charged by way of special charges and that they should be put on the same basis of charge as applies in the case of other people who have availed of rural electrification. This discrimination is unfair and, as I have said, it is diametrically opposed to the spirit of the Rural Electrification Act.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Burke and Deputy Lemass thought then that it was wrong to have these special charges, I feel sure they have not changed their minds and that, when the division bell rings, they will troop into the Lobby with the Labour Party to support the proposal that the special charges be done away with. Perhaps the Minister himself will accept the fact that the special charges, in the circumstances, can no longer be sustained and that if they are only a fraction of £250,000, the easiest thing to do is to get rid of them completely.</P>
    <P>The Minister corrected Deputy Pattison, saying his figures were wrong. Deputy Pattison had quoted some figures given by the Minister here last year.  The figures given by the Minister then&mdash;he can check them immediately&mdash;were that 11,000 were at that <Col N="540" /> time paying special service charges and 26,000 others, if they accepted, would have to pay the special charges.  That is a total of 37,000, not 35,000.  In addition, there are 12,000 who will have to pay a prohibitive special charge if they accept and all that would affect 50,000 dwellings, not 11,000 as the Minister said when he was speaking.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a point about whether or not bottled gas was the answer to the problem of people being asked to pay a prohibitive charge, since reference was made to people being asked to pay two or three times the normal charge.  I cited the case, and I do so again, of somebody living beside Gormanston Camp in a council cottage of three rooms where overhead aerials are the order of the day.  Yet that man is being asked to pay a special charge of £10 15s.  That kind of thing cannot be breezed away.  The Minister said bottled gas is possibly the answer.  If bottled gas is the answer, will the Minister say how many people have applied for bottled gas subsidies since their introduction?  Is it not correct to say that very few people have availed of the £10 offer?  Is it not true to say that not alone do the people concerned consider it to be absolutely useless, but that the bottled gas companies themselves consider it to be of very little assistance to them in selling their commodity since the Minister's scheme is not encouraging anybody to take bottled gas?</P>
    <P>Not alone does that apply to the islands off the extreme southern and western coasts but it applies equally in Counties Meath, Dublin, Kildare and all around.  I asked the Minister a question recently and he gave me the slick answer that because details of the subsidies would not be supplied by the firms concerned until the end of the financial year, he could not say how many had applied.  I said that if he wanted to give me the answer he could easily have asked the firms concerned what the figures were, that he would not have to write them down because such a small number were affected he could very easily have given me the information on the spot. It suited him better to say he would have to get the information.</P>

      <P>This Bill will go a long way towards bringing about the industrialisation we seek in this country.  It will go a long way, indeed, towards meeting some of the recommendations in the report on the small western farms and providing for that industrial advance that is necessary to absorb those workers who cannot, and will not be able, to find employment on the land.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister, in bringing in those two Bills, is taking a great step forward and the results of the development that will follow on them when they become law, will be evident in the years ahead.  There are substantial cash grants and full training facilities now for workers and, indeed, provision for roads, bridges, sewers and houses.  It is hard, indeed, to imagine how much further the Minister can go at this stage to encourage industrial effort in this country or how much more he could do to encourage outside manufacturers to come into the country and establish industries here.  For that reason he deserves the full commendation of the House.  I conclude by wishing the two Bills a speedy passage through the House and the reward that they are justly entitled to in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I should like to welcome those two Bills for the reasons given by most members who spoke here this evening.  I have advocated this change for quite a long time and I always felt that there should not be such discrimination between one part of the country and the other.  I have always appreciated the difficulties west of the Shannon generally in the underdeveloped areas. <Col N="542" /> I have even said that I thought, whilst they might get some assistance over and above that which would be given to the other parts of the country, there should not be what there has been over a number of years, such a colossal gap&mdash;a gap which induced many industrialists or manufacturers to go west of the Shannon in order to qualify for the bigger grants.  As I say, I would be all in favour of giving some extra assistance to alleviate unemployment and diminish emigration to some extent but industrialisation in many other parts of the country was, in fact, neglected by reason of the fact that the grants given to other parts of the country to start industries there were not as attractive as those given in the underdeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>I know emigration and unemployment have been very high in the north-west and south-west counties particularly but whilst it cannot be said that emigration in the province of Leinster has been big compared to Connaught, the big factor in Leinster is that there has not been a lot of emigration from Dublin, which is included in Leinster.  If one has regard to the census of population figures and in the statistics contained in that report, he will see that there has been a tremendous amount of emigration from the Leinster counties, quite apart from Dublin, over the past 15 or 20 years. Therefore, I say, we in the Labour Party, and I in particular, welcome what seems to be a change of heart on the part of the Government.  I am prepared to give the Government credit for making this change but I think also we should pay tribute to the Committee on Industrial Organisation that was established by this Government some months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paying tribute to this Committee which recommended those changes, I think one should also pay tribute to them for the excellent general reports which they have issued over the past few months.  They do not pull punches in those reports.  They are certainly very lucid documents and their recommendations are firm.  There is not much vagueness about the recommendations made by the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  It seems to me that this <Col N="543" /> organisation appreciates to the fullest extent the situation in the country at the present time and the situation that there will be when we go into either the Common Market or some other Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach some time ago had occasion to say that, whether we went into the Common Market or not, we were going into an era of freer trade. I think all of us knew, long before the Taoiseach made that speech, that we were going into an era of freer trade.  The news this evening for those firm supporters of the Common Market must, indeed, be very discouraging. The situation to all of us is not encouraging because it is a confused one but I think every Member of the House is convinced that we are going into an era of freer trade and that the recommendations of the Committee on Industrial Organisation must be put into effect, in the first place, by the Government, and secondly, by private enterprise and private industry.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach spoke here on the Adjournment debate, he described the speeches of some of us in the Opposition as complete wailing, &ldquo;cleamhsáning&rdquo; and what have you but I remember on that particular occasion I gave, as I am prepared to give now, credit to the Government for acting on the recommendations of the Committee on Industrial Organisation. The function of that organisation was to make recommendations, firstly to the Government and secondly, to those who are responsible for industry, and incidentally for employment in this country.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the Government are prepared&mdash;and I applaud them for it &mdash;to put into legislative effect the recommendations in respect of assistance to industry and for the establishment of industry.  Having said that, I want to go further by asking again what was asked by me on the Adjournment debate, what was asked by Deputy Norton and what is being asked by the bulk of the workers in this country, especially in respect of those industries where it is expected there will be redundancy.  The Government may claim that by those particular <Col N="544" /> pieces of legislation they have done their job.  It has been suggested that an attempt to go further is not for them and it is not their job to interfere in the affairs of private enterprise or to interfere in private industry.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the various reports on the various industries that have been already surveyed and to draw his attention to the general reports by the Committee on Industrial Organisation. It seems to me that there are many Irish industrialists who are not very enthusiastic about making changes, reequipping themselves.  It seems to me they have not shown themselves to date as wanting to avail of the generous grants available from the Government. I think, in these circumstances, that the Government must show some concern. I do not know whether they do or not.  Up to this, apart from the grants they announce are available, there is no evidence that the Government are doing anything else to stimulate private enterprise and industry generally to fit themselves for the era of free trade into which we are undoubtedly going.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, in one of these reports&mdash;I think it is the fourth interim report&mdash;the Committee on Industrial Organisation warns that many of those in industry in Ireland at the present time do not seem to have any inclination at all to effect the changes which will be necessary in the new situation. The Minister might make some comment on another part of the report which has been referred to by Deputy Gallagher.  I assume that the Minister is not in a position to make any final pronouncement on this matter, but there has been a recommendation by the CIO that there should be established here certain development areas. The type of areas envisaged are well defined in the CIO report and, while details are not entered into, I think the Government should consider, as a matter of urgency, this admirable suggestion which has been made.</P>
    <P>Finally, we welcome these Bills.  We welcome this idea of balancing out, one might say, the application of grants all over the whole country.  I believe it will do much more to promote industry <Col N="545" /> than the legislation which we have had up to this, because whether anybody likes it or not&mdash;I am not speaking against the West of Ireland or any part of Ireland&mdash;there are traditional industrial centres in this country. In these places the problem of training workers will be relatively simple.  They are admirably suitable for the establishment of industries and I trust that the grants announced now will be availed of, not as everybody seems to think, by foreigners exclusively.  Every time we think of the establishment of an industry here we immediately conjure up a vision of a German, a Dutchman, a Britisher or an American.  We welcome them if they establish an industry and give employment, but all of us would like to see greater participation by Irish people in industry. Whether it is participation by Irishmen exclusively or not does not make any difference.  It might be better if there was participation by Irish people alone, but it seems that Irish capital is short.  However, even participation in industry with the foreigners would be very admirable indeed.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister or the Government have thought about some form of control over money that is invested by way of grant or given by way of loan, when it is given in substantial amounts ?  We had some cases where substantial amounts of money were advanced by way of grant or loan to industries that folded up.  I do not say there were many but there were a few.  The Government should try to devise some ways and means of exercising control, by way of the appointment of a director in an industry that had been established, with either a substantial grant or a substantial loan from the Industrial Credit Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few observations which I should like to make.  First of all, I welcome these Bills.  I particularly welcome the provisions in the Bills which are designed to minimise the distinction between the undeveloped areas and the rest of the country.  It has been quite apparent for some time that the Undeveloped Areas Act was working very unfairly towards certain areas.  In <Col N="546" /> fact, there is no better example of this than the city and county of Limerick which are on the fringe of an undeveloped area.  Despite numerous efforts by local groups and individuals over the past five or six years to secure industries, despite the fact that several foreign industrialists came to Limerick to examine its possibilities as an industrial location, despite the fact that a few industrialists were definitely interested in setting up a plant at Limerick, nevertheless, because of the inducements and the better grants and so on which were available in other areas they went into those areas.</P>
      <P>I know, from my own experience, of at least three cases of foreign industrialists coming to Limerick and being interested in setting up industries.  One of them told me that he had toured the rest of the country and had found that Limerick was the most suitable location for his particular type of industry.  However, because of the fact that the inducements were better on the western seaboard, he subsequently opened a plant in the west.  I welcome these Bills because while they do not abolish discrimination in the matter of grants as between one area and another, nevertheless, they place the entire country on a more or less equal footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points relating to grants in which I am interested.  First of all, there is the question of grants for small industries, particularly in rural areas.  During the past year, I have had the experience of making representations on behalf of two people, each of whom lives in a small village in my constituency, and each of whom was interested in setting up a small industry.  In one case, the employment content was four men and in the other it would be about eight girls.  This may seem very small, and I did not feel very happy going along to Foras Tionscal looking for grants for these particularly small types of industries.  Nevertheless, in these small villages where these people live, even a little industry employing four men or eight to ten girls would be of immense advantage.  I would ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration <Col N="547" /> to applicants for grants for small industries.</P>
    <P>There is another type of industry in which I personally am very interested and of which I had some experience. I am referring to industries which are mainly based on the processing of agricultural raw materials.  In my particular case this refers to industries processing milk.  I have the feeling, and I have got the impression, that there is more difficulty in establishing an industry utilising agricultural raw materials than there is in setting up any other kind of industry.  I cannot for the life of me see why there is not more emphasis on, and why more encouragement and better inducements are not given to industries utilising agricultural raw materials.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, which extends throughout a good part of the Golden Vale and is the most intensive milk-producing area in this country, I have been associated with three different proposals for the establishment of milk-processing industries.  I am happy to say that one of those proposals has materialised within the past week. The position is that when a proposal for an industry of this kind is put forward the normal procedure is, first of all, to approach the IDA.  I want to say that in my experience I have nothing but the highest praise for the officials and all those connected with the IDA.  I can say the very same for Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>A big problem and a big snag in trying to get milk-processing industries established is the fact that when the proposals have been considered by the IDA they are then submitted to the Department of Agriculture.  In this industry which has materialised in my constituency in the past week there is foreign participation and proposals were submitted last August to the IDA.  They were then submitted to the Department of Agriculture for their observations.  These proposals lay in the Department until the 1st November and it was only when a certain amount of pressure was put on the Department that we finally were able to get the thing through.</P>
    <P>I have had another case of an <Col N="548" /> application for the extension of an existing industry where a proposal was referred to the Department of Agriculture and no effort was made to deal with it for several months.  I would feel very happy if one or two officials qualified and competent to examine proposals of this nature could be attached to the IDA and possibly to Foras Tionscal&mdash;without having the dead hand of the Department of Agriculture frustrating all our efforts.</P>
    <P>The new Bills will be generally welcomed. They have not gone the whole way towards abolishing or evening out, so to speak, different areas, but I think they will give a chance to areas outside the underdeveloped areas to promote and, perhaps, secure industries.</P>
    <P>In the last paragraph of the Minister's opening address, he makes the point that the Committee on Industrial Organisation have recommended the setting up of development centres.  I think this is an excellent idea, and I would ask the Minister to lose no time in examining this recommendation and in introducing a Bill for its enactment. To sum up I feel there should be more emphasis on promoting, encouraging and having better inducements for small industries.  Secondly, in view of the fact that we have tremendous natural advantages in matters of soil, climate and so on for the promotion and establishment of industries based on agricultural raw material, I would also ask the Minister to review this aspect and, if possible, try and develop some means of overcoming this problem to which I have referred; that is, the dog-in-the-manger attitude of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of welcoming those two Bills.  Any enactment which offers added inducements to industrialists from overseas or at home to further development in this country is something that must be welcomed in this House.  The only possible objection or criticism I can offer is that, while the Bill reduces the differentiation between the underdeveloped areas and the rest of the country, we still have a situation whereby certain areas outside those underdeveloped areas&mdash;that should <Col N="549" /> normally be considered as under-developed&mdash;are still not in a much stronger position.  In the case of any industry coming to the country the industrialist setting up finds that, by going to the underdeveloped areas part of the country, covered by that particular legislation, he can get quite attractive additional grants.  If for reasons best known to himself, or to the particular company contemplating setting up, he decides that quite an amount of transport is involved, he may decide that the additional inducement of those better grants is not sufficient to attract him to the underdeveloped west, with the result that he ultimately decides to set up as near to a seaport as possible.  The object behind all these additional aids, I take it, is to try and work up our exportable produce. Naturally enough, when that is the particular object in mind, the most likely place and the most attractive place from the point of view of the industrialist is as near as possible to a seaport.</P>
      <P>While welcoming both these Bills and seeing all the advantages contained therein, the fact remains that the very same grant is being offered to an industrialist, or an industry, proposing to set up in the city of Dublin.  Quite a big proportion&mdash;I do not know how much exactly&mdash;but quite a number are centred near the port of Dublin and, as has been mentioned, that is one of the very few areas that has not suffered from emigration.  I would have welcomed, if it could have been included in this particular Bill, some type of differentiation between the areas already highly industrialised and the rest of the country, quite apart from the areas at present described as undeveloped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty from the point of view of a constituency such as mine is that, if an industrialist is either attracted by the grants to the undeveloped areas, or prefers to stay near to a port, there is no inducement offered which might bring him down in favour of my constituency.  There is nothing the various development associations in Laois can offer which will outweigh the advantages which can be obtained in the undeveloped <Col N="550" /> areas, on the one hand or, on the other, the desirability of staying near the point of export.  Now that is one of the problems which this measure has difficulty in solving.  Really to satisfy the people in my part of the country&mdash; there are other areas in the same situation, areas which were not included in the old congested districts, which is the area taken in under the Undeveloped Areas Act&mdash;something more will have to be done.  There is justification for feeling aggrieved because so far none of the measures has been of any great advantage to my particular county of Laois.  Down through the years, only one small undertaking has been in a position to make any use of any grant.  I do not believe any other county has come off as poorly as the Laois section of my constituency.</P>
    <P>Several speakers have already adverted to the apparent lack of interest taken by officials in the IDA and An Foras Tionscal in proposed small projects.  These small projects do not appear to capture the imagination of officialdom in either An Foras Tionscal or the IDA.  This is most unfortunate.  Country Deputies are well aware that what is really required and what would be really successful in the smaller country towns are the small projects.  Officialdom seems unable to visualise an industry with an employment potential for anything less than 500 people.  Such a potential does not exist in small villages and towns, and the surrounding countryside, and it is from these areas that the greatest flow of emigration takes place. As someone said today, we have no enterprise to hold the young people of 16 and 17 years of age.</P>
    <P>On one particular occasion&mdash;I have dealt with An Foras Tionscal on a number of occasions&mdash;I approached this body with what I considered to be a very good project.  It was a small project, with an initial employment potential for some 15 workers, but there were possibilities of expansion. The project was based on the development of a quarry.  The idea was that choice ground limestone tiled surrounds would be manufactured.  A certain amount of market investigation <Col N="551" /> had been done in England and it was apparent that this product might have something of a snob value.  Section 2 of the 1959 Act was produced to me and I was told that the project would have to be such that it would be justified by its very size and its exceptional national importance; it would then qualify for a grant.  Apparently a project with an employment potential of from 15 to 25 people was not one they could regard seriously. Apparently it was also not one of exceptional national importance.</P>
    <P>That type of approach should, I think, be discouraged.  I have never met with anything but the greatest courtesy in An Foras Tionscal, but one has that feeling that cold water is being poured on one's project.  That is a bad approach.  Development associations all over the country have schemes.  Possibly holes can be bored in them, but I hold that they should be encouraged.  There should be a full discussion and there should be a sympathetic approach.  Suggestions could be made for improvement so that the proposition might be brought forward again, better planned and polished.  If the project is a small one, it attracts no attention.  I believe that it is small projects which will save the country towns and villages and the rural areas generally.</P>
    <P>Development centres are recommended in the CIO report.  One speaker on this side of the House suggested today that, when this matter comes to be tackled, stress should be laid on particular areas which have been pretty well developed industrially. I cannot see his reasoning because I believe the purpose of the Undeveloped Areas Act is to attract industries to areas which are not developed.  I do not think establishing development centres in areas already developed would be a good idea.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned that this might have the effect of inducing people from other areas into developed areas.  He referred to the fact that Irish people seem to be reared with a sort of emigration tradition.  But there is no migration tradition; Irish people, in the main, are not anxious to move <Col N="552" /> from one part of the country to another.  The angle should be that where there is a small development potential and where an area is devoid of industry, this development centre should be located.</P>
    <P>An Foras Tionscal should be encouraged to make suggestions.  Deputy Gallagher mentioned that lists of towns should be drawn up emphasising that particular areas are suitable for a particular type of industry.  In most parts of the country at present, there are development committees and, to my knowledge, they have been straining over the past years to attract industry to their areas.  The ideal places are those where agricultural produce could be used as a raw material.  We have received in my district the greatest help, from the point of view of advice, from General Costello of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  He seems to be in demand all over the country and he has been responsible for encouraging development in different parts.</P>
    <P>Foras Tionscal should have some type of advisory service available. There should be an advisory service whereby officers of Foras Tionscal could go to the country and discuss with different associations the pros and cons of trying to follow up some type of industry, especially with the view to utilising the raw material that could be made available from their own agricultural resources.  More use should be made of the various bodies like Foras Tionscal, not so much from the point of view of having people with ideas coming to them, but having members of Foras Tionscal going down the country and discussing problems with the various development associations. That is all I wish to say, except to add that I would like to have seen some type of differential being introduced whereby there would be an inducement to industrialists to come to outlying areas to set up factories instead of in places like Dublin which is already industrialised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the Minister wanted to interrupt me when I spoke my first sentence.  There was always in the legislation, and it was a bone of contention, in relation to the establishment of industries, a bias in favour of the undeveloped areas and there still is in this legislation, except in regard to some grants.  I do not think it is a serious bias.  The clause now inserted whereby people in exceptional circumstances, or where it is obvious to Foras Tionscal that an industry could not be established in the undeveloped areas, may be given the full two-thirds grant, does provide the safeguard we want.</P>
      <P>I remember, for instance, an industry in which a type of coal briquette was to be manufactured in the town of Drogheda a few years ago and the greater grant was available if the briquette was made in Athlone.  Of course, to an industry like this, 10/- a ton is a fortune.  The situation was that the industrialist could have been tempted if he could have used a place like Drogheda where he had factory space on which he was ready to build, at the wharfside, and where the moving costs of bringing the raw material, which happened to be waste coal from Britain, to the site would have been so much lessened.  Most of the usage would have been in the city of Dublin.  It seemed silly to ask the industrialist to go to Athlone and bear the cost of the haulage there and back, which of course cancelled out the project. That was due to existing legislation and the fact that this legislation is designed to get rid of that difficulty is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister on it and it is a good thing that it has been looked after.  I would say that in relation to the undeveloped areas, and the establishment of industries generally, mobility of labour in present day circumstances is an existing fact.  Big industrial centres like Liverpool, Birmingham and Coventry will exert their <Col N="555" /> pull and people will go there.  We have only to look at America where 60 years ago 70 per cent. of the people existed on the land and 30 per cent. in the urban areas.  Now you have got less than 20 per cent. on the land and more than 80 per cent. in the urban areas.  You could possibly call that sort of movement emigration between the various States.  Whether we like it or not, that is going to happen and we should not lose an industry because we give the greater grant to enable it to be established in an undeveloped area which might not be suitable.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with previous speakers that there must be some extra help in the Statute Book for the establishment of industries in undeveloped areas, to encourage the employment of people rather than the mass movement of families from places where there is not sufficient industry.  I would say this about the undeveloped areas that there are pockets in various places where one would not have expected to find them, places which could be termed undeveloped areas but are not. The snag about that is that if you start making changes, I suppose every county council, every Deputy and every local person would try to plug their own place and get it declared an undeveloped area.</P>
    <P>For instance, in Louth, we have the area of the Cooley peninsula.  The other day I heard the figures for emigration from that area, the number of children who had been attending the local technical school and who had gone to Britain or further afield.  The figures were frightening, to say the least of it.  They were authenticated by the headmaster of the technical school and the clergy.  That is the problem there, even though they have the advantage of the opportunity of getting a job in Dundalk, Ardee or Drogheda or even Dublin without going too far away.  At the same time, there is nothing in the area.  It was there the ESB first started the rural electrification campaign.  It was densely populated, with a growing number of young children.  Members of these families must emigrate but in an industrialised <Col N="556" /> area such as Louth, that peninsula would hardly have a chance with the present approach to things, of being declared an undeveloped area.  That is something that might be considered.  I am sure other Deputies could speak for similar pockets in their own area.</P>
    <P>When this matter was discussed at Louth County Council meeting, immediately another councillor got up and said he knew of another such place. You must take places that are genuinely in this condition.  I am satisfied there are such places in rural Ireland due to high populations and lack of employment and there is need for their declaration as undeveloped areas.  Of course, the escape clause now would help if there were an opportunity to set up industry there. The section whereby in the large-scale grants, it is possible to have a split grant-loan, which is a loan free of interest, the grant and a loan from the Industrial Credit Company being brought up to the total value of two-thirds of the fixed assets, is good because it means in fact that an industrialist setting up a factory has now only got to find, if he has a completely viable project, the interest accruing and, at the same time, keep depreciation on the plant funded and the workers paid and really only requires one-third of the cost of the fixed assets, plus, of course, his ordinary trading capital.</P>
    <P>I think that gives a wonderful opportunity and, without doubt, you must have a flow of industry here.  I can never understand why that has not happened.  We are only 40 minutes flying time from points in Britain where they are overcrowded, apart from anything else.  I should imagine people would like to live here because they would be able to drive along uncrowded roads.  Yet, we have not had the influx of British industrialists we rightly should have had.  In the '20s, no doubt there was a feeling of distrust in the mind of the British industrialist when he thought of establishing an industry here but that must have gone during the '30s and after the war, it seems quite extraordinary that we had not more British industries established here.  I think we had more continental <Col N="557" /> industries established here during that period.  Even in our large-scale projects such as the production of cement and things like that, it seems to be people with continental links who wish to come here.  I am not producing that as a criticism of anybody or any Government.  I have made my particular criticism which evoked an interruption from the Minister.  However, he is a good friend of mine and so we may forget about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  It is extraordinary that the British did not come here.  I feel it will happen now because it will have to happen.  These grants must be a great incentive.  They represent a different approach from the approach in Northern Ireland where the people are in a bad way with much unemployment.  They provided and built factory space which they made available to industrialists.  Our system is a better one because no ready-made factory space can be said to be suitable for any industry. Industrialists may buy factory space in the North but I do not think anything you would buy would be as good as what you build if you have the money because you would build exactly what suited you.  Our present arrangement is good.</P>
      <P>The Deputy from Laois spoke of Foras Tionscal throwing cold water on a project.  I wonder if he ever went looking for a loan himself?  I did so as many times as I have fingers and toes.  The position of a person lending money is always one in which he throws cold water on the project.  He knows the person who wants to do something, whether to increase his production, or give greater service, is overflowing with enthusiasm and when he gives money, he has to justify it. It is only natural that Foras Tionscal, or the Minister, or the Industrial Development Authority, should look at projects with what must appear to those presenting them as a rather jaundiced eye.  I think there is nothing wrong with that; I think the Foras Tionscal approach is good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> The case is being made repeatedly that there should be more thought for smaller industries and I think the lack of investment in such industries around the country was the cause in many cases of their disappearance.  Because of new processes, there are many things turning up now which will not employ 500 people but which are exceedingly viable and provide excellent employment, even though operating on a small scale.  I am thinking of such processes as spray skimmed milk and I know of one instance where this business was set up near a co-operative society, where the farmers could deliver the skimmed milk, if they did not want to use it themselves, as they left the creamery.  I happen to know they could sell twice their present production. That seems to be something that has a market.</P>
    <P>There are other activities related to agriculture such as the pre-packed potatoes which may employ eight or ten people, as the Deputy from Laois mentioned.  You also have the handling of vegetables, horticultural products, all small efforts which should not be forgotten.  We have them in every town and everybody knows about them.  If they are forgotten, what will happen is that very large industries will take on the job.  It is the way of all industry at present but if a small unit is economic, I think it would be right for Foras Tionscal and the Minister to approach it with perhaps a greater degree of sympathy than in the case of a large application. These small units can live and it has been proved, of course, in the Common Market that they can live in competition with large ones.  It is fashionable that the words &ldquo;Common Market&rdquo; or &ldquo;EEC&rdquo; should not occur once in the Minister's statement.  I do not blame him for that; it is a sticky problem.  But, whether the Common Market comes or not, we are going to have freer trade; and no matter what happens today, the situation, by and large, will be the same for us.  If we do not industrialise, our people will have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>As far as we on this side are concerned, we welcome these measures. They are in line with the report of the <Col N="559" /> CIO.  They bear the approbation not only of the Government but of those who are charged with the task of finding out exactly what we need.  The question of development centres was dealt with by that committee, and the Minister says he will consider that matter later.  I am not convinced that a rigid line in regard to development centres would be a good thing.  I am not convinced, for instance, that the Shannon Free Airport Industrial Estate is doing as well as it should. That is not meant as a criticism.  But you can regularise too much.</P>
    <P>If an industrialist likes a place, if he likes the opportunity of employing good labour and likes services such as railways and wharfs, there should not be too great a desire to push him towards a centre for development.  If he is prepared to go to one place and another place loses him, I would lean towards giving him the maximum aid. At the same time, we should take into account the needs of the undeveloped areas and the necessity for preserving some difference, with the saving clause that if a development company or an individual has attracted an industry to an area, that area should get the industry, if it is willing to come there.</P>
    <P>One often hears of industrialists coming to an area as if politicians or development committees had attracted them.  I know that many people who come here make contact with the presidents of chambers of commerce or with mayors or corporations.  But most of them make a business contact, and it is from there that the project progresses.  The person who seeks to attract a person to a particular area may be pushing his own boat out at the same time, but, if it gives employment, I am happy.  You cannot interfere too much.  We must try to attract the type of industry that will allow us to employ our own people at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of high investment industries with a relatively small employment content. The safety clause there is that grants are to be limited to £1,000 per worker employed.  I believe that is right.  I do not think anybody should get more than £1,000 by way of grant in order <Col N="560" /> to employ one worker.  I wonder if an industry in which there is a very high level of capital investment in relation to the number of workers employed is the type of industry we can afford or one that would be of any value to us? The only reason it would be of any value is its effect on our economy and the other industrial sectors.  This sort of industry is usually a high-profit industry.  People who come here to set up industry, whether it is an industry of that kind or not, do so for a profit. I wonder should we give a grant of one quarter and a grant loan of one quarter, say, of £200,000, to an industry where the employment per worker in relation to capital invested might be of the order of one worker per £20,000 or £30,000?  It is a question of whether we can afford it.  Probably we can.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything critical about legislation we have just passed. We are debating legislation for Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta which I hope will go through.  There is no grant suggested by the Minister.  This is an industry where we are expending £20,000 to employ one worker.  In the ordinary way, however, if there were not a labour crisis in an area, that is too much money.  We could spend it better on the small industries mentioned and in other ways in order to employ our people.  It is an overenthusiastic approach and might be to our detriment.  We are limited in the amount of money we can spend.  Relative to our needs, our national loans are small.  It is not so long since a national loan did not fill.  Somebody might say over there: &ldquo;They did not fill for you.&rdquo;  But we can say we are offering extremely attractive terms. Both statements would be correct.</P>
    <P>The figure given of £1,000 per worker employed is more in line with what we should expend in relation to what is available.  Ten or 12 years ago, it was believed that £1,000 should employ one worker.  Now, that is gone forever and the figure is £3,000 or £4,000.  I do not think an industry which requires to spend £20,000 in order to employ one worker would be of any interest to us.  I commend this legislation.  If I sounded a bit critical at the start, I am sure the Minister <Col N="561" /> will realise it was not all intentional anyway.</P>

      <P>We in the eastern part of the country welcome this Bill. We always felt that the industrial grants were loaded in favour of the western areas.  When we tried to get industrialists interested in the east, they always pointed out the advantages of going west.  Over the years, we in Ireland have had a problem of unemployment and emigration.  The only way of solving that is by building factories.  The land can absorb only a certain number; and where can the remainder go except into industry? We have been building factories at a reasonably fast rate, but we in the east have always been up against this problem of higher grants in the west. One of the most welcome features in the Bill is that large industries can be established outside the west and still receive a grant.  Further, the industry does not have to be near a seaport in the east in order to receive the higher grant.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to consider the idea of giving more help to small factories and firms.  Quite a number of these have been refused grants by Foras Tionscal.  Looking back over the years, we cannot fail to appreciate that most of what are now big firms had very small beginnings and worked up.  We have the case of Henry Ford who started in a small way and I am led to believe that the Guinness firm also had a small beginning. We must remember it is our people at home, with initiative and foresight, who will provide the fabric of our national industrial effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a person working with a firm who has an idea and whose only chance of expanding it is at night when he finishes work.  He does it as a hobby, which later develops to the stage where he is able to employ a few people.  Then he finds he is held up for the extra money necessary for expansion in his efforts to develop and attract markets.  Grants are not available to him.  If some of this money were devoted to helping such small <Col N="562" /> firms, it would give a considerable amount of employment in the country and would foster a new race of industrialists who would be completely Irish, with their roots in the country.  I would ask the Minister to consider that idea.</P>
    <P>We all welcome industries in all parts of the country since they give so much employment.  In the different areas, we have development associations, chambers of commerce, anxious to attract industries to their towns but who find it very hard to get in touch with interested industrial concerns. There is a wide gap between a town looking for an industry and an industry abroad anxious to set up a factory somewhere in Ireland.  I submit that better liaison facilities should be available to chambers of commerce and other development associations in towns in this country and interested industrialists abroad.  I can understand the view of the Department that industrialists should not be pestered by every town in Ireland which is anxious to contact an industry but there must be some way in which the Industrial Development Association can help in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that the Minister, in this legislation, is thinking in terms of providing grants towards the enlargement and adaptation of existing concerns.  It is very good for our economy as a whole to see existing industries enlarging.  Nothing succeeds like success and from that point of view, we cannot welcome too warmly the development over the past few years of our smaller concerns.  I attended the opening of a new building at Naas last year.  The Minister performed the official opening ceremony in respect of a building which was practically doubling the size of the old factory.  Many firms lack the capital to carry out such extensions and therefore we can see the benefit of this legislation in helping them to get over that difficulty.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for grants towards the training of workers.  That will be particularly welcome in parts of the country.  I was interested in a concern in Kilcullen, County Kildare, some time ago.  We went before the <Col N="563" /> Industrial Development Association and told them that the Germans interested in the undertaking were seeking a grant towards the cost of training employees.  Apparently it takes the best part of six months properly to train personnel in the use of machines and when these people discovered there was very little hope of a grant for this purpose, it dampened their enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>When considering the establishment of an industry in any area, we need to study carefully what is needed most from a new factory.  With a new tractor, the controls have to be explained.  They will always be different, just as in a new car.  That is much more so in the case of a new industry.  The new machines will be completely foreign to anybody in the area.  Naturally, you will not get the same amount of production out of those machines until the workers are fully skilled in their use.  The concern may have to train quite a number of workers, say, 100 or 200, or maybe more.  Naturally, we should give a grant towards training.  I welcome this Bill because that is one aspect which will help to promote industries in my part of the country.</P>
    <P>Section 6 relates to grants towards roads and bridges.  They are essential. A factory will need a road into it.  If it needs a river or a plentiful supply of water, it will have to be based near a river and naturally there will be a bridge.  I welcome the idea of taking into account every aspect that a factory will need&mdash;roads, bridges, harbour equipment, if near a seaport, and a railway line.  These will be welcomed, particularly in some of the areas where the railway may be closing down.  It may help to preserve the railway line in that area.</P>
    <P>There are also grants for dwelling accommodation.  There was the question of the location of a factory in Kilcock last year and difficulty arose about getting houses for skilled workers for that factory.  There was no help towards the building of houses or the development of a site there and the promoters of that industry turned <Col N="564" /> away from the town.  If this Bill had been in operation a year ago, I feel that today Kilcock would have another factory.  An extra industry in Kilcock would be a great advantage from the point of view of employment given over a very wide area.  Such extra employment would be a boon to the area for miles around.  In that respect, I particularly welcome the relevant section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that development authorities and chambers of commerce should be able to meet industrialists and to invite them to their area.  It is rather difficult to get in contact with them.  Many large firms in the world had very small beginnings.  If something could be done for the small concerns throughout our country, which cannot qualify for grants, it would be a very good thing and quite possibly it would help them to develop into very big concerns in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which I consider is, to a considerable extent, indicative of fresh thinking by the Minister, An Foras Tionscal and the IDA on the State policy of providing cash grants to industry by way of incentive for setting up new industries. The maximum grant is being raised in the Bill to £250,000 and the difference in treatment between the undeveloped areas and the rest of the country is to a great extent being removed.  I welcome that because, as I have said here on several occasions, artificial incentives to industry to localise itself in one place rather than another can be overdone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies on all sides of the House have spoken this evening of the alleged prejudice of the IDA against very small-scale industry.  I do not believe that such a prejudice exists.  However, I do believe that the IDA must be fully conscious of the grave competitive disadvantages with which any very small-scale industry is faced.  The idea of establishing a tiny factory in a rural town or village as a means of revitalising that area is, to some extent, based on a false premise.  The industry which will succeed in the future is the large-scale industry, the industry which <Col N="565" /> can avail of automated techniques, the industry which can engage in research, the industry which is sufficiently well capitalised to enter into world markets and to engage in production on a large scale.  All the indications throughout the world are that these are the industries which will thrive in the future.  The economies of large-scale mass production are very considerable.</P>
    <P>Because I think that the removal of the disparity between the undeveloped areas and the rest of the country and the raising of the maximum grant are indications of fresh thinking in regard to this matter, I welcome this Bill.  I have great respect and sympathy for any Deputy who is anxious to obtain employment for the people of the towns and villages in his constituency but we must strive to take a national view of this problem of providing new employment opportunities.  Employment provided anywhere in the country is a good thing.  Above all, I believe we should avoid sentimentality in our approach to the question of establishing industry in outlying areas.</P>
    <P>We have heard it said that the proper type of industry to establish in this country is one which utilises agricultural raw material.  The raw material for Irish industry in the future is Irish brainpower and that is why I welome particularly the establishment of large-scale industries which will have the finances to engage in research which is very largely the clue to industrial prosperity in this age.  We all know the story of the wonder fabric terylene, a product which was developed only after immense research.  If the firm which developed that product had not the funds to engage in that research, it would never have been discovered. Irish brains are second to none and if we condition ourselves to regard Irish brainpower as the basic raw material of industry, we shall develop that type of industry which will exploit world markets on a large scale.</P>
    <P>Many of the grants being made under this scheme are being given to foreign industrialists.  From time to time, one does hear criticism of that, and those persons who engage in criticism, for example, of Germans <Col N="566" /> entering the industrial sphere in this country appear to take their cue from the British Tory press.  We should welcome industrialists, no matter from where they come, and indeed I welcome particularly the turnabout in Fianna Fáil policy in this respect.  I would urge the Minister to pursue to its logical conclusion this policy of welcoming foreign industrialists and repeal what remains of the Control of Manufactures Acts.  We should make it clear to foreigners when they come to this country that we are a plain, simple people, that we are not trying to create here a mecca for millionaires&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>But not too simple, I hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that, in particular, our fabric of industrial relations is based on the trade union movement and that we expect employers to recognise that.  I say that because there have been one or two indications of a certain degree of misunderstanding by foreigners on that score.  I often wish someone could persuade the Minister to urge those foreigners engaged in industry here to set up, where they can, profit-sharing schemes whereby the workers engaged in their industries will share in the profits and thus ensure some return to Irish nationals for the capital made available so generously by the State to these people who come here.</P>
      <P>A very good case can be made for the Minister or the Industrial Development Authority insisting on the right to appoint watchdog directors, his nominees or one of his nominees, to these companies, particularly foreign companies which receive large grants from the State.  We have the precedent there already where the Industrial Credit Company is concerned. As far as I know, they very rarely invest in a company without insisting on some measure of control. Even if the State were never to draw profits from its investment in these industries&mdash;for these are free grants which are envisaged by the Bill&mdash;it would be well that the Irish taxpayers were represented on the boards of these companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> I mentioned a few moments ago that artificial inducements to localise industry in one place or another can perhaps be overdone.  Industries should, first and foremost, be located in those places where they will be most efficient, where costs can be kept down to the minimum, and that means usually adjoining a seaport.  Tremendous economies can be achieved by industries where they are to a greater or lesser extent concentrated together as compared with the industry which may be miles away from its counterpart. I do not say that in order to make the case that more new industries should be given to Dublin rather than other parts of the country.  On the contrary, I recognise that Dublin is far too big for the size of the country and I deplore the parochial approach to this problem of creating new employment opportunities in this State. There is too much wrangling going on between one town and another; there is too much bickering confronting the Industrial Development Authority, with Deputies saying: &ldquo;You did not give us an industry and you gave it to some place else.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister has dropped the very rigid approach to the question of undeveloped areas <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the country, the time has come seriously to consider the establishment, somewhere within 50 or 60 miles of Dublin, of a new town on the lines of the British new towns such as Harlowe and other places about which we have heard, where we could have six, eight or ten industries which would have the advantage of lower costs and a competitive advantage in entering world markets.  There is no doubt whatever that the only industries which will succeed in the future are those which can turn out the competitive product without protection which will sell itself on the international markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  To my mind, it is a further advance in the position we are endeavouring to reach to provide employment for our own people.  I welcome it particularly because of what Deputy Donegan called pockets.  In my constituency, in <Col N="568" /> Cobh, Midleton, Youghal and Mallow, we have industries, but the town of Fermoy is a blot on the landscape in that regard.  Steps were practically ready to be taken to get an industry in Fermoy when the Undeveloped Areas Bill cropped up.  I hope we will now have an opportunity of getting a decent industry there to cope with the unemployment which undoubtedly exists in that area.  There is also a stretch of hinterland from Kanturk and Newmarket to the Kerry boundary in which there is an undoubted opportunity for an industry based on agriculture about which my friends opposite talked.</P>
      <P>We must keep in mind that any industry based on agriculture will have to realise that the employment that will undoubtedly be created on the land through that industry must be quoted at an entirely different price from the price paid to agricultural labour today.  Those of us who are living in what I might call practically industrial areas and who are farming in those areas find that very often the agricultural labour disappears overnight. There is no man&mdash;and more credit to them&mdash;who has only the labour of his bones to offer who will work for £6 or £7 a week on the land when he can get anything from £14 to £25 a week in industry.  That is the position at present existing within a few miles of my door and I am proud to see it there.  There must be a levelling up in regard to the agricultural industry in general.  The days of cheap food are gone.</P>
      <P>I was looking at Section 2 of the Bill and I was wondering how it would work out.  There are proposals in regard to AFD plants which are to be established in the south.  An AFD plant will require a capital of £250,000.  The labour force of the factory will be 700 people, not counting transport, clerical and field workers.  If we could get rid of subsection (1) (b), we would be entitled to the grant of £250,000.  I take it that under this Bill the plant will be entitled to £125,000, that is, one half of the total amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering whether the farmer who turns to intensive farming, to the production of large quantities of <Col N="569" /> vegetables, will be entitled to 50 per cent. costs under this Bill.  At present he is entitled to £17 when he employs an extra man.  This Bill provides for a grant of £1,000 if you employ an extra man, so I was wondering whether agriculture is an industry within the meaning of the Act, and whether when we have these factories established, and if we give employment to ten extra men for the production of cabbage and cauliflowers or anything of that description, we are entitled to a 50 per cent. grant towards the cost of the job, or are we entitled to £1,000 per man?  I cannot see how we can be done out of it.  It will be very happy news for the tillage farmers in my constituency.</P>
    <P>After all, they are establishing an industry to grow cauliflower, cabbage or peas and, in my opinion, they are entitled to that grant the same as the industrialists, whether they are Germans or Jews.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>As I pointed out at the outset, there is no use in offering a man an uneconomic price to grow something, just as there was no use in offering 1/- a gallon for milk.  We have come to the point where we must pay a farmer sufficient money to enable him, in turn, to pay his workers something very close to the industrial wage, something that will keep him on the land, something that will not put us in the position into which we are rapidly drifting, in which there will be no one left on the land except the old age pensioner or the cripple.  That is happening very rapidly right through the rural areas.</P>

      <P>You will not cure it by telling a man: &ldquo;You keep cows and milk them, and we will pay you 1/- a gallon for five years.&rdquo;  That would not enable him to pay £1 a week to his worker.  We have to change that.  We have to get away from that aspect, so far as agriculture is concerned.  We are, I think, going the proper way <Col N="570" /> about it when we establish, within reasonable distance of one another, vegetable processing plants which will undoubtedly give employment, in the first instance, to the rural workers in the district and, in the second instance, will give employment on the land to extra men.  If I am wrong the Minister, when he comes to conclude, will dash any hopes that I may have raised.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, will a farmer who employs ten extra men for the production of peas, cauliflowers, or cabbage, be entitled to 50 per cent. of the extra cost of setting up the machinery to do so?  Or, if that is too high, will he be entitled to £1,000 per man put into employment?  We hear a great deal from the non-farmer about the flight from the land.  If the non-farmer were brought in for a day, and kept on the land, he would die of fright.  If these people are so anxious about the flight from the land, should the same terms not apply equally to the man giving employment on the land as to the man who builds a factory?  If the idea is to give £1,000 to a man to employ another man in an industry, why should the poor old farmer get only £17 for employing a man on the land?  The gap is too great and it is time it was narrowed.  I will not speak about the Common Market.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is an improvement in that it gives an opportunity to areas which are, in my opinion, in a worse position than any undeveloped area in the country.  I refer to the pockets centred in places where there is a great deal of employment. I have stated what I think will obtain under this measure.  If I am wrong, the Minister will contradict me when he comes to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other <Col N="572" /> speakers, I welcome this Bill, but with certain reservations.  We are all, I think, very dissatisfied with the existing legislation, which appears to have failed completely in its purpose of providing employment in the underdeveloped areas since emigration from those areas is just as strong, if not stronger, than it was before.  This is an attempt now to equalise or equate the situation in the whole country and to give to other parts of the country benefits hitherto enjoyed only in the underdeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there is really no change in the powers held by Foras Tionscal.  I should like the Minister to tell the House if it is true that the entire Board is composed of civil servants.  While accepting that the Minister must appoint people for the purpose of protecting the State investment and ensuring that the funds made available are utilised to the best advantage, I cannot conceive that civil servants are the best people to decide local interests, the siting of industries, and so on.  Perforce they must consider largely the statistical book point of view.  As long as they can place the investment with a reasonable guarantee of its being successful and with the possibility of its creating certain employment, everything is all right from their angle; but the human aspect should enter into the picture as well.  There are many instances in which small industries should have been able to get certain benefits from the State.  I am personally cognisant of several.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see anything in the Minister's speech that highlights the necessity for the development of small rural industries.  If we look at the country as a whole&mdash;this is world-wide&mdash;and look at the dwindling agricultural employment potential, the Minister will accept that one of the most important things and one of the most eminently desirable things here is the development as far as possible of small rural industries.  If we do not develop on those lines, then we shall not keep our people on the land.  The Minister's speech dealt with large sums of money&mdash;£250,000, £500,000 and augmentations by way of financial loan, <Col N="573" /> industrial loans, and so on.  There is very little reference to the smaller type of industry.</P>
    <P>Very recently, I attended a conference of the FAO in Rome.  One of their great problems was that of dealing with the rural population.  One of their great aims is to retain as far as possible rural populations where they were born and bred, not only because it is desirable that people should stay in their own surroundings, if possible, but also in order to preserve the inherent stability of the State itself.  Their solution for the problem is the establishment of rural industries.</P>
    <P>From time to time, many people have come to me and asked me if I could get from the Industrial Credit Corporation, Foras Tionscal, or whatever the body was, the wherewithal to enable them to start a small industry. In many cases the sum was as small as £5,000 or £10,000.  I have been unable to get it on any occasion whatever.  In any of the bigger projects that I have been concerned with&mdash; there were only one or two where I have been acting on behalf of people who wished to start something in my constituency or in adjacent constituencies&mdash;where bigger sums of money were involved, I found them much more accommodating.  I should like to direct the Minister's attention to that and would ask him, when replying to the debate, to reassure me and the House that there is provision in these two Bills to meet that very vital problem.</P>
    <P>If that is not done, I do not think the aim of these two Bills will be achieved.  As I take it, the aim of the Bills and of previous legislation is to retain our people within this country, to stop emigration, to give employment and, naturally, to expand our economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>To return to the constitution of Foras Tionscal, if I am correct in my surmise, we are dealing with a group of civil servants.</P>

I should be glad to know if private individuals are appointed to Foras Tionscal, what particular qualifications they have, whether the Minister feels they are the type of people who have a full understanding of local conditions, if they are people who have knowledge of situations in rural Ireland and outside the city of Dublin, who have knowledge of conditions other than in the west of Ireland because, if we are to site industries and utilise the State funds at our disposal to the best purpose, we have to deal with every class and section in the community.  The Minister will agree, perhaps, that the majority of the directors of Foras Tionscal are civil servants.  Am I right in that?</P>

If a parliamentarian such as I, or any other Deputy, wants to make representation at political level, he is precluded from doing so because the Minister has delegated to Foras Tionscal complete authority in these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking as one member of the Dáil.  I am hoping that when this Bill goes through, it will not be another of those Bills that remove our functions from us because they are gradually being swept away.  I should like to feel that the Minister would embody in this Bill an appeal to himself so that a Deputy or any citizen of the State who felt in a particular instance that Foras Tionscal were not acting in the best interests of the country would be in a position to raise the matter in Parliament and highlight the situation which he believed to be undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> I had a case not so very long ago where I considered that quite an injustice was being done to an old-established firm in this country.  I shall not disclose the facts now.  The firm had its own particular trade and had been at it for generations.  They were prepared to put up considerable sums of money.  They wanted to get a State grant.  They were precluded from doing so because there was a firm of the same type in Dublin which it was felt would be affected.  That is a matter that could have been raised in Parliament but I was precluded from raising it. I was told, on making application to the Minister concerned&mdash;it was not the present Minister&mdash;that he had no function in the matter, that it was purely a matter for Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>I should like to get away from that sort of thing and to feel that Parliament is still sovereign and that Deputies still have the right, when they want to make representations on behalf of industries and the siting of industries and grants and loans for industries, to do so in Dáil Éireann.  The only opportunity we get of highlighting situations such as that is when a Bill comes before us.  If I ask a Parliamentary Question relating to some instance where I think things are not being done as they should be, I am told by the Minister that he has no function in the matter, that it is a matter for Foras Tionscal.  I am sure the Minister would be the first to agree that if I were to pose Parliamentary Questions to him on the subject of particular industries, that is the answer I would get, or else that it was a matter for the industry concerned and that he had no function in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I have raised these matters because we are introducing legislation here for the purpose of allowing considerable sums of money to be made available, which to a large extent is State money.  The Minister referred to £1,000 per worker as being the amount of money available.  I should like to agree with that straight away.  That is quite a good idea.  It is a safeguard against the establishment of industries on which large sums of money are expended, which will not have the <Col N="576" /> labour potential that is so desirable. But, how does the Minister reconcile that fact with the Bill which was before us last week in relation to nitrogenous fertiliser?  The sum of money involved there&mdash;every shilling of which is State money&mdash;is far in excess of £1,000 per worker.  I do not know what the ratio is.  The Minister did not state it.  An outside organisation that had studied the matter carefully and that has economic advisers at its disposal, computed the figure at as high as nearly £20,000 per worker.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the point that all State money should be safeguarded and that there should be complete equation as between all types of national expenditure or, shall we say, expenditure out of public funds.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill for re-equipment of factories.  There has been a difficulty so far.  When trying to induce foreigners to participate in our industrial revival one finds it is very easy to get a German, French, Italian, Continental, British or even American firm interested in industry here provided it is a new industry and had the benefits of the factory being built and grants being made available.  That was a completely anomalous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the position of the already established factories where it was almost impossible to secure any assistance from the State other than something in the line of technical assistance.</P>
    <P>This is a new form of legislation which did not exist before and it will be of tremendous benefit to the country.  With regard to the re-equipment loans, could the Minister indicate the percentage rate on the re-equipment loans, whether they are on the full commercial rates of interest or whether firms that have justified their existence and have shown themselves to be able to manufacture and to export will get slightly more liberal terms than the ordinary somewhat high rate for loans that prevails to-day? I think the rate today is in the neighbourhood of 6 per cent.</P>

      <P>There is another thing that is missing from the Bill which, perhaps, the Minister might consider embodying in it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the fact that industries had to be completely competitive and his argument was that it would be better if they were sited in bigger centres so that they could be up to date and competitive in every way.  That is all right from one angle but our purpose in legislating here this evening is to try to give widely disseminated employment.  To do that, as I stressed in my opening remarks, it is desirable to have these rural industries scattered about even in small places.  I would even go into the smaller villages, or, anyhow, the small towns, and ensure that the surplus workers will not have to emigrate but will be employed in industry.</P>
      <P>An easy way to get over Deputy Byrne's difficulty about being competitive would be for firms manufacturing the same products to combine.  If Foras Tionscal were prepared to give grants to start smaller processing firms in different parts of the country&mdash;such as has been started in Deputy P. O'Donnell's constituency by a priest in Glencolumbkille, although he had to go to America to collect the money because the State would not give it&mdash; and if you had many such small industries, their co-ordination for the purpose of exporting would be very desirable. Even apart from the small industries, that is desirable for the bigger type of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> We are facing a free trade area of some sort, whatever comes out of the political morass that exists at present in Europe and in other places.  It is desirable that firms should co-ordinate as much as possible and is the Minister prepared to embody in these Bills, if they are not already embodied, grants or loans for firms which are prepared to co-ordinate for exporting?  That is the only chance these firms will have of being competitive against bigger firms.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in mass firms.  That, you might say, is almost the communisation of firms.  I am a very strong supporter of private enterprise. I believe any small concern which is run by private individuals deserves all the encouragement it can get, but if it is to hold sway in this modern life, it is absolutely necessary for it to have the support of its sister and brother firms.  The Minister could embody some assistance in that respect in some form of legislation.  Perhaps it was never more important than it is today because, as I say, we are facing free trade of some sort and of a wider variety in the very near future.</P>
    <P>One other thing that strikes me is that on many occasions on my travels I have tried to interest people to come to my constituency, or at least to Ireland, to start an industry.  I am always asked: &ldquo;What facilities have you got in the town in question?&rdquo; They always ask about water, light and transport and so on but in the final analysis they always come back to the question of housing.  The Minister mentioned in his opening statement that bridges and roads were being constructed, I wonder if there is anything in this legislation dealing with the housing question because I am absolutely sure that the local authorities are not going to do it. There is a town in my constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am rather disappointed with these Bills, for this reason, that we now appear to abandon all hope of establishing industries in the undeveloped areas as defined. This, in my opinion, is the deathknell of the undeveloped areas and let us remember that the undeveloped areas comprise the Gaeltacht, the Breac-Ghaeltacht and the congested areas. Now we are going to extend to the remainder of the State practically the same facilities as were given to projects in the undeveloped areas prior to this. Let us, first of all, consider the title of the original Bill.  It was known as the Undeveloped Areas Act.  In other words, we admitted there was an undeveloped area and an Act was introduced to enable prospective industrialists to go in there and establish industries, and to assist them in establishing industries and to give employment to the residents in the undeveloped area.  Grants and facilities were made available to these prospective industrialists.  I do not think we can safely say at this stage that the undeveloped areas no longer remain undeveloped.  I think we are all in agreement that there are still undeveloped areas.  The areas as defined in the original Act are still undeveloped but they will become less undeveloped after these Acts have been passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if I said that.  I am glad the Minister corrected me because I would not like it to go on the record but certainly they will become less developed after these Bills have been enacted.  There is not the slightest doubt about that.</P>
      <P>We all know that these areas as defined in the original Act were areas to which no industrialist wished to go, areas in the poorer parts of rural Ireland, the west, the north-west and the south-west.  In other words, they were the areas west of the Shannon, the areas, remember, to which Cromwell once assigned the people of Ireland and unfortunately the people of Ireland clung to these areas.  A serious effort was made to develop these areas and to provide industries in them but now evidently we are throwing our hats at them.  The next thing we will find is that they will be on a par with the rest of Ireland.</P>
      <P>As a result of lack of development in those areas, there is a great drain on population by way of emigration and migration.  Not only are the Government going to do less for them in the future but, in my opinion, are going to do them considerably more harm if the forecast of the Minister for Lands is correct when he says that he is going to take from migrants and emigrants who no longer work them, their own farms and distribute them among the congests.  That is a bad thing.</P>
      <P>The undeveloped areas are the cradle of the language and if we are ever to revive the language as the spoken tongue, it will only be by developing industries in those areas and retaining the people in them.  As it is, native speakers are fast flowing away from these localities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> I think the Minister was stampeded into introducing these Bills in the erroneous belief that we were about to enter the Common Market and that he might attract more industrialists to other parts of Ireland than were prepared to go to the congested areas of the west and north-west.  Far be it from me to anticipate the decision of the Government but perhaps they will wish to review the situation after today's occurrence in Brussels.  Perhaps we may wait for some time for the Committee Stage of this Bill until we see what the future outlook on industrialisation here is.  That may be difficult to forecast.  I think this is a Bill in preparation for a breakdown of the paper tariff walls which have been built around our mushroom industries in the past.  It is a preparation for our entry into some free trade association and we should know into what association we are going before we rush through Bills such as this.</P>
    <P>If anything, we should concentrate on giving higher grants to industrialists who would wish to come into these undeveloped areas.  It is strange that when the Undeveloped Areas Act was introduced, it singled out certain parts of the country, not just by chance but after careful study of the economic, financial and population status of the different areas and it said these are undeveloped areas in which industries could and should be set up and encouragement given to people to go there.  It was a very good Act and some very fine industries were set up in the undeveloped areas as a result of it which would never have been set up there but for the encouragement and enticement held out by it.  Once you put the rest of the country almost on a par with the undeveloped areas, you will leave those areas as they are now and they will never become more developed than they are to-day.</P>
    <P>These Bills are premature.  We should first wait and see what the future holds for this country, see if we can develop undeveloped areas more than we have done.  If we have money to spare or spend, for God's sake, let us spend it to the credit of the native tongue and the Gaeltacht and the undeveloped areas before extending <Col N="582" /> these facilities to the remainder of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I heard of the introduction of these Bills, I thought it was a rather inopportune time for the Minister to bring forward legislation concerning industrial development.  We know that Britain and Ireland are trying to get into the Common Market and the outcome of the negotiations could not be foreseen in the past few weeks.  Possibly a clearer light has been thrown on the issue to-day.  I thought that with the changes that our entry to EEC might bring about, it would be advisable for the Minister to hold over any Bills dealing with industrial development until we were definite as to whether or not our application for membership of the Common Market is likely to succeed.  Undoubtedly, such an event would have a very big effect on our industrial development.</P>
      <P>It is more than 11 years since the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was then Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, introduced the Undeveloped Areas Act.  He made a lengthy statement on what he thought that Act would bring about.  He foresaw then that the face of the undeveloped areas would be changed within a reasonably short period, within, I am sure, the eleven years that have now elapsed, and that so many industries would spring up in those areas that full employment would be achieved there and the need for emigration could be completely wiped out.</P>
      <P>In fact, very few changes have taken place and they are confined to a limited number of areas.  The West Cork Deputies were persistently agitating for more consideration for their constituency in which there were some areas undoubtedly the most underdeveloped in the country.  While we are thankful for the few industries we have got in the past few years, it is very little compensation when one looks at the expenditure under the Act since it was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is mention now of grants not exceeding £500,000 and £250,000.  I think if we encouraged smaller industries <Col N="583" /> in the undeveloped areas, catering perhaps for not more than 40 or 50 workers and requiring only small capital and if these were based on a solid foundation and deemed economic, it would be a better way of meeting the situation than waiting for a big foreign industrialist to come along to initiate a project involving a capital expenditure of, perhaps, £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and the House are disappointed so far as foreign industrialists are concerned. Some years ago, it was thought that while Irish people might not take much action, we would have a number of foreigners coming in, particularly from West Germany and the US and, to a lesser extent, from Britain, to establish industries here and solve all our problems. The number who have come has not measured up to our expectations. They are few and far between. In the past 12 or 18 months, the prospects of getting these industrialists to come here to establish industries were, I think, on the decline.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said this Bill is bound to have an adverse effect on the undeveloped areas.  That is obvious. When the Minister introduced the Undeveloped Areas Act in 1951 it was specifically to attract industrialists to those areas with a view to providing much needed employment.  The Minister is now twisting the other way.  Under the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill he is giving grants which are almost as attractive as the grants under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  If we do succeed in getting foreigners to establish industries here in the future, it is unlikely they will set them up in the more remote parts such as the seaboard of Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Kerry or West Cork when the concessions given by the State are almost as good in the more favoured parts of the country.</P>
    <P>That being so, it is little use for the undeveloped areas to be looking forward to the establishment of industry by foreigners.  Having regard to the many statements made in the past, particularly those by the Minister, about <Col N="584" /> the disadvantages of life in the undeveloped areas and seeing it is unlikely that we can attract foreigners there, could we not do something ourselves? Could we not devise some suitable projects and establish them in the undeveloped areas just as well as any gentleman coming from West Germany, Britain or the United States? We have embassies in all those countries. We have a whole-time special agent in West Germany.  I do not know if we have a second one there.  He is searching for suitable industrialists to establish subsidiary companies here.</P>
    <P>What about having a co-ordination of the different Departments of State dealing with the undeveloped areas? What about having the heads of Civil Service Departments devising schemes to establish industries in suitable locations in the undeveloped areas, industries established by Irishmen for Irishmen, instead of waiting for the strangers to come and do it?  Anyone who has read &ldquo; Aesop's Fables &rdquo; knows the position of the man who waited for the stranger to come and do his work. It was not done.  The same thing can be said of developments in the undeveloped areas.  If we are to wait for the British, the Americans and the West Germans to establish industries and brighten the lives of the people living in those areas, I am afraid we will have a long wait.  A few places may be fortunate but, generally speaking, within the next 20 years I cannot see the problem solved to any appreciable extent if we are waiting for outside bodies.  We have here employment giving bodies such as the Department of Local Government, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Furthermore, the Department of Social Welfare has big obligations in such areas in regard to the payment of benefits of one kind or another to those unemployed. That is essential so long as people are unemployed in those areas.</P>
    <P>It would be much better if the money so paid out were channelled into some kind of industrial project.  Instead of unemployment benefit being paid in a particular area, some industry could be established.  This would be more welcome to the workers than going along to the employment <Col N="585" /> exchange every Tuesday and Wednesday and signing for unemployment assistance or benefit.  The money expended on such benefits is of such a size that it would go a long way towards meeting the cost of industrial projects in some places.  The trouble is to find an industry that would be soundly based, likely to continue and prove an economic proposition.  But have we not a plentiful supply of highly-paid senior officials in the various Departments who have the knowledge and technical capabilities of devising schemes for suitable industries to meet the needs of these areas?  Surely we could have a coordinating committee from the Minister's own Department or from such bodies as An Foras Tionscal or other kindred organisations to develop suitable schemes for different localities? Until we do that, the outlook for the undeveloped areas will not be very bright.</P>
    <P>I think the best service I can do the undeveloped areas is to appeal to the Minister to forget about foreign industrialists for a while and to think more in terms of providing sound industries established by our own people.  There need not be much delay.  The position so far as our commitments with foreign countries are concerned is relatively clear.  We must continue planning for the future.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's Department, no notice is taken of the principal industry in this country, the agricultural industry.  Earlier this evening, the Minister stated he would be prepared to give a grant of £1,000 for every man employed.  The Minister, on page 7 of his statement, says he is prepared to give a grant, apart altogether from the amount put up by the industrialist concerned, of £1,000 to any firm that will be able to create employment for even one worker.  We have in the rural parts of this country&mdash;and I would say that the undeveloped areas could be said to compose the rural part of Ireland&mdash;several people capable of managing land who at the moment have not got any land to manage.  If they had such an outlet for their produce as vegetable processing factories, they and their families could <Col N="586" /> make decent livelihoods.  Particularly in the midlands, in fact throughout the country, we have land which is not being utilised by the owners and the unfortunate thing about it is that it is the best land that is not being utilised.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not enter into a discussion on land under this Bill.  This Bill relates to industrial production and the Deputy is embarking on a dissertation on land and its quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure you will agree, Sir, that agriculture is termed an industry in this country. You will also be aware that I made a case earlier that there is no co-ordination between the different Departments. The Minister for Industry and Commerce will talk about industry but will have not a word to say on agriculture, while the Minister for Agriculture will talk at length on agriculture but will not say a word on industry.  You must join the two together.  If we had a little more co-ordination between Deputy J. Lynch and Deputy Smith, we would do better.  The day is gone when Ministers can think just of their own respective Departments.  They must now realise that the work of their Departments must be co-ordinated, that they all affect one another.</P>
      <P>We should have more co-operation and more planning from the top.  We should have more discussion between the heads of the various Departments. If we had, possibly we would be able to promote more employment not alone in industry but in agriculture as well.  It is quite evident that while all Parties in the House have welcomed foreign industrialists as being helpful in the promotion of employment, at the same time it could be said that every foreigner who has come in and who may in the future come in is interested in making a profit.  He came because he thought he would get a good business deal here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is it that if we have not got sufficient technical know-how as far as certain industries are concerned we cannot import some experts with such knowledge?  Surely we should be able to get from other countries people <Col N="587" /> with technical know-how on projects which our own advisers think are feasible and suitable for the undeveloped areas or any other part of the country.  Surely the State could put up the money necessary to provide us with such knowledge, or a proportion of it.  I have no doubt you would get a reasonable response from the people in the country for their share of such expenditure.  In Rosscarbery some years ago when there was hope of establishing a little industry in the locality, the people very quickly put up over £4,000, with an assurance that as much more would be forthcoming, if necessary.  When you have that spirit in a small place like that, it is evident the people of the country as a whole are desirous of helping themselves. They deserve help from the Minister in turn.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the eleven years since its passing, £3,083,079 has been paid out under this Act and I understand the amount of the grants approved up to the end of last year amounted to £6,128,859.  This shows that the industrial grants are catching up with grants under the Undeveloped Areas Act, even though the former are of much more recent origin.  The amount of industrial grants approved is about £4,500,000.  I am sure that when the present Minister spoke here in 1951 he never thought that by the end of January, 1963, the Exchequer would be called on to such an extent.</P>
    <P>It has come to our notice from time to time that some of the projects established throughout the country have not measured up to early expectations. Before an industry is established, before the State decide to back it, there should be a minute scrutiny of the credentials of those promoting it to ascertain whether they are likely to continue to stand on their own feet, because the most unsettling thing that could happen in an area is to have a factory established this year and have it closing down in 1965 or 1966. Therefore, I am in entire agreement with the rigid measures adopted by Foras Tionscal and the Department in screening all such applications as closely as possible.  It is no use <Col N="588" /> handing out money to people if there is nothing to show for it.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by asking the Minister to point out to the Government that we have failed to solve the problems of our undeveloped areas through the 1951 Bill, since amended.  The outlook there is not so bright and I believe that between them, the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Agriculture could establish a coordinating committee so as to provide all the technical advice necessary to solve the problems of the undeveloped areas.  I appeal to the Minister, then, to examine the position in that light and to try to get the Government to do something in that direction.  Surely it is likely to be more effective than waiting for other people to do our job?  Therefore, I am asking the Minister, having introduced his Bill, which to a big extent weighs against the undeveloped areas, to think of the other method I advocated for developing them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>While we all welcome any move on the part of the Government to industrialise the country, and thereby stem emigration, the Minister should realise that the present method of industrialising the country is not correct.  There should be comprehensive planning.  So far, planning has been haphazard to a certain extent.  If Irish money is spent on industrial firms which come into this country, then the Minister should be in a position to site the industry.  I understand he is not.  I understand that they can site the industry in any place they like.  That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should be in a position to ensure that any person who comes into this country to start an industry will site it where he thinks it desirable to do so.  The siting of an industry is very important in this country to keep the population in the different areas.  Deputy P. O'Donnell referred to the Gaeltacht areas and to the undeveloped areas along the western seaboard, and so on.  Everything should be done to establish industry in those places.  I believe that industrialists as a whole do not want to go to the western areas.  Therefore, it is the duty of the Government to <Col N="589" /> build whatever factory they decide to have in a certain area.  It is necessary to have greater co-operation between the Minister for Lands and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Industry and Commerce so as to have any industry which would be suited to an area located in it.</P>
    <P>The Government should build the factory, furnish it and put in a representative of the Department to see that everything is carried out properly.  That is essential.  After all, if the Irish people are to do the work, it is to the advantage of the Government&mdash;from the point of view of taxation&mdash;and it is to our advantage also that things are done in that way.  What is wrong with the ESB, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and Bord na Móna?  Why can we not have such industries in the undeveloped areas?  I hope the Minister will consider that point.</P>
    <P>We do not want to have the eastern part of this country over-populated, if you like to put it that way.  We do not want great big cities in this small country and other places like the deserts of Africa.  I do not wish to delay the House or the Minister but I hope he will consider the points I have made.</P>

      <P>This Bill is another retreat by the Government and another confession of failure.  I happened to be over in the west of Ireland and I saw some of the factories which were built and which never had a chance. They were built merely for the sake of building a factory.  It is one of these expensive lessons that the Government have to learn.</P>

      <P>I shall.  The Deputy was looking at what this Bill will do for his constituency and constituencies nearby.  I happened to be in Wexford on other business.  I had hoped to meet Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Corish that night.  I was told I could not meet them because a meeting was being held in Wexford in connection with an industrialist who had come into Wexford and they hoped that, with the help of some Wexford people, an industry would be started there.  I thought that was very good.  However, in the course of conversation with them some weeks later, they told me that the industrialist had come to Dublin and they had not heard from him after that.  Then he appeared somewhere in the western region.  He was to put up the industry and then, when he made up his costings, and so on, he just packed up and went out. This has been weighted against us all the time in the east as if we had no unemployment problem, as if the people in the eastern counties were like the people of the Pale and should have no concessions or receive no help from the Government and as if there should be no encouragement to people to erect factories in places where they should be erected.</P>
      <P>It appeared to me that the worst thing one could do in the eastern counties was to make a good case for a factory, even with promotion and everything else behind it.  If a good case were made, and it was mentioned that it would be a good idea to start a certain type of industry or type of manufacture in an eastern county or near an eastern town or city, the next thing one would hear about it would be that the promoters were packing up and were being brought across the Shannon.  I am glad we are on level terms at last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no bouquets to throw at the Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="591" /> so far as my constituency is concerned. I have no bouquets to throw at the Department of Industry and Commerce as far as their policy all down through the years is concerned.  It never had the support of the CIO which tells us that industry must be decentralised in Ireland.  The policy all the time seemed to be that Dublin got a great preference over all, over the west, over the east and over the south.  I have not the figures by me now but I shall have them tomorrow. A question had to be put down to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to find out how many industries were established over a period&mdash;&mdash;</P>
