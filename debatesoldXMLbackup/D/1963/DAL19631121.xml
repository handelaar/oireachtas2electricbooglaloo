      <P>On the Order of Business, may I raise a matter so that it may be brought to the attention of the Departments concerned?  Deputies are finding considerable difficulty in reading the carbon copies of replies to questions.  They are too faint and too blurred.  Perhaps if it goes on the record it will be seen and adequate attention will be given in the appropriate place.</P>

      <P>Before I moved to report progress last night, I had been saying that it is as important for us to know the genetic factors of our beef bulls as it is to know the genetic factors of our dairy bulls.  In any event, the finished product, no matter what it may be, whether meat or vegetables, must be the work of a combined organisation.  We must have the breed and the feed.  We must have the research worker and the technician all working in a combined operation to produce the article which in the final analysis will be acceptable to the housewife and the consumer.  These are the factors which will help us to sell and to hold our place for any product we have to export into a competitive market.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell, when concluding here last evening, had two complaints.One was that Deputy Lemass was an urban-minded Taoiseach.  I am not aware that there are set qualifications in this Parliament or in this House for the Taoiseach or his background.We need only go back and discuss Leaders of Governments from the foundation of this State.  One will find very few farmers.  I do not know whether Deputy Dillon would claim that he is a farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I take it, is speaking of coming events casting their shadows before them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether anyone would describe Deputy Dillon in Grafton Street as a clodhopper.  I do not think anyone would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy describe all farmers as clodhoppers? I do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a further complaint by Deputy T. O'Donnell, that the present Minister was very unpopular with farmers' organisations. I cannot recall one instance of Deputy Dillon, when Minister for Agriculture, being chaired by the farmers' organisations.  I do not know whether he can recall one instance himself.  I can recall a number of occasions when I attended meetings at which Deputy Dillon was present when <Col N="1849" /> there were quite a few people in the audience who would have loved to go home with his scalp on their belts.  He can recall those meetings himself.  So, let us not talk about whether a Minister is going to be popular with agricultural organisations or not.  I am sure we will wait for many a long day and will see very many Ministers for Agriculture pass through this Parliament before we find that man who will be chaired by the farmers' organisations.  Deputy Dillon, from his experience, cannot deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I am glad he is in the House.  Last week here, by way of interjection, Deputy Dillon described the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil as &ldquo;gutties&rdquo;.  It is on the record.  Since I came into this House I have listened, two, three and four times a year, to high-powered lectures from Deputy Dillon on the dignity of Parliament.</P>

      <P>It is at column 1577 of the Dáil Debates of 14th November, 1963, as follows:</P>
      <P>Mr. T. Lynch: At the same time, the Minister must admit that there were then serried rows of Fianna Fáil men almost coming across the floor to assault Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>Mr. Smith: I did not happen to be one of them, strange to say.</P>
      <P>Mr. T. Lynch: I did not make the accusation.  The attack was led by Fianna Fáil men.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: He had plenty of &ldquo;gutties&rdquo; to do it for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  That was true.</P>

    <Col N="1850" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether, in spite of all the high-powered lectures on the dignity of Parliament given here by Deputy Dillon, any member of this House should have the right to describe another member as a &ldquo;gutty&rdquo;.  We all know that Hitler used to divide the world into two classes of people.  The pro-Nazis were always virtuous and the non-Nazis were non-virtuous.  As far as Deputy Dillon is concerned, all the paragons of virtue sit on the Fine Gael Benches and all the non-virtuous sit on this side of the House.  That is the end result of all the high-powered lectures on the dignity of Parliament we have had from him.</P>
      <P>I would defend any Deputy on the opposite side of the House.  In the nine or ten years I have been a member of this House I have quite a few friends in the Labour Party and in Fine Gael and I would resent any member of this House, either on the Labour or Fine Gael Benches, being described as a &ldquo;gutty&rdquo;.  Yet, that is the word used by Deputy Dillon who comes in here three or four times a year to give us high-powered lectures on the dignity of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What has this to do with the Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with a remark made here and I am entitled to do that.  I will leave it at that.  I am not a Deputy who can be accused of being abusive to anybody but there are always a few plucked roosters at the other side of the House who are mad to have a go at anybody.  Since I came in here the dignity of this Parliament has deteriorated for that very reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, in concluding his speech on the Estimate, was not very gracious to the Minister for Agriculture.He advised him to go back to the green fields of Cavan and to go out on grass.  If we notice the pattern of people coming and going in this House very few of us will get a chance of going out on grass because the pattern here is immediate and sudden darkness.  Since I came in here, most of the people who were called from this House were called away suddenly. Deputy Smith has reached the evening <Col N="1851" /> of his life and, if he has had in this House an eventful and colourful career, and if he lives long enough to go back to the green fields of Cavan, I hope a Smith in the green fields of Cavan will not be a mushroom.</P>
    <P>I want to make a brief reference to the farm buildings scheme.  A considerable amount of money has been spent on the erection, reconstruction and improvement of farm buildings but I have one complaint to make about it. The people who supervise this work are not trained to suggest to the farmer a plan for his buildings.  In a well organised farmyard the buildings are planned to save labour which is a very important factor in any farmyard.The people who supervise the farm buildings scheme are not trained.</P>
    <P>In the ultimate, most of the buildings in our farmyards are erected in a haphazard manner.  An adviser who goes into a farmyard to advise on the erection of a new building, whether it be a cow byre or a fattening house, should be trained to tell the farmer to put the building in a certain spot from the point of view of labour saving and economy.  He should be able to say where the fattening house should be in relation to the new cow byre or the new piggery.  That is not being done.  Buildings are being put up <i>ad lib</i> and there is no overall plan. It is now overdue that we should have at least one adviser trained and qualified to advise a farmer as to what the ultimate plan of his farmyard should be.  We have not got that.</P>
    <P>There is a social aspect in the farmyard.Slums in the animal colony are as bad as slums for human beings. We know that in some of the more advanced countries there is a tendency to provide separate living quarters for sows, even for feeding pigs, and for calf rearing.  I believe that tendency will grow, because if you study the animal colonies in the average farmyard you will find the whole set-up is full of bullies and bullied.  You will find that in a herd of cows there is a bully and there is consequently quite a lot of blood spilling in a badly-organised animal colony in the farmyard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer again to a problem that has been bandied about the House during the parliamentary year, speeches repeated here <i>ad nauseam</i> by Deputy Dillon in relation to emigration from small farms in the west.  Of course, Deputy Dillon and some of the backbenchers of the Fine Gael Party have always been saying Fianna Fáil drove them off the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall say it again in a few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that they had to lock the doors and flee from their homes in the western countries because of the mad policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us examine the position as I have seen it.  I saw a pattern unfold itself in the years before, between and after the two wars.  I saw westerners arrive in the rural parts of Northern England and Scotland as migrants going out to work.  I saw that pattern grind to a halt during the first war when the people did not migrate and, I feel sure, whatever Government was in power, did not starve in the west.  No one here, not even Deputy Dillon who claims a first-class knowledge of the problems of small holdings in the west, has ever attempted to produce a plan that will solve this problem, because if we are to go back and examine the problem, we shall find it is an evolution from sustenance living to living as human beings should live.</P>
      <P>Those who were migrants in the period before the war became emigrants after the war.  They did not become emigrants because they were driven out by an inter-Party Government, a Fine Gael Government, or a Fianna Fáil Government.  They became emigrants because they refused to exist on a sustenance living and they got fed up of forcing a churlish soil, as Oliver Goldsmith said, for scanty bread.  They changed from migrants to emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They moved into the building sites in Britain where they were able to earn <Col N="1853" /> £5 a day for a minimum of five days a week.  There was a big difference between trying to eke out an existence on a small rundale holding in the west of Ireland and a fiver for every eight hours they worked in Britain.  That was one of the main reasons.  Most of them were English speaking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what you think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so they did not suffer the disability of having to learn another language.  There was also the great revolution in regard to travel: what used to be an ordeal between Ballyhaunis and Birmingham became a journey of between 10 and 12 hours. I have seen them.  I have gone into public houses they frequent.  A year ago last September I was invited by a young man of 22 years of age to go to an Irish pub in Arlington Road.  I knew the pub and I knew Camden Town before this young fellow was born.  I saw there 60 or 70 fellows, quite happy I can tell you.  They did not weep as Deputy Dillon wept for the emigrants; they had plenty of money and when they got nice and merry they sang all the nostalgic songs and come-all-ye's.The funny thing was that among their number were quite a few West Indians from St. Lucia and Trinidad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put the problems of the west of Ireland before the Minister and tell him a few home truths.  In this Estimate there should be some consideration for the problems of the small farmers of the west. I emphasise small farmers because that is what we have in that area. These farmers have been the backbone of agriculture in this country. I am sorry Deputy Moher is leaving because I intended to let him have a few home truths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be smoking all right when I have finished with him.  I am mainly concerned with the Department's lack of policy in regard to the problems of the west, <Col N="1855" /> with the Department's failure to remedy the appalling conditions there. The plight of western farmers can be measured by the continued mass emigration from the area, by the flocking into the towns of young men who see no future on the land.  Hundreds of young men still go to Britain to spend five or six months there each year.  The last speaker said there was not any such thing as migration. Does he know anything about the beet season and the hundreds who leave the west every year for England? That migration plus emigration makes inroads on the west.  The fact is that the young men who are prepared to stay on the land cannot even get a wife.  What future is there for young women?  Will they settle down to a life of drudgery?  It is not that they are afraid of drudgery if they thought there was something at the far end of the road but they realise the position is otherwise.  There are fewer on the land today than ever and that is not just my opinion.  That is shown in the statistics issued by a Government Department.  The people are not getting an opportunity to express their views on the present situation and the sooner they wake up to that fact the better.</P>
      <P>Apart from the human population, would the Minister explain why the pig population which in itself was a great arm of the economy in the west, has collapsed by 50 per cent in the past 30 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might be able to tell me how that happened only in the west.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right going down to cumann meetings.  The cumann meetings are a fixed group.  I will invite the Minister down to hear men of diverse views and to have his eyes opened to a few facts.  Will the Minister explain who has got the lion's share of the pig and who has been getting it over the past 30 years?  Is it the man who rears the pig for three and a half months of the year or is it the bacon factory that brings the pig in one door and out the other, all done within three weeks?  Who has the greatest profit?  We have seen the racket in the west and the farmers are at the mercy of these bacon factories. One day it was a fat pig they wanted. When they had a fat pig the farmers were told it was a lean pig that was wanted.  Between the ups and the downs, it was the small farmer who was down all the time.  Pigs had to be sold at a loss to the producer but, of course, there was no loss to the bacon factory. There are more pig rings than the one in the pig's nose.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been smiling at this for quite a long time.  It would be very interesting to have a breakdown of the figures for the bacon at the market and when it reaches the housewife.We would see then who are making the pig profits.  It would be very interesting to see the bankbooks of the bacon factory directors.  I would say they would be all Grade A.  These are the things that have crippled pig raising in the west and the Minister will smile at them.</P>

      <P>It reminds me of a boy whistling passing the graveyard to keep his heart up.  Would the Minister smile coming along the Cois Fhairrge road in Connemara at seeing the number of glasshouses that have been <Col N="1857" /> abandoned?  Would the Minister tell us what happened about the tulipgrowing scheme for the Aran Islands? Will he smile at that?  Will the Minister tell us what happened the onion scheme on the Aran Islands? The Minister can sit there and smile at the unfortunate people in the west. Like the Fianna Fáil policy, in regard to the west, the Minister is a flop.</P>
      <P>There were many harebrained schemes introduced just to fool the people.  Many people fell for them and the unfortunate thing is that the people who fell for them emigrated.  Then another group grew up and they, too, will be fooled and emigrate in despair. The Minister is one of the big ranchers who can sit back and smile.  A few years ago it was the wheat rancher who was being pushed on.  Today it is the bullock.  The people have a very short memory.  Not so many years ago the Minister and his Party were going around the country pawing the ground to do away with the calves.</P>

      <P>The ranchers in the midlands will come out well in this. They will make a packet while the small men in the west can sit sucking their thumbs.  I would like the Minister to tell us how many can increase their herds in the west.  I would like to know what he is doing to try to make these people qualify for these subsidies, because the land is impoverished.  It cannot carry extra cattle; it can barely carry what it has now.  It is impoverished through a lack of drainage, lime and manures.  Let us face facts. The west will remain poor because the small farmer has not got the capital to improve his land and it is only by improving the land that he can increase the number of his stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil did away with the Dillon scheme which was the only hope for the people of the west.  The land of the west could qualify to a degree if the Minister had a realistic approach to the problems of the west and if he were man enough to bring back the Dillon scheme which achieved so much in the past.  One thing for which I shall congratulate the Minister &mdash; he was congratulated for this at a Fine Gael meeting in <Col N="1859" /> Galway city recently&mdash;is for adopting again a Dillon scheme which he had knocked on the head some time ago and that is in regard to increasing the number of agricultural advisers. I wonder who has been advising the Minister.  I think from going around the countryside he has seen the need himself.  As I say, the land in the west cannot bear any more heifers.  Why not at least give a start by providing a calf subsidy in the west?  Would that be too difficult a pill for the Government to swallow?  It would help to undo the damage they did over the years when they slaughtered the calves.  You will never live that down.</P>

    <P>Let us turn now to the wheat ranchers and to the wheat policy.  In our town during the last year we have seen two flour mills closed down.  They said it <Col N="1860" /> was due to centralisation.  Is it not a fact that because of emigration less bread is consumed in the west now and that that is why the flour mills were closed down?  Is the Minister worried about the men who were thrown out of employment?  Some of them received compensation but I know of one man who worked there for 15 years and never got a penny.  Of course, the Minister did not lose a night's sleep over him.

      <P>I know we are hitting the Minister hard.  The Fianna Fáil policy shows that there is no hope for the future of the small farmer in the west.  The solution is to give the people the opportunity of voting in the coming election.  I have not got much to do with the banks and neither have the small farmers of the west but I happened to be reading <i>The Banking Review</i> for September, 1963, and on page 19 it quotes the words of Mr. Whitaker.  It says that in general it would seem that attention should be concentrated primarily on raising the efficiency and volume of production in <Col N="1861" /> agriculture and industries based on agriculture.  It says that the net output of the agricultural sector for the last year was a little higher than in 1957.  Where are the dynamic strides about which we hear so much?  It also says that the output was less than 15 per cent above the abnormally low level to which it fell in 1958.  That was two years after we left office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate it would appear that the really important thing is to score off your political opponent or off somebody not in the House.  I intend to confine my remarks to the points which have not already been covered and to be as impersonal as possible.  It seems clear from what has been happening here for some time that, although the Government are prepared to say that agriculture is the primary industry, they are, at the same time, prepared to make a Cinderella of agriculture. This was proved very clearly by the recent decision of the Taoiseach not to include agriculture in the National Industrial Economic Council.  The Taoiseach said he might include them afterwards or that he would consider discussing with agricultural representatives in what way it could be brought in.</P>
      <P>Although we are supposed to be planning to increase our gross national product, we are prepared to leave agriculture completely out of it.  Anything that has been brought about in this country so far has been brought about by planning.  We have the evidence of the Sugar Company, which is doing excellent work.  We have the Pigs and Bacon Commission, Bord Bainne and all the other State-sponsored bodies attempting to improve the situation.  But agriculture in general is apparently nobody's baby. The result is we have situations arising here which would not be allowed arise in any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are interested in helping agriculture we have to realise that we must depend on industries based on agriculture, because the raw material produced on Irish farms and processed locally is the best bet for bringing employment and prosperity to the country.  But the Government must help in marketing.  When we come to that problem we find something happening which suggests they do not know what they are doing.  In the Minister's own constituency some time ago a firm started the production of powdered milk from skim milk.  They employ a substantial number of people <Col N="1863" /> and pay reasonably good wages.  They have a big market for their product in the Middle and Far East.  Having reorganised their factory and installed extra plant, they are now at the stage where they can take 250,000 gallons of skim milk per week and have a market for the finished product.  But they are now able to get only 80,000 gallons.  They approached the Minister to see if he could help them out in this matter by contacting creameries.  They were told that the creameries and, through them, the suppliers would be contacted.  When they asked when this would be done, they were told it would be some time next spring.  Now staff are being laid off, and the Department are not prepared to do anything about it.  The Minister might say: &ldquo;This is a matter of a private concern.  Where do we come in?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want a question and answer debate.  Next door to that factory another factory is being erected to do exactly the same type of work&mdash; to process skim milk.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but he was saying something which was not even fair to himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying something which may not appear to be fair to the Minister.  If it is true, the Minister has certainly made a big blunder.  Will the Minister say when replying <Col N="1864" /> whether or not those people who have a State grant for erecting this new factory will be drawing out of the same pool of milk which has proved to be entirely inadequate for the existing factory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Whole milk and skim milk are two different propositions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into a discussion with the Minister at this stage.  I am sure he realises that, if skim milk is not available when this new factory is completed, it amounts to the same thing.  If the whole milk, including the skim, is to be absorbed by the new factory, the problem is as I have described it here.  The existing factory will be left further short of supplies and may possibly have to close down altogether.  If the Department were interested in doing something for the dairy farmers, surely it would have been an excellent idea to have a factory such as the one being erected in Killeshandra erected somewhere in Meath or in the Golden Vale, where there is more milk than the creameries can handle, rather than to bring together a private enterprise and a private-cum-State enterprise and have them both drawing out of the same pool of milk?  If the Minister could channel about 100,000 gallons extra of skim milk or inform the existing factory where they can get it, it would mean good employment for constituents of the Minister.  If that cannot be done, they will be out of their jobs.</P>
      <P>This is a serious matter.  Possibly the Minister's information about it may not be up-to-date.  If so, he should check on it and he will find the situation is as I have described.  If the factory were sited anywhere else, it would be a great idea.  This is the sort of factory we need, one using the products of the land.  It is a great idea to start them but certainly not so that they can carry out cut-throat competition with existing industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A big effort is being made at present to have some sort of fruit and vegetable co-op.  In 1954 I suggested to the then Minister that something should be done about this.  That is on record.  He did nothing about it.  I appeal to the Minister <Col N="1865" /> now to do all he can and not just leave it to private interests, to somebody who thinks he can get a few people to put up the money.  Let the State go into this and let the lead given by Major General Costello be followed up.  I disagree with many things he does but in this instance I think he is right.  The State should try to set up co-operatives to deal with fruit and vegetable processing because this will give employment on the land and markets should be easy to find when the goods are processed.</P>
    <P>The numbers leaving the land are alarming, so much so that the Statistics Office in their most recent report say they cannot understand them.  They say: &ldquo;It does not look right but those are the figures.&rdquo; Surely the Minister must admit something should be done to prevent that trend continuing?  Not only farm workers are leaving but members of farmers' families.  I do not think Deputy Moher really meant what he said.  I have great respect for him but I do not think that even in his own Party what he said would be considered as anything but completely out the window&mdash;that if people who cannot find employment here leave the country and go to another land to earn plenty of money and mix with every race in the world, have a singsong about Ireland, this will be a great country.  I do not think that is what he meant.  We all know that people can go abroad and earn £5 a day on certain jobs but, unfortunately, they are working themselves to death trying to keep somebody at home in Ireland.  Apparently, Deputy Moher is perfectly satisfied with that situation.  He suggests we should be quite satisfied provided they got employment somewhere; that it was no worry of Dáil Éireann and we should be happy if they are happy.  I do not think that is the future we would like to hold out to our men and women.  I should not like to see that happen in my constituency.  While our people are free to roam if they wish, it is the duty of everybody here to try to provide employment for them at home.</P>
    <P>That brings me to wages.  The Minister and I have crossed swords on this on a number of occasions.  It <Col N="1866" /> has now reached the stage where I think the Minister himself&mdash;normally I find him a reasonable man&mdash;must do something positive about it.  We had a full scale debate some months back on the Agricultural Wages Board.  I do not intend to go into details like that now but I should like to point out that the Central Wages Board consists of a chairman and three other people who are supposed to be neutral, four farmers' representatives, and four workers' representatives all of whom are nominated by the Government.  We may be pardoned if we say it is a Government-controlled organisation.  As far as I know, with the exception of the workers' representatives, everybody else is a very strong supporter of the Minister's Party. Two of the neutrals are Fianna Fáil members of local authorities.  I would not hold that against them if it were the only thing wrong but one of them is a big employer of labour.  I cannot see how a big employer can be neutral where wages are concerned.</P>
    <P>There are five regional boards and recommendations are made by them which may or may not be considered by the central board.  Over the past 12 months efforts were made by the workers' representatives to have some arrangement made to increase wages to meet increased costs.  Remember the highest minimum rate is £6 15s. per week in No. 1 area.  In No. 2 area it is £6 7s. and in No. 3, £6 less stamps.  Last year when stamps went up 9d. the farm worker had 9d. less and if they go up by another 9d. on the 4th January he will be minus 1/6d.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made early in the year by workers' representatives to have a meeting called for the purpose of increasing wages.  This was vetoed by the Board.  Again and again attempts were made to get an increase and eventually the Board agreed that in regard to a number of areas in the south of Ireland&mdash;Wexford in particular and East Cork and two or three others that were in a pretty good agricultural district&mdash;it was unfair to bracket them with Donegal, Mayo and Leitrim and that they should be upgraded at the next meeting where wages were increased.  That would <Col N="1867" /> give them automatically 7/- more a week.  Eventually the Board met to decide on an increase in wages.  They had before them recommendations for an increase from Athlone district that workers were entitled to an extra £1; from Dublin that all workers were entitled to an increase of £1; from Limerick and Cork, an increase of 13/- and for Waterford district, an increase of 15/-.</P>
    <P>The Central Board decided, having considered these regional recommendations, that they would upgrade the area in the south that I mentioned and give them an extra 3/- making an increase of 10/- per week.  They came to Meath, Westmeath and Wicklow and said they would give them 3/- and give the rest of the country nothing, that they were entitled to no increase as there was no justification for it.  One of the Minister's neutrals said on that occasion that the Board must take the Taoiseach's White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> into consideration, that it would not be right to give increases to farm workers.  I do not know who he thought he was talking to or about.</P>
    <P>Naturally, there was great dissatisfaction over this and the workers' representatives insisted on a further meeting of the Board.  At that meeting a motion to rescind the original decision was carried and a motion proposed by a neutral, seconded by the farmers, provided that an increase of 5/- per week be granted with effect from 28th December to compensate farm workers for the loss they must suffer as a result of the turnover tax, increased cost of stamps and general increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that is the proper way to pay farm workers, to keep people on the land and encourage them to stay there?  An extraordinary thing about the discussion is that while the Board is supposed to be a private one they make a statement to the Press afterwards.  I am stating deliberately here what actually happened to show the high feeling of the workers' representatives about what took place. When a suggestion was made that the increase should be greater than 5/-, and <Col N="1868" /> Kildare happened to be mentioned, a representative nominated by the Minister, a farmer, said that we wanted an increase there because we wanted to get more votes for Labour there. Obviously, he was not very well up in politics because the Labour candidate in Kildare has more votes than he can use.  He always tops the poll.  But that is the general attitude and approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take a hand in this.  If the Agricultural Wages Board, as at present constituted, are not prepared to give a fair deal to farm workers it is the Minister's job to see that they get, if necessary, a direct subsidy through the State to ensure that they get a living wage.  It is just not good enough that people should be asked to live, or that they should attempt to live, on the miserable pittance they are getting at the present time.  We have heard all the stories about the terrible pitch to which agriculture has gone.  I am prepared to admit immediately that, as far as the small farmer is concerned, he is not doing well.  He is getting it hard.  The farmers who are alleged to live on £4 per week out of the farm are, in fact, working outside and have an income from the job or they are signing on at the labour exchange when they are out of work.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to suggest that there are groups of farmers living on £4 a week from the land and that they are not making any attempt to better their conditions.  I have no grievance where these people are concerned.  If the income they get from the holding is not sufficient, then they are quite right to look for a job elsewhere to subsidise that income.  It is rather ironic, however, that if land is being divided in the area the Land Commission refuse to regard these as uneconomic holders. The small farmer with 50 or 100 acres does not employ any great volume of labour.</P>
    <P>Now, when the Wages Board set about fixing rates, to what do they refer?  They refer to the rate which the poorest farmer in the country can pay to the worst man he employs.  That is a very stupid approach.  I suggest the Minister should have a few <Col N="1869" /> economists on the Board instead of these people who pose as neutral but who could not be neutral if they tried. With a few economists on the Board there would very soon be a different approach to farm workers' wages.</P>
    <P>The big farmer who employs labour is doing quite well.  We have been able to make a rough check from the statistics made available in the Government's own publications.  The pattern proves that, without any doubt at all, the big farmer is well fitted to pay more wages and is, in fact, in a position to pay a decent rate to the people who are creating his wealth.  Someone referred to the fact that the general output on farms is still at the 1957 level.  When we talk about output on farms most people refer to it as if it were output per man and not output per acre.  If you talk about output per man, the farmer who lays off two men and buys an extra machine, or two, will immediately have an increased output. but output per acre has not gone up at all.  The Minister must be as well aware of this as I am.  We checked then on how much the farmer got as compared with the farm worker.  The result so shocked me when I read it first that I actually checked further.  I found the average paid to the farm worker was less than the minimum rate of wages.  This was explained by the fact that so many farmers now employ boys from 16 years onwards and pay them a lower rate.  That brings down the average paid to the farm worker by quite a considerable amount.</P>
    <P>We found the family income per head per year in Dublin was £844 and that of the farm employee £225. Can anybody say the average farmer is not doing quite well if he and his son, or two sons, working on the farm have each an average of £844 per year while the farm worker employed has only £225?  The Minister is familiar with Cavan.  There the farmer and his family have an average of £240, very much less than the Dublin farmer.  The reason the Dublin average is so high is, I think, that there is a great deal of market gardening.  The Minister may <Col N="1870" /> find a moral in that.  If fruit and vegetables were developed much more that would result in higher incomes for the farmers themselves.  The average for Cavan is £240 per year for the farmer and £194 for the farm employee.  In Meath it is £605 for the farmer and each member of the family, and £227 for the farm employee.</P>
    <P>Now, taking these figures at their face value&mdash;they come from figures supplied by the Department, <i>Irish County Incomes</i> 1960&mdash;you find there is a very good case to support the contention that farm workers should be getting a great deal more than they are getting now.  I would ask the Minister to have this whole question of farm wages investigated to satisfy himself, once and for all, that there is no use leaving the present system of wage fixing because it is absolutely obsolete and out of date.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a reasonable man.  I will supply him with any information I have.  I think he will agree there is reason why he should intervene.  He has informed me through his Secretary, when I asked him to take an interest in this matter, that there was no reason why he should intervene; it was a matter for the Wages Board.  I think he will agree now that, if industrial workers are looking for an increase of £2 per week on an average wage of £11 15s., it is absolutely stupid to suggest that farm workers are entitled to only 5/- on £6 to £6 15s.  That goes without saying.  I shall not labour the matter further.</P>
    <P>With regard to the heifer subsidy, I wonder if the Minister has finally made up his mind yet.  While it was hinted at and then rushed out in a hurry&mdash;I think because there was danger of a general election&mdash;the details do not seem to have been worked out.  Will the Minister ensure, if the subsidy is proceeded with, that we do not have a repetition of what happened some years ago where wheat growing was concerned?  Reference was made by a previous speaker to the rich lands and what is likely to happen in the rich lands.  I assume the speaker meant the midlands.  Meath happens to be part of the midlands; the land is <Col N="1871" /> rich all right, but the people are not. The trouble with the wheat subsidy was the appearance on the scene of wheat ranchers, who came along and paid fabulous prices per acre; some got their fingers burned but some made a quick fortune.  I understand efforts are now being made by groups of people to do the same thing again&mdash; club together, buy a big number of heifers, keep them until they collect the subsidy and then sell them at a handsome profit.  That is something which the Minister should examine because it would be rather a pity if that sort of thing were allowed to happen.  It would completely defeat the object he is trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>Another thing, of course, is that the small farmer who is nearly fully stocked will find it not so easy to get the money or the space for the extra heifer and, therefore, will find it difficult to avail of the subsidy scheme. The Minister and his advisers, I am sure, have considered this aspect.  If not, perhaps they will.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion made to me that it would be better if the Minister would introduce a subsidy on home-grown animal feed and encourage the small farmer to winterfeed fat cattle.  The Minister might possibly consider that suggestion.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of farm income.  The Minister talked about the increasing prosperity of farming.  He said there was an extra £4 million last year, that farmers got an increase of £12½ million since 1957. In fact, since Fianna Fáil returned to Office farm labourers got one-twenty-fifth of the increase which was given to the farmers, by the Wages Board, so that the farm workers are now in a much worse position <i>vis-á-vis</i> their employers than they were in that year.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of the farm building inspectors.I would not agree with what has been said.  I think they are doing an excellent job.  It is all very well to say that farmyards should be modernised, that the farmer should be able to create a properly planned farmyard. <Col N="1872" /> The existing farmyard may have been in use for a very long time.  If the farmer wants to build an extra cowbyre or other building on it, he and the man who is advising him are the best judges rather than a person viewing it from afar who says that if he had £10,000 or £12,000 he could make a grand job.  A very good job is being done.  The inspectors are doing excellent work.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into detail but I should like to make one point in reference to the question of bacon.  I have had complaints from all over the place which I have heard repeated here several times, that while all sorts of graded bacon go into the bacon factories all the bacon coming out appears to be Grade A and shopkeepers charge for Grade A bacon, no matter what type you get.  I have also heard the complaint that in country shops at present it is absolutely impossible to get top-class bacon.  It appears as if the real Grade A bacon is for export only.  It would be too bad if that were so.  I would ask the Minister to comment on the matter when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>In the fruit growing areas a problem has arisen.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of the system or not. When a number of people in an area grow fruit, one of them usually has an old lorry.  The fruit is put into the lorry and taken to the market.  Last year CIE and the Garda became very active and clamped down on this practice.A number of people were prosecuted and fined for marketing their neighbours' fruit.  It is all very well to say that that is the law and the law must be obeyed but it resulted in a number of undesirable things happening.One was that the fruit going into the market often went in very much later than it should and the growers, therefore, did not get the price that they should get.  Another result was that it became quite common practice for these people after their work &mdash;they are not all fulltime market gardeners&mdash;to pack the fruit in baskets and leave it to be collected at perhaps two or three in the morning by the neighbouring lorry owner who would take the fruit to the market in time. <Col N="1873" /> CIE, naturally, are not prepared to do that kind of thing, with the result that some people have complained to me that they have suffered considerable loss.  I approached CIE about the matter.  While they did co-operate to the fullest extent possible for them, no solution emerged.  I suggest to the Minister that where there is co-operative effort such as I have described, without all of them having to buy a lorry, there could be some arrangement made whereby a man could carry fruit to the market and thereby get the best price for the fruit grown in the area.  The arrangement would apply to a very limited period and there should not be any reason why it cannot be made.</P>
    <P>There is a matter about which I spoke to the Minister and to which there was a sequel.  The Minister gave the matter his immediate attention and dealt with it.  I refer to the question of employment on State farms.  There was a strike on a State farm over wages and hours.  The strike lasted six weeks.  I pose this question to the Minister: Is it not an extraordinary thing that when the teachers, who are entitled to good wages but who are getting very much more wages than farm workers, were made an offer and they threatened strike action the State immediately jumped to it and said conditions must be adjusted and another offer was made which is at present being considered but when the farm workers employed by the State looked for an increase in wages they were told they would not get it and they went on strike for six weeks.  The reply from the Department was: &ldquo;No surrender.  You must go back on the same terms.  If you do not, we will close down the whole job.&rdquo;  That appears to me like discrimination against what the Minister might consider to be a less protected section of the community.  Possibly, he may consider that it would not be so important if farm workers had to emigrate because there were no jobs available for them.  It would be very unfair if farm workers were to continue to be treated, as they consider they are being treated, not as second-class but as fifth-or sixth-class citizens.  They get the <Col N="1874" /> worst of everything that is going.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to look at this whole question.  The Minister should set the example on State farms.  It is no answer for the Minister to say that the neighbouring farmers are a mean lot and are paying a low wage and that he cannot do very much more than he is doing.  If they are a mean lot, then the Minister should be able to set a decent standard of wages.  This is a matter of extreme urgency and if we are not to have another reduction of 8,000 to 10,000 in the number of farm workers and farmers' families on the land in 1964, the Minister must give this matter his immediate attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to keep the House very long.  I had no intention of speaking at all until I had to listen to some Deputies here this morning who never did an hour's work on a farm advocating how farms should be run and accusing some of us of being wealthy ranchers.  I represent the farmers of North Tipperary. Very few of us are wealthy ranchers. In fact, there are very few wealthy ranchers in North Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan of Galway says that there is no hope at all for the small farmers of the west.  I think there is a hope and I shall make a suggestion for what it is worth.  In my part of the country the Sugar Company started a central pig-fattening station.  Farmers buy the sows from the station and the station buy back the progeny and fatten it.  The whole litter is taken to the station and weighed.  We get a price based on weight.  It is a very good idea.  If such a scheme were in operation in the west the position of the farmers there would be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the farmer may not have the buildings necessary to carry out such a scheme.  I suggest that houses could be built by the Department through a subsidy and the farmer could keep sows.  Alternatively, the central fattening station could build the piggery for the farmer.  The farmer would take his litter to the station which would charge. say. £3 a litter until such time as the farmer would have the farm buildings paid for.  A <Col N="1875" /> litter of ten bonhams at 6/- per head for some period until the loan was paid back would provide a good living for the small farmer.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputies say that the big rancher will get all the benefit from the heifer scheme but people must realise that to qualify for the grant under that scheme a farmer must have a herd and must have passed the test. The big ranchers never went in for milking cows or for carrying a herd of cows because there is a lot of trouble with them.  We can also be sure that when the Minister's scheme comes into operation he will bear these things in mind.  The aim of the scheme is to increase the cattle population of the country and to do that we must increase the number of heifers on every farm.</P>
    <P>It is bad policy for people to be coming in here and trying to score off one another.  There is no sense in going back to things that happened in the past.  Reference was made here to the economic war but during the economic war I was at the fair of Thurles with cattle on that very day the Government resigned.  I heard the farmers all around me saying that they would go out and vote the Government back stronger than ever.  There were lives lost in this country from both Parties in order to put the country where it is and at that time no count was taken of the cost.  Why should we go back now to things of the past?</P>
    <P>The previous speaker spoke about farm workers and their demand for more money.  I have every sympathy with them.  I work with them myself because when I go home from this House I do not sit in my armchair. I go out and work with my men and I know that they are doing a good job.  We cannot meet increased wages for our farm workers by increasing the prices of our produce and I would suggest that they should be subsidised to some extent to bring up their wages. Such subsidisation would not interfere with the cost of living but would help to keep the people on the land.</P>
    <P>Some farmers say that they cannot <Col N="1876" /> get labour and my experience in my own constituency, where we have Bord na Móna and the Thurles beet factory, is that there is nobody unemployed in the area for the past couple of years.  How can you blame the farm worker if he goes to work in the beet factory or with Bord na Móna where he can get £9, £10 or even more every week?  The farmer cannot come up to that.  Some farmers only expect their workers to come in casually and some cannot afford to give them a decent week's wages at that but what is the use of a farmer employing his workers for a week or a fortnight and then throwing them on the heap?  The farm workers are entitled to whatever can be got and should get it.</P>
    <P>People accuse the Fianna Fáil Government of letting down the wheat growers.  I have grown wheat since the beginning but for the first time I did not grow any wheat this year because of the awful position we found ourselves in last year.  I had my wheat in the shed for a month but when I came to sell it to the merchants I found that I had to slice down 50 or 60 barrels. What happened was that anybody who got out early last year got their grain into the millers regardless of what condition it was in.  Then they found out that they had a surplus of wheat and they had to take it out on somebody and the people they took it out on were the good farmers who kept their wheat and had it in good condition.That is true of many good farmers in my own area.</P>
    <P>I stand with the small working farmer.Despite what has been said by Deputy Coogan I am not a rancher myself but it is bad when one hears that kind of talk in this House.  We hear that bacon is scarce and that it cannot be got, but farmers are now getting a better price for their pigs than they have got for years.  Down through the years farmers have been urged to produce certain commodities and when they went into that production they found that they were not able to sell their yield.  Now we have a promise that no matter what the farmer produces he will have a market for it. The farmer can now plan for years <Col N="1877" /> ahead and the solution of fixed prices is the only one for the problem of production.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Beet Growers' Association and we have always advocated that farmers should get the best possible price for their beet.  The price of beet is fixed between the council of the Association and the Sugar Company and they get on very well together.  I have heard people saying they will not grow any more beet because of the trouble involved, but farmers should remember that if they do not weed their beet three or four times during the season their crop is going to be a bad one.  Our economy depends to a large extent on the growing of beet.  If we did not grow beet where would we get sugar and what would we pay for it?</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Coogan inviting the Minister to go to the west to see the condition of the small farmers there but I would invite Deputy Coogan to come down to my area and see the farmers there.  We have to admit that in many cases the big farmer comes in for a large part of the grants we get but I do not know how that can be avoided.  The man with 100 acres is bound to get more fertiliser than the man with the 15 or 20 acres and they also got the big end of the improvement in rates.  That has to be so and I know that the people opposite only use the small farmers to catch votes at election time.  Every Deputy here should be interested in the progress of our country and should help whatever Government are in office to go in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I had no intention of intervening in this debate until I heard some of the remarks made.  I am not criticising any man but some of the people who have spoken here never did an hour's work on the land.  They never grew a head of cabbage in their lives and yet they come in here and abuse other people.  Any Minister, whether it is Deputy Dillon or Deputy Smith, should have the interests of the people at heart.  It is no use going about criticising and attacking one's opponents; it is the people who will decide, and I find that the more one <Col N="1878" /> attacks one's opponents the less support one will get from the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has one of the toughest jobs in the Cabinet.  As I have been telling people at agricultural gatherings, we have subsidies amounting to £39 million and, mind you, that is a fair penny. I could advocate cutting a considerable amount of that money to give us a lighter Estimate, but what would happen to the agricultural services? It is like the turnover tax.  There has been a lot of comment on the turnover tax and I agree that certain items have increased out of proportion because the manufacturers raised the prices before the tax was introduced.  However, I have yet to meet a man who objects to paying 6d. in the £ on purchases.In my town, Thurles, there is a shop where if I buy £1 worth I pay the 6d., and so on, <i>pro rata</i>.  In conclusion, I express the hope that the Minister will operate this heifer scheme fairly and not let the big man come in to score to the detriment of the smaller man, as has happened in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMSheridan" hpid="Mr. Sheridan Mr. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Fanning, I come from a rural area and being a practical farmer, having associations with farmers as all belonging to me have had, I feel entitled to make a few observations on this important Estimate.  It may seem funny coming from me, but the first point I wish to emphasise is the question of education for farmers.  It is what a lot of our farmers lack at the moment, and I hope the farming youth of today will avail of it, unlike their predecessors.</P>
      <P>Up to quite recently, in the farmers' homes the genius was sent away to the Civil Service or to some profession or was at least started off in college. The dud was kept on the farm. That was a very poor performance. Ever since I entered public life I have seen farmers who would have preferred to have been introduced to a mad dog than to an agricultural instructor. Thank God that day has gone.  Almost all the farmers in my constituency now avail of the services of the agricultural instructors who are doing a good day's work by bringing advisory services into the farmers' yards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> I can quote a few cases which occurred since I came to the Dáil where farmers were short of credit and had not a hope in the world of getting any.  They asked me for my advice as to where they should start.  I told them I was not a financial expert, that I was incapable of giving them the advice they required, but I did them a good turn by advising them to consult the county agricultural officer.  He helped them to draw up schemes, make approaches to the bank or to the Industrial Credit Company and I am glad to say that in most cases, where the farmers concerned proved they had the ability to repay, they met with complete success.</P>
    <P>That is an example of the manner in which we are moving with the times in the agricultural community.  Not so very long ago a small farmer had not an earthly hope of getting credit from the banks or from the Industrial Credit Corporation or any other corporation.  The only way he could get anything from a bank was to go in with a mask on his face and a gun in his hand.  There has been a big change for small farmers in that respect.  It must bring a feeling of great relief to farmers these days to know they have security in their own country.</P>
    <P>For one reason or another, land prices have risen by leaps and bounds recently.  Some may say the cause is to be found in foreign investment, but as I see it the farmer and the farmer's son are not finished buying land.  In North Longford, which I represent, small pieces of land, which could not be described as top quality, are making on the verge of £100 per acre.  That in itself must give the farming community a sense of security that farmers did not have heretofore.</P>
    <P>I should like now to make reference to what has been our greatest export for years and still is&mdash;our cattle trade. I should like the Minister to refer, when he is replying, to the point I am about to make in relation to our cattle trade.  It has often seemed funny to me that while we have market research and various boards&mdash;the Pigs and <Col N="1880" /> Bacon Commission, Bord na gCon and others&mdash;we have no beef marketing board.  I submit the Minister should introduce a beef marketing policy which would lay down clearly the quality of meat required for the export market.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister now to clarify the Department's policy as to the beef breeds and crosses considered to be most suitable for export purposes.Every Deputy who knows anything about cattle will agree that the day of the three year old bullock is finished&mdash;that this type of animal is not an economic proposition for the farmer or dry stock owner.  An increase in our cattle population cannot be achieved as quickly as we would wish it unless there is a firmer policy on the eradication of diseases, particularly contagious abortion.  I know that a scheme in this respect has been introduced but I would ask the Minister to hurry it up because this disease could wipe out entire dairy herds.</P>
    <P>In reference to the heifer scheme, if it never does anything else it will create a trade for young heifers which has not existed in the past 12 months. That is one great point in its favour. However, I am afraid the larger farmer will benefit most from this scheme. Small farmers, particularly, will be unable to benefit overnight from it because they certainly will not rush out bullocks in November, December, and January when there is no trade for them, and start buying heifers. Neither will the dairy farmers.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the danger I see is that the small farmer who is stocked to capacity, especially if he is a good small farmer at all times, while he may be able to reach the capital, his land is probably not able to carry any more cattle.  The larger type of farmer can switch around any time and can stock up with heifers and be provided with his £15.  The only way I can see that the small farmer could benefit would be to take into consideration the farmer under £20 valuation and give him a subsidy, something like they have in Northern Ireland, say, £5 on each calf.  That would be great encouragement to the <Col N="1881" /> small farmer and it would do away with the charge that this scheme is entirely for the rancher or for the big farmer.  This scheme, to my mind, is to increase cattle production for export.  I want to assure the Minister I am all for that as, I think, is every Deputy who is interested in the country.  There is just that snag and I would like the Minister to take the small man into consideration.</P>
    <P>As regards sheep production, there has been a large increase in the numbers but very little attention has been given to breeding policy or the production of suitable ewes to breed lambs for the export market.  That is something that should and could be considered.  We have a good export market especially in France for the past year or two and it is worth looking into because sheep can be a great asset to the farmer.</P>
    <P>In regard to pigs, greater efforts should be made to expand the pork trade.  This provides an outlet for the heavier type of pig and also for pigs that will not grade well in the factory. The trade has expanded in recent years and if it could be developed further it would be of considerable benefit to the farming community and especially to the smaller farmer.  While I am on the subject of pigs I would ask the Minister to keep an eye at all times on the matter of pig feeds to see that the price does not go too high because if it does it decreases the profit for the feeder.</P>
    <P>Milk is a very vexed question in this House and outside it but I would like the Minister to state the position for the coming year.  There is a rumour &mdash;and I would like to know if it is a fact&mdash;that there is a danger of a scarcity of milk to meet the commitments of An Bord Bainne for the export market.  The parts of the country I represent, Longford-Westmeath, but Westmeath predominantly, are dry stock areas and dry stock, it is well known has not yielded anything like the profit there is from milk. Therefore, any encouragement in regard to milk by way of price or other incentives would be welcome.  The farmer is always inclined to follow the money and I would ask the Minister <Col N="1882" /> to look into that.  I would also ask him to look into the comments I have made about the heifer scheme which I believe is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJBurke" hpid="Mr. J.J. Burke Mr. J.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take up very much of the time of the House this morning because most aspects of Fianna Fáil agricultural policy&mdash;or I think I can describe it more accurately as a lack of agricultural policy&mdash;have been dealt with by speakers from this side of the House, including the Leader of our Party, Deputy Dillon, and there is not much point in trying to rehash the whole thing over again.</P>
      <P>I cannot let this occasion pass, however, without protesting in the strongest possible manner at the Government's complete lack of any policy in regard to trying to keep the small farmer on the land.  I expected the Minister in his opening speech to deal at some length with the report on the small western farmers and, as the Minister himself comes from a fairly congested area, County Cavan, I expected he would give us some indication at least of his desire to make it possible for those small farmers to remain on their little holdings.  I could not see one hope of that from his remarks.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his desire&mdash;and I believe it is a genuine desire&mdash;to increase agricultural production, has forgotten those small farmers completely. Being a farmer myself, I would support any scheme that would tend to increase agricultural production.  However, the new heifer scheme which the Minister has introduced and the scheme for paying bigger grants towards the salaries of agricultural instructors are both designed to make the rich man richer and the poor man poorer.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Sheridan from Westmeath advocating a subsidy on calves born on farms under a certain valuation.  When I came in here first almost 10 years ago it was one of the first things I advocated.  I did not get very far with that but I still see no reason to change my mind on it.  It is the only way you will get any real increased production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituency I represent, County <Col N="1883" /> Roscommon, is not, strictly speaking, in the congested area, but I wonder does the Minister realise that 81 per cent of the farms in County Roscommon are under £20 valuation? Recently the great majority of these small farmers have gone in for milk with the result that they are feeding as many cows and heifers as their land will feed or they have no money to buy them, either one or the other.  The result of this scheme is that this 81 per cent cannot draw one shilling out of this new scheme while the 19 per cent medium and bigger farmers, even in County Roscommon, not to talk about Westmeath, get a free present from the Government of sums up to £1,000.</P>
    <P>The second scheme the Minister introduced, and which was supposed to increase production in undeveloped areas, increased the grant towards agricultural instructors' salaries.  We all realise the urgent necessity for making expert technical advice available to the farmer but I doubt very much if this recent scheme will achieve much in Roscommon.  Heretofore 50 per cent of the salaries of agricultural instructors was paid out of the rates and 50 per cent was paid by Government grant.  The Minister increased the State grant to 75 per cent, leaving 25 per cent to come out of the rates, provided a certain number of instructors are employed.</P>
    <P>This is all very fine but 81 per cent of the farmers in Roscommon are under £20 valuation and what is the use of paying instructors to visit these people and to tell them how they can increase production by 30, 40 or 50 per cent when they have not got the money to avail of that advice?  Over the years Fianna Fáil have adopted quite an amount of Fine Gael policy and I would ask the Minister now to go a step further and implement Deputy Dillon's policy of making interest-free loans available to those farmers.  The Minister says that that cannot be done but surely it is a good proposition.  What better security could you have than their little holdings?Those men will pay the money back: they will produce something that can be exported at a profit, the calf, <Col N="1884" /> the sheep or the pig.  Is it not far better to make interest-free loans available to them than to dish out enormous sums of money, free, gratis and for nothing, to any foreign chancer who wants to start a factory here and who, when no further State aid is forthcoming, closes down and walks off?</P>
    <P>The net result of the Minister's policy is that the small farmer is being forced out.  In my constituency these people are closing their doors and walking off and it is difficult to blame them.  It has become popular recently for Ministers to vie with one another in announcing increases in salaries and shorter working hours for salaries and industrial workers but those 81 per cent whose valuation is under £20 work a 12-hour day and for their own work, and in many cases for their wives' work as well, they are able to earn less than half of what a labourer gets.  These people's incomes have not gone up one shilling in the past ten years whereas everybody else has had his income doubled.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to think that they do not have to feed and clothe themselves and their families.  The Government will realise too late the minute the people close their door the only real factory there ever was has been closed down&mdash;the farm on which were produced calves, sheep, pigs and other agricultural produce.  I am surprised at Deputy Moher, whom I regard as an intelligent man, saying that these people are quite satisfied to go.  So far as my constituency is concerned that is completely untrue.  They are only too anxious to stay.  All that they want is for a Government to make it possible for them to earn a labourer's wages at home and they will be quite prepared to work a 12-hour day.  It is well within the capacity of any Government with a genuine desire to do so to provide this minimum standard of life for these people.  They are not asking very much.</P>
    <P>When I say this I will be asked how it is to be done.  The tragic thing is that the answer is so simple and so obvious but yet the Government will do nothing about it.  The first thing to do is to implement Deputy Dillon's <Col N="1885" /> policy of making interest-free loans available.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act should be reintroduced and also Section B of the Land Reclamation Scheme.</P>
    <P>It does not matter what the Minister or Fianna Fáil say about these schemes; they have been tried and found successful in the west.  The western farmer knows that and is asking for their reimplementation.In addition, I can see no reason why the Government would not remove the levy of 1?d. on the milk.  It is only a small thing but it would satisfy the farmers.  As I said before, it is essential to pay a subsidy on calves born on land under a certain valuation.  That would result in some real production.  At present, the genuine, honest small farmer supplying a creamery has all the cows and heifers he could feed but if he had interest free loans he could manure his land and be able to keep and feed a few extra heifers.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen with this scheme, in the way it is drafted, as far as the big farmer with 50 or 100 bullocks is concerned?  I do not agree with Deputy Sheridan that a farmer could not unload bullocks in November.What is to stop him?  The price of heifers has not gone up.  You can buy a Whitehead or an Aberdeen Angus heifer cheaper at the moment than two months ago.  I had nine or ten heifers which I sold before this scheme was announced and I thought I had lost money but I found that you can buy them just as cheaply now. What is the big farmer going to do?  He is going to sell his 50 bullocks and replace them with 50 heifers, draw £750 free grant, let the calves suck them for a while, fatten them, sell them, go back into bullocks next year and collect a nice tidy sum from the Government while the small man draws nothing.  Instead of making the rich man richer and the poor man poorer, it is high time the Government introduced a scheme to pay a subsidy on calves born on farms under a certain valuation.  If that is done, these men, who are creamery suppliers, will manure their land and fatten a few extra shorthorns or milking breed cattle every year.  Year after year they <Col N="1886" /> will be breeding calves irrespective of the subsidy, while the other fellow will not increase production at all.</P>
    <P>We should prevent our bacon factories from robbing the small farmer. That is what is happening.  It is proved by the fact that a small farmer can get more for his pigs on the fair than he can at the factory, while the dealer who buys his pigs on the fair, and has a nice profit, can sell those pigs to the factory.  The only explanation is that the dealer is not subjected to the same rigid type of grading as the small farmer.  There is the difference only of the width of a fingernail between the different grades. Apparently, if a farmer is not well on the right side, he gets the hammer; but the factory apparently tell the dealer that they want 200 pigs on a certain date and if they are anywhere near to the grade they will do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher made a good suggestion when he said the Government should establish central pig-fattening stations run by experts.  As Deputy Moher pointed out, the profit on a pig is so low that, unless the job is done expertly, you will not get a proper price.  They think they can do what they like with the small farmer, who has only three or four pigs, but the man with 1,000 pigs to sell gets special conditions.</P>
    <P>Another way to help the small farmer would be this.  Every farm coming on the market in congested areas should be acquired by the Government and divided amongst the small farmers.  Recently at least five or six big farms came on the market in my constituency, and they have been bought by people who are not farmers at all.  They are simply buying them as an investment and holding on to them.  The Government have done nothing about it.  The sooner they stop all this claptrap about the new Land Bill the better.  They have plenty of powers under the present legislation to acquire those holdings if they are willing to do so.</P>
    <P>They should also stop their claptrap about providing piped water supplies to every house in the congested areas at a cost of £400 or £500 <Col N="1887" /> per house.  I have no objection to piped water in every farm house&mdash; I want to see it&mdash;but we should do first thing first.  You must first give those people a means of livelihood before you start providing water supplies.If you carry on as at present and spend £100 putting water into a house, you will find the house locked the following week and the people gone to England.  Unless you provide them with a basic livelihood first, there is not much use talking about water at this stage.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to know what he should do, he should have a good read of the Fine Gael agricultural policy.  I am sure we would make copies of it available to him at any time.  He will find the answer to most of the problems I have mentioned there.  In my constituency Fianna Fáil appear to be panicking badly. They have every reason to panic. They have only one seat out of four, and it looks as if they are going to lose that seat.  The Parliamentary Secretary who represents that constituency is so worried that all he can do is go around the country shouting that Fine Gael are dissatisfied with the leadership of Deputy Dillon.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do that Deputy Dillon is the unanimous choice of Fine Gael.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as my constituency is concerned, I should like to impress on the Minister for Agriculture the urgent necessity of making capital available to the small farmers.  Otherwise, they will not be able to avail of the schemes the Minister is introducing.  In my constituency at present only the big man can afford to manure his land and buy extra stock.  While I do not think the Minister will say much about <Col N="1888" /> my comments, I am sure he will give a hearing to Deputy Sheridan.  Therefore, I am glad Deputy Sheridan has suggested a subsidy scheme for calves born on farms under a certain valuation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from an area generally regarded as a dairying centre. Therefore, I will not discuss the problems of the tillage and dry-stock farming areas.  I have dealt in the past with the problem of overproduction of milk and I have made suggestions for the processing of milk into products other than butter.  But I am afraid my suggestions have fallen on barren ground.  It was a revelation to me this morning to hear that the Minister had granted two licences for the processing of milk in Cavan.  Nothing could be further from sanity than the location of milk processing factories where milk is not produced.  The sensible place to look for milk is where you have it readily available. That is the position in my county.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a situation in regard to agriculture which has arisen in the past couple of months but which has been forecast for many a long day.  Last week I put down a question to the Minister.  I asked him if he was aware of the present scarcity of bacon and the consequent steep increase in prices of these commodities to the consumer and if he would state the reason for the scarcity and the consequent price increases.</P>
      <P>In reply, the Minister said he had received some representations but he was not aware of any general scarcity of bacon and hams.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission had informed him that the position was constantly being kept under close review by them and that they were taking steps to prevent the possibility of a scarcity of gammons for the pre-Christmas trade.  When he was asked about the steep increase in prices, he said he had no information on that.  I wish to present my case as a result of the Minister's reply.  I have proof of what I said, I have a notification from the Evergreen Bacon Factory, Cork, to customers which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are grateful for your instruction to reserve 200 gammons for <Col N="1889" /> you but we regret we are completely sold out for Christmas.</P>
    <P>Here is a reply from Edmund Burke and Sons, Ltd. bacon curers, Clonmel:</P>
    <P>We thank you for your kind inquiry regarding 500 gammons for your pre-Christmas trade but regret that owing to short supplies we are already oversold.  We have pleasure in enclosing a copy of our price list and have placed your name on our mailing list.</P>
    <P>Claremorris Bacon Factory wrote:</P>
    <P>We acknowledge yours of the 16th inst. and regret we are unable to let you have any gammons as our stocks are not sufficient to supply anything like the full requirements of our regular customers.  Again thanking you for your inquiry and regretting any inconvenience caused which, we assure you, is a matter entirely beyond our control.</P>
    <P>The Cooperative Wholesale Society, Rock St., Tralee, wrote on Nov. 18:</P>
    <P>We thank you for yours of 16th inst. but regret we cannot offer you any gammons.</P>
    <P>Clonmel Bacon Factory wrote:</P>
    <P>Gammons are going to be scarce, very scarce at Christmas.  Last year we were in a position to put some aside beforehand to help us fulfil our orders.  This year, due to different trading conditions existing, we have been unable to carry out a similar programme.  Therefore, we think it only fair to advise you of the position at this early date&mdash;</P>
    <P>that was on Nov. 13&mdash;</P>
    <P>We shall be reluctantly obliged to ration quantities available and consequently we shall be glad to know your requirements of gammon before Nov. 27.  We shall reply by Nov. 30 letting you know the exact quantities we can supply you.  This position has arisen through circumstances outside our control.</P>
    <P>Messrs. O'Mara, Limerick, wrote on Nov. 12 saying:</P>
    <P>We wish to acknowledge with thanks your booking for Christmas gammons and your order for same. However, owing to limited supplies at present, we regret we are unable <Col N="1890" /> to guarantee the full amount ordered but we will confirm same, together with prices, early in December.</P>
    <P>There is the scarcity of gammons of which the Minister was not aware. There is the written word of the factories I have mentioned.  I am not here to take part in this debate with acrimony but to put my view of this side of the industry in order to help the Minister and the people trying to live out of it and for no other reason.</P>
    <P>I now want to put before the Minister the second part of my question in regard to the steep increase in prices. I have positive proof in price lists from bacon factories.  I come from the greatest bacon-curing area in the country, an area where the Danes had to come to learn something about the trade.  They went back with the knowledge they got from the people of Limerick and we can see the result in their position today.</P>
    <P>Regarding the steep increase in prices of which the Minister says he is not aware, I shall first deal with the ordinary food which the poorer classes mostly indulge in, pig meat, the ordinary pig's head or, as the more refined people in Dublin say, pig's cheek.  In Limerick up to a short time ago, pig's heads were being sold at 16/- a cwt. from the bacon factory.  An average of 10 heads go to a cwt.  These were retailed at anything from 2/- to 2/6 a head. There is a fair meal to be got from a pig's head, especially about 11 o'clock at night when it tastes sweetest.  Today, the price of the pig's head to the people is 8/- and it has jumped from 16/- to 60/- per cwt.  Yet, the Minister tells us there is no steep increase in the price of bacon.</P>
    <P>Back rashers today cost 7d. each. Cooked ham wholesaled in April last at 4/10 a lb.  During the August weekend, the peak season for cooked ham, as may easily be understood, cooked ham was sold from bacon factories in Limerick at 5/8 a lb. Today, in what might be described as a slump period, the price of a lb. of cooked ham from the factory is 7/-. Yet the Minister told me last evening that there was no steep increase in the <Col N="1891" /> price of bacon, but that is the position with regard to cooked hams.</P>
    <P>I come now to Wiltshire sides.  Wiltshires were sold in the month of August, 1963, at 330/- a cwt.  In April, 1963, the price of the leanest Wiltshire was 350/- a cwt.  The long clear for the same month, that is, the fat 12st. pig, the fellow nobody wants, was 260/- a cwt. from the factory.  In November, 1963, the leanest Wiltshire bacon sold at 350/- a cwt. and the fat fellow that was 260/- a cwt. in April is now 356/- a cwt&mdash;the fat fellow, the grade C, or whatever he is, the fellow nobody wanted.  He is now dearer than the Grade A, or the leanest Wiltshire. Yet, the Minister tells me there is no steep increase in the price of bacon.</P>
    <P>On 1st April, 1963, those are the prices that prevailed and, if the Minister is unaware of the situation, I have here evidence and figures from bacon factories to prove my statements.  Had these increases been evenly distributed, no one would have groused.  If the supplier got his share, the curer his, and the unfortunate woman who stands outside the counter to buy a half head, or a half lb. of rashers, or a quarter lb. of cooked ham, got her share, no one would quibble.  Yet, the Minister comes in here and tells us that he is unaware of the steep increase in the price of bacon.  It is time someone intervened to put the facts of the situation before him.  That is what I am doing now.</P>
    <P>I come now to another situation. We return to the TV, but without Professor Williams this time, and we find that practically every week there is an advertisement on behalf of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  The Bacon Marketing Board has gone out of existence, thanks be to God.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission come along and they tell the viewer: &ldquo;I go for bacon&rdquo; and they give recipes and expatiate on all the ways and means in which bacon can be served up on the plate&mdash;if you can get it and if you can pay for it.</P>
    <P>Now, I have no objection to advertising.That is good business.  I would prefer to see that programme handed over to English TV, or even <Col N="1892" /> places farther than the British market; let our bacon be advertised in these places and let the people there say they go for bacon.  The present farcical situation is like looking at meat in another man's window, telling the people &ldquo;I go for bacon&rdquo;, when the people who want that bacon badly can hardly go for a crubeen which is 2d. at the factory.  You would get half a hundredweight two months ago for £2.</P>
    <P>I have described the situation today. There must be some good reason for this position obtaining.  I venture to suggest that in the dash and the rush for export markets and the hurry to get into the newspapers to tell the people we are exporting here, there, and everywhere, we should exert a little caution.  Lately there were three shipments of pork to Norway, running into 15,000 carcases.  Each carcase consisted of the whole pig, with the exception of the offal.  We retained the offal. Everything else went&mdash;the kidneys, the liver, the head and the feet.  While it was en route to Norway, in another post to the same country, there was a subsidy of 70/- per cwt. being sent after it to help the people of Norway to eat it, and our 70/- with it, while here at home unfortunate people cannot buy a rasher.  Yet, the Minister tells us there is no steep increase in the price of bacon.</P>
    <P>The bacon industry seems to me to be in a very critical condition.  The fault must be laid somewhere.  We appear to have taken the shirt off our own back and we are giving it away to a neighbour while we ourselves run around half naked.  That is the picture as I see it.  The Chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission may be a very energetic man; he is completely lacking in experience.  He gave up the running of the city of Cork and its public representatives, and all the problems that appertain to local government, and he is now Chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission. Perhaps he has done some good things, but we all do a great many damn bad things, and maybe this man in his flurry and his haste has oversold to Norway. That is my contention.</P>
    <P>There is a move now to centralise the buying of pigs.  That suggestion is <Col N="1893" /> not new.  It has been made already.  It means that the farmer has to bring his pig a mile or ten miles into the central area and has to take whatever price is arranged by the ring who present themselves as buyers that morning. This will mean the complete wiping out of the ordinary dealers who go around from fair to fair and who are at the moment practically completely wiped out by the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government in the past.  Whatever few of them remain today are the only means of competition the farmer has now as against the bacon curer.</P>
    <P>It would be a sad day for the country and for the industry if the pig dealer were completely wiped out.  He deals in a competitive market.  He has, first of all, the supplier to deal with at the fair.  Then he has to fight with the curer with regard to the grading of the pig.  The pig dealers are a section of the community for whom I have great admiration because they are men who live on their ability and their brains, who pay on their judgment.  At a glance, they judge the grade of the pig in the morning and take their chance when they come to the bacon curer in the evening.  They are men for whom we should have the greatest respect and who deserve every consideration from the Department.</P>
    <P>Central buying is a problem that could lead the whole bacon industry into chaos.  It would mean that the producer would no longer be a human being; he would be a cipher.  He must bring his 20, 30 or 40 pigs to the factory and take whatever price the factory pay.  He cannot question it.  The grade is decided by the factory and must be accepted.  On many occasions I have seen producers question the price and the grade in the factories in Limerick.  They got no satisfaction.  As a result, I have seen people who rear pigs weighing pigs in their own yards before bringing them to the factory because they could not depend on the weights they got from the factory.</P>
    <P>I am not 100 per cent against the bacon curer because I know well, and have had experience of it in Limerick, that this industry has been left to jog along in a lackadaisical fashion, particularly insofar as curers are concerned. <Col N="1894" /> While they did make handsome profits for many a long day, they did not put their profits into the development of their industry.  They invested it elsewhere, mostly in their own enjoyment and high living.  The result is that they are today faced with a situation where they have to bring their factories up to standard.</P>
    <P>I can say, from my experience of bacon factories&mdash;I have been in most of them all over the country; I am not confining myself to Limerick &mdash; that the standard all over the country is very poor and the conditions under which workers are obliged to work are absolutely scandalous.  One sees unfortunate girls with old wooden boots on them and an oilcloth apron on them, standing in half an inch or an inch of water in winter and summer, with the wind blowing through the factory and no protection. They are standing at an old bench, scraping the guts of pigs and cleaning them as sausage casings.  I am not confining myself to Limerick; this is more or less general.  I cannot see what the factory inspectors are doing about this. If they had a prowl through the factory and came through the backgate instead of through the office they might have a different picture to present.  I would ask the Minister and his advisers to take particular cognisance of this.</P>
    <P>Some of these factories are going through a critical period because of the misdeeds of the people who went before them and they are now faced with a tremendous financial burden in getting their factories &mdash; I would not say up to first-class standard&mdash;but to ordinary standards by the introduction of new machinery and new methods. These people have been jogging along as if everything was going to be all right forever and a day.</P>
    <P>I would advise the Minister that where a case is made, instead of doing what the Pigs and Bacon Commissioners are suggesting, namely to buy them out and close them up&mdash;that is their policy&mdash;these factories should be allowed to remain open, particularly the smaller type of factory that caters for nearly 100 pigs a day, that gives employment to perhaps 50 or 60 <Col N="1895" /> people.  In Limerick the bacon factories have a big employment content. They kill an enormous number of pigs every week.  There are other small factories all over the country trying to survive and they should be given loans to bring their factories up to a standard to enable them to compete with the bigger people.  At present the inclination is for the creameries and the farmers to come in and some of these factories are being run on a co-operative basis, which is not a very healthy thing, particularly as working conditions and labour conditions are not understood as well in the co-operative factory as they are in the factory run by private enterprise.  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of what I have said with regard to the bacon industry.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by asking the Minister to put a fixed selling price on the parts of the pig that are saleable. I know you cannot put a general price on bacon but there are cuts of bacon that could be controlled.  The Wiltshire is cut into different parts and if the price were controlled at retail level, everything will be controlled from that back to the wholesaler, to the curer, and to the supplier.  But, as it is, nobody knows what he is paying for bacon.  The woman standing at the counter does not know what she will pay for a pound of bacon.  The only figure that is given is the figure from the factory.  I quote from a price list of 11th November, 1963.  Mild-cured Wiltshires leanest: None; Select lean: None; Middles leanest: None; Lean when ready: 408/-; Long clears: 360/-; Gammons: None.  That was last week. If you can get gammons this week they will be 448/-.  Cooked ham is 7/- a pound.  That is the situation in the bacon trade and I would ask the Minister to start immediately to control the price to the woman at the counter.</P>
    <P>If he does that he will regularise the trade and we will not have the position in which one day there is a plentiful supply and that in three weeks' time that particular commodity will be gone off the price list altogether.  That is no <Col N="1896" /> way to treat an industry.  If there is not fixity of price we will have nothing but chaos.  In the interests of the country and of the working man and the woman who has to rear a family the Minister should step in for the purpose of controlling the price of the different parts of the side of bacon. Then you will have a free market, free competition and equality of price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to contradict some of the allegations made here by my colleague, Deputy Esmonde, last week.  In column 1656, volume 205, No. 11 of the Official Report, he said:</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that it is not economic for farmers to grow feeding barley with a floor price of 37/- a barrel.  As against that, I should like the Minister to take into account the fact that the farmers are dependent entirely on the decisions of the merchants or whoever takes in the barley&mdash;the grain dealers in this country&mdash; as to moisture content and I have no redress whatever in that matter.  The majority of farmers in my constituency in the past season got something in the neighbourhood of 32/- a barrel for feeding barley.</P>
      <P>That is by no means correct with regard to the average feeding price of barley in my constituency.</P>
      <P>I should like Deputy Esmonde to know that Wexford holds the world record for barley yields of 55 barrels to the Irish acre which was grown in recent years.  I am not disputing the point that the farmers would like an increase in the price of their barley. The acreage of barley sown last year was a record of 432,700.  That figure in itself will disprove the allegations made by Deputy Esmonde.</P>
      <P>Another allegation he made is that merchants who have hired out sacks to the growers make it a condition that the growers will sell their wheat to them.  I have a docket here which disproves that contention completely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  You know it yourself.Two-thirds of the merchants of <Col N="1897" /> Wexford are members of the association which issued this docket which states in a footnote: &ldquo;The object of this docket is merely to define the terms of issue of sacks and gives no undertaking that the wheat therein will be purchased by me.&rdquo;  That disproves completely the allegation made by Deputy Esmonde.  I have been in contact with the merchants of Wexford for the last week to disprove that.  I made sure of doing that.  If that kind of thing were carried on it would leave the farmers not knowing where they were.</P>
      <P>In the past six months we have had some discomfort in my constituency regarding the supply of cream to the sole creamery there, Inch creamery.  It was decided for the betterment of the suppliers that it should stop and, while earlier on the farmers were displeased, I am glad to see that they are now quite satisfied that it was in their best interests that it should stop.  I am glad to see that they have now accepted that.</P>
      <P>They have been promised by the creamery that they will get two separating stations in the county to take in milk in the south of the county. I understand that the creamery has applied for the licences to build these two stations and I would ask the Minister to state when he intends granting them so that they can get on with the work.  The farmers are anxious that it should commence as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot in the course of the debate about the heifer scheme. That scheme will have to increase the cattle population but there is one aspect which no one seems to have dealt with and that is the provision of fodder for these animals and how we are going to increase our winter fodder and improve our grasslands.  I am glad to see that we have set up the Irish Conservation Working Body to improve our grasslands and to promote silage to a greater extent.  I understand a meeting was held in Cahir in the middle of November.  All the elements of the agricultural industry are represented on this body including co-operatives, farmers' interests and officials of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody directly concerned with <Col N="1898" /> agriculture, especially Deputies who are themselves farmers, will agree that during the past few years the amount of good hay made has been negligible, owing to weather conditions. Any hay produced could only be described as of poor quality.  If good value is to be got from hay crops, it is necessary to have the saving done in the first fortnight or three weeks of June.  If it has not been saved by the end of June, the good is gone out of it.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the Department must consider the introduction of a policy of encouragement of silage-making. What farmers need is some type of incentive in the form of grants on tonnage.I shall quote for the House some figures from Northern Ireland in this respect.  Over the past eight or nine years, farmers there have been given grants of £1 per ton on the first 100 tons and 10/- per ton on the second hundred.  That is in the first year.  In the second, grants of 15/- per ton on the first 100 tons and 10/- per ton on the next 400 tons are given.  A scheme of that sort is necessary here if we are ever to achieve our cattle population aims.</P>
    <P>In this respect we now have one incentive&mdash;the heifer scheme of £15 per head.  A policy aimed at encouraging silage-making would add further incentive.One method of doing this would be to encourage the co-operative creameries and private contractors to hire out silage-making machinery to farmers at rates that it would be possible for the farmers to pay.  Some such schemes are working successfully, I understand, in the south of Ireland.  Mitchelstown Creamery operate such a scheme and have been doing so during the past number of years.  Farmers themselves, particularly small farmers, could not possibly be expected to acquire the machinery necessary&mdash;the forage harvesters and the tractors and buck rakes.  I repeat that unless there is some such incentive for the production of more and better feeding stuff, we will never achieve our cattle population target.</P>
    <P>Another point with which I should like to deal is the operation of the Land Project.  In my constituency there <Col N="1899" /> are approximately 40,000 acres of wet land, known as the Macamores, and farmers find the £30 per acre does not nearly cover two-thirds of the actual cost of draining that land.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to endeavour, if possible, to increase the maximum figure for drainage from £30 to at least £40 or £45 per acre. The actual drainage cost at the moment is approximately £60 per acre so that the maximum grant now available is not nearly two-thirds of the cost.  I am aware that the number of applicants from that area for grants under this scheme is quite considerable but, on the other hand, the number of schemes carried out in proportion to the number of applicants is very small.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the experience is in other counties in this respect. The Board of Works are at the moment endeavouring to devise a scheme to clean the Owenavaragh river which is the main source of drainage for the area, the average valuation of which is £1 per Irish acre. This land was revalued under Griffiths Valuation some years ago when labour was approximately 5/- per week and the main crops were peas, wheat and beans which were grown in ridges, the work being carried out by hand.  That day has gone.  Before I finish, I should like to repeat my suggestion to the Minister in regard to drainage grants and to suggest again that he increases the amount per acre from £30 to £40 or £45.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The constituency I represent comprises a large number of small farms.  We have 10,900 holdings in Leitrim and of these 10,000 holdings are under £20 valuation, the remaining 900 being over £20.  In Roscommon, as my colleague Deputy Burke has pointed out, the total number of holdings is 18,900, of which 15,140 are under £20 valuation and 3,760 over £20.  That clearly indicates that the constituency is mainly made up of small farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech, I wondered if there was any advantage whatsoever to come from that <Col N="1900" /> Department this year to the small farmers.  The only change we have got in the policy of the Department from last year is the introduction of the heifer scheme, an increase in the number of advisers, which I am sure resulted from the report of the Commission on Small Farms and, thirdly, the increased grants for farm buildings.Let us examine the heifer scheme for a few minutes and consider its likely effects as far as small farmers are concerned.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, it will be of very little use to our small farmers for the reason that on a small farm of £20 valuation most of the people are at the moment carrying all the stock the farm is capable of feeding.  You might occasionally meet a farmer up and down my constituency who could carry some more stock, but he has no means at his disposal of getting capital to bring about that increase.  There is, therefore, not much point in telling him, if he buys a heifer at about £20, that when she calves he will get a subsidy of £15.  Accordingly, I cannot see this heifer scheme being of any use to small farmers.</P>
    <P>The scheme may have another effect this year: it will increase the price of the year and year-and-a-half heifer, but next year it may decrease the price of the yearling bullock or heifer for the simple reason that the people who normally buy their yearlings or suck calves will have themselves produced calves from the stock of heifers they will have bought.  I am quite sure most of the big farmers will take advantage of this scheme.  I must agree with the statement made by other speakers that it will increase the number of cattle but I doubt if it will be any real asset to the small farmer.</P>
    <P>In regard to the increase in the number of agricultural advisers in each of the counties covered by the report on small western farms, I cannot see that they will be a great advantage.  They probably will go in to the small farmer and discuss matters with him but they will find he has no capital to do the things they would require him to do.  It is very hard for the small farmer to get credit of any sort.  He may approach his local bank <Col N="1901" /> but he will not get much credit there. He may try the Credit Corporation here in Dublin but we all know how hard it is for the small farmer to get money from them.  Even if he were successful in getting any finance from the Credit Corporation, the rate of interest he would have to pay on it would be very heavy, 6½ per cent at the moment, and it would be very hard for him to pay back money at that high rate of interest.  If the Minister or the Government gave some thought to our policy on this side of the House of providing farmers with a loan as high as £1,000 free of interest, it would be one way of giving some little hope to the small farmer.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier on, I was delighted to see that the Minister is prepared to give increased grants for farm buildings.Everybody knows the price of building materials has increased tremendously over the past 12 or 18 months, particularly timber, nails and galvanised iron.  It is only natural, therefore, the Minister should give an increased grant for farm buildings and I hope the increase will be substantial.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of talk here the week before last about the ninth round of wage increases.  Seemingly, every section in the community, civil servants, local government officials and everyone else will be covered.  We have also had the experience a few weeks ago of the Government increasing their own income by the 2½ per cent on the goods being bought by the small farmer and others.  You can rest assured the business people, the manufacturer, the wholesaler and so on will look after their own interests.  They will increase their profits.  Every section of the community is increasing its profits.  If people are not in business, their wages are being increased but there is no word whatsoever about the income of the small farmer being increased.  Yet everything he has to buy has been increased substantially.</P>
    <P>It would be wise for the Government again to look into this question of the west of Ireland, if they are serious about doing anything there. The west is going rapidly and nothing is being done about it.  Up to a few years ago, the people living on small <Col N="1902" /> farms had a substantial market for eggs and got a good price for them. Poultry and pigs were the same.  There is now no market for eggs.  As regards poultry, we know that the price being paid, particularly at the Christmas period for turkeys, is so low that they are no longer being produced in any quantity.  Pig production has become a completely commercialised job and the day of the small farmer who used to feed two or three pigs has gone completely.  The bigger farmer has many advantages over him.  He has guaranteed prices for wheat, sugar beet and barley.  Unless something is done and done very soon, the small farmer will just move out.</P>
    <P>A number of statements are made here from time to time about emigration.I quoted figures for emigration here on this Estimate last year. I have no further figures to quote unless I requote the figures and that would not serve any purpose.  However, even since this time last year, people are still going from my constituency, particularly from South Leitrim and North Roscommon.  Not alone are boys and girls of 18, 19 and 20 years going but whole families are going.  There is a moral obligation on this Government or any other Government to do something for them.  Heretofore their income was supplemented in many ways.  On top of that, they used to get work from the county councils but in recent years the plan of the Department of Local Government and that of county engineers seems to squeeze out the labouring man, not, I suppose, because it is economic but because it is the modern trend to use bulldozers, automatic rollers and so on.  All these are being used at the expense of the small farmer.  I never in my lifetime saw more small farmers looking for work than I did this year and I think that is the view of every member of our council.</P>
    <P>The Leitrim Committee of Agriculture on numerous occasions asked the Department to include Hereford bulls as special term bulls but they have not met with much success.  Some of the members of that committee of which I am a member asked me to mention <Col N="1903" /> it on this Estimate.  I would be thankful if the Minister would consider giving a number of special term bulls of the Hereford type in County Leitrim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House very long, but as this is a very important Estimate, I wish to make a few observations on it.  I was amazed to read recently that the milk yield in this country is the lowest in Europe.  The Minister with the help of his Department is proposing to import Dutch and German Friesians with the object of stepping up milk production.I wonder what effect this will have on our very valuable store cattle trade which has been our saviour for many generations?  We have the Hereford and the Aberdeen Angus and they have done a great deal to help the export trade but the basis of our cattle trade springs from the foundation stock of the dual-purpose shorthorn.It would be a very serious blow to our cattle trade if that breed were to lose its identity.  In our haste to increase the production of milk, I fear we might lose that fine old stock and I would ask the Minister to make sure that we do not lose them.  I realise that he knows as much about cattle as anybody else in this House and he knows that they were the foundation stock down through the years.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the heifer subsidy scheme which has been introduced with the object of increasing our cattle population.  I know it will have that effect but like many other Deputies I feel it will not help the small man very much to increase his stock because generally the small man is well stocked with cows.  He makes his living by supplying milk to creameries and by producing calves and I do not see how he can improve his position. We have, however, other types of farmers who will avail of the scheme and whose cattle population will rise accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister said that he would like to see a better relationship between the county committees of agriculture and the advisory services.  As a member of the Meath County Committee of Agriculture, I <Col N="1904" /> can say that relations between our advisory services and the committee are excellent.  We have a very fine staff; we have a CAO, a deputy CAO, ten agricultural instructors, four horticultural instructors and three poultry instructresses.  Relations between the instructors and the farmers are very good.  I understand they visit more than 50 per cent of the farmers in Meath.  That speaks well for the members of the county committee of agriculture and the voluntary organisations such as the National Farmers' Association, Macra na Feirme and other bodies who have helped to put the instructors in touch with farmers.</P>
    <P>In regard to pig production, as the Minister is aware, we have large numbers of the wrong type of sow and that is mainly responsible for all these difficulties in regard to the grading of bacon in our factories.  No matter how the farmer feeds or looks after the sow it is very difficult to get it graded properly.  Producers should be encouraged to get rid of that type of sow and to replace her.  At the moment we have good trade for fat sows and the difference between the price for fat sows and their replacement would be small.  I would ask the Minister to impress on his Department the need for changing these sows and for getting into a better class of stock.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher mentioned that in County Cork they had a big problem in relation to deaths of premium boars in recent years.  Within the past 12 months, we have had a somewhat similar problem but not on as large a scale.  We had to replace three or four premium boars.  These were Landrace boars and I wonder if there is some weakness in the breed and if they are not able to stand up to the hardships they have to endure on the small farms.  The reason I think it is peculiar to the Landrace breed is that we never have any complaints in regard to the Large White boar.  During my time on the committee, I remember only one case.  The Department should investigate this position and see if this is peculiar to the Landrace.</P>
    <P>Last week our committee received <Col N="1905" /> an application for a grant towards the eradication of warble fly.  It came from an organisation of which some of the members are members of the NFA.  I understand it was a regional effort and while I appreciate the valuable work which voluntary organisations are doing.  I would prefer to see this job tackled on a national basis.  As we are all aware, the loss to the country from badly warbled hides is colossal.  The Minister should get the Department interested in this and, if something is to be done, to have it done on a national basis.  To tackle this job piecemeal will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I have not got much more to say except that I hope the heifer scheme will have the desired effects.  I favour the suggestion made by some Deputies that if we are to help the small farmer, then a subsidy should be given to farmers under a certain valuation in order that the rancher will not run away with the proposition as happened in wheat growing and other big operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the farmers got £4 million more in profit in the past year than in the previous year when there had also been an increase.  They say that figures can be produced to sustain any contention.I wonder if any farmer would agree with the Minister that he got his share of the £4 million which the Minister said was earned by the farmers during the past year.  I doubt it. I come from as good an agricultural county as there is in the country and farmers' prices have not increased over the past ten or 12 years.  As a matter of fact, if anything, there has been a reduction in the actual price paid for farm produce over the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take wheat, which is the principal cash crop for any farmer.  Ten years ago, the farmers were receiving up to 10/- per barrel more for wheat than at present.  Not this year, but for the past two years, it was practically impossible for any farmer to secure the top price for his wheat.  Everybody knows the hardships endured by the farmers in the harvesting and marketing of their corn.  Nobody can blame the Government <Col N="1906" /> for bad weather, but the Government must take the responsibility for the treatment meted out to the growers when the harvest comes for sale.  In both 1961 and 1962, few farmers realised the full price for wheat.  In most cases, it was 44/- or 45/- a barrel instead of 75/-.  When the millers felt they had sufficient wheat for the grist, there was a complete closedown.</P>
    <P>I remember in 1961 when farmers who had very good wheat could not get it accepted if it was produced after a certain date.  Instead of getting the full price, to which they were entitled, they got from 40/- to 45/-.  When a motion was tabled here asking the Government to take action to give the farmers fair play in the grading of wheat, what happened?  First, it was said that the introduction of the motion at that time was an Opposition gimmick and they refused completely to accept it.  The Taoiseach intervened in the debate at that time to say:</P>
    <P>During the past ten or twelve years, since the termination of war-time scarcities, the main problem in this country in relation to wheat has been we are getting too much of it, and nobody knows that better than Deputy Dillon because, when he was Minister for Agriculture, he tried to cope with that problem.</P>
    <P>During his term of office, Deputy Dillon had to cope with the problem of surpluses.  He was prepared to face that problem and not leave it to the millers to make conditions impossible for the farmer.  I remember the occasion when wheat was rejected out of hand at the Waterford flour mills. I phoned Deputy Dillon and told him the position in Waterford.  The very next morning an official of the Department was sent by the Minister to see that the farmers got reasonable treatment at the mills.  As a result of his information, the farmers did get a fair deal.  Deputy Dillon did not hand over his responsibilities to a third party.  He did not hand them over to the millers.  He dealt with the surplus by reducing the price at that time in order to bring down the production of wheat.  How did the present Government handle the problem of a surplus? <Col N="1907" /> Instead of facing up to their responsibilities, they handed them over to the millers.  The farmers became so harrassed that they did not know until they had their crop growing, and had it in and graded, what price they would get.</P>
    <P>The result of that policy is that we have had a substantial reduction in the acreage of wheat.  It is very easy for a Government to hand over their troubles to a third party in order to avoid doing the straight and honest thing in regard to surpluses.  Wheat has been reduced so far this year, and, in addition, there has been a reduction in the yield per acre.  The result is that any wheat presented to the millers this year after the first week or so has been accepted for milling.  The amount of Irish wheat in the grist at present is only 55 per cent.  It could be up to 70 or 75 per cent in the case of bakers' flour, and still produce good bread, and up to 90 per cent in the case of household flour.  How many millions have been lost to the farmers by the policy of the Government in reducing the production of wheat to the point where there is only 55 per cent of it in the grist?</P>
    <P>In his intervention in that debate, the Taoiseach mentioned that the farmers were taking an undue risk.  I know the Taoiseach is a Dublin man and has no contact with the country. If he had, he would know that every day a farmer has to take risks, whether it be in the case of livestock, crops or anything else.  Millions of pounds are going into the pockets of the foreign producers of wheat which should go into the pockets of the Irish farmer. Our balance of payments position was never as bad as it is at present with a gap of £90 million a year.  What effect will the import of millions of pounds worth of wheat have on that position in the coming year?  That is the result of the Government policy of not paying heed to the farmers, not giving them sympathy and not co-operating with them.</P>
    <P>I know that when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture he had a sympathetic Government to deal with. I appreciate the position of the present <Col N="1908" /> Minister.  It is a very tough position having to deal with a Government led by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach says: &ldquo;We will promote industry but let the farmers carry on as they have always carried on.  When we are pressed, we may give them some money for the reduction of rates or bring in a heifer scheme but we will not investigate the possibility of improving their conditions.&rdquo;Deputy Dillon appreciated the position of the farmers and was prepared in a bad harvest to stretch the regulations to the limit to facilitate the greatest number in the harvesting and marketing of wheat.</P>
    <P>Barley is in much the same position as wheat.  When in office, Deputy Dillon arranged for imports of feeding barley seed and gave a guaranteed price of 48/- a barrel.  That was a great help to the farmer for it gave him a new crop which was very light on the land and gave a good yield. When the present Government came into office they reduced the price of feeding barley to 38/- a barrel and even at that, tillage farmers due to the harrassing they got with the wheat crop said that the least they could get was that when they produced a crop of feeding barley, they would be able to sell it according to moisture content. They might lose 1/- or two between top and bottom grades but not 25/- or 35/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>Another reason is that farmers have turned in a big way from wheat growing this year to barley growing.  It is not a wonderful price: it is very small compared with what Deputy Dillon was prepared to offer.  Oats is almost a thing of the past.  Practically no protection and no encouragement is given to those who grow oats.  I have not heard of anybody growing oats in my county to any great extent.  It is hard for the ordinary layman to understand the Government's corn policy.  At present we are importing thousands of tons of maize, coarse grains and pollard, commodities which, with a little encouragement from the Government, could easily be produced here.  There is no reason why we could not produce practically 95 per cent of the grain required for animal feeding and 75 per cent for human food in this <Col N="1909" /> country.  Would that not be much better policy, if the Government provided a market for the growers in their own country for corn rather than import thousands of tons of it?</P>
    <P>There may be something in the point, as regards maize, that America has agreed to take a certain share of our sugar in return for maize contracts.That does not hold in regard to pollard or bran.  The inter-Party Government had production for home requirements as the main part of their policy and up to the time of the disposal of the barley crop in January or February, no maize imports were allowed.  The then Minister wanted to produce at home all that could possibly be produced.  Is it any wonder that we have the NFA protesting against the increase in the cost of living in the past ten or 12 years, with no compensating increase in the prices they get for their produce?  No wonder they have protested very strongly.</P>
    <P>In Kilkenny this year, the NFA said that as a protest against rising costs without compensation, they would refuse to pay an increase in the rates. They agreed to pay the same rate as in 1961 because they felt they were not in a position to meet the increased rate and they wanted to bring home to the Government their responsibility for allowing prices to rise so steeply and consequently general costs, while there was no compensating increase for the farmers.  At the October meeting of our county council, we had a report on the rates position because several farmers told the rate collector who called on them that they were prepared to pay the 1962 rate but not the extra 2/- in the £ imposed this year.  It was a protest against the inactivity of the Government in not providing increased incomes for farmers.</P>
    <P>At that meeting, Deputy Medlar, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, said in the discussion which followed the report on the rates that the farmers had got no increase over the past ten or 12 years.  I am sure every member of the council agreed with him.  The Deputy contributed to this debate and I expected that he would bring to the Minister's notice his view on Government policy regarding prices.  I heard <Col N="1910" /> some of his speech when dealing with another matter and then I read his speech in case I was doing him an injustice but there is no word in that speech about farm prices not being increased.  At the county council meeting, we were all there as county councillors, with the county secretary and the county manager and we could not affect farm prices.  We were doing our best to give good value to the ratepayers for their rates.  I felt that when Deputy Medlar joined in this debate he would bring to the Minister's notice his point of view that farmers had got no increase in prices over the past ten or 12 years.  Possibly the best of us when we sit down feel we have missed something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If that was true there, would it not be true in the Dáil?  Does the Minister suggest that if Deputy Medlar said it at the county council meeting, it was true but if he said it here, it would be untrue? I agreed with Deputy Medlar that farmers have not got increases in prices for the past ten or 12 years. The Deputy is well versed in these matters.  We know that during the beet crisis in 1956 the Government promised that if returned to office they would bring back the price to what it was earlier, which would represent a 10/- increase.</P>

      <P>With regard to the heifer subsidy scheme, it may be good as far as it goes, but the ordinary small farmer will get very little material benefit out of it.  He is already carrying all the stock he can, if he wants to live.  With a great stretch of his resources, he may be able to increase by one, but that will only be £15 a year.  I read the report of the meeting of the Kilkenny Committee of Agriculture.  The County Council of Kilkenny is fairly well balanced, but there is a Fianna Fáil majority.  There are very few Fine Gael men on any of the sub-committees.I will quote three men on the Kilkenny Committee of Agriculture, two Fianna Fáil councillors and a nominated member by Fianna Fáil.  I am sure they would not wish to harm the Government especially at this critical time in the Government's life. I am sure they would not want to embarrass the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. John Murphy said it was a good scheme but it is only going to be a benefit to the big man.  Mr. Donnelly asked can a rancher buy in a lot of heifers and have them suckled and get all this money.  Mr. Murphy replied that, of course, he can.  There is the point I am getting at.  Mr. P. Walsh thought the scheme could be abused and that it could be worked the wrong way.  The small farmer had very little <Col N="1912" /> room for more heifers and he had kept any dairy stock he could and consequently there was no room for him in the scheme at all.  Apparently it was all beef the Government wanted.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that any man welcomes the scheme, but the scheme is not the end-all.  It will not bring prosperity to the small farmers who are at their wits' end to carry on because of the high cost of living, which will become higher still now with the turnover tax and the further increase in wages.  It cannot be said that I am giving the Fine Gael view.  I am giving the view of people who are anxious to support the Government.</P>
    <P>During the past year we have had suggestions and recommendations about amalgamation.  It has been suggested that there should be one large creamery in each county.  I suppose that would be the first step and we would move from that to one large creamery in each region.  It has been said that we want to streamline the production of bacon and bacon costs. We will have one large bacon factory. I suppose that will be a factory in each region, not in each county, and the farmers will subsidise the erection of this large factory through the medium of a 5/- levy per pig.</P>
    <P>We have had the first touch of this rationalisation, as it is called, in the flour milling industry in my constituency.Two flour mills have shut down.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce agreed to the proposals of the Flour Millers Association relative to a reduction of production in the flour milling industry.  Substantial sums were to be paid for extinguishing quotas.  The workers were to be compensated.All very fine, but I wonder what will happen when we have two or three large mills serving the whole country?  What will be the result? Will we get cheaper flour?  Will we get a better quality flour?  Will we get a better service?  I doubt it.  I doubt if we will get a cheaper flour, a better flour or better service.</P>
    <P>The industry is being removed from the ordinary people.  The flour mills in the various districts serve a very useful purpose.  They are prepared to meet competition and they give a very fine <Col N="1913" /> service to the farmers.  Farmers could get seed and manures on credit until the harvest was brought in.  The closing down of the mills in Thomastown and Muinebeag has proved a very big loss to the farmers in the area.  Hitherto they had an easy delivery.  The cost of delivery was negligible.  They had credit facilities.</P>
    <P>In the same way they had facilities in the bacon industry.  They could deliver their pigs to the local factory. If the policy of the Government is implemented, all these industries will be wiped out.  There was recent amalgamation in the fertiliser industry and the depot in Kilkenny goes in that amalgamation.  A monopoly was created and that depot is now closed. We seem to have suffered very heavily at the hands of the present Government.</P>

      <P>It was indicated in my letter to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers that one of the advantages of a general agreement negotiated through the National Employer/Labour Conference would be that such an agreement would assist workers, who may not have the benefit of trade union organisation, in seeking corresponding wage improvements. Such a general agreement would undoubtedly be taken into account by the Agricultural Wages Board, by the Joint Labour Committees and by those involved in the settlement of wages of other classes of rural workers who are not covered by these bodies.  If the Deputy has in mind that the Government should take powers by legislation to secure wage increases for unorganised <Col N="1914" /> workers generally, this would raise an important question of policy on which the Government would wish to have the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and of other interested organisations before taking any decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the reference in the question to the Taoiseach's statement is to the statement in the letters which he sent to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the confident expectation that the country's present rate of economic growth will be maintained, and in conformity with the Government's policy that its benefits should be fairly distributed amongst the whole community, a further upward revision of wages and salaries might now be safely envisaged, on a scale <Col N="1916" /> which would provide compensation to all wage and salary earners for whatever rise in the general price level may follow on the introduction of the turnover tax, and also to such further extent as would represent their fair share of the estimated expansion of national resources in the coming year.</P>
    <P>In accordance with that statement, the rates of the allowances mentioned in the question were increased three weeks ago, with effect from the date of introduction of the turnover tax; and since the amount of the increases in the basic rates varied from 7 per cent to 10 per cent, it may be taken that not alone has any increase in the cost of living been fully compensated for but account has been taken of expansion of the national resources as well.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the allowances to which I have referred are the meanest, the lowest and the most niggardly in the land and that by reason of the implementation of the turnover tax, the cost of living has been increased out of all proportion for the unfortunate categories of persons to whom I have referred?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Public Assistance <Col N="1928" /> Act, 1939, provides that home assistance shall be granted to every person who is eligible for general assistance and is not granted assistance in an institution.  Accordingly, there is no statutory authority for the continuance of the payment of home assistance to a person who is admitted to an institution.</P>
      <P>If the disability allowance to which the Deputy refers is intended to denote disability benefit under the Social Welfare Acts, the position is that while such benefit is not normally paid during the period of residence in an institution, advances for comforts or other necessary expenditure by the claimant, may be paid, at his request, during that period and the balance paid when the claimant leaves the institution.</P>
      <P>If, as appears to be the case, the persons concerned receive full maintenance from the health authority, I do not see how a position such as that indicated in the latter part of the question could arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question relates to the closing of some social welfare officer stations in South Tipperary which became necessary arising out of the reorganisation of the work of the outdoor staff of my Department.  These stations were closed from the 1st October, 1963, and the closing of further stations is not contemplated.  I explained the circumstances giving rise to the closing of a number of Social Welfare officer stations in a reply on 24th October, 1963, to a question by Deputy Hogan O'Higgins, and I would refer the Deputy to that reply.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether, in view of the Taoiseach's recent statement that a further upward revision of wages and salaries could now be considered to meet the rise in the cost of living, he will now take steps to introduce legislation to give a further increase in social welfare benefits and assistance <Col N="1931" /> paid to old age pensioners, widows, orphans, the unemployed, the sick, and others, in order to meet this rise in the cost of living; and whether, in particular, he will take steps to increase the rates of home assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The increases in social assistance payments which came into operation on 1st November, 1963, and the increases in social insurance payments from January, 1964, will be more than adequate to meet not only the rise in the cost of living occurring since the preceding increases were granted but also any rise attributable to the Turnover Tax.  The rates of payment will continue to be kept under review in the light of any further increase in the cost of living and the growth in the national income.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing the rates of home assistance is one for the public assistance authorities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, in view of the fact that Part V of the Vocational Education Act applies only in Limerick, Cork and Waterford cities and of the fact that the operation of this section has induced employers in the Limerick area to employ young workers from outside the Limerick city area in preference to city workers who must attend the vocational school one day a week, he will now review the <Col N="1945" /> whole operation of this Part of the Act with a view to (a) assessing its real value to those pupils affected, (b) equalising the situation throughout the country with regard to vocational education, and (c) providing a more effective and realistic measure of vocational education for young workers in all parts of the country.</P>

In connection with this survey, the part-time compulsory courses under Part V of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, will come under review. The question of the suitability of these part-time courses will be very carefully examined when the report on the survey is available.</P>
      <P>As to (b) and (c) of the Deputy's question, the proposals for the development of post-primary education, which I announced in May last and details of which are being worked out in my Department will, I think, meet anything the Deputy has in mind in connection with these sections of his question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley) Gerald Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1948" /> Following a detailed investigation it was decided on 17 Deireadh Fómhair, 1963, that the existing electricity supply line to the soldiers' married quarters at Dún Cathal Brugha, of which there are 100 in all, should be replaced. Tenders for the supply of the necessary cable and fittings were invited on 22 Deireadh Fómhair.  These were received on 6 Samhain 1963, and, following examination thereof, contracts for the supply of the various items were placed on 19 Samhain, 1963.  Delivery of the bulk of the cable and fittings is expected in about a week from now. It is expected that the work will be completed in about four weeks from the date of delivery of the materials.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to install new electric wiring in the soldiers' married quarters in question.  As I informed the Deputy in reply to a question on the 12th of this month, the existing internal wiring in those quarters is being checked and repaired where necessary. This work and the laying of the new supply line to the soldiers' married quarters represent only a small part of the work involved in the scheme, mentioned in my reply to the Deputy's questions on 21 Feabhra, 1963, for the separate metering of all soldiers' married quarters throughout the country. The largest portion of the work involved in this scheme is the segregation of the wiring as between the individual quarters and connection with the meters which have been installed.  In Dún Cathal Brugha the work of checking and repairing the wiring is nearing conclusion but the full implementation of the scheme as a whole must await the completion of the other work involved.</P>
    <P>There has been no avoidable delay in dealing with this matter but, as mentioned in my reply to the Deputy's questions on 21 Feabhra, 1963, difficulties have been experienced in getting electricians through the employment exchange and it has been necessary to make special arrangements to have the work in Dún Cathal Brugha completed by Army electricians from military posts outside Dublin.  I cannot say at this stage when the entire work will be completed.  It is anticipated, however, that the installation of the <Col N="1949" /> new cable will result in an immediate improvement in the supply of electricity to the quarters in question.</P>

The facts are that the Corporation have informed the Garda, without any comment as to the merits, that requests have been received by the Corporation for pedestrian crossings at these three places, but there are about 60 crossings within the city in respect of which similar requests have been received, or which the Corporation or the Garda themselves think merit consideration, whereas the financial provision by the Corporation in the current year's estimates is sufficient only for ten.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, the Corporation requested that all the crossings concerned be made the subject of surveys, which include traffic counts and so on, by representatives of the Garda, the Corporation, and the Department of Local Government with a view to the fixing of an agreed priority list, which will then be formally presented to the Corporation.  The Garda hope that the survey will be completed in a few weeks' time.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 70 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the implications in the questions.  The Deputy describes <Col N="1954" /> the persons concerned as &ldquo;innocent&rdquo;. There is a legal presumption of innocence until the person is proved guilty but that does not mean that the Garda Síochána, whose duty it is to investigate crime, are not to follow up their suspicions and pursue their inquiries on the basis that a particular person may be guilty.  They could not do their duty at all if they were to believe, as readily as the Deputy appears to do, protestations of innocence from suspected persons.</P>
    <P>Neither do I accept that the Garda Síochána have been repeatedly visiting houses in connection with their investigations of crimes merely because the occupiers are relatives of persons convicted of similar crimes.  If, however, a person is well known to be, not only a relative but a constant associate of persons, both relatives and otherwise, who have several convictions for serious crime, that person can expect to be looked on by the Garda Síochána as a possible suspect in certain cases and, as long as they do not exceed their powers, they are only doing their duty in making the inquiries that they think necessary and I am not prepared to intervene.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the recommendations for the dairy industry and the bacon industry.  I think it would be very bad for the country if the suggestion to amalgamate the creameries were acted upon.  These creameries perform their own function and provide the farmer with many services.They provide him with credit when required; they provide a lorry service and so on.  The same applies to the bacon industry.  It would be a backward step to have only three or four very large factories in the whole country.  I understand another recommendation is that the farmer should pay for these factories by a levy of 5/- a pig.</P>
      <P>It is hard to understand the Minister's action in sanctioning the closing of the flour mills.  In his speech he mentioned that the trend in France and Germany was to provide employment for the small farmer by the provision of industry.  Here, instead of encouraging the growth of industry in the smaller areas, we find the policy of the Government is that it should be centralised in three or four industrial centres throughout the country such as Shannon and Dublin.  They say that only in these places will the industries get the services they require.</P>
      <P>That is a very wrong policy altogether.  As a result of Government policy, we have flour mills closed in my constituency.  Because of an amalgamation in the fertiliser industry, we have had a loading depot, a storage depot and a compounding depot closed in Kilkenny.  If the Minister were to follow his remarks about France and Germany to their logical conclusion, he would promote industry in the smaller areas.  For years we have heard the Minister for Transport and Power say that the flight from the land was no worse here than anywhere else and that the only hope was to establish industry to absorb those people.  But now, even in places where industries are already established they are being closed down.  I suppose the Taoiseach being a city man, does not know very much about the ways of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the Minister resents the protest meetings and marches of the <Col N="1956" /> farmers.  He says they are an imitation of what has been done on the continent.But are the Minister and the Government not the best people to prevent these meetings and marches? If the Minister and the Government co-operated with the farmers, they would not have to bring people together from all over the country to protest.  We would not have what we had in Limerick recently where 500 or 600 guards were sent to protect the people from the farmers, where two guards were appointed to escort each tractor in the procession in case anything might happen.</P>
    <P>It has been proved these marches produce results.  There was the case of the increased grant for the relief of rates.  Nothing was done about it until the farmers protested strongly in several areas.  I understand they were asked not to protest in Dublin, that their claims would be met before they arrived there.  They were met, with a £2 million grant for reduction of rates. I see the same thing occurred in regard to the heifer scheme.  We had meetings in Athlone and a protest in Limerick and then the heifer scheme was initiated.  These organisations consist of responsible people who do not want to embarrass the Government.  They have able and brilliant men in the farming industry at their heads and want to co-operate with the Government.Apparently, the Government do not want that co-operation.  Only when people feel they do not get the co-operation they deserve do they organise the protest speeches and marches the Minister resents so much.</P>
    <P>Although it may be very hard for him, I ask the Minister to co-operate with the organisations so that in future when any claims are made, they may be debated and discussed as happens with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I see the Taoiseach is anxious to meet the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to have consultations with them and with employers' unions but there is no suggestion of any meeting with farmers.  He has no time for them. He does not understand them.  I know the Minister is in an unenviable position in trying to help farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen mentioned the Land <Col N="1957" /> Project.  I was surprised that any Fianna Fáil Deputy should have the temerity to mention this subject.  We know what happened when the present Government came in.  The Minister now speaks about the credit being provided for the farmers but was not this an ideal credit scheme for the man who could not afford to meet his share of the cost of the Land Project, that it could be put on the annuities and he could pay for it as the land is brought into production?  This was not a scheme only for the man who could find a large sum.  There was the option of Section A, if he did not want it put on his annuity.  If a man had not got the capital sum, he could opt for the second part of the Land Project.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen said the cost now was about £60 per acre while the maximum grant now was £30.  This, he said, should be increased to £45 per acre.  I support him in that but I would prefer it had he asked that Section B should be restored to enable the farmer who cannot pay the capital sum to be facilitated.  Under the new issue which is being made to counteract the effects of the turnover tax, we are going to provide houses for the farmers in respect of which the capital sum can be put on the annuities.  But in the Land Project, Section B, there was already provided the necessary credit which people required very badly.  I suggest that, to the best of his ability &mdash;I know it is hard to get any hearing unless there is a protest march or something like that, from the present Taoiseach&mdash;the Minister should keep pressing and try to get a fair deal for the farmers.</P>

      <P>The present Minister took office at a very difficult period.  I have heard other Deputies speak of the schemes organised by the inter-Party Government and the then Minister for Agriculture.  It was easy to tell the people that the schemes were there but my experience in <Col N="1958" /> County Dublin was that any farmer who tried to avail of these schemes, reconstruction or building of out-houses, drainage or sinking wells, that normally benefit the farmer, found there was no money to pay for them. Not only that, but no other Minister had to deal with the bovine tuberculosis scheme.  At that time we had a deadline from the British market that unless we had a TB-free herd by a certain date, we were finished.  Other Ministers, including the previous Minister for Agriculture, had fallen down on this job completely.  The nation owes a debt of gratitude to the present Minister for the wonderful job he did in that huge scheme.</P>
      <P>First, we had to deal with the number of farmers who thought it was not necessary; others said: &ldquo;My father's and grandfather's cows were all right and so are mine.&rdquo;  We are naturally conservative but we had to move with the times and deal with the problem that present-day changes brought about.  It took a long time to do it. Almost 500,000 cows had to be slaughtered and tact and encouragement were needed to operate this scheme and at the same time, subsidise farmers, keep up the stock of cattle and keep the export market going.  It amounted to saving the agricultural industry as a whole, no small task in a few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have people of all organisations with cures for all ills: our export markets are not as good as they should be; no market for the surplus goods and so on.  Thank God, we are in a free democracy and these organisations, Macra na Feirme and the others, may say what they like about the Minister and the Department but while Macra na Feirme have done a good job for the country in organising farmers, trying to get them to adopt more scientific methods and trying to get them out of the groove in which they had been for years, it should go a step further and be constructive in its criticism.  The Minister is very wide-awake.  He is well aware of the position.  He is a politician and a member of a Party and it is to his own advantage, as well as to the advantage of his Party, that he should <Col N="1959" /> do the best he can.  If he can do better, naturally we shall all be pleased.  But the Minister is doing a very good job. I compliment him on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department have availed of every opportunity that has offered to improve the lot of the farmer.  There are people who criticise a great deal, especially people holding jobs, official or honorary, in the various farming organisations.  I would strongly advise the Minister to adopt the same strategy as Abraham Lincoln adopted: he would send for the most ardent critic and tell him that he seemed to be able to do the job better than the man who had it and he there and then offered him the job.  I would appoint these critics, asking them to report periodically on progress to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is one of the healthier signs of democracy that people can criticise. One would at all times like that criticism though to be constructive. Neither Fine Gael nor Labour criticise constructively.  Constructive criticism would help us to make this country even better.  I come from old farming stock and I have heard stories from my great grandfather and my grandfather.They survived without the help of any Minister for Agriculture, for there was no Minister for Agriculture to help them.  There were no schemes. The standard of living was low, but the people survived, and survived under very adverse conditions.</P>
    <P>Today we are putting £40 million into farming, subsidising farming, both directly and indirectly.  Agriculture is our most important industry.  The tourist trade comes second.  The industrial arm proper is rapidly catching up. A great many schemes have gone through this House since I first became a member, some 20 years back next May.  Many improvements have been made on our farms.  Help is even given when adverse weather conditions prevail.The Exchequer steps in to aid farmers, and will again, should occasion arise.</P>
    <P>Our greatest difficulty is, of course, the finding of markets for our surplus produce, and we have a considerable surplus.  In Dublin at the moment, we <Col N="1960" /> have a surplus of vegetables.  A farmer from Balbriggan told me at the Árd Fheis that it did not pay him to bring cabbage to the market because of the slump.  I think the solution to the problem lies in the establishment of co-operative societies.  If we go into the Common Market, if we are not as good as our neighbours in Europe, we will fall by the wayside.</P>
    <P>I have had some experience in exporting surplus vegetables to Britain and Scotland.  Freight charges are prohibitive.  The answer to the problem is the co-operative society in which every member will pull his weight.  There is very urgent need for co-operation in my constituency. We got away reasonably well with wheat but vegetable growers are suffering badly.</P>
    <P>Co-operation is the only solution. It would solve the problem of machinery for one thing.  It would cut down overheads.  A small farmer purchases a machine costing £2,000 and half the year the machine is idle.  It takes a great deal of effort to pay for that machine, to say nothing of depreciation.With a co-operative society, one machine could do four or five farms.  Instead of one man going into the Dublin market with a lorry half full, the same man on the same lorry could take the produce of five or six other growers.  That would eliminate overhead costs.</P>
    <P>Foreign markets must be studied. I am talking of vegetable markets now. It is essential to understand the presentation of vegetables in these markets.I have been in London, Glasgow and Edinburgh from time to time. Our standards must be brought up. Tomato growing in County Dublin has been very successful and a grading system will be put into operation. This year there was a certain amount of grading done.  It is hoped to be able not alone to supply the home market, but to export tomatoes.  The Irish tomato is of much better quality than the imported variety.  It is felt that, if handled properly, there is a good export market for tomatoes, that the quality of the tomatoes will sell them.</P>
    <P>I remember when the onions grown <Col N="1961" /> in Kerry first came on the Dublin market.  A co-operative movement was started.  It is a pleasure to see the way onions are marketed now, having been properly harvested.  The same applies to the co-operative societies dealing with apples.  I do not intend to discuss the dairying industry. I am confining myself to a few problems that concern County Dublin particularly.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the importance of co-operation.  The day of the individual producer is gone.  Farmers must co-operate with one another.  Our aim should be to make ourselves better than our forefathers were, to leave this country in a better condition than that in which we found it.  People must think intelligently for themselves.  I hope the young farmers will not always be going to Fine Gael meetings and Labour Party meetings where all they do is criticise the Minister for Agriculture.I hope our people will be prepared to stand on their own feet and to think for themselves and do the best they can, in co-operation with their neighbours.  It is highly important that there should develop a spirit of co-operation.Given that, there will be a very easy task for any Minister for Agriculture in the future.</P>

      <P>My intervention is intended to be very brief but the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture affords Deputies from rural areas an annual opportunity of voicing in Dáil Éireann the opinion of their constituents as to the activities of the Department of Agriculture over the preceding 12 months in particular and over the past few years in general.  Therefore, I rise this evening to speak on behalf of the farmers in North-East Cork, whom I have the honour to represent, and to give the views of, as I consider, the great majority of them in relation to the position in which they as farmers find themselves today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard my friend Deputy P. J. Burke from County Dublin extolling the Minister for Agriculture and assuring him that farmers and horticulturists in County Dublin were satisfied with the administration of his office by the Minister, I could not help thinking <Col N="1962" /> that he, like the Minister and the Government generally, is completely out of touch with reality.</P>
    <P>It is accepted and admitted by all sides of this House that the agricultural industry is still basically and fundamentally the industry on which everything in this country hinges.  It is generally agreed that the wealth of Ireland is not under the soil but on the top surface of the soil.  That being so, I am glad even at this late stage to think that the Fianna Fáil Government now admit that the basic industry is agriculture and, that being so, that we have to work it to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister and to the Government that farmers generally find themselves in the position that they cannot give of their best because they feel they are being treated anything but fairly.  It is true to say that the farmers were worse off on 1st November, 1963, than they were on 1st November, 1962.  I do not gloat in making that statement to the House. I am sorry to have to make it.  Even though farmers are agitating at times and are taking part in protest marches, in justice to them I would point out that there is good reason for their agitation and protestation.</P>
    <P>The Minister agreed, as did Deputy Medlar within the past hour and a half, that the prices for grain have not been increased over the past four or five years.  That is admitted on all sides. It must be admitted also that the costs of production of grain have increased considerably over the past four or five years.  Is it any wonder, then, that farmers are agitated?  Farmers, especially the grain growing farmers and other farmers of north and north-east Cork, are rightly agitated as a result of the position in which they find themselves.  The price of grain has not increased.  The cost of production has increased considerably.  Rates have increased considerably over the past four or five years.  In Cork they have increased by 3/- in the £ in the last year.  The grain-growing farmers of north and north-east Cork are the biggest ratepayers in the constituency. While they have to pay the increased rates and, like everyone else, have to meet the increased cost of living, the <Col N="1963" /> price of grain in 1963 was the same as in 1958-59.</P>
    <P>I would appeal, in all honesty, in all fairness, without agitation, to the Minister and the Government to give their immediate attention to the situatition in which such conditions are allowed to prevail.  I want to suggest also, in all fairness, that when the farmers do represent to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Government that they are not getting their due share of the national loaf, they are doing so in a very honest and sincere way.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Crotty, I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to treat the National Farmers' Association and other organised farmers' groups as the various trade unions are treated and, in my opinion, rightly treated.  The organised industrial trade unions are listened to whereas the farmers' organised groups get very little hearing.</P>
    <P>If we are to get the idea across to the people that increased production is necessary, that it will be necessary to work harder on the land, in view of the possibility of European competition in the future, and if we are sincere in appealing to the farmers to help us in that trojan task, we must show some faith in them, first of all by listening to them and then by dealing with their grievances in a sincere, honest and straightforward manner.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Government are the industrialists' Government and have very little concern for the farmers.  A great many farmers held that view before I did.  If this Government want to appeal to the sense of nationality and patriotism of the farmers, they should do as they did during the emergency when the farmers responded to the appeal.  While the emergency may not be as great now there is still an emergency and you must treat them in the way they should be treated as an organised body.</P>
    <P>I have said already that the price of grain has not altered in the past four or five years and I want to add that the farmers are worse off this year than they were in 1962.  All over the country the yield of grain is down considerably <Col N="1964" /> this year.  In my constituency, the yield of barley is down about five barrels per acre and a reduction of five barrels per statute acre means a reduction of about £10 per acre.  The Minister and the Government have no control over that but it is a fact that it has happened.  The yield of wheat is down about three barrels per statute acre which means about £10 per acre in terms of money.  Whether the farmers grow barley or wheat, apart from the price being the same and their costs greater, they are also £10 an acre worse off than they were in 1962.</P>
    <P>Those are plain, blunt facts and in view of them and of the position in which the farmers find themselves as a result, it is now the immediate task of the Government to do something about wheat and barley prices.  The Minister knows that a situation exists now, at the end of November, in which many people cannot get enough barley. I wonder what was the cause of the drop in the acreage of wheat and barley this year?  Was it that these crops do not pay to grow?  It is remarkable that there are farmers who find it impossible to get feeding barley at present in the south of Ireland.  I cannot understand what was the reason for the drop in acreage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>What I did say was that the produce had declined considerably <Col N="1965" /> and that the financial return was down considerably as well.  I came across a situation in the past week which I thought was paradoxical in which pig feeders found it impossible to get feeding barley at the end of November.  I cannot understand how that situation has developed but I am suggesting that the main reason is that the price given to the farmers for the growing of barley is not remunerative enough to induce them to grow it.  I cannot understand a situation in which we are importing coarse grains into a country which is admirably suited for the growing of feeding barley, especially when we remember that as a result of the Land Project and the ground limestone scheme, barley can now be grown on land that was only meagre and average up to recently.</P>
      <P>There is something fundamentally wrong with a policy which allows a situation to develop in which last year we gave practically £2 million to An Bord Gráin for the handling of the wheat crop here.  The fact that so much money was given to the Board to handle so much surplus wheat requires immediate investigation.</P>
      <P>I want to go on and tell the Minister that while the farmers in my constituency suffered all those losses and hardships through the growing of grain, they also find themselves in anything but a happy position in regard to the cattle trade.  I have no intention of blaming the Minister for the present price of cattle but the farmers now find themselves in the position that the cattle trade has fallen into an unhappy mess in the past couple of months.</P>
      <P>I have not come across anybody in this country who could pinpoint the reason for the drop in cattle prices. Cattle rearing is the fundamental side of the agricultural industry, which is, in itself, the fundamental part of our economy and it seems extraordinary that the reason for the fluctuation in cattle price cannot be pinpointed by anybody here.  We will have to devise a system whereby prices can be maintained in some kind of consistent form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the same position with regard to pig rearing.  After all the money that was spent in grading pigs and all the rest of it, we now have the <Col N="1966" /> situation in Cork where pigs are at a premium, grading has been discarded and anything in the shape of a fat pig brings in from £17 to £20.  Where have they all gone to?  Is it a question of supply and demand or has all the money spent on grading them and trying to find out what is the best type of pig been wasted?  All those things seem to go by the board when any kind of a scarcity arises.  I begin to wonder if all the money spent on the pig industry will have the effect we hope on the future of pig rearing. What we need is a broad policy aimed at constant production rather than speculative production.  The pig industry is one in which people are inclined to get into and get out of rather quickly, so unless we can guarantee pig rearers some future we will not succeed as we would like to.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch on the flight from the land.  It is unfortunate this problem has been steadily increasing over the years, particularly when we consider that all our best traditions were built up by our peasants.  The loss of them now is a disaster for Irish society.  Goldsmith, in his <i>Deserted Village</i>, had this to say:</P>
    <P>A bold peasantry, its country's pride, When once destroyed can never be supplied.</P>
    <P>I wonder how we are to tackle this problem of the flight from the land.  I know many of the causes that give rise to it, and to my mind, one of the main reasons is the takeover of the work on our farms by machinery instead of manual labour.  Here I want to sound a serious word of warning to the Minister and to the Government: I believe it is a very bad thing for this country that so much agricultural machinery is allowed to be imported.</P>
    <P>A considerable lot of this machinery lies idle in farmer's haggards for 11 months, sometimes 11½ months, each year.  The oil for that machinery, the spare parts, are all imported. Therefore I suggest we should devise a scheme whereby all this machinery would be bought and held on a co-operative rather than an individual basis.  In this manner we would be helping to achieve an improvement in our adverse balance.  I do not think <Col N="1967" /> any Minister or Deputy will disagree when I say it is bad policy to have machinery costing thousands of pounds thrown around farmers' haggards for 11½ months of the year while it is used perhaps for a month, perhaps for only a few days each year.  If our grain growing policy is to be continued in earnest, I suggest we should tackle this problem of excessive agricultural machinery immediately because nobody can say that it pays a man with a hundred acres or less to acquire machinery and have it lying idle in his haggard for the best part of the year.</P>
    <P>I began to refer to the flight from the land and mentioned machinery only because I thought it contributed largely to this problem.  It is one of the reasons why there is less employment on farms.  Of course there are also social reasons.  We have now arrived at a stage when it is hard to keep farmers' sons and farm labourers isolated, far away from the community spirit and the bright lights.  We cannot expect them to stay on the land either if we do not give them adequate compensation for the work they do. While most farmers would be only too anxious to pay their sons or their workers adequate wages they are limited in what they can afford by the facts I have already mentioned. This of course brings us back again to my submission that we do not give the farmers adequate compensation for the work they put into the land and we have the full circle in that the farmers are therefore unable to pay proper wages.</P>
    <P>The last problem I want to deal with is that of credit facilities for farmers.  Nobody has any doubt that the credit schemes and facilities available for farmers over the years have been anything but adequate.  There is no doubt that lack of these credit facilities is at the root of our problem of getting higher production.  This applies with particular emphasis to the smaller farmers.  The Minister knows this very well, coming from a county where the average farm is smaller than in my constituency of North-East Cork.  I am sure the Minister is as well aware as I am that many small farmers are starved for capital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1968" /> If these farmers could only get the wherewithal to manure and fertilise their land properly, I have no doubt we would get the extra production we require and the farmer would enjoy the independent position in society he so richly deserves.  The trouble in this country is that if you have got money, you can get plenty of money, but if you have not got money, you are left high and dry.  The Industrial Credit Company are there to help farmers and I know they are doing a good job of work, but where they are falling down on the job&mdash;and I am afraid this is because they are restricted by legislation&mdash;is that they are not providing better credit facilities for small farmers.</P>
    <P>I would appeal therefore to the Minister to have these problems tackled more enthusiastically, with a special eye on the small farmers, many of whom are suffering from under-production because they have not the capital to do the job properly. Having said that, I want to appeal in general to the Minister and to the Government to note the fact that the grain-growing farmers of North-East Cork have very genuine grievances. The Minister should listen to those grievances, to those protests that these farmers are not getting their due share of the national loaf.  In making these protests, they are doing only what they are genuinely entitled to do.  I want to appeal also to the Minister to make an all-out effort to develop constant rather than speculative prices in the pig trade so that more people will go into it in a businesslike way.  I repeat my suggestion about making available better credit facilities for small farmers.  If the Minister does all these things, he will be doing a great national job in helping farmers to get the added production from the land for which all Deputies appeal as I do now.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few brief remarks only on this Estimate.First of all, I should ask the Minister what plans he and the Government have, that is, if they have any plans, to check the dereliction of the small and medium-sized holdings all over the country.  All Deputies who spoke, from north, south, east <Col N="1969" /> and west, have given ample evidence that the flight from small and medium-sized holdings is going on apace. The Minister himself, coming from a constituency of medium-sized and small holders, must see what is going on there just as I see it in the west of Ireland and as Deputy Barry who has just spoken sees it in Cork.  These last few years and apparently the next few will be known as the age of extinction of small farmers.  They will be drawn off the land for one reason and one reason only, that the job does not pay.  They cannot make a living on it.</P>
      <P>The Minister lately decided on a subsidy for heifers calving after 1st January next.  That is something to the good.  However, if we are to go by what the Minister said, these grants will be so hamstrung with regulations that the scheme will be abortive.  I suppose he is taking a leaf from the book of the British Minister of Agriculture.The British have poured more than £800 million in subsidy into farming.  There is an unlimited market right on their doorstep and still the British Government decided that small as the agricultural industry was in England, Scotland, Wales, it must be kept alive at all costs.  The Minister must have come across these statistics gathered from various farmers there, most of whom admitted that 70 per cent of their income was subsidised in one form or another.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be taken as begging on behalf of the farmers but the prices farmers are getting for their agricultural produce are so small that they are being forced off the land.  The Government have been giving such meagre scrappy help that the industry has been dying for a number of years. It has suffered blows that would put any other industry under the sod.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a farmer applies for building scheme grants or for something to improve his land, it takes all the work in the world to get a few pounds.  On the other hand, a foreigner of any nationality, from Japan or Peru, has no trouble in getting £100,000 as a grant to set up a factory.  There is nothing to stop that man finishing with the profit of that business in a year or two as happened in the case of an <Col N="1970" /> industry in which the Government put £350,000 of the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>We are not so far removed from the days when there was a terrific fight by the tenant farmers to own their own land.  They thought the great battle had been won, as it was, when the various Land Acts culminating in the Land Act of 1923 were passed, putting an end to landlordism and giving the farmer the right of sale and other rights in connection with the land. Quick on the heels of that comes home Government which proceeds to treat the farmer as if he were a working horse pulling every industry and every white elephant out of the mire.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been used all down the years to bolster up, particularly, foreign industries.  I am all for industry because I realise the land can put only a certain number in useful employment and the surplus has either to emigrate or to find employment in industry here.  However, agriculture has been flogged unmercifully for the purpose of supporting industry which has given nothing back.  That is why I am raising my voice in this regard and it is about time somebody did it.</P>
    <P>If the Government want to help the small farmer, they must devise some means of supplementing their income by part-time employment in the localities where they live or by direct subsidy.The Minister and his advisers and the Taoiseach and his advisers will have to determine what way that will be done.</P>
    <P>The heifer scheme is a step in the right direction.  I hope the Minister has put an upper limit on that scheme. Long before the scheme was announced, one person, I am told, seemed to know it was coming and prepared by buying enormous numbers of cattle and scrub bulls.  I have no objection to the bigger farmer who can afford it taking advantage of this scheme but a person who is a gambler like that cannot be described as a farmer.  Therefore, I hope there will be a ceiling in regard to this scheme.</P>
    <P>In regard to the farm buildings scheme, it is time we looked at what the British Government and the Northern Ireland Government have done for their farmers.  The time has come for giving more generous <Col N="1971" /> assistance to our farmers for farm buildings and so on.  The grants for cowbyres and piggeries is exactly one-third of what is given across the Border.  The time has long passed when the farmers should be taxed for any improvements carried out.  I am referring to the old British and Northern Ireland system, which they abolished years ago, of putting rates on agricultural buildings.</P>

      <P>Let me submit that if I raise this on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government I shall be bringing in agriculture and the same argument will apply.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I will not dwell on it further.  I should like to ask the Minister what new regulations have been issued under the Land <Col N="1972" /> Rehabilitation Scheme as regards the depth of outfall of drains which is now necessary before a job can be sanctioned. I have only heard this from farmers and I cannot say it is reliable but I have been told that the Department now require an outfall depth of at least 3' 6&rdquo; below the level of the drains on the farmer's land.  That would mean the virtual death of the Land Rehabilitation Scheme.  Section B of the scheme was killed by the Government some years ago and if what I have been told is true, this will mean the end of the remaining part. Except in mountainous areas or where there is a very steep run-off, no land could be reclaimed.  I would ask the Minister to let us know what regulations have been issued.</P>
      <P>The mismanagement of agriculture has been very clearly shown up by the way people are leaving the agricultural industry.  Agricultural prices have not increased by one-tenth of one per cent since 1949, while the cost of living and the cost of everything the farmer has to buy, fertilisers, seeds, chemicals, tools and so on, have gone up in price and the wages of other sections of the community have been doubled or trebled.  The agricultural stamp in respect of abatement for employment on land has gone up from 2/6 to 6/-.  When it was 2/6, the agricultural abatement was around £8, £9 or £10.  Some years ago, the Minister brought in an abatement of £17 but it does not cover the cost of a workman's compensation policy, plus the 6/- stamp.  It is time the Minister had another look at that if he wants to give agricultural employment any fillip at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income of small farmers does not pay them any more.  At one time we had families, with the exception of perhaps one member, clearing off to England or America, or perhaps they might have been fortunate enough to get jobs here, but now whole families are clearing out and in my part of the country, it is quite common for boys and girls who have gone to England to bring their parents over.  The Government should do all they can to stop this drain from the land.  It can be done and the way in which it can be <Col N="1973" /> done is to give some security of income to the farmer.  If the Minister wants proof of that, I can give him one pointer from Mayo.  Some years ago, there was not a single creamery in the county but today there are at least three, one in Killala, one in Castlebar and one in Claremorris.  While the price of milk is not exorbitant, at least the people know what they are going to get.  The price of cattle at present has completely flopped and is down by anything from £10 to £20 a head on last year.  The bacon trade is also down and only a born gambler would go into it; poultry and eggs are things of the past.  The markets have gone and the farmers must clear out or starve at home because they will not qualify for the dole.  If the Government want to retain even a few of those who are left on the land, they will have to give them some security of price and some help to bridge the gap between the cost of living and their income.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be well aware that the farmers have no say whatever in the fixing of prices.  It is always the man who buys the produce from the farmer who determines the price and the same man determines the price at which he will sell it.  So much the luckier for him.  All this neglect and carelessness, amounting at times to contempt, has left village after village bereft of manpower.  We will be lucky if we have even one family left in a townland inside the next ten or 20 years.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies mentioned the farmers' protest meeting in Limerick some weeks ago and it was certainly disgraceful to read in the newspapers that there were as many guards drafted into the city as there were farmers. One would imagine that the occupants of one of the big penitentiaries in the United States had broken loose, that a crowd of dangerous killers or gunmen were at large&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The way that protest march was treated was blackguardism. It was just similar to the Minister's threat years ago that he would fill every field with inspectors.  The sooner the Minister gets rid of that landlord idea, the better.  Farmers will not be bludgeoned in that sort of way.  They suffered it long enough under foreign rule and they are not going to take it under native Government.</P>
      <P>The farmer is anxious to be led, but the farmer is the kind of man who will not be driven.  The Minister should have realised that by now.  This is no place for caustic comment and I hate being dragged into it, but when I see the principal industry of the country being neglected and mishandled, somebody has to raise his voice.  Our agricultural manpower is being driven out and so many holdings are being left derelict that it will be beyond the capacity of any Government, with the financial resources at their disposal, to make good the ravages of the diseases going on to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister I shall be brief, not because I do not think agriculture worthy of a full discussion, but because we are practically 12 months behind in our consideration of the Estimates.  Indeed, soon we will be back discussing the Estimates all over again.  I am sorry the Estimate for Agriculture is being treated on a political basis.  I believe there is a certain amount of good in the policies of each Party so far as agriculture is concerned.  But we are still so childish that we are not prepared to say there are good points in each programme and that we should try to amalgamate the best points in each in order to take agriculture out of the political cockpit it should never have been allowed to get into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must realise how agriculture will be affected here by our entry into EEC.  At present, the French are forcing the issue so far as agriculture is concerned, because they know what they can gain.  West Germany are playing a different game because they have a different view of agriculture. <Col N="1975" /> The nearest market to us at present is the British one, but our share of that is small compared with that obtained by Denmark and other countries.  It is a pity we are not prepared to devote as much time to considering the effects upon agriculture of our entry into EEC as we devote to its effects upon industry.  Last Sunday I read a report in an Irish newspaper dealing with the question of our possible entry into the Common Market.  This report, written by an eminent expert, did not contain one word about agriculture.  There was not a word about the farmer, or, equally important, about the farm worker.  These people outside, who seem to know more than all the politicians, talk about the great advantages that may accrue from our entry into the Common Market.  However, they should realise the danger confronting us.  When we realise the competition with which we will be faced, we may have to approach the problem in a different way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry talked about prices and, more important, a guaranteed market over a long period.  There is no use telling the farmer what he will get for one year or offering him a bounty for one year.  It is far more important for any Minister for Agriculture to concentrate on securing satisfactory markets at long-term prices.  We must admit what has been happening all along.  When Fianna Fáil are in office, Fine Gael, as the main Opposition Party naturally offer the farmers certain advantages. But the farmers are no fools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We know from every election in this country that the farmer's attitude is: &ldquo;If one crowd are in government, we will put in the others, because they will give us a couple of bob more&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is happening.  The results of the elections show that.  It would be far more honest and more fair to the farmers if, instead of offering them some small bounty which will last only for a year or two, we gave them a guaranteed market with a guaranteed long-term <Col N="1976" /> price.  Then the farmers would be able to plan for the future the same as an industrialist can plan for the future when he knows he has a secure market and a fair price.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry also mentioned the question of machinery.  In addition to all the other surveys being carried out, we need a survey in regard to the wastage of machinery in the country. Some machines costing a lot of money are idle for over 11 months of the year.  The Minister should initiate a survey related to the cost of operating these machines and the results achieved.</P>
      <P>My last point refers to the farm worker.  When discussing agriculture, we cannot divorce one from the other. I know that in parts of the country the small-holding farmers employ only family labour, but there are other parts of the country where the holdings are not large and where employment is always given on the farm.  I think statistics show that, irrespective of whether Fianna Fáil or the inter-Party Government were in office, there has been a continuous drop in the number of farm workers employed.  Year after year there has been a steady drop in the number of farm workers employed on farms.  That is not a healthy sign. In 1947, wages were disgraceful&mdash;35/- a week, but the farm worker at present is not adequately paid.  If he is considered as a human being, against what it costs to buy machines that are idle for 11 months of the year, we find if we are prepared to operate agriculture in a truly Christian democratic way, we must have much more respect for the farm worker.</P>
      <P>Not until the Agricultural Wages Board that is packed against the worker at present with its so-called independents who all the time vote against the workers' representatives, is smashed and then reorganised, we can never hope for fair treatment and adequate conditions for our farm workers who are proving their worth even in the far-off countries where they have had to go, not because of the activity of one Government or political Party, but because of the inactivity of different Governments in regard to agricultural workers.</P>

      <P>In any case, the small farmer gains very little and in the west of Ireland the man of £20 valuation is being wiped out.  The Minister knows&mdash;he may laugh at this &mdash;that the famous heifer scheme that we hear so much about is not any advantage to the small tenant farmer of under £20 valuation.  He must keep his land fully stocked in order to exist. He must put in so many heifers to qualify for this £15 subsidy.  He is not in a position to do that and, therefore, it is no gain to him.  Neither the fertiliser subsidy nor derating nor the heifer scheme carry any advantage for such farmers.  Since I came here over 21 years ago I have been advocating total derating on the first £20 of valuation.</P>
