    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech yesterday was disappointing from start to finish.  There were many words in it, but it conveyed very little information to the House and less to the country.  It was prepared for presentation to the House to get the necessary funds, while giving the least possible amount of information. I notice that in that long speech practically no matter of great national importance was mentioned.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the Weekly Bulletin issued by the Department. It is mean and shabby and I think its articles are deliberately designed to boost the Fianna Fáil Party.  When I read the speeches by various Ministers in that bulletin, I cannot help asking myself what interest or value they have for those who are interested in external affairs. What obligation has the Department to advertise the speeches made by a Fianna Fáil Minister with funds provided by this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the films which are to be shown when completed, and to the new information booklet which will be in colour and contain photographs.  I am sure it is not foolish to presume that booklet is being designed to get publicity abroad for President de Valera.  I venture to say that at the expense of <Col N="1046" /> the public, the Department of External Affairs are now providing a booklet, in colour, with photographs of the President in every shape and form, to be circulated abroad and give the impression that there is only one Party and one man in this country, and that the only Party who have ever done anything progressive in the history of this country are the Fianna Fáil Party and that the booklet, which will be sponsored by the Department of External Affairs, will seldom or never make any reference to anyone else.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that before he embarks upon large-scale publicity for this new booklet he should consider placing it before the leaders of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party so that they can see whether it is on a broadminded basis or on the usual narrow-minded political basis of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am given to understand that this new publication is based on the political activities of the Minister for External Affairs himself and on those of the Head of the State, with particular reference to the fact that he was the only leader this country ever had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Head of the State should not be drawn into discussions in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consult with the leaders of the various Parties in the House so that their attention may be directed to any political references there may be in that publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the number of international conferences and conventions which are being held in this country and to the many eminent public personalities who visit the State for these conferences from time to time.  These conferences are helping to build up abroad a high place for this country and the more of them that are held in our capital city, the better.  They will help to bring about a better understanding between those who attend them and the Irish people and they will help to highlight Irish hospitality on a world-wide scale.  It should be made known by our Ambassadors and Ministers abroad <Col N="1047" /> that Ireland holds out a welcoming hand to people who wish to hold their conferences in this country.</P>
    <P>The number of international conferences about to be held here, as outlined by the Minister, is a good sign for our country and this activity should have the encouragement of all members of this House.  The more conferences of an international character held here, the better for ourselves.  The facilities which we can offer for the holding of these conferences are second to none and I hope the Department will, in its own way and through the medium of the high grade and experienced civil servants in the Department itself, endeavour to concentrate on a long term plan for the holding of such conferences here.  Nothing should be left undone to encourage such a development.</P>
    <P>Foreign delegates who have come to this country for these conferences have gone away with a wonderful impression of the country.  We may not always be blessed with the best of weather but in comparison with the tropical heat of some countries and the bitter cold of others, our climate is reasonably good.  Those who have participated in international events here in the past have thoroughly enjoyed themselves and have gone away with a lasting impression of our warm Irish hospitality.</P>
    <P>Where functions are held for the purpose of welcoming these international personalities, invitations to such functions should not be confined to those who make generous financial contributions to the Fianna Fáil Party. I know of functions held in Iveagh House and, on looking around, one could only come to the conclusion that the reason for the presence of many of the people there was that they were generous financial supporters of Fianna Fáil.  That is wrong and this House is the place where attention should be drawn to the abuse of Iveagh House in that connection.  It would not be tolerated in any other country. It may be one way in which the Minister can show his gratitude and appreciation <Col N="1048" /> to those who have shown financial loyalty to his Party but it is wrong and should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I could name at least 20 people whom I have seen at such receptions whose only claim to be there was that they had supported generously the election funds of Fianna Fáil, while representatives of various cultural and educational bodies were overlooked simply because their places have been filled by those who supported Fianna Fáil.  The Minister knows that is true.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are not taking the activities of the Council of Europe seriously.  It is a highly important body.  The method of appointment of Government delegates to it is a matter for the Government and I do not know how they make the selection. However, the Council of Europe owes a debt of gratitude to the Leader of the Opposition for the personal interest he has taken in its activities since he went to Strasbourg as one of the delegates of this country.  Special mention should also be made of the excellent service rendered to that Council by Deputy Esmonde who, in his own way, has made international contacts of great value to this country.</P>
    <P>We should send to the Council of Europe delegates who are entirely devoted to advancing the interests of this country abroad rather than those who are selected on a narrow political basis. I am afraid the Government are inclined to look on the activities of the Council of Europe as an excuse for sending a number of people on a holiday, when they should regard it as an assembly where our representatives can win for Ireland many more friends abroad.  The general policy of the Department of External Affairs should be to win for Ireland abroad many more friends and to minimise the number of its enemies.  It is hard to see how a nation like ours could have enemies abroad, but it is very easy to make enemies by irresponsible and wild speeches and by acting in an irresponsible way.  I am afraid the Minister for External Affairs must answer to this House for a high degree of irresponsibility <Col N="1049" /> in his speeches abroad.  If anyone deliberately tried to make enemies abroad for this country, he could not set about it in a more effective way than the Minister has been doing.  Very recently, he has changed his attitude in that respect, but he could add to this by saying nothing at all.  There are many people who cannot open their mouths without offering offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong for a Minister for External Affairs to go abroad and deliberately look for Ireland's friends to give them a kick in the pants, to offer them all sorts of insults. The function of such a Minister is to expound the foreign policy of his Government, nothing more.  The difficulty here is to find out what that foreign policy is.  We have the Minister for External Affairs advocating one line and the Taoiseach, the Leader of his Government, advocating another. I would advise the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs to consult with each other and try to agree on one policy.  The way the Minister has spoken in world councils is belittling and degrading to the Irish nation.</P>
      <P>I might point out that we in the Fine Gael Party do not take any delight in that.  We are rather sorry about it and want to ensure, through constructive criticism, that a concrete and solid foreign policy is agreed on between the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs and pursued vigorously.  One thing that should be avoided is the giving of offence to our best friends, to Britain and the United States.  If there has been a temporary misunderstanding between Britain and France in relation to EEC membership, it is no reason to assume that France will be any less friendly to Ireland. Our attention has not been called to any statement by President de Gaulle or any of his Ministers that France would be likely to oppose Ireland's entry into EEC, though I think it would be very unwise for Ireland to enter the Common Market, unless Britain is allowed to join as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> We must not forget that we are closely linked, economically, culturally and geographically, with Britain.  All our energies should be directed to cementing this relationship, but at the same time we should not allow the breakdown between Britain and France at the Brussels talks to influence our friendly dealings with France.  While on this subject, I must say I cannot understand why the Minister made no reference to the Common Market in his introductory statement.  Everybody now realises the wide gap there is between the information given by the Taoiseach in replies to Deputies Dillon and Corish and the actual truth about events at Brussels.  It only serves to strengthen our belief that the Government have badly mishandled and mismanaged our application for EEC membership, that they are guilty of a high degree of negligence.  Not only that, but they have continued to withhold vital information on this subject from the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, therefore, that the Minister for External Affairs and the Government are not fit and not qualified to carry out the further negotiations which will, we all hope, arise in the future in connection with our efforts to join the Common Market.  We all now realise the importance of a united Europe, backed up by the USA in the fight to save the world from the heavy and cruel hand of Communism.  In his speeches abroad, the Minister should therefore leave no shadow of doubt as to Ireland's position in this regard.  He should take every opportunity, in every world assembly, to show where Ireland stands in relation to the activities of Russia and her Iron Curtain satellites &mdash; that we are 100 per cent behind the policy of a united Europe, backed by the United States.  That is the only hope of obtaining peace and progress in the world and Ireland may be able to play her part in securing these conditions.</P>
    <P>We have much to be proud of in our association with the United Nations in relation to the manner in which Mr. Boland conducted the business during his period as Chairman of that body.  His wise counsel and capable handling of affairs have <Col N="1051" /> contributed greatly to enhancing the fame of Ireland's foreign representatives. It is a great pity that a man of Mr. Boland's intellectual attainments and international achievements should be handicapped by doubts as to the Government's foreign policy.  I think the Government are unfair to those who speak for us abroad in not giving them a clear-cut policy on external affairs.</P>
    <P>A number of new African States have recently come into being.  Why should this country not join with Britain, the United States and European countries and concentrate on making new friends for Ireland? If more intelligence and commonsense were displayed by the Government, it would not be left open to any of these countries to think of Ireland for a moment as anything but friendlydisposed. I trust as a result of this debate steps will be taken to increase the number of our friends and reduce the number of our enemies.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Cuban crisis of last October in which President Kennedy, with great wisdom and restraint, made what was probably one of the world's finest pronouncements. He deserves to be complimented and supported by all free nations and should receive officially from Governments appreciative messages saying that they are solidly and firmly behind that pronouncement.  Apart from the Pope as an adviser, practically no other statesman exercises as much power in the world to-day and I believe that the President of the United States has contributed more to peace in the past 12 months than any other man.  Our Minister for External Affairs when abroad and our representatives in the United States should take every opportunity of making it known that President Kennedy's action in the Cuban crisis was appreciated here and had the support of all free peoples.</P>
    <P>In the Congo, the United Nations force is being reduced by 7,000.  Serving there at present are 868 members of the Irish Defence Forces and I am glad that the Minister has very properly paid tribute to the conduct of our soldiers there.  But I am not completely <Col N="1052" /> satisfied that the Government have done all they could in the past 12 months to counteract the false, misleading, malicious, damaging and scandalous propaganda which I feel was deliberately sponsored by Communist interests to belittle the forces of the United Nations and to single out the Irish soldiers.  Any money spent in an effort to counteract that campaign would be well spent.  The Minister must have information in his Department to the effect that of all the soldiers sent to the Congo, the Irish battalions were of the highest standard in the matter of religious duties, general conduct and discipline and particularly the sympathetic manner in which they dealt with the Africans.  Despite efforts to damage the reputation of our soldiers, they have won a very special place in the heart of the Africans for their courtesy, sympathy and assistance. They have helped this country by their good example and their officers deserve the highest appreciation of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Any Deputies who have spoken to any of the chaplains returned from the Congo find that they all testify to the high standard of conduct maintained by our soldiers.  These chaplains are in a position to give impartial views because they were with the soldiers not only in the hours of battle and danger but also during relaxation and social moments.</P>
    <P>It may be said that we get little value from our Army but the Minister must know that, small though the Army is, there were numerous applicants for service in the Congo.  They were disappointed that they could not be called for service in the Congo.  That goes to show the fine quality of courageous men whom we have.</P>
    <P>Our men went to the Congo, not to look for fight, not to enter into battle but for one purpose only &mdash; to preserve, maintain and keep law and order.  I really feel that while law and order have been and are being maintained there, the Irish have played no small part in bringing about the peaceful conditions that prevail in the Congo at the present time.  We can only hope and trust that the activities of the United Nations in the Congo will <Col N="1053" /> be successful entirely and completely and that the time may came when the United Nations may be able to leave the Congo to the natives when they have built up a steady condition of law, order and respect.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that these people whom the United Nations are now helping and assisting in the Congo are people whose country has only been given birth to.  They lack a high degree of discipline, understanding and education &mdash; and a general allowance has to be made.  Whilst our State is only 40 years old, we are able after 40 years to take our place with the nations of the world in helping to assist in the establishment of law and order in countries which require such assistance.  That, in itself, reflects credit on this country.  It reflects credit on our Army, on our men and on the United Nations.  That is why I feel that the stand that has been taken in the United Nations is worthy of support and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here last night by a Deputy to the External Relations Act.  Why, I do not know &mdash; but I suppose the External Relations Act would come up for comment on every Estimate in relation to the Department of External Affairs.  Whether that Act was right or wrong, it was passed by this House.  I really feel that the passing of the External Relations Act at least decided where we stood.  I can recall many years ago asking Parliamentary Questions of the then Taoiseach as to where we stood internationally. Very often, he would reply one day and say: &ldquo;We are in the Commonwealth but we are not of the Commonwealth.&rdquo;  The next day he would reply and say: &ldquo;We are of the Commonwealth but not in the Commonwealth.&rdquo;  The result was a high degree of uncertainty as to where Irishmen stood &mdash; whether we were in the Commonwealth or out of the Commonwealth.  It could never positively be located where we stood.</P>
    <P>The one thing the External Relations Act did was to show clearly where we stood.  In addition, if we wanted to appoint our Ministers abroad, those appointed usually had to be referred to the reigning British King <Col N="1054" /> or Queen.  The passing of the External Relations Act at least raised the status of the head of our State.  He was in a position to receive the accredited Ministers and to accept the credentials of foreign Ambassadors, and so on, coming here.  They could be presented to him as a representative of our State and we could accredit without any reference to the British King or Queen our Ministers abroad and they could get full recognition in that regard.  The passing of that Act, which was never tackled by the Fianna Fáil Party, nevertheless succeeded in having our country recognised abroad as an independent State.</P>
    <P>Probably there could have been bargaining at the time.  I feel, in that regard, it was a good thing and it is a good thing that the constitutional status of this country abroad should very clearly be defined and that we should not be in the position in which we were prior to the passing of the External Relations Act that we were in the Commonwealth today but not of it and the following day of the Commonwealth but not in it.  At least we know now where we stand.</P>
    <P>I think it was, again, extraordinary that no reference was made in the Minister's statement this year to the Border, the Partition problem or the problem of a united Ireland.  Why, I do not know, because this is one year in which there should have been special reference to that.  We can recall a reference made, I think, by the late Cardinal D'Alton some time ago when he spoke of a United Ireland within the Commonwealth. I feel that, as far as the Commonwealth of Nations is concerned, the Commonwealth in non-existent. When we see the position in relation to Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and particularly when we examine the Commonwealth of Nations as it was, say, 25 years ago, it is practically non-existent today.</P>
    <P>The point was made as to whether it should be wise to have a United Ireland, a 32 County Ireland, linked with the Commonwealth.  But we find that the real position today is that, for all purposes, the Commonwealth is crumbling away and is practically non-existent. <Col N="1055" /> Now, what will the Minister for External Affairs do?  What is his definite policy in relation to the Six Counties and to the Partition of our country?  Has he a definite policy on it or is his policy the same policy as referred to this country before the passing of the External Relations Act when the policy was that we were in the Commonwealth today but not of it and, the following day, that we were of the Commonwealth but not in it and back again the next day to in the Commonwealth but not of it, and so on?</P>
    <P>The position is that, for the time being, until the Partition problem is solved in this country, the Government of Northern Ireland are there.  There are as good Irishmen in the Parliament of the Six Counties as there are in this Parliament.  There are Members of Parliament in the Six County Parliament as Irish, as national and as Gaelic as we are.  They possess the Irish language, they think the same way as we think and they care for the people they represent just as much as we care for the people we represent.</P>
    <P>When will we reach the stage in this country when we shall grow up?  We seem to be remaining small very long. The older we get the more narrowminded we appear to become.  I venture to say that in County Down today there are as good Irishmen as are in any part of Ireland.  The evidence is clearly given, when the people of Down come to Croke Park to play the people of Offaly, that even though there is a Border between them and for the time being they are under two different Governments they are the same people and they have the same understanding.  They are devoted to Gaelic pastimes and have the same allegiance to the GAA as we have in Offaly.  They come down to our national stadium in Croke Park to participate in the games and they are as good Irishmen as we are in the south of Ireland.  The same applies to Tyrone, Antrim, Armagh, Fermanagh and Derry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs is himself an Armagh man.  Is there anyone in a better position to bring about a closer link-up than he?  The <Col N="1056" /> Tánaiste is a Belfast man.  Are the Tánaiste and the Minister for External Affairs Irishmen to a lesser degree than the Irishmen they left behind in Armagh and Belfast?  The men who are in the Six-County Parliament are the political brothers of the Tánaiste and the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    <P>How can we continue to seek friends abroad, to get the new states of Africa to be our friends, to encourage greater friendship with European countries and the United States while we seem to give the blind eye and the deaf ear to our own flesh and blood in the Six Counties?  The one year in which there should have been a special reference to the conditions in Northern Ireland is this year and I want to express great disappointment that there was no reference in the Minister's Estimate to the fact that there is a new Prime Minister in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>In this country and in the Six Counties, things have changed during the past ten years.  Some of our own leaders in the South have gone, temporarily anyway, into cold storage. The old leaders who carried on the bitterness in the North are fading out and are also, I hope, in cold storage. Lord Brookeborough never wanted to extend the hand of friendship because he was brought up in that old school of narrowmindedness and bitterness. While other Deputies may say, as some of them said last night, that it does not matter who the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland is, that they are one sack, one sample, I disagree with that argument.  I believe the new Prime Minister of Northern Ireland will infuse new life and will provide a ray of hope of closer friendship and a greater degree of co-operation between the North and the South.  The days of the Brookeborough Government are past.  The old references by the Six Counties to Southern Ireland are past and gone.  I wish to ask the Minister what has been done in a practical way to help our fellow-Irishmen in the Six Counties.  Would it not be better to try to help them economically, and for them to try to help us in our economic difficulties, rather than politically?  Is it not a <Col N="1057" /> fact that Irish Shipping placed orders abroad for shipping while the Belfast docks and the Belfast shipyards were idle and the shipworkers were walking around unemployed?</P>

      <P>If we are asking for co-operation between North and South and if there is any work which we must place with outside contractors, it is our duty to consult with the Northern Minister of Commerce, since we have not a consul or a representative in Belfast as we should have, which matter I shall deal with in a moment.  We should make that effort, realising that the economic problems and difficulties of the Six Counties are very close to our own.</P>
      <P>There has been tremendous emigration from the Six Counties.  There has been endless and tremendous emigration from the Republic.  If it were not for the fact that high subsidies are paid by the British Government, the farmers of the Six Counties would be as poor as the farmers of the Republic. I venture to say that the time will come when the British taxpayers and the British Government will &ldquo;cop themselves on&rdquo; and will say: &ldquo;This is too great a liability.&rdquo;  If the British Government withdrew their financial support in the morning, it would be very hard for the Six County Government to exist for 48 hours.</P>
      <P>We may be able to help those people if they want our help and they may be able to help us when we need help. There is no use in saying that the docks and the shipbuilding yards of Belfast did not tender for Irish shipping. Were they ever asked?</P>

      <P>I should like to know what steps were taken to encourage the building of our ships in Belfast. If there are no orders for shipbuilding in Belfast and if there is a high degree of unemployment in the yards there, I find it hard to believe that there were approaches in connection with the building of ships for the Republic and that they were turned down.  I am quite satisfied no approach whatever was made in that respect.</P>

      <P>Every effort should be made to consult with the North and to say: &ldquo;You are a part of the unit of Ireland; here is a manner in which we can help to relieve your unemployment.&rdquo;  When a helicopter was needed to help in the search for the unfortunate students who were the victims of the tragic accident in Wicklow &mdash; in respect of which the sympathy of all of us goes out to their parents&mdash; we had to send to the Six Counties. The helicopter came down and operated to great effect and with speed and efficiency.  As a Deputy, I should like to express grateful thanks to Mr. Brian Faulkner, the Minister of Home Affairs in the Six Counties, for the speed with which he dealt with the request for the services of that helicopter in connection with that tragic event.</P>
      <P>An example of solid co-operation has been provided by the Foyle fisheries.  Discussions have taken place between our Government and the Northern Government in relation to railways and transport.  On the occasion of the death of our beloved Cardinal last February, at the height of the worst weather for ten years, was a special effort not made by the Six Counties authorities to see that the roads to Armagh were cleared with the greatest possible speed?  Was there not a high degree of courtesy shown to our President and Ministers from the time they crossed the Border until they reached the Cathedral in Armagh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad we have reached the stage of realising the foolishness of using force.  I could never understand how any group of men could say it was in the interests of this country that they <Col N="1059" /> should cold-bloodedly shoot any fellow-Irishman in the Six Counties.  I am glad the Irish Government have played their part in stamping that out.  We are with the Government 100 per cent in that regard.  It is something to be proud of that those who in the past were inspired by youthful enthusiasm or by the teaching of history in a bitter manner have now come to realise that force will not be tolerated by us in the South and that we will protect the property and lives of the people of the Six Counties and play our part in co-operating with the Northern Government in seeing to it that a state of law and order and respect for those in authority will prevail.</P>
    <P>I could never understand why there could not be respect for those in charge in the Six Counties.  They are not Englishmen.  I do not know if there is any born Englishman a member of the Stormont Parliament.  They are all residing there and have got their votes from their constituents.  We have a reserved opinion about the make-up of those constituencies and the allocation of seats, but I could never understand how an Irishman in 1962 or 1963 should have the same mentality as we had ourselves in 1921 or 1922.  The time in which one Irishman would use a gun on another should be long past.  We are now living in civilised times and we should all be grown up.</P>
    <P>This Government can contribute most generously, particularly the Minister for External Affairs, towards the building up of the Six Counties as a part of our community.  When is the Minister going to appoint a representative in Belfast for the purpose of furthering trade and closer co-operation between the local authorities bordering the Six Counties and developing schemes which affect the two States?  Whether we like it or not &mdash; and we do not like it &mdash; the border is there.  It is certain, however, that it cannot always last; but it will never be taken by force.  That is as sure today as it always was.  There can never be an attempt from this side of the country to take it by force because we would be bringing our fellow Irishmen into combat against us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> There is one way in which this problem can be solved.  We should offer to the people of the Six Counties a higher standard of living than they are getting under their own Government. We cannot do that until we first improve our own standard of living and make it attractive for them to come in.  If they want to come in, let them come in; if they do not, that is their own business.  We must face facts.  They are there and we are here. What is to prevent the Minister for External Affairs doing what he has done in the case of Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Canada, the United States, Argentina and now Nigeria? We have our Ambassadors, Ministers, and trade commissioners, in practically every corner of the world.  But here, where we can help our own Irishmen in their difficulties, there has been no effort on the part of this Government.</P>
    <P>It is no use saying that constitutionally this Parliament does not recognise the Government of the Six Counties. The Minister for Justice and the Minister for External Affairs have revealed that negotiations are going on between civil servants from North and South in relation to an extradition Bill. How can top-level talks between the two Civil Services take place in relation to fisheries, rural electrification, customs tariffs and extradition legislation without recognising the authority of those with whom we are talking?  Surely we are not in consultation with people whom we do not constitutionally recognise?</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which we can help those people, and many ways in which they can help us.  I should like to hear from the Minister why he made no reference to this matter in his speech.  Have the Government decided to do nothing whatever in regard to co-operation between North and South?  What has happened to the special section of the Department of the Taoiseach which was set up by Deputy J.A. Costello during the inter-Party Government's term of office to deal purely with co-operation and trade and life in the community generally between this country and the Six Counties?  No mention has been made <Col N="1061" /> of it from that day to this.  Is it not right that if we have trade commissioners all over the world, we should have one in Belfast and should invite the Belfast Government to send a representative to Dublin?  Then the question which Deputy MacCarthy referred to in relation to shipbuilding and orders could not arise.  If we want ships, we could consult the Belfast representative in Dublin and if he told us that the shipbuilding yards were available for orders and that there was unemployment there, then first preference should be given to Belfast, without seeking tenders from any other part of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am convinced that while we have our own shipyards, orders are placed abroad. Naturally enough, our yards cannot be ignored but rather than place the orders on the Continent, it would be better for them to be placed at home, and when I say &ldquo;home&rdquo;, I mean Belfast.  I hope the Government will grow up in this matter.</P>
      <P>Now that the Taoiseach has stated that he is prepared to meet Captain O'Neill, the Northern Ireland Prime Minister, I think that Captain O'Neill should be invited to Dublin.  The Minister referred to all the personalities who have come here and have been graciously received.  I notice that Mr. Henry Brooke, The British Home Secretary, is visiting Belfast today. We had a statement from the Taoiseach and the Minister on their return from London that Mr. Sandys proposes to come here for holidays this summer.  It is a good thing for this country, both north and south, to have British Ministers coming here and getting a better understanding of our problems.  Mr. Sandys, I am sure, will return with a very good impression of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to say that, because of lack of co-operation and friendliness, <Col N="1062" /> Ministers in the north, and of the British Government, have not a proper understanding of our difficulties and of our problems.  The big problem which exists is the question of our emigrants.  There are as many Irish-born people in London as there are in the province of Connacht and talks between Mr. Sandys, the Minister for External Affairs and the Taoiseach would be helpful in getting a degree of sympathy and understanding. When Mr. Brooke has finished his visit to Belfast, a request should be extended to him to visit Dublin.  I believe that Mr. Brooke is intimate with the many problems that affect Irish emigrants in Britain.  On occasion, I have corresponded with him about emigrants who found themselves in a serious plight, or in difficulties of one kind and another in Britain.  I have always found that Mr. Brooke, unlike the Ministers in the Republic, who refer matters of this kind to the Civil Service, dealt with the correspondence himself.  Not alone did he deal with it but he carried out personal investigations into the problems affecting the emigrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Brooke has an intimate knowledge of the many problems facing tens of thousands of our people who are living in bad housing conditions, who are sleeping out, or living in insanitary houses owned and maintained by coloured people.  We have thousands of people, particularly young girls, walking the streets in London, Bradford, Manchester, Coventry, Liverpool and Hull without any advice, guidance or assistence, away from friends, from religion and from their own people, in strange, hard surroundings and penniless, and some effort should be made to have talks with Mr. Brooke in this country on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister realise that we are spending £64,000 building a new embassy in Nigeria, and when I say a new embassy, I mean a palace, because for £64,000, it must be a palace.  My experience has been that it is difficult enough to get a labourer's cottage built <Col N="1063" /> for a man and his wife and five children but £64,000 can be spent on a palace in Nigeria.  There must be some special circumstances we have not heard of because any residence for a secretary and representative of this country could be provided with all the amenities and comforts that Nigeria can provide for £5,000.  It would be a generous provision at £10,000.  It would be of a very high standard at £20,000 but I cannot understand where £64,000 comes in and I want to hear the Minister giving us details as to the building being built in Nigeria for £64,000.</P>
    <P>Have there been difficulties in locating a site or have the Nigerian people held the Irish people up to ransom?  Who is getting the handover? I should like to get from the Minister full details about this and how it is proposed to spend £64,000 of the taxpayers' money on this palace. Would that £64,000 not go a long way towards providing hostels for our emigrants in London?  I know that our emigrants abroad are being catered for.  I know that His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin has taken a keen and personal interest in the welfare of our emigrants abroad and has sent from his diocese a number of Irish priests to London and elsewhere to look after them.  There are various county associations in London, Bradford and Liverpool catering for Irish people but they have no money.  They cannot work without money.</P>
    <P>When boys and girls leave this country, having been educated and maintained by their parents until the age of 15 or 20, does that mean that we are finished with them, that we have no further responsibility, that we do not need them any more, that we do not give two straws what happens to them, who provides for them, what their living conditions are?  We have not done anything about securing employment or decent living conditions for them or safeguarding their religion.  Are we ever going to do anything in regard to that?  Do we give two thrawneens about the tens of thousands who have emigrated?</P>
    <P>At one time the Government announced their intention to bring <Col N="1064" /> them all back to work at home.  The days are gone when that was the principal policy of Fianna Fáil.  Who is going to cater for our emigrants abroad?  We have not provided a penny in an effort to improve conditions for our emigrants.  Will we do something for them?  Will the Minister do anything about it during the coming financial year?  He must not intend doing so because there is no provision for it in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Would it not be a wise thing if the Minister for External Affairs were to go to London to see Mr. Brooke or were to invite Mr. Brooke to Dublin to discuss what can be done about our emigrants in Britain, particularly young Irish girls?  Does the Minister for External Affairs know of the extraordinary number of Irish girls, unmarried mothers, who are living in every city in England to-day, afraid to return home, ashamed to return home, who have no friends to help or advise them?</P>
    <P>This is a serious responsibility.  It is a situation in which our Minister cannot remain dumb and inactive.  It is not the responsibility of the British Government.  I venture to say that the British Government will co-operate if any move is made by the Minister to do something practical about this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs was one of the Ministers who went across to London recently with the Taoiseach.  There is no reference in the Minister's speech on this Estimate to what transpired.  Will the Minister tell us when he is replying what the talks were about?  Did Mr. Macmillan say anything?  I have never in all my life heard of the Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs going to London for consultations with the British Prime Minister and other Ministers and returning in a cloud of depression and silence.  As Deputy Dillon said <Col N="1065" /> last night, they must have been talking about something besides the weather.  What brought them over? Did they get anything by going over? Did the Minister for External Affairs know that the Danish Ministers were there the week before seeking markets and getting concessions from the British Government?  Our Minister for External Affairs went over to London and spent a few days in consultation with British Ministers and on his return has nothing to tell the Irish taxpayer and ratepayer who sent him over.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Estimate is the only opportunity Deputies have of asking the Minister were the talks strictly confidential.  Was he bound to secrecy by Mr. Macmillan as to what they were talking about?  Did they lose some of the concessions we had from Britain and are they afraid to tell the people?  Is that the position?  Judging by the sad and gloomy expressions on their faces as they left the aircraft, I have a feeling that the Danes or somebody else got in before them and that our Ministers got nothing.  Why the silence?  Why has there been no explanation?</P>
    <P>If the talks were a failure, tell the country that the talks were a failure. If our Ministers were bad negotiators, let them get out and let somebody else go over who will negotiate more satisfactorily. A great deal can be obtained if there is give and take on both sides and proper negotiation and bargaining. The Minister for External Affairs and the Taoiseach, in my opinion, are not good men to bargain and it is my view that these talks were a complete failure. There is no use in any Deputy saying that we on this side of the House are glad of the embarrassment caused to the Minister for External Affairs by the failure of these talks abroad.  We are not.  We are saddened if the talks have not been a success.  We should like to see the negotiations being successful.  The men who went to London were the best men Parliament can select in present conditions but we are not satisfied that they are the best men obtainable to lead a delegation from this country and to get the <Col N="1066" /> best possible bargain for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>A serious effort should be made to disperse the gloom created by the silence that has attended the return of the Ministers from London.  The Minister for External Affairs should get the permission of the Taoiseach as head of the Government to reveal to this House when he is replying to this debate the cause of the failure of the most recent talks with representatives of the British Government.  If the talks were not a failure, if our delegation had anything to boast of, they would have called a Press conference as soon as they had disembarked from the aircraft. If there is any bad news arising out of the meetings in London, let us hear it.  The Minister should not continue to deprive the House and the country of the full details of the discussions.</P>
    <P>Money is provided in the Book of Estimates for the upkeep of our embassies. We should send only the most highly qualified people to represent us abroad.  I have no doubt that we have a good tradition in that regard. Because of our close proximity to Britain, and the close economic links which we have, and must have, and should have to a greater extent, it is important that we should have our best and ablest ambassadors in Britain.  Mr. Dulanty was one of the greatest and finest ambassadors this country ever had.  He represented the Irish Government in trying and difficult times and laid the foundation of a very high standard of representation in Britain. That very high standard was maintained by Mr. Boland and Mr. McCann, and Mr. Cremin now has that difficult task.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government could not be represented by a more capable or efficient ambassador in Britain than Mr. Cremin.  He is a man of great ability who understands the problems of the British people in addition to the problems of his own country.  Instead of Mr. Cremin being handcuffed as our ambassador, there should be a clear-cut policy as to where we stand with Britain in regard to co-operation, markets and everything else.  I know <Col N="1067" /> that during his term of office he will be successful and that there will be a high degree of close co-operation to the advantage of this country.</P>
    <P>I wonder has the Minister ever considered that our embassies and legations and the offices of our High Commissioners should be used to increase our trade with the countries to which they are accredited?  That has been advocated by many Deputies.  It could be done by the appointment of various trade agents throughout Britain, through the office of Mr. Cremin, and with the approval and co-operation of the British Board of Trade, who would seek markets for our produce.  That would help our industrialists and business people.  Sub-offices should be established throughout Britain, under the control of what could be described as a trade director, to further the sales of Irish whiskey, Irish bacon, cheese and milk products.  Sub-offices should be set up in all the principal cities of Britain, under the control of Mr. Cremin, to deal with the problems of our emigrants, and a high-grade civil servant should be put in charge of those offices, and distressed Irish people with difficulties and problems should know exactly where the most convenient depot was.  They should be assisted financially, if necessary, and should be given advice about employment, housing, and the many other problems to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>We should have a number of specially trained people to sell our products in New York.  It is not very long since a well-known trader, a most successful New York businessman, came over here and, in the course of a conversation with Deputy MacEoin and me, lamented the fact that he could not get sufficient supplies of frozen fish, cheese and the products of Clover Meats for his ring of stores in Jackson Heights in New York.  He made representations to the Irish authorities in New York without success.  He said that the moment he put Irish products into the windows of his stores, there was an invasion and the goods were cleared as quickly as they were displayed.  This businessman, a native of Athlone, has been many years in America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> The same applies to the late Tim Costello whose bar was well known to the Irish in New York.  When he tried to get Irish whiskey for his string of saloons and bars, he could never succeed in doing so.  Is it not strange that we are trying to get markets for what we produce here and there are great contacts abroad trying to get our products, but there is a missing link somewhere?  The Minister could, and should, fill that gap, and see to it that not only in New York but in Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, and the other cities in the United States, we had trained men pushing the sales of our Irish products.  That would eventually be of advantage to our farmers, and especially to our dairy farmers.  It would be to the advantage of the Irish bacon industry, and to the advantage of the fish-processing plants in Killybegs and elsewhere.  There is a wonderful demand in America for our frozen fish products because of the attractive manner in which they are packaged and presented for sale.  That does not show any slackness on the part of those at home, but it does show slackness on the part of those abroad who are not doing enough to push their sales and to ensure that they are in plentiful supply when required.</P>
    <P>All our embassies abroad, in France, Spain, Ottawa, Lisbon, Berne, Stockholm, Brussels, The Hague, and Bonn should be able to play a part in pushing Irish products, but they are not equipped to do so.  The Minister should equip them.  Our exports could be increased five times over if we had the machinery abroad.  We have not the machinery or salesmanship abroad.  An effort should be made to see to it that these offices are used to press the sale of our products and something worthwhile in that regard should be done now.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the general outline of foreign policy and I feel it is time the Minister had consultations with himself in relation to his past and in the hope of improving his general conduct as Minister for External Affairs in the future.  We now have to face a modern world.  I know it is difficult for a Minister who was a Minister a quarter of a century ago to bring himself into line with the new <Col N="1069" /> times in which we are living but I hope this debate will give him food for thought in the general recasting of our foreign policy so that we can raise our status as a nation in the eyes of people abroad.</P>
    <P>We of the Opposition have no desire to be unduly critical of the Government or the Minister.  We would much prefer to be in a position to offer compliments if compliments were deserved, but as far as the Department of External Affairs is concerned, there is room for all-round improvement.  I hope the Minister will have a general overhaul of the policy of his Department with the aim of increasing the number of our friends abroad and reducing the number of those who are unfriendly to us.</P>

      <P>There is only one pleasant feature about this Estimate, that is, that it shows a reduction as compared with last year.  This year, there is a reduction of £550 but last year there was an increase of £93,000, so there is poor consolation for the taxpayer as far as expenditure in the Department of External Affairs is concerned. When the boot was on the other foot and, indeed, when the present Minister was in office previously, the question of Partition was constantly raised.  Many a young man was led to his grave over the Minister's solution to that problem.  Partition has now become a dirty word as far as this Estimate is concerned.  It is not even mentioned at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.  I do not know how they managed that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It used to arise on it very much but it does not arise on it very much now as far as Fianna Fáil policy is concerned.  It is about time to cry halt to our colossal expenditure on embassies in foreign countries.  I appreciate that we should have a decent embassy in Nigeria in keeping with the work of our missionaries in that country.  They have played an important part in bringing that country to the position where they can take over control, but I feel that the figure <Col N="1070" /> of £64,000 for an embassy there is too high.  It is about time we tightened our belts in foreign fields.  We are being called on to have a pay pause in this country and we are entitled to a lead from the top in that matter.</P>
      <P>Greater efforts should be made by our embassies to promote trade in foreign countries.  I should like to see greater return for the money spent on these embassies which should do more work in that direction rather than being in existence for prestige purposes alone.  I understand that an official of the London Embassy has been detailed to interest himself in Irish emigrants. That is not a question for an official only.  The problem is too great and is one that is being created by the Minister's Government as has been proved by the census returns.  I am sure that official could present a very fat file to the Minister regarding the needs of our emigrants in London, that he would be able to tell him that he himself could play a great part by interesting himself in the Irish centre in London and in giving financial help to it.  The Minister should have second thoughts on this matter and give some money from the Estimate for this great work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note under the heading of propaganda that we are exporting films.  The Department should take full advantage of this provision to promote our tourist industry.  If we had television films made, it would be easy to get countries to exhibit them.  This would play a great part in furthering tourism, our second most important industry. To add to that propaganda abroad, I should like to see a colour party of our troops in the Congo participate in the world's greatest St. Patrick's Day parade, that on Fifth Avenue in New York.  I feel sure the United States would be only too delighted to sponsor such participation so that the expense incurred would not fall on this Estimate. Apart from the pride it would give our emigrants, it would also help to remind the people of that great country of the important part played by our Irish troops in the preservation of world peace and it would be some recognition of the great work our troops are doing.  As well, it would help <Col N="1071" /> to take away from the American Government the nasty taste left in their mouth by the Minister's attitude in the United Nations on what I will call the China incident.  On St. Patrick's Day, 1961, I stood on the same platform as the Minister on Fifth Avenue and had the pleasure of seeing that most wonderful parade.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister of the cold shoulder his Department and the Department of Finance have turned to an appeal by pensioners in the United States.  Surely this is a problem that can be ironed out between the two Departments.  It would help to bring back to this country thousands of emigrants and hundreds of thousands of badly-needed dollars.  It would allow emigrants who through economic circumstances had to leave this country to come back here and spend the remainder of their days in places where their hearts have been for years.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of international law, I should like to know what part the Department of External Affairs are playing in bringing to justice the greatest criminal who ever hit these shores, Dr. Paul Singer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has ranged pretty widely during the past two days on all sorts of matters, some of which are not the direct responsibility of the Department of External Affairs.  I should like to deal, first of all, with Deputy Dillon's allegation of a change of policy in the United Nations on the matter of including China on the agenda for discussion.  I have been representing Ireland in the United Nations during the past six years. In each of those years, the question arose of whether the representation of China should be included for discussion on the agenda.  On each of those six occasions, I voted for the inclusion of that item.  In the first four of those six years, the representative of the United States voted against its inclusion, but in the past two years, that representative has voted for it.  It is interesting to note that, with all the Fine Gael propaganda about my being a Communist because I voted for the inclusion of China for discussion on the UN agenda, they have not uttered one word about the American delegation voting for its inclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <P>Many of the matters raised here were much further away from the work of the Department.  Not only did Fine Gael go around the country saying these things but they produced a pamphlet which they circulated at the by-election in Dublin. In it they again accused, by quoting a letter, the Irish delegation of &ldquo;championing the most barbaric system of slavery that the world records&rdquo;. <Col N="1074" /> We are alleged to have championed that system because at that time we had voted for the inclusion on the United Nations agenda of an item on the representation of China.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard Deputy Dillon's shadow Minister for External Affairs for two hours this morning.  He should now give the person who happens to be responsible for External affairs at the moment a chance.  We did not interrupt his shadow Minister once.</P>
      <P>I shall deal now with some of the things it was said I did not deal with in my opening remarks.  I thought I had made a very long and comprehensive speech but Deputies racked their brains to deal, not with what I said &mdash;nor did they criticise it to any extent&mdash;but with what I had not said. Deputy Dillon has for nearly 30 years been prophesying with every moon that Fianna Fáil are about to split.  I say 30 years because 31 years ago he voted Fianna Fáil into power.  He was one of the critical votes in the election of the Fianna Fáil Taoiseach but for the past 30 years at least every spring and every new moon, he tells us Fianna Fáil are about to collapse, about to split.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that Fianna Fáil have evolved a very strong system of collective responsibility as well as the division of administration.  The Taoiseach is and has been, as is right and natural, in charge of major constitutional matters such as joining the EEC.  I have no hesitation in saying that inside and outside the Cabinet, I have supported the Taoiseach in his application for membership of EEC. I did so not in the past six or 12 months: I have always been in favour of a European Community in which European countries would combine to run Europe in accordance with the principles of western civilisation and in which they could try to give an example to the rest of the world of how neighbours could live in peace and co-operate to develop their resources, thus helping not only themselves but others in greater need.  When at Strasbourg&mdash;in 1949, I think&mdash;we had the first announcement of the Coal-Steel Pact in which France and Germany participated I remember having the opportunity of welcoming that Pact on the floor of the Assembly, and I did so. I said I welcomed it although we were an importer of steel and I did not think <Col N="1076" /> the Pact would result in our having to pay less but possibly a little more but that, representing a country importing steel, I was prepared to pay a little bit more in order to see the French and German people getting together and using their steel for peaceful purposes rather than for weapons of war to hurl at each other.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly approve of the organisation of the European Community among the Six and, as I said last year at the conclusion of the debate when some similar sort of allegation was made, I thoroughly welcomed the Irish application to join the European Community. I recognise that if we were to join any such community, we should have to surrender as much sovereignty to that political entity as any other member surrendered.  Negotiations have collapsed for the moment and I do not think any useful purpose will be served by commenting on that situation at this stage, seeing that the Taoiseach dealt with it very comprehensively and it was discussed in the Dáil for a couple of days.  If I thought any words of mine could help to get negotiations going again and help them to succeed, I should gladly utter these words here or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to the fact that I had not spoken about the London talks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a debate for a couple of days on the London talks. The Taoiseach has said all that can be said on those talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What debates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a long series of question and answer.  It was on the Vote on Account that we had a long debate on this and kindred matters of trade with Britain and the expansion of trade.  Everything useful that can be said on them has already been said. If we were prophets, we might be able to say something useful in opening a debate on this subject, but we are not prophets and we have to await events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not the arbiters of European policy nor are we the arbiters of world policy.  As a small country, we have to be careful about how we approach <Col N="1077" /> situations in which there are high emotions.  I should prefer at this stage to leave the matter where the Taoiseach left it and to wait until we see developments in regard to the European Community.</P>
    <P>In regard to Partition, again, if I thought it would help matters or help towards the unity of Ireland to deal at length with the subject of Partition in my opening speech I should have done so.  I think that at this stage and in view of the recent changes, the most I should say is to reiterate what the Taoiseach said in answer to a question the other day in regard to cooperation with the Six Counties and to say, also, as the late Lord Craigavon said in 1937:</P>
    <P>In this island, we cannot live always separate from one another. We are too small to be apart or for the Border to be there for all time. The change will not be in my time but it will come.</P>
    <P>Let us hope that all concerned will realise the fundamental truth then expressed by the late Lord Craigavon and that they will work to bring about the change as rapidly as possible. When the change comes, it will redound to the prosperity of both parts of this small island.  It is too small to be apart.  If it were joined together, it would give a very much bigger market, to put it at no higher level, upon which to build an export trade.  An internal market is always useful for the development of exports.  It would lead to a free market and free social exchanges which would be very healthy for both parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne and other Deputies spoke at some length on our emigrants in Great Britain.  The fact is that it would be impossible for any Government to take as good care of our people who go to Britain as we could if they stayed at home.  It is not with our will that any emigrant leaves this country, even though we cannot provide for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at as high a standard of life as they can get in other countries for a time.  This Government are prepared to divide with them <Col N="1078" /> if they stay at home but if they go abroad in such numbers as they have gone to Britain, we cannot possibly provide for them there.  A lot of the Irish in various parts of Great Britain have been better off or think they are better off than people in Ireland.  I think it would be only right to ask them and to try to organise them to take reasonable care of their neighbours in the same town&mdash;and we have been doing that.  We have a special official on the job of organising these clubs throughout the country.  We take particular interest in how our emigrants are getting on.  We try to encourage the development of their associations.  I do not think we can do any more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a Comptroller and Auditor General.  We have to satisfy him that the money is being spent in accordance with the Vote. There is more to it, however, than that.  That, perhaps, could be got over by giving a grant-in-aid but there is the fact that there are many cities in Britain with Irish emigrants and there are many sections in each of the cities. I do not know how much we would need to give in order to meet the demand that would be created if there were Government funds here to draw on.  We know how difficult it is to resist demands here.  We know that if the Government provide a modest sum for a certain limited purpose, the demands grow that more money be provided for all kindred activities.  I think that instead of creating goodwill and a spirit of goodwill and self-reliance in the Irish communities in Britain, we would destroy the very good work being done at the present time by voluntary organisations at great sacrifice on the part of their members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Connolly Clubs are a very small group.  Russia is a very big country and the number of non-members exceeds the number of members of the Connolly Clubs by millions to one.  This is a small country, so the position is reversed. I do not believe it would be possible for us effectively to look after our Irish people in Britain from the cradle to the grave.  It cannot be done and an effort on the wrong lines to help them might lead to a diminution of the very fine work being done by the Irish people in these various cities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked for some indication as to what we were doing for underdeveloped countries by making officials available and Deputy Costello suggested we should have a peace corps in order to help these underdeveloped countries.  I regard the American peace corps as a very fine effort.  It is wonderful to see in this very modern age that young Americans are prepared to sacrifice a number of years, to go to these underdeveloped countries and live more or less on the same scale as the local people, while affording them the benefit of their skills and advice. However, the peace corps is, in effectiveness, very far behind the thousands of Irish missionaries, doctors, nuns and teachers who have gone abroad to underdeveloped countries for a century or more.  If we were thinking of training people for a peace corps, there is no better peace corps than the Irish priests, doctors, nuns and teachers who are already in these underdeveloped countries and giving very good service, for very poor reward in most cases.</P>
      <P>We have offered to these various underdeveloped countries what assistance we can.  The FAO asked us to take an interest in one country, Tanganyika.  The Deputies will remember that the Red Cross raised £73,000 for the war against want. The FAO assigned to Ireland the country of Tanganyika to give special assistance to it and that we propose to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Nigeria alone there are something like 1,500 Irish men and women <Col N="1080" /> teaching and helping the Nigerian people.  That is a vast number of people for a small country like Ireland to have in one country alone. It was the biggest number of Irish at that sort of work in a single country in Africa and we felt we should open diplomatic relations with Nigeria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Lagos was a fairly large city a few years ago but it was not equipped at all with housing or other facilities to deal with the sudden explosion of diplomatic representatives who entered the country and we had the greatest difficulty in finding anything for letting. After some months by some lucky chance, we were able to get a house that was vacated by somebody who had been retired home and we decided to build.  Generally speaking, I have always believed we should own these houses.  You pay very high rents for suitable houses and at the end of ten years, you are just were you started, and ten years' rent would, I am sure, in most cases more than build an equivalent house.  We had that experience in Paris and in London.  When we are talking about big houses and big embassies, the Deputy should remember that the highest price ever paid for an embassy was paid when he was Minister for Agriculture in a certain Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had responsibility for government, it might not be £64,000 but £164,000 he would spend.  He objects to expenditure when he is out of office but I am saying that when he was in office, he spent more money on one embassy than was ever spent before.  However, we have to house our embassies in a suitable manner and suitability is related to what other embassies have in the same area.  I am sure a number of ambassadors would like to live in very small and comfortable houses but that is not the type of house in which they can carry out their duties as representatives of Ireland.  It must be spacious and be properly furnished, and so on, in order that they may represent Ireland reasonably well, not with any great display but at least with taste and dignity.  I do not think we have aimed at any more than that.  Our expenses in regard to housing our embassies abroad is very small indeed compared with that of a lot of countries very little bigger than we are, and some of them very much worse off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree we should keep our embassy buildings as modest as possible, but they should be good and nice.  They should be houses visitors would be glad to come to.  In Lagos, there was this situation of dire lack of suitable houses.  We got one for the moment.  This £64,000 is a shot by the Board of Works at what two houses would cost <Col N="1082" /> on the only suitable site available. Not only are houses scarce in Lagos, but sites in suitable areas are very scarce and dear.  I want to deal with what we were trying to do for underdeveloped countries by sending experts to them.</P>

      <P>Last year, a number of Irish professional experts were sent under the technical assistance programme of the specialised agencies to the following countries: Colombia, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Jordan, Burma, United Arab Republic and Somalia. In addition, there are probably a dozen professional people working under the technical assistance programme of the specialised agencies of the United Nations&mdash;doctors and nurses under the World Health Organisation and agricultural experts under the Food and Agriculture Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time, we have been receiving applications for training <Col N="1083" /> facilities here for people from countries in the course of development.  In the past year, there were four Congolese officials undergoing training in the meteorological section at Shannon. We had an Iraqi in the housing section of the Department of Local Government and for one or two years past we have had an African in the Attorney-General's office.  We have told a number of countries: &ldquo;We cannot do as we would like to do&mdash;offer special scholarships to all and sundry in Africa in order to take out a primary degree, but there is one facility we can give at reasonable expense to us which would be very valuable for you, that is, if you send along men with a university degree or a certain level of experience in administration, we will try to fit them in here by putting them through a Government Department or through one of our State bodies.&rdquo;  That invitation is open, and a number of countries are interested in it.</P>
    <P>However, under various organisations they have open to them scholarships which, up to the present, seem to be more attractive.  I know from talking to a number of the representatives of these African countries that they are coming to realise more and more the importance of good administration and good business management. I pointed out that we could offer good training in both those fields to men who were equipped educationally or through experience to absorb what we could give them.</P>

      <P>It is&mdash;agricultural experts.  We did lend a parliamentary draftsman to Ghana.  He is back, but a former Irish civil servant is now filling the same position.  That is a private arrangement between himself and the Government; we did not come into it.  We are willing to give what help we can, but we are limited.  The type of help we offer is the type of help most needed by some of these countries and the type we can give at least expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the <Col N="1084" /> question of territorial waters and suggested we should make an effort again to get an agreement to extend our fishery limits by bilateral agreements. We have been doing our best to try to get a renewal of negotiations for international multilateral agreements instead of bilateral agreements. In our circumstances, bilateral agreements are not desirable.  It would be better for us if we could get a group of nations, either here in Europe or in the eastern Atlantic, to come together and make an agreement as to what the limits of our territorial waters and fisheries would be.</P>
    <P>We have been pursuing that.  From time to time, our hopes have been raised; the prospects look a bit more promising, and then they fade away. I am not unhopeful, however, of making some progress towards a multilateral general agreement between a group of nations in the eastern Atlantic or in both the eastern and western Atlantic.  If there is any chance of achieving that end, it is better for us to wait rather than push out our territorial waters, claiming the right to exclude people from a greater area of the sea.  We have not only to catch fish but we have to sell them after the event and I should like to see, when we extend our territorial waters, our fishing limits, that it would secure as wide an acceptance as possible.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £8,582,600 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and of certain other Services administered by that Office, and for payment of Grants in Aid.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate of £13,503,600 for my Department is shown in the Estimates volume as approximately £582,000 greater than last year's. When, however, the recent Supplementary Estimate of £133,000 is taken into account, the actual increase is approximately £449,000, and of that amount £62,000 is in respect of licence fee revenue payable to Radio Éireann.  Accordingly, the net increase for the services directly provided by my Department is £387,000, and that is attributable mainly to the continuing expansion of the telephone service.</P>
      <P>The subheads with substantial variations are:&mdash;subhead A&mdash;salaries, wages and allowances&mdash;where the increase over 1962/63, including £132,700 in the Supplementary Estimate, is £162,000.  It is mainly for additional staff and overtime for telephone construction and maintenance work, and for additional telephonists.  On the postal side extra provision is necessary also partly because of the shorter working week for postmen, and partly because of the growth of delivery work in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase over 1962/63 for subhead C&mdash;Accommodation and Building Charges&mdash;including £16,700 in the Supplementary Estimate, is £155,500, and it is due principally to the building works forming part of the expanded telephone development <Col N="1086" /> programme.  Provision is also made for heavier consumption of electricity. Incidentally, some charges, amounting to approximately £10,000, connected with the radio services at airports, which were formerly borne on this subhead, have been transferred to the Vote for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>The increase over 1962-63 for subhead F &mdash; Engineering Stores and Equipment, including £116,600 in the Supplementary Estimate, is £628,000. The major portion of the increase is to meet the requirements of the expanded telephone development programme, both for the direct purchase of stores and for payments to contractors.  In regard to subhead G &mdash; Telephone Capital Repayments &mdash; continuing heavy investment in the development of the telephone service is responsible for the increase of £251,000 in the annuities for the repayment of the capital advanced.</P>
    <P>Subhead K1&mdash;Grant Equivalent to Net Receipts from Broadcasting Licence Fees (Grant-in-Aid)&mdash;showing an increase of £140,000, transfers to Radio Éireann the net revenue from television and sound licences.</P>
    <P>The amount of £71,600 for subhead K2&mdash;Additional Grant Under Section 22 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 (Grant-in-Aid)&mdash; is the full amount remaining out of the subsidy of £500,000 permissible under the Act.  Under subhead T&mdash; Appropriations in Aid&mdash;the increase over 1962-63, allowing for the additional £196,000 provided in the Supplementary Estimate, is approximately £868,000.  Recovery from Telephone Capital funds in respect of the enlarged telephone development programme is mainly responsible.</P>
    <P>The volume of letter traffic in 1962 was about the same as in the previous year but there was a reduction of approximately 3½ per cent in parcel traffic.  Within this general picture, there were some considerable increases under particular headings mostly on the foreign side; for example, outgoing letter mail to Europe increased by 12 per cent, second class air mail (that is, printed papers, newspapers, etc.) to overseas destinations by 50 per cent and outgoing air mail parcels by 23 <Col N="1087" /> per cent.  It will be noted that these increases were all in airborne traffic.</P>
    <P>During the year a direct night air mail service from Dublin to London was brought into operation to supplement the Dublin-Manchester service. In addition, eleven extra direct despatches of air mail to European cities&mdash;nine from Shannon Airport and two from Dublin&mdash;were introduced. The public response to the &ldquo;Post Early&rdquo; campaign before Christmas was good and although traffic again reached a record level it was disposed of satisfactorily.  I am glad to report a continuing increase in the use of postal address numbers on items delivered in the Dublin area.  Over 57 per cent of such items now bear postal numbers.</P>
    <P>A special &ldquo;Europa&rdquo; postage stamp was issued in September, 1962, simultaneously with other members of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations. Another special stamp has been put on sale during the past month to further the &ldquo;Freedom from Hunger Campaign&rdquo; organised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.  In September next there will be a further &ldquo;Europa&rdquo; stamp issue.</P>
    <P>There was a further decrease in the number of telegrams dealt with during the year.  In all, the estimated number of telegrams handled was 1,682,000&mdash; a decline of over 5 per cent on the number for 1962/63 as compared with last year's decline of one per cent. It occurred mostly in traffic with Great Britain and to a lesser extent in internal traffic.  With the development of other forms of communication it is only to be expected that this decline will continue.</P>
    <P>The telex service continues to expand and the receipts from telex subscribers now constitutes one-fifth of the total telegraph revenue.  There are now 189 subscribers' installations as compared with 157 last year.  During the year internal telex calls amounted to 143,000 &mdash;an increase of 12 per cent while calls to Great Britain also increased by the same percentage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> During the year the number of countries with which we have telex service was increased by nine, making 71 countries in all.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the conversion of the telex system to automatic working. Owing to delays in the delivery of the necessary equipment it now looks as if it may not be possible to make the change until about the end of the year. When the change is made the service will be particularly attractive, as subscribers will be able to dial calls not only to other Irish subscribers but also to subscribers in Great Britain and other countries which have an automatic network.  It is intended that, as in the case of telephone trunk calls dialled direct by subscribers, such calls will not be subject to the three minute minimum charge which at present applies to calls obtained through a Post Office operator.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the loss on the combined telegraph and telex services in the year 1962/63 will be of the order of £185,000 or about £10,000 less than in 1961/62.</P>
    <P>The telephone service continued to expand in 1962.  Call traffic was greater, by about 6½ million local and trunk calls, than in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The trunk network was extended substantially, a further 13,000 miles of circuits being added.  The additional circuits were provided mostly in underground and aerial cables and in the form of microwave radio circuits.</P>
    <P>Approximately 14,800 new subscribers' exchange lines were installed; nine new automatic exchanges were opened; the equipment at 152 exchanges was extended and 69 extra telephone kiosks were provided.</P>
    <P>The subscriber trunk dialling facility was extended to a further 25 exchanges, and it is now available to about 70 per cent of all subscribers in the country.  It is intended to introduce subscriber trunk dialling at most of the remaining automatic exchanges within the next year or two.</P>
    <P>The continued increase in call traffic made it necessary to devote a high proportion of our resources to the expansion of the trunk system.  During the year additional circuits were provided <Col N="1089" /> on the Sligo-Donegal and Galway-Athlone radio link systems and new circuits will be brought into service shortly on the Dublin-Arklow and Waterford-Wexford systems.  A radio link between Tralee and Limerick is expected to provide circuits by next summer and a radio link connecting Limerick and Athlone is in course of installation.</P>
    <P>The capacity of the main coaxial cables is being substantially increased and many main underground cabling schemes are in progress or have been approved for execution.  At the same time aerial cable and carrier systems are being employed more extensively to provide additional circuits.  Almost a thousand miles of open-wire circuits were provided on various minor routes.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that it would be possible to record substantial progress during the year in the conversion of telephone exchanges to automatic working.  Equipment for a large number of exchanges is on hand and the work of installation is well advanced, but the programme has been seriously retarded by unexpected difficulties and &ldquo;teething troubles&rdquo;.  Only a few of these exchanges have actually been converted and a satisfactory standard of working has not yet been attained at them.  No effort is being spared to eliminate the difficulties that have been met, but until full success has been achieved it is not possible to give a reliable forecast about the introduction of automatic working at other exchanges.</P>
    <P>A direct transatlantic telephone link between Dublin and New York was opened during the year and effected a welcome improvement in the speed of the service.  We are hopeful of being able to obtain additional direct circuits during the year to cater for the increasing demand on this route.</P>
    <P>Twelve additional circuits to Great Britain have been arranged for and will be in service shortly.  A further 36 will be in operation late this year or early next year, and a further 48 will it is hoped, be provided in 1964.</P>
    <P>Despite the necessary concentration on trunk and exchange development, a small increase was achieved over the previous year in the installation of new <Col N="1090" /> telephones.  The number of connections made, however, fell short of demand which has grown spectacularly in recent years.  There is a fairly long waiting list and, although arrangements have been made to instal a record number of telephones this year, it is clear that a back log of waiting applications will be a feature of the situation for some time to come.</P>
    <P>This aspect of the position should not, however, be permitted to obscure the general picture which is one of progressive achievement.  The number of exchange lines has been doubled in the past ten years and quadrupled since the end of the war, the mileage of trunk circuits has been greatly increased and the automatic system has been extended to 75 per cent of all subscribers in the country.  During practically all of this period of development, expenditure has been kept within revenue and the charges for the service have been among the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>The picture that I have given of a growing service is, of course, reflected in a considerable increase in the capital requirements of the telephone service. Large scale expenditure on big trunk and exchange development schemes will involve greater capital investment.  In fact the capital provision for 1963/64 amounts to £4½ million which is almost three times the amount expended four years ago.</P>
    <P>The £10 million capital expenditure authorised in the Telephone Capital Act, 1960, will soon be exhausted.  It will be necessary therefore to introduce a new Telephone Capital Bill later in the year.</P>
    <P>Business in the Post Office Savings Bank continues to increase.  Deposits during 1962 amounted to £21.2 million, and withdrawals to £17.8 million.  At 31st December, the total balance, including interest, due to depositors was approximately £97.2 million as compared with £91.5 million at the end of the previous year.  It should pass the £100 million mark this year.</P>
    <P>Deposits and withdrawals by the Trustee Savings Banks during the year amounted to approximately £1.4 million and £0.5 million respectively, and the total amount, including interest, to <Col N="1091" /> the credit of the Trustee Banks at the end of the year was £17.4 million, an increase of £1.4 million over the previous year.</P>
    <P>Sales of Savings Certificates during 1962 amounted to £3.7 million, and repayments, including interest, to £2.9 million.  At 31st December, 1962, the value of principal remaining invested was £28.1 million, an increase of £1.4 million during the year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, Post Offices throughout the country continued to co-operate in the issue of Prize Bonds and approximately £9 million of the £30 million of Prize Bonds issued up to this year were collected through Post Offices.  About £1 million was withdrawn from the Savings Bank or from Savings Certificates for re-investment in other Government securities.</P>
    <P>I should like once again to bring to your notice and to record my appreciation of the excellent work performed in the cause of National Savings by the members of the Savings Committee.</P>
    <P>The Department's services for the transfer of funds continue to be widely used.  The total value of Money Orders and Postal Orders issued during 1962 amounted to £23.8 million, an increase of £1.2 million over the preceding year. The increasing use by the public of higher value money orders and postal orders is indicated by the fact that the number of orders issued dropped by 300,000 to 10 million.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare and other agency payments totalled £31 million, an increase of £1.5 million on the preceding year.</P>
    <P>During 1962, four new automatic telephone exchanges were erected. Major building schemes at Carrick-on-Shannon and Sligo Post Offices were completed, improved Public Offices were provided at Killarney, Longford and Wexford, and adaptations were carried out at Waterford Post Office. Work was under way on the building of twelve other automatic exchanges, on the provision of new Post Offices at Ballinasloe, Wicklow and Youghal, on the erection of a new district sorting office at Finglas, and on major improvements to Ennis and Limerick Post Offices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> This year the building of a new trunk exchange for Dublin has already commenced and during the remainder of the year a start is expected to be made on four new automatic exchanges, on a new district sorting office at Raheny and on improvements to Arklow and Mullingar Post Offices.</P>
    <P>As regards the new central sorting office for Dublin, the foundation and steel erection works were somewhat delayed by unexpected water-level difficulties and by the bad weather.  The work is, however, now progressing satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides for a total staff of 17,446, an increase of 380 on last year's figure.  The addition is made up mainly of engineering workmen required to implement the larger telephone development programme and operating staff required to cater for the growing volume of telephone calls. The increase in the Department's salary and wages bill is attributable to the cost of the extra staff, to increases in remuneration granted during the past year and to additional costs arising out of the shorter working week for postmen.</P>
    <P>The Department as one of the largest employers of labour in the country is keenly conscious of the vital need of keeping abreast of developments in modern management techniques, and various members of the staff attended courses during the past year in management, work study and similar techniques conducted by the Irish Management Institute and other bodies working in these fields.</P>
    <P>A conference between headquarters officials and postmasters will be held in May.  These conferences which are held every few years, cover the whole range of post office services and are a means of maintaining and strengthening the essential link between headquarters and the local managers in the field.</P>
    <P>In thanking the staff for the work of the past year, I must make special reference to the prolonged spell of severe weather we had after Christmas: the postal and telephone services were kept going through all that time in almost every area and where a service was interrupted it was quickly <Col N="1093" /> restored.  For that achievement I should like to thank publicly all those who by their zeal and initiative overcame all the difficulties of snow and ice.  And I should like to include in these words of thanks the local staffs of CIE and the drivers of our mail contract services who worked side by side with Post Office staffs.  I am sure all Deputies join with me in this appreciation of work well done.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that pay increases together with reduction in weekly hours of work conceded to various grades, had added over £1 million to the Department's wages bill.  As the recent Supplementary Estimate indicated, further increases since then have added something of the order of £100,000 a year.  Labour costs are, of course, the dominating factor in the Department's expenditure. Approximately 60 per cent. of expenditure is for salaries, wages and such related matters as travelling expenses and superannuation.  In addition, labour costs affect significantly the charges to us for the conveyance of mails, for the supply of electricity, for large-scale construction works by outside contractors, such as buildings, the installation of automatic telephone exchanges, or the laying of underground cables.</P>
    <P>In Appendix E, Deputies will see a summary of the trading results in recent years of the Department's business on a commercial accounting basis.  That is to say, all income and expenditure, whether in cash or notional, as in the case of services rendered to or by other Government Departments, have been taken into account and provision made for such matters as superannuation liability and depreciation on plant.  In 1961-62 the Department just broke even.  At the moment I cannot say with certainty what the results for 1962-63 will be, but the indications are that, in spite of the increased postal and telephone charges, the surplus, over the services as a whole, will be the relatively very small one of approximately £100,000. That will be substantially less than in the years immediately prior to 1961-62, and the surpluses in these years were in themselves inadequate to provide <Col N="1094" /> for contingencies and to offset losses in bad years.</P>
    <P>However, it is a bit soon to make up one's mind about our financial position; experience of the working of the services up to the end of the calendar year will provide a more reliable indication of the way we are going.  There is general acceptance of the Department's position as a trading organisation engaged in giving a nation-wide service to the public and expected to pay its way, overall, in doing so.  In agreement with the Minister for Finance, I have decided recently on certain administrative measures which will place the Post Office commercial accounts on a more realistic basis and will recognise the special position of the Department to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, as Deputies know, the practice has been that while other Government Departments paid in cash for telegraph and telephone services no money passed in respect of postal services or in respect of a wide variety of agency services which, as shown in Appendix B on page 249 of the Volume of Estimates, have an estimated value of £909,000 in 1963-64. Similarly, other Government Departments render services to the Post Office to an estimated value of £445,000. Although credit is taken and given in the Department's commercial accounts for these various services which are not paid for, there has been an air of unreality about the figures, which must persist so long as no real transfer of funds takes place.  The changeover to a cash basis for all services&mdash; which cannot be made effective until 1964-65 as Departments will have to make appropriate provision in their Estimates&mdash;will give greater reality to the transactions, will place the accounts on a surer footing, and will encourage both my Department and other Departments to examine the services concerned to see if they can be used more economically and more efficiently.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has agreed that, in future, profits on the Department's services will notionally be carried to a special reserve account and that in considering annually the Department's proposals for expenditure&mdash;particularly <Col N="1095" /> capital expenditure &mdash;he will bear in mind the amounts to credit of this account as well as the total of depreciation provisions made in the Department's accounts. The Minister for Finance has agreed also to widen the powers delegated to the Post Office in a number of administrative matters, with the general object of enabling the Post Office to act more freely and to cultivate a more commercial approach in the conduct of its services.  When experience of these changes has been gained the general position will be re-examined with a view to seeing whether any more radical changes in the Department's status would be warranted.</P>
    <P>Under the Broadcasting Authority Act, the Authority has been given the maximum freedom in regard to broadcasting and television programmes and ordinary day-to-day administration.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to report in detail on the Authority's activities during the past year.  Instead I shall comment only on the main developments and on matters in which I have a specific function under the Broadcasting Authority Act and the Wireless Telegraphy Act.</P>
    <P>Out of each £4 licence, £1 is intended for the sound broadcasting service. After deducting the costs of collection, a total of about £514,600 is being provided for sound broadcasting under both Subheads K1 and K2.  This amount plus sound advertising income will not be sufficient to meet the expenditure on that service in 1963-64 and the question of increasing the licence fee will have to be considered during the year.  The television element of the grant in respect of the net receipts from combined licences amounts to about £572,000.</P>
    <P>The Government decided when the television service was being established that it should be operated without ultimate cost to the Exchequer.  When the Broadcasting Authority Bill was being considered, it was felt that the television service would probably not begin to pay its way until the third year of operation.  I am happy to say, however, that the Authority expects that in 1962-63&mdash;the first full year of operation&mdash;Telefís <Col N="1096" /> Éireann will break about even.  Of course 1962-63 is not a representative year as none of the provincial transmitters was in operation for the first eight months.  Nevertheless, the results are definitely encouraging.</P>
    <P>Now that it has been shown that a television service can be provided without an annual subsidy from the Exchequer, the Authority will no doubt be under pressure to improve that service in various ways.  In particular there will be a demand for more and better home-originated programmes. The more ambitious types of home programmes are, however, very expensive.  Moreover, the Authority's expenditure in the coming year will be greater than in 1962/63 because, apart from the operating costs of the provincial transmitters for a full year, it will have to meet higher charges by way of interest and depreciation as its capital construction programme nears completion.  It is problematical, therefore, whether any worthwhile improvements in programmes can be afforded during 1963-64 out of Telefís Éireann's income from advertisements and the television element of the £4 combined licence fee.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the Authority's main concern was to extend the television service to the whole country as quickly as possible.  It had hoped that the provincial transmitters at Truskmore, Mount Leinster, Mullaghanish and Maghera would all be in full operation before the end of 1962.  Unforeseen delays and difficulties prevented this and the recent appalling weather has caused further delay.  At the present time the only provincial mast which has been completed is that at Truskmore.  Nevertheless television transmissions have been made since 23rd December, 1962 from Mount Leinster, Mullaghanish and Truskmore and since 10th February from Maghera.  None of these stations is yet operating on full power and temporary masts are being utilised at Mount Leinster, Mullaghanish and Maghera.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising in the circumstances that reception over the country generally is patchy.  The Authority is pushing ahead with all possible speed <Col N="1097" /> and it is expected that by the summer the four provincial stations will be operating on full power from permanent masts.  This should lead to a considerable improvement in some areas and the Authority will then consider what further steps are necessary in areas where reception is still poor.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the national television service will be on 625 lines but Kippure and Truskmore will broadcast also on 405 lines for many years.  The Kippure station has been transmitting on both systems since 1st July, 1962.  The present transmissions from Truskmore are on 405 lines only but 625 line transmissions from there will commence later this year.  I should perhaps again impress on prospective purchasers of sets outside the normal service areas of Kippure and Truskmore that they should satisfy themselves regarding the quality of reception before purchasing 405 line receivers.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the Authority's main objective during the past year was to extend the television service to all parts of the country as quickly as possible.  The capital costs of providing the national television service were higher than anticipated when the Broadcasting Authority Bill was under consideration and advances to Radio Éireann are approaching the limit of two million pounds set by Section 23 of the Act.  Accordingly consideration will have to be given to the introduction of legislation to increase this limit during the forthcoming year.</P>
    <P>It should interest Deputies to know that the Authority joined Eurovision on a provisional basis in the middle of last year and has signified its wish to continue participation during the present year.  The position will be reviewed in the light of the experience gained.  In the absence of a direct link the Eurovision programmes in which the Authority participated were brought to the transmitter via the BBC. In all six were transmitted from Kippure, namely, the Easter Message of His Holiness, the opening of the Ecumenical Council on 11th October and four broadcasts from the European Championships Games in Belgrade. <Col N="1098" /> In addition there were of course the Telstar broadcasts which were inter-continental exchanges of television programmes, whereas Eurovision is concerned with programme exchanges between European Countries.</P>
    <P>I have had many complaints regarding the interference caused to the reception of programmes by various types of electrical equipment.  As the House is aware, all powers appropriate for the investigation and detection of interference with wireless telegraphy receiving apparatus have been conferred upon Radio Éireann.  Draft regulations to control undue interference caused by electric motors were published and made available to the public up to June 9th last.  My Advisory Committee has since considered amendments to the draft which had been suggested.  It is my intention within the next few months to make regulations which I trust will result in reducing this major source of interference.  I also propose to publish about the same time a draft of regulations to control interference caused by ignition equipment.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory to know that the publication of the draft regulations regarding electric motors has prompted inquiries from members of the trade and is an indication that they are taking steps to conform with requirements.</P>
    <P>So far as reception from the BBC and UTV is concerned, the relative weakness of the signals makes satisfactory reception difficult.  It would be altogether unreasonable to expect that electrical apparatus would be suppressed to such a degree that no interference would be caused to reception from distant television or radio stations because the cost would be prohibitive. Accordingly, the observance of the interference limits which will be prescribed by regulation will not ensure satisfactory reception of foreign programmes. This is a factor which the viewer may be slow to accept.</P>
    <P>I have heard many complaints regarding undue interference caused to radio reception by television receivers and I am having this question studied. It is possible that the solution may lie more in the establishing of a code of <Col N="1099" /> practice for television set manufacturers rather than in the introduction of statutory regulations.</P>
    <P>No permanent change was made during the year in the hours authorised for television and sound broadcasting or in the limits fixed for the broadcasting of advertisements.  These matters are subject to review from time to time.</P>
    <P>During the year, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, I approved the terms of the Radio Éireann Superannuation Scheme which was submitted to me by the Authority under Section 15 of the Act.  The scheme which is a contributory one applies to practically all of the Authority's staff, including former civil servants who transferred to the service of the Authority.  The benefits available under the scheme are similar to the superannuation privileges of established civil servants.  Copies of the scheme have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I was happy to give my consent to the appointment by the Authority of Mr. Kevin C. McCourt as DirectorGeneral as from 1st January, 1963, in place of Mr. Edward J. Roth who resigned to take up a television post in London.  I know that Mr. McCourt brings to the Authority qualities of the highest order and that he can be relied upon to develop and consolidate the good work already done.  I feel sure that Deputies will join with me in wishing him every success in the difficult task he has undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to join with the Minister in congratulating the Post Office staff in general on keeping the service going during the very severe weather we had since Christmas.  No doubt, it was very hard to make postal deliveries during that period but I have heard no complaints of people not getting a reasonable service.  The members of the Post Office staffs, especially in the country areas, deserve our congratulations for the very good service <Col N="1100" /> they gave in that difficult period.  It just shows the personal interest they take in the work they have been assigned to.</P>
    <P>I am very glad, as I feel sure everybody else is, that the Minister has not announced any increased charges for the Post Office services this year.  Last year, the price of the postage stamp was increased from 3d. to 4d. and we must remember that that increase is being carried into this and future years &mdash;at least we have not been told there is any hope of a reduction.  The same applies to telephone charges, which were increased last year by £1 10s. per annum.</P>
    <P>What the Minister and the Department should aim at is to expand business in order to obviate the necessity for future increases in charges. This is a quasi-commercial undertaking and in every business the general policy at the moment is to expand services and sales.  I would advise the Minister to make that one of the principal objects of his Department during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with the telephone service and it is in relation to that service that I have moved the Estimate be referred back.  People all over the country are complaining, and Deputies from all sides of the House, myself included, have been plaguing the Minister during the year.  His is one of the Departments I have to write to every week or fortnight on behalf of people complaining that though they made application for telephones months ago, there are no prospects of getting the service installed.</P>
    <P>If we look through the accounts of the Post Office, we see that in respect of the telephone service, there was a surplus last year of exactly £1,880,000. Surely such a state of affairs should be an encouragement to expand still further, to keep abreast of modern developments which make the use of the telephone almost a necessity.  Many years ago in my father's business a telephone was installed but it was found that as there were practically no other subscribers in the area, its installation was a mistake.  It was removed.  As I have said, that was a long number of years ago and things <Col N="1101" /> have moved forward considerably since and nowadays the service is essential.  In agriculture, particularly, with the introduction of mechanisation on farms and the general development of the industry, the need for quick communication is very evident.  If machinery breaks down during the harvest, the telephone is a great help which people appreciate.</P>
    <P>Those are the reasons why I say there is a great need for expansion here.  I had thought the Minister would announce a much larger number of extra subscribers than the figure of 14,800 he gave.  Two years ago, he set his target at 15,000 and I thought that figure would have been passed twice over since.  In the first month of 1960, the number of new phones installed was 1,200.  I wonder why the Minister does not take a page from the book of the ESB in this matter. They never have 10,000 or 12,000 people on their books waiting for connections because they plan five years ahead.  The result is they are always anxious and waiting for new business.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that when the ESB sought a loan last year, it was very quickly over-subscribed because people knew the service the ESB were giving and were prepared to put money into an expanding business.  In this matter of expanding the telephone service, would the Minister not look for money elsewhere than from the Government?  He says he is putting £4,500,000 into the telephone service this year.  Surely if he is getting a reasonable return for the money, there is no reason why this should not be done.  Not only would he be facilitating people who have long been awaiting the telephone but he would be giving more employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us the staff of the Section had increased during the year by 380.  We can remember seven years ago when the then Minister for Finance advised a reduction rather than an increase in the Civil Service, though that should not involve any loss of remuneration for existing civil servants.  Even considering that, I warmly welcome this increase in the Minister's staff since it indicates an <Col N="1102" /> expansion of a very necessary service. Further expansion would bring still further employment, particularly in country districts where it is so badly needed.  Apart from paying its way, the Post Office has a social obligation to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>Application was made to the Minister for a kiosk in a small village in my county.  It was refused on the basis that it would not pay.  I had supported that application and asked the Minister to provide the kiosk because I felt that in that area there were very few telephones and the people were entitled to these services.  The attitude of the county councils has changed in such matters and they now provide lights in all the small villages.  It would be a good thing if the Minister and the Government would provide telephone services.  I heard the Minister say in reply to Deputy Sweetman that he would think of providing an express letter service from Cork, even though it would involve a loss.  If the Minister is prepared to lose on that service, why is he not prepared to suffer a small loss in providing telephones in small villages?  It is on the basis of the telephone service that I refer this Vote back for reconsideration.</P>
    <P>While postmen generally are all right, I should like to bring the position of auxiliary postmen to the Minister's attention.  Two years ago, the Minister announced that an agreement had been reached with the auxiliary postmen that threequarters of a week's pay would be given to them for each year of service.  That was very good because up to that time even if a man served 30 or 40 years, he got nothing.  I had hoped that the Minister, as time went on, would increase the amount from threequarters of a week's pay for each year to one week's pay for each year of service.  It would provide a useful lump sum when men are retiring and might encourage some men who are very hard-pressed to give up their services.</P>
    <P>Recently we had questions here about the appointment of auxiliary postmen and several Deputies pointed out this was done on a political basis and that the Minister made these appointments direct.  As the Taoiseach <Col N="1103" /> said recently in reference to elections, the people have grown up and become mature.  It is high time the Post Office became mature.  These postmen work 20 to 40 hours per week and the Minister should leave their appointment to somebody else.  One might as well say that if the Minister for Local Government sanctions a relief scheme which will employ 20 men, each county should submit 20 or 30 or 40 names from the employment exchanges to the Minister for his sanctioning the employment of 20.  I have no doubt the Deputies did not complain without good reason.  It is a terrible thing to see a married man who has been doing temporary duty while an auxiliary postman was absent and doing the job for years, and eventually when the auxiliary man retires, instead of taking on the married man who had been doing temporary work, a single man&mdash; very often&mdash;or some other man is taken on instead.</P>
    <P>I had a case in my county not so far outside the town where a man was appointed as auxiliary postman.  Apparently he was the only one in the exchange recommended by a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  I did not recommend him but apparently it was discovered after his appointment that his father or somebody in his family was a Fine Gael supporter.  The result was that although this man had been measured for a uniform, he was told he should re-apply for the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the first I heard of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I get many letters from Deputies.  I do not remember all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest the Minister should.  I am only stating the <Col N="1104" /> fact that I did write.  The result was that this married man who had been appointed and had carried on the job for two or three months was told to re-apply.  He did so, but inevitably, some single boy in the area was appointed and the married man told he was no longer required.  We should grow up.  I have respect for the Minister and for any Minister of State but is this procedure raising the status of Ministers in the eyes of the people?  I suggest that the proper course would be to leave these appointments to the postmasters.  If there is any fault in the service, the postmasters will be accountable.</P>
      <P>If the Minister adopted that suggestion, he would be doing a good day's work and creating more respect for the office of Minister.  How can the ordinary person have respect for Ministers, whatever Government are in office, when he hears of these things happening?  It lowers the status of Ministers to have that sort of thing going on.  I do not believe it will affect the next election one way or another whether the Minister appoints more auxiliary postmen or not.</P>
      <P>The position of subpostmasters has also come to my attention.  The Minister promised last year that they would have arbitration&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Minister's speech very recently and I think that Deputy Norton congratulated him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I definitely said that the Government had decided that class would not be admitted to arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, conciliation anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Not even conciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Conciliation, at least. We shall not fight over it.  I see that social welfare payments have gone to £31 million.  That is part of the job <Col N="1105" /> these people handle and it is a big amount, involving big responsibility. They handle big sums of money and they should get reasonable remuneration for doing so and also to encourage them to resist temptation.  I know the postmasters are not very satisfied with the way things have gone.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that there was an increase in deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank from £91 million to £97 million during the past year. That is a pretty good sign.  It is a sign that people are accumulating saving and putting a bit by for the rainy day.  If the Government increased the interest on Post Office Savings Bank deposits, it would encourage still more savings in that direction.  At present, the rate of interest in respect of the Prize Bond Fund is four per cent.  The Minister should increase the rate of interest on Post Office Savings Bank deposits to four per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister states he has very little to do with broadcasting and television. When the Supplementary Estimate came before this House, I appealed to him to use his good offices to end the impasse between the journalists and the television authority.  One of the principal programmes people look out for on both radio and television is the news.  They have been denied that now for quite a while.</P>
      <P>During the past week, the Minister for Industry and Commerce used his good offices to defer the bus strike. I trust that, apart from deferring it, the matter in dispute will satisfactorily be settled.  Would it be too much for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come into the television dispute and to use his good offices there?  I think I should prefer to ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to use his good offices there: it would all be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People, especially in backward places, regard the news as a very important programme.  It is one of the services people look out for on the radio and even more so on television; apparently it is much better on television. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to try to put an end to the impasse.  The dispute <Col N="1106" /> will have to be brought to an end some day and it might as well be done immediately as having it drag on.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions interference by electrical equipment with radio and television.  The only complaint I get in Kilkenny is about interference from television sets when they are switched on.  That complaint has been very common in Kilkenny and I can speak for my own city.  I brought the matter to the attention of the Minister.  He said he would see that other people would not interfere with radio broadcasting but I do not think he has done much to put his own house in order. I do not suppose it is an easy matter to settle.  Nevertheless, the normal person who has not a television set resents it when some neighbour throws his radio out of order by switching on his television set.  That is only natural.  I would ask the Minister to concentrate on getting that interference eliminated.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister a year or so ago about inquiries over the broadcasting system.  A constituent of mine rang Radio Éireann and asked them to broadcast for a foster mother for a thoroughbred foal that had lost its mother but they did not broadcast the message.  That was not so bad but, a fortnight afterwards, somebody else got that same service.  I should like to know if that service is reserved for certain establishments or for certain people in this country.</P>
    <P>Farmers do breed these thoroughbred and halfbred animals.  They feel they are equally entitled to that service as any breeding establishment in the country.  The Minister wrote to me at that time and supported Radio Éireann in their stand.  I resent that.</P>
    <P>A normal man in the country would expect the same service from Radio Éireann as foreigners or anybody else get from them.  This man in question was refused that service; yet, a fortnight afterwards, he heard an identical request broadcast on behalf of somebody else.  The Minister should take a line that all these broadcasts should be accepted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be fairly brief.  I should like to refer to a discussion which took place last year, during which contributions were made by a number of Deputies, including myself, on the subject of auxiliary postmen and pensions.  It is too bad that in the year 1963, we still find people who, after up to anything like 40 years' service with the Post Office &mdash;a Government service&mdash;retire without any pension but the old age pension, if they qualify for it.  We feel that <Col N="1108" /> the time has come when the Minister should decide to initiate a scheme of pensions for what were known throughout the country as subpostmen.</P>
      <P>Next, I wish to refer to the rate of pay.  Some time ago, in answer to a question I put down, the Minister said I was trying to cover up a failure on my own part because I considered that somebody was not getting enough pay as a postman.  I have no responsibility whatever, except what responsibility I have to my constituents here in this House, for the pay of auxiliary postmen. Possibly the Minister might have made the comment without thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be well aware that my trade union does not cater for auxiliary postmen and, therefore, I have no responsibility for it.  It was an unfortunate intervention by the Minister.  I take it he made the comment without thinking.</P>

    <Col N="1109" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we should not have postmen employed on what appears to be a fairly high hourly rate but which, because of the fact that they are employed for a very small number of hours each day, means they receive a miserable week's wages.  I quite agree they will have an increase granted according to their service.  However, the Minister would be the first to agree with me that it would be unreasonable to say that if people are employed from 8 o'clock in the morning until 12.30 o'clock in the day, a period of four-and-a-half hours, they should not expect to get a week's wages.  With the type of underemployment we have, there do not appear to be jobs waiting for these postmen when they finish so that they can start to earn the other half of their week's wages with another employer.  The Minister should face up to that position and if people are full-time employees of the Post Office, he should see to it that they get a decent week's wages.</P>
      <P>Postmen have a responsible job. They are carrying the mails and are responsible for a considerable amount of valuable property which passes through the post.  It is most unreasonable that they should be asked to work for as low a wage as £4 a week.  Of course I may be told they are supplied with a uniform; I shall come to that in a few minutes.  These people are receiving this miserly sum for the hard work they are doing, work which they must do in all weathers.  One of the things commented on during the recent bad weather was that the postman kept going, no matter how bad it was.  He got the same amount of wages as if the weather had been fine.  He delivered the mail and was paid for the four-and-half hours which was supposed to be the time it would take him to deliver the letters in a particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a question down to the Minister and in that connection I should like to say that following the question, the Minister sent me what might be termed a semi-impudent letter to which I did not reply because I did not think it merited a reply.  The position <Col N="1110" /> was that I had got a certain complaint and brought it to the Minister's notice.  It was to the effect that on more than one occasion inspectors from the local post office had travelled the route, and if it was not with the object of reducing the amount of time taken to deliver the letters, I should like to know what was the object of the inspectors travelling around with the postman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>About the fact that the inspection was being carried out and that the man was not satisfied with the amount of money he was getting or was to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get any representations from anybody about the number of hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says he did not get the representations, I shall have to accept his statement but the Minister ought to check up on it because somebody is writing letters in his name and on his notepaper.  The letter was sent to me signed by the Minister referring to representations made, which representations were perfectly fair.  The Minister now says he does not know anything about this matter at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said nobody made representations to me regarding the number of hours the man worked in the job to which he was appointed, and I appointed him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally.  I would expect the Minister to appoint him but <Col N="1111" /> it is quibbling with words when the Minister says he did not know.  The representations were made about the whole set up there and on the basis that the postman could not make them himself because you know what can happen to an employee of the Post Office who makes representations.  The representations were replied to by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not want to make an issue of this.  I was not trying to be a smart aleck when I asked the Minister the question.  When the matter was brought to my notice, I referred it back three times before I took any action because I did not think it was my job to do it. However, eventually I was prevailed on to put down a question to the Minister and whether it was in regard to hours or pay, representations were made. There was a reply from the Minister which was not considered satisfactory and I was asked to raise the matter here.  I ought to make it very clear that I had no wish to embarrass the Minister when I raised it.  I accept that the day the Minister answered the last question he did not know the inspection was taking place.  However, somebody went around with the postman. Do you know the day he picked?  It was a day when there was fog and when weather conditions had prevented mail coming from England for two or three days.  He could not know the fog was coming but surely it was his responsibility to know that there was no English mail coming into the country on that day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it the will of God that eventually caused five minutes extra to be added to the time taken to do the round when it should have been an hour, were it not for the way it has been handled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to uniforms, is it not time the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, like the Department of Defence, did something about the postman's uniform?  This is 1963, not 1900.  The uniform is a shocking baggy affair.  I do not know who made it.  Obviously they were all made from the one pattern and the fellow from whom they picked the pattern must not be too well <Col N="1112" /> made himself.  It is certainly not a tunic.  I do not know what it is supposed to be.  I know the Minister is not directly responsible for this but I am bringing it to his notice because I believe that being a sensible man, he can do something about changing the type of cut of the uniform.  He would have the thanks of the numerous postmen who are constrained to wear it. We are hoping to have a hot summer and it will be a most uncomfortable summer for postmen who have to wear this uniform and the peculiar type of cap which has been done away with in most countries but which is still worn here.  There is a strict instruction that they may not take it off and unlike the guards, they may not take their coats off.</P>
    <P>Again let me refer to the question of hours.  There should be a standard minimum rate of pay for postmen.  I do not know how the Minister will go about it.  I would not like to try to direct him as to how he should approach the matter but I suggest he should try to have a set of hours laid down for postmen.  If the postman has to do more than the area he is doing over the period of earning the week's wages, let that be so, but, for goodness sake, pay him a decent week's wages and do not let us continue the situation in which he has only half a week's wages on the basis that he is employed for only a half day each week.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of telephones.  The Minister has said here on numerous occasions that because of the fact the trunk services were overloaded, there was no point in adding individual connections because it would only make the overloading worse.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>I have received from the Medical Research Council a memorandum on drug toxicity and its control.  The memorandum constitues a very useful contribution to the important and complex problem of drug control, which is of concern not only to this country but to health administrations in many other parts of the world.  The memorandum is being examined closely in my Department and as requested by the Council will be the subject of discussion with representatives from it as soon as the departmental examination mentioned above has reached a more advanced stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware of the complaint made by the Irish Nurses Organisation that permanent nurses employed in the voluntary hospitals have no superannuation rights; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of superannuation benefits for the staffs of voluntary hospitals is primarily a matter for the authorities of those hospitals.  The Minister for Health is concerned only to the extent that expenditure on superannuation schemes by hospitals participating in the scheme for grants from the Hospital Trust Fund towards revenue deficits may, if approved by the Minister, be reckoned towards the amounts of grant to be paid.  In March, 1954, the Hospitals Commission at the request of my predecessor, Deputy Dr. Ryan, addressed a communication to each of the participating hospitals indicating the criteria which would need to be satisfied in order that such expenditure by hospitals might be allowed to rank as indicated.  Broadly speaking, the standard contemplated was that laid down in the local government superannuation code.  Of the 60 participating hospitals, twenty-two operate superannuation schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Irish Nurses Organisation is seeking is a general, uniform, scheme applicable to all voluntary hospital nurses with the right to carry pensionable service into employment <Col N="1116" /> in another voluntary hospital or into employment in the local authority service.  The introduction of such a scheme raises a number of questions which require careful consideration and which are at present under examination in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a situation in which only one-third of the voluntary hospitals provide superannuation rights for nurses is not very satisfactory? Would he agree to ensure that this whole question of nurses' superannuation will get immediate and urgent attention from him and his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, in 1954, Deputy Dr. Ryan addressed a memorandum to all the voluntary hospitals concerned inviting them to prepare superannuation schemes.  A total of 22 have acted on that invitation; the others have not.  The position in relation to the voluntary hospitals is that they are voluntary hospitals and I, as Minister for Health, have no control and cannot direct the authorities in these hospitals to prepare such a scheme.  The matter has, however, been taken up recently with the voluntary hospitals by the Hospitals Commission and officers of my Department. I am hopeful I may be able to set up machinery which will secure for this question a more detailed examination than has been possible and which will enable me to put, perhaps, alternative proposals to the voluntary hospitals.</P>

The Deputy's Parliamentary question of 20th June, 1962, was regarded as a renewal of the application and as then stated it was decided to have the proposal reinspected. Because of the shortage of engineering staff it has not yet been found possible to do this, but it is hoped that the inspection can be arranged soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want again to refer to the question of the supply of telephones and to the replies given by the Minister as to why there were such long delays in certain areas.  I know that there are technical difficulties and the Minister just cannot supply telephones when and where they are wanted immediately, although at times it appears that he can.  I would ask him to try to do two things.  First of all, where phones have been abandoned for one reason or another, where people have ceased to use the telephone and decided to discontinue the service, without the possibility of its being resumed, would he arrange to allocate the lines to somebody who has been waiting for a considerable time in the area?  Secondly, if there are lines available in certain areas, surely it should be possible to allocate those lines with a minimum of delay? The question of the non-availability of technical people should not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind areas such as the area in which I live where, although an underground cable has been laid recently, it appears as if the connections are slow and are going to be <Col N="1168" /> slow.  Perhaps the Minister would see if he could expedite connection in places like that.  I do not expect the Minister to work miracles but if he had the matter investigated, it might be possible to have the service connected for people who have been waiting a considerable time.</P>
    <P>Let me refer for a moment to the question of subpostmen and the method of appointment.  I raised this matter last year with the Minister. When a vacancy occurs for an auxiliary postman and there is a temporary appointment made, it is usually a person who has done the job before or who is considered suitable who is appointed.  If he comes from the labour exchange, usually he is a person with substantial family commitments. Would the Minister arrange that, unless there are very strong reasons for not doing so, if that person applies for the permanent post, he will be appointed?  It does look bad, if somebody has been acting as auxiliary or temporary postman for a number of months, that somebody else, with perhaps fewer family commitments or perhaps in similar circumstances, should be appointed.  The people who talk about these things will say it was because the man who was doing the job was not satisfactory.  Very often, it is found that reference is made to the character of the unfortunate man who had been carrying out the work. For that reason, the Minister should be very careful about dispensing with the services of a person who has been engaged in an acting capacity and appointing somebody who comes in out of the blue.</P>
    <P>There has been a ban in operation over a number of years on the use of motorised bicycles or motorcycles by postmen in country places.  This is the year 1963 and it is time that ban was removed.  If a postman finds it convenient to use a scooter or autocycle, the Post Office should have no objection.  I do not know the reason for the imposition of the ban originally but as far as I am aware, it has not been removed.  I would ask the Minister to apply a little common sense to that matter, which should solve it without any trouble.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> With regard to Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann, practically everybody in the country is disappointed as a result of the continuance of the strike by newsmen and the consequent lack of news programmes.  The people down the country appreciated the news programmes on Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann.  The strike should not be allowed to continue for one minute longer than is necessary.  While the Minister has stated here that he has no responsibility for the matter, I am sure he appreciates that continuance of the strike must, of necessity, mean a complete close down of the services.</P>
    <P>The Minister enunciated a very good trade union principle a few moments ago on the responsibility of trade unionists in this matter.  It is not possible to continue the position that a small group are in dispute while everybody else is working, particularly, as appears to be the case now, when an effort is being made here and there to move in on news time and to issue under one heading or another an item which up to now would have been regarded as a news item.  I am quite sure we do not want to see such things happening.  We do not want to see our services damaged.  We would like to see them improved.  I would appeal to the Minister to do everything he can to see that justice is done to the newsmen on Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann who are on strike.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know a great deal more about this matter than anybody else here knows.  It is his job to know these things.  He must appreciate that the men there have not been getting a fair deal and that he must do something about it quickly.  We do not want the strike to drag on into Holy Week, Easter Week and then into the summer.  That would do irreparable harm.</P>
    <P>Since all strikes must be settled eventually by discussion, it is only sensible that every effort should be made to have this strike settled at the earliest possible time.  If the Minister intervenes at this stage, he will get nothing but the assistance and thanks of everybody concerned.  He should make an extra effort to have the matter dealt with.  We know that the Minister <Col N="1170" /> can write off the matter by saying that it has nothing to do with him, that it is a matter for Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann.  It was a bad day when this House decided to put these powers directly into the hands of outsiders. The responsibility should rest with a Minister.  Perhaps in the not too far distant future that position will have to be restored.</P>
    <P>As far as programmes are concerned, Telefís Éireann are doing quite well.  I said last year that I considered that the Authority were making a great effort.  I believe they are continuing to make a great effort.  Coverage of outdoor events should be increased. One of the finest efforts made by Telefís Éireann is in regard to the coverage of outside sports events.  There should be increased coverage of these events, wherever possible.  I do not know whether the cost is prohibitive but I would appeal for increased coverage of outdoor events.  Canned programmes can be obtained from the other stations, if viewers want to see them.</P>
    <P>The Irish programmes, including Irish dancing and Irish music, have been very well received and very well put over.  I would suggest that a certain type of play supposedly depicting Irish life should not be broadcast or televised.  The tinkers, the tramps of the road, do not carry a deceased relative around in a sack for weeks until they reach their place of origin where they want to bury her.  If programmes such as that were broadcast or televised by other stations, there would be a howl of protest inside and outside this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Paddy the Packer&rdquo;.  It certainly did nothing to enhance the reputation of the station.  Irrespective of who writes them or who is responsible for them, the less of such things we see the better it will be for Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to interference with reception of television and radio programmes.  Interference is a very annoying matter.  Could the Minister say if it is intended to introduce legislation to deal with interference? In the present situation anybody who wants to be awkward can ruin a programme for his neighbours simply by letting the motor of a van or motorcycle or old car run while it is parked outside a house for half an hour while the programme is on.  Then there are people who use all sorts of electrical machinery, defective machinery, obviously, because it upsets the viewing of various programmes.  I am not blaming the Minister for this.  I believe that eventually something will be done. The sooner the matter is attended to, the better it will be for all concerned.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to interference with reception of radio programmes by the use of television sets. This matter should be taken up with the manufacturers of television sets. There has been considerable comment by people who have not got television sets that the reception of radio programmes has been badly interfered with by the use of television sets in the neighbourhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter I mentioned last year and about which the Minister said he could not do anything. I would appeal to him to reconsider the matter.  I refer to the question of children's allowances paid to certain officials of his staff.  The Minister knows the matter I have in mind. When certain of his staff are recruited in a certain way they get children's allowances at a certain rate whereas persons promoted from the ranks who, apparently, are regarded as a different race, are paid the allowances at a lower rate.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at it because I <Col N="1172" /> believe that in common justice what applies to one should apply to all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister and his Department on this document which we have received relating to this Estimate.  There are a few comments I should like to make while the Estimate is going through the House.</P>
      <P>More use should be made of the Irish language on Telefís Éireann. There should be more Irish programmes and more Irish language programmes than there are at present for the people of the country.</P>
      <P>The work in the telephone service in general is very heavy.  It is a heavy burden to have to try to cope with the number of applications.  I know of one area where there is only one main line and you may have to wait for an hour, or an hour and three-quarters, for a telephone call to Dublin or even a few miles away.  That question will have to be gone into, and I think that an even distribution of main lines per population in an area would be a good idea.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, the Department called in some rural unestablished postmen to sit for an examination.  I wonder if anything could be done by the Department for those men, some of whom have given 20, 25, 30 or 35 years' service?  It is pretty late now to ask them to sit for examination. Naturally, they left school a good many years ago, and they cannot compete, or be expected to compete, at this stage, with younger men.  Can anything be done to establish them, because they have given faithful service to the Post Office?  They worked well and they should be established and get some pension as a recognition of their service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to telephone kiosks in small towns should be investigated. A farmer may need to get in touch with a vet at night when the post office has closed down, and people with private phones have gone to bed. If there were telephone kiosks in the small towns, they would be able to contact the vet and perhaps save the <Col N="1173" /> life of a beast, or even contact a doctor and perhaps save the life of a human being.</P>
    <P>Telephonists in general should be congratulated.  They have a very tough and hard time.  They are very courteous and they try to help in every way.  They have a very difficult job and they should be congratulated.  The telephonists in this House are most helpful and courteous.</P>
    <P>In certain areas, the number of hours per day the postman works are very low.  They are temporary men and they just get a few hours' work.  I know one area where there has been a change of postman five or six times in the past three or four months.  The hours are low but the mileage is long.  I wonder could we get a certain standard?  I wonder could we say that the postmen should get a fairly decent wage per week, irrespective of the number of hours worked, so long as the journey was long, so that the men would not be disgruntled and change their jobs?</P>
    <P>Some time ago, a postman in my area asked for a route test.  Strangely enough, the day the route was tested, he was sitting for an examination to become established.  I think his route should not have been tested the day he was sitting for an examination.  In that case, I think his route should be retested because it looks as if the Department were trying to take advantage of him.  Perhaps they were not, but that is the way it happened.</P>
    <P>On the question of minimum charges for telephone calls, whatever the distance the charge is still 1/3d if the call has to be routed, but if it is a direct line, the charge is 3d.  I think that if the call has to be re-routed, the charge should still be 3d.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Tully's remarks about uniforms for postmen.  Something should be done in the very near future to provide a better type of cloth, something which would be hard-wearing and would look better.  If the present uniform gets one shower of rain, it looks baggy, and does not last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me deal, first of all, with the youngest branch of the Minister's Department, television.  We have now had 12 months' experience <Col N="1174" /> of Telefís Éireann.  I want to deal primarily with the reception of television in the State.  Certain areas have perfect reception; other areas have poor reception; and in some areas there is no reception whatever.</P>
      <P>Speaking on this Estimate last year, I recommended to the Minister that the solution of the problem of various types of reception was the installation of piped television.  I advocated piped television, and I explained to the House and the Minister the advantage it would be: how much cheaper it would be for licence holders; that we would have a standard and uniform type of reception; and less outlay in the Department in the provision of piped television by private concerns.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out to me at that time that while he himself was sympathetic towards the idea of piped television, there would be legal difficulties in the matter.  I explained that it would not take very long to pass an Act of the Oireachtas to get over the legal difficulties and in fairness to the Minister, he said he would do his best to try to get over them.  I presumed by that he meant he would do his best to introduce legislation which would make piped television possible in the State.  It would do away with the unsightly aerials in rural and urban Ireland, and it would make the amenity of television available to every house-holder in the State.  There would be a choice of station by plugging in, and there would be guaranteed reception from all stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the most isolated parts of Northern Scotland, there is perfect reception from Independent Television and the BBC through piped television and I understand that is achieved without any extra outlay.  It is unfair of the Minister, if he proposes legislation to introduce piped television, that he should put the citizens to the expense of erecting television aerials.  He should come straight out and tell us now if there is any possibility of the introduction of piped television.  He is aware that a number of commercial concerns have undertaken to wire up every town and village in the State at their own expense if piped television <Col N="1175" /> is introduced.  They have also undertaken to pay the licence fee for any person who wishes to instal piped television and to recoup themselves by weekly instalments but we have heard nothing from the Minister as to the possibility of its introduction.</P>
    <P>Last year on this occasion, the Minister told us that he proposed to establish booster stations throughout Donegal.  There are certain pockets of that county in which Telefís Éireann cannot be received.  The Minister told us that he proposed to establish booster stations at Letterkenny and other places but we have heard nothing since about Letterkenny or these other places, despite the fact that viewers are paying a licence fee of £4 per annum and getting very poor reception.  If we are to have booster stations in Donegal, Kerry and other parts of the West, the sooner, the better.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to the programmes from Telefís Éireann.  There is not much use in using the Irish language over Telefís Éireann or Radio Eireann unless it is understood by a big number of viewers and listeners, but while we are waiting for the revival of the language, we could have more live broadcasts of subjects dealing with Irish culture.  I see regularly dance competitions being broadcast by Telefís Éireann but I have never seen a céilí broadcast.  I would like to see more céilí broadcasts over our services, not merely ones that have been rehearsed but ones that are actually taking place throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  They would be every bit as interesting as some of the dancing competitions we see broadcast every week.</P>
    <P>Our outside cameras could also attend the feiseanna throughout the country.  This is the period in which they are held and I should like to see live broadcasts of these occasions.  If we cannot give more time to the language because a large number of people do not understand it, our Gaelic culture is well understood and we should broadcast it much more for Irish audiences.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that in future we will see many <Col N="1176" /> more live broadcasts of these céilithe and feiseanna.  It might help to counteract some of the propaganda on the other television services.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see more live broadcasts of sporting events, not in or around the capital, but throughout rural Ireland.  It would create a greater competitive spirit at these various competitions if the players were aware that there was a bigger and wider audience than those present at the game.  It is difficult to criticise Telefís Éireann.  They have not yet had an opportunity to prove themselves but I hope the criticism I am making now will be accepted as constructive criticism.  I have great hopes for Radio Éireann, particularly with the new Director General, Mr. Kevin McCourt, who has proved himself in many fields. We should be slow to condemn Telefís Éireann when it has been only such a short time in operation.</P>
    <P>There are other branches of the service to which I should like to refer. There is the question of the subpostmasters. The Minister told us here last year that some of these people who give 10 hours' service per day are paid the magnificent sum of £125 per annum upwards.  When he was questioned on the matter and asked if he considered this a reasonable figure for these long hours and the provision of a room, light and heat, he said that these people had certain sidelines.  I cannot see what other sidelines can have to do with the question.  They could have these sidelines without being subpostmasters and probably have them to a much greater extent.  I would appeal to the Minister to be a man and meet these people who are paid this miserable pittance each year.</P>
    <P>We know what happened last year when they went on strike.  They were threatened and then they were beaten by a trick perpetrated on them by members of this House.  The manner in which they were met was disgraceful. One would think that they are not civil servants at all.  They are as much entitled to conciliation and arbitration as any other servants of the State and the fact that they live in rural Ireland is no reason why the Minister should not meet them.  The Minister should hear their case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Even at this late stage, I would make an appeal to him to be reasonable, to try to understand the difficulties under which they live, under which they try to eke out an existence.  I suggest that he meet them and extend to them conciliation and arbitration and not have them disgruntled and sometimes tempted&mdash;if not subpostmasters and subpostmistresses, at least their assistants&mdash;because of the mere pittance they get, to dabble into public funds. I trust it will not be necessary to refer to this matter on this Estimate next year or any other year, that in the meantime, the Minister will have done something about it.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies discuss each year delays in the installing of telephones. One would imagine the Minister is conferring a privilege on a person by installing a telephone.  A telephone at the moment is a very expensive piece of equipment, a very expensive but indispensable luxury, and when we find waiting periods of one to two or two and a half years, there must be something wrong.  Last May, we had increased postage rates.  In July, the telephone charges were increased but still there is no speeding up in disposing of the backlog of applications for telephones.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to seek the help of his colleague, the Minister for Defence, and select from that Department some of the experts and have them seconded to his Department. I do not see why there should be any difficulty in it.  Some years ago, we were told the difficulty was in the procuring of equipment.  I do not think that is any longer an argument and I feel certain military personnel would be most anxious to secure practical experience in the field in the laying of telephone cables and other such work.  It would not cut across in any way the labour content of the Department because the more telephones installed, the more cables laid, the more care and maintenance that will have to be given to the cables and other equipment.  There will be no redundancy; there will be only a clearing of the backlog.</P>
    <P>Even when sufficient telephones <Col N="1178" /> have been installed, we must still do something about speeding up trunk calls.  Take the progressive market town of Ballybofey in County Donegal. If one wants to get a call through from there to Dublin, the delay is unbelievable. The Minister told me in reply to a Parliamentary Question that as a result of a test carried out, it was found the delay is no longer than three minutes, but I can assure him, as one who has very often tried to make such a telephone call, that it takes much longer than three minutes.  It is something he could look into and possibly remedy.</P>
    <P>Another question arising under the heading of telephone calls is that of courtesy.  The majority of the civil servants engaged in the telephone service are most courteous and helpful but there are a few black sheep.  How often do we find this reply to a query as to when one may expect a call to come through: &ldquo;Hold on&rdquo;?  After a few minutes waiting, you leave down the receiver and after another few minutes, you get a ring to be told: &ldquo;Do you want this call or not?&rdquo; That is not a very courteous manner of dealing with the public.  Quite recently, I discussed it with one of the Minister's colleagues who agreed that a few individuals are giving the service a bad name.</P>
    <P>I suggest there should be a standard vocabulary for people engaged in telephone exchanges.  In the United States, the first question you are asked is: &ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; and on being helped, when you thank the operator, the reply you get is: &ldquo;You are welcome&rdquo;.  How seldom do we get that kind of courtesy in this country?  As I have pointed out, I am not referring to the majority.  I am referring to a minority and I submit it would be no harm if the Minister would, through his officials, make spot checks on the courtesy extended to the public by some of those engaged in the telephone service.</P>
    <P>One of the cheapest services provided by the Post Office is the overnight telegram.  It may be sent for 1/6d, provided it is not to be delivered before the following day and that it is handed in before 10 o'clock at night. Last week, my friend, Deputy Harte, <Col N="1179" /> wished to send an overnight telegram from the city here and he was told by the telephone exchange in the city that they had never heard of the overnight telegram service.  In three rural post offices in Donegal, I asked if I could send an overnight telegram and I was told they had never heard of such a service.  I then put down a question to the Minister as to whether he would display in every sub-post office a notice of the hours during which such telegrams can be sent and the cost.  His reply was not very helpful.  In effect, he said that periodically these notices are displayed in the post offices and they would continue to be displayed periodically until further notice.</P>
    <P>The Minister must do better than that.  He must periodically instruct subpostmasters that such a service is provided, that such a service should be encouraged.  I hope my ventilation of the matter in the House will let the public know that one may send a telegram of up to 12 words for 1s. 6d., provided it is handed in before 10 o'clock at night and provided one does not insist on delivery until the next day.  The Minister should advertise that to the public.  He should let them know about the existence of this service so that they can avail of it.</P>
    <P>Again on the question of telephones, in many parts of rural Ireland, we have no public telephones because we have no kiosks.  I know the Minister's difficulty about erecting kiosks in many parts of the country where there is no public lighting, where there may not be electricity.  I am thinking of areas in Galway, Kerry, Mayo and Donegal.  I am certain that in isolated pockets in those areas there is at least one public-minded citizen who would be prepared to place, free of cost to the Department, a room at the disposal of the Department where a telephone and coin box could be installed.  The island of Arranmore off Donegal has not got a public telephone kiosk and I am quite sure a number of people there would be very glad to provide accommodation for a 24 hour service.</P>
    <P>This is a service which pays and which assists the Department in paying for the service generally.  We all <Col N="1180" /> know how difficult it is in such isolated districts to contact the priest, the doctor or the fire brigade, in cases of emergency.  An immediate call through a public telephone would avoid much unpleasantness and might save life.  The suggestion I have made offers a method whereby the Minister would be spared the outlay of erecting a public kiosk and he should do something about it.</P>
    <P>The delivery of letters could be very much speeded up if motor scooters were provided for rural postmen. I suggested this last year and since then, I notice a number of motor cycles in use by postmen but why they cannot be supplied to all rural postmen is a mystery.  These motor scooters are easily procured and cheap and in addition to being labour-saving, they would speed up delivery of letters in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>May I make one final appeal to the Minister to keep politics out of the appointment of postmen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>How the Minister can sit there without blushing and tell me that, I do not know.  I have seen the secretary of a Fianna Fáil cumann produce a letter from a Minister of State saying that there would be six vacancies for temporary linesmen in the locality and if he knew anyone wanting the positions, to send the names in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about Ballinalee but I know about Lifford in County Donegal, and if the Deputy confines his activities to Cavan, he would be much better off. What I have said is a fact.  During the year, we had to point out to the Minister the scandal that occurred at St. Johnston over the appointment of a rural postman and within the last year or two, I pointed out a bit of a scandal that occurred back in Nairn where an Old IRA man was refused appointment as rural postman.  I do not know if the Minister personally is to blame for this.  I am afraid there is <Col N="1181" /> more than the Minister to blame.  It is bad and stinks of corruption and is something the Minister should try to eradicate.  I know it is difficult to get employment in rural Ireland and that people use all the pull they possibly can to get anything that is going but it is not fair that political corruption should be involved in the appointment of a postman.  The Minister should at this stage try to eradicate it.</P>
      <P>Postmen have a difficult, weary and monotonous life and every effort should be made to ensure, first of all, that they become established and thus entitled to pensions.  We have remedied that up to a point through contributory pensions to which these men become entitled but, apart from that, there should be superannuation provision for them.  It is unfair to see a temporary postman in the same capacity for 20, 30, or 40 years and then thrown out at the end of his time.  The Minister should do something to provide superannuation for these unfortunate men. He should ensure they will have some comfort on their tiring rounds throughout the year on their deliveries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to become excited about this Estimate, although I heard a little about political corruption.  I do not know if the talk was justified or not because it happens in the case of every Ministerial post.  Wherever there is a vacancy, or a likelihood of one, strings are pulled in every direction and those who are disappointed will always say that it was political corruption.  We have the problem of trying to house people here in Dublin and although that is done strictly on the merits, yet those who do not get what others get say that there must be &ldquo;backhanders.&rdquo; It is very difficult for any Minister to avoid that kind of allegation.  Although I am a city Deputy, I often get letters from people asking me to support somebody for the post of rate collector by talking to some TDs on the council. Frequently, it is unfair to make these allegations because it is a case of the pot calling the kettle black.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in some minor matters.  I heard it said that we should have more Irish on Telefís Éireann. <Col N="1182" /> What really matters is the sort of audience you have and one must admit that 80 or 90 per cent of the people, whether you like it or not, are probably not interested in anything Irish. We know that from the number of people who go to céilí dances.  I think only one céilí run in Dublin pays. That was the position.  It is very hard to make them pay because you have not sufficient céilí-goers and there are perhaps 2,000 modern ballroom dancers for every one who will pay to go to a céilí.  Largely, television audiences do not want much Irish and they will turn it off.</P>
    <P>I am not against encouraging Irish plays but many of the plays have ham players.  In fact, from time to time, I have looked at people trying to be funny who are not funny at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">

      <P>No; I am talking of television.  You will not get away with that in the theatre.  You will not be engaged unless you are funny.  Taking television all round, it is not bad.  The previous speaker referred to the time given to ballroom dancing.  These dancers are specialists, not amateurs, and have probably spent 20 or 30 years at it.  Most of them have private tuition every week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  These are not just ordinary dancers.  Thousands of people will look at them who would not bother looking at céilí dancing which is more or less a team rather than an individual effort.  One gets &ldquo;browned off&rdquo; after a few minutes looking at a fellow stepdancing.  When you have seen it once, you have seen enough of it, but those exponents of ballroom dancing have anything up to 50 figures and then there is their style as well.  It may be a question of taste. Otherwise, there is no comparison. Time is given on television to céilí dancing but the ballroom feature is a good feature when one considers the vast numbers who do ballroom dancing and gauge the size of the audience from that.  I am speaking as <Col N="1183" /> an authority because as a Deputy has said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I lived out of running dances for 30 years and I can assure you I would have starved for those 30 years, if I had tried to run céilí dances.</P>
      <P>The Old Fianna passed a resolution last year asking the Minister to have a stamp to commemorate the formation of the Volunteers.  This is the 50th anniversary of the formation of the Volunteers.  It was suggested that some stamp should be produced to commemorate not only the Volunteers but the Cumann na mBan, the Citizen Army and the Fianna.  I think there ought to be such a stamp.  It is not too late yet to have one.</P>
      <P>I can never see how a person with a private telephone should have to pay £1 17s. 6d. for rental.  In thousands of cases, those people do not use the phone six times a week.  It works out that very often they are paying 1/- a call&mdash;it amounts to that&mdash;whereas other people are doing business on it. Therefore, they are actually largely profiting by the phone.  There should be some differential as between those who have a private phone just for their own use and those who actually use it for business purposes.  I know people whose bill amounts to only about 10/- or 15/- but who have to pay £1 17s. 6d. for the rental.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will keep the few points I have made, especially the one about the stamp, in mind.</P>

Is eol dom gur maith an rud é sin agus gur dul ar aghaidh maith é.  Caithfidh mé chomhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire gur éirigh leis an t-airgead a chur ar fáil. Dá mba rud é nach raibh an t-airgead ann, ní bhféadhfadh linn dul ar <Col N="1184" /> aghaidh.  Ie é capall na hoibre airgead ins an chás seo agus is maith an rud é go bhfuil sé ar fail.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá mar gheail ar Oifig an Phoist féin&mdash; sé sin, na tothe.  Sílim go mba chóir go mbeadh roint bheag airgid le caitheamh ortha gach bliain.  Ceann des na háiteanna is cinnte a thugann an cuairteóir cuairt uirthi isteach oifig an phoist.  De ghnáth, nuair a théann cuairteóir isteach in oifig an phoist féachann sé thart air agus bíonn a fhios aige ansin cé'n sórt tír í.  An féidir leis an Aire aon rud a dhéanamh chun cabhair a thabhairt sa treo sin? Sílim go mba chóir deontas beag a chur ar fáil gach bliain agus iallach a chur ar na daoine gur leo na tithe sin dath nua a chur ar an áit agus ainm na hoifige a scriobhadh amach arís gach bliain, agus mar sin de.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to say I believe that the post offices are places most often visited not alone by the people of the district but by those who come here as tourists.  For that reason, I feel that these premises should be kept in a fairly high standard of repair.  If at all possible, some little gratuity should be given periodically to help these people to ensure that their premises are clean, neat, well-painted and well-preserved.</P>
      <P>I know, too, that many of the people who own these premises placed the best room at the disposal of the post office when it was necessary to make application or when they were granted these post offices away back years ago.  Conditions have changed very much since then.  The work has increased out of all proportion.  Very often now subpostmasters in the country find they have to work practically all round the clock, in view of the increased telephone services all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel the time probably has come when the Minister will have to differentiate between post offices located in private houses where no business is carried on and post offices located where various trading shops, and so on, are in the same building or along side it and to the advantage of the <Col N="1185" /> owner.  That, in itself, may have mitigated very much against the subpostmasters when they were looking for an increase recently.  I know that the amount of work they have to do has increased enormously.</P>
    <P>I should also like to pay a special tribute to them in view of the fact that last year they handed in, I think, over £3½ million in Saving Certificates, probably more.  As a matter of fact, down the years, they have handed back millions of pounds.  It is rather strange that in this country while the majority of people may try to place bank officials and people who work on those premises on a very high place, the same often does not apply so far as the ordinary subpostmaster is concerned, despite that fact that he, too, handles an enormous amount of public money during the year.</P>
    <P>It is to the credit of these men that they have handled that money efficiently and that very rarely are there instances of persons embezzling or putting to their own use any of the funds entrusted to them for safe keeping. I think that is a special tribute to them.  As a community, we all know that the post office is a great centre in any parish or locality.  We know, too, that these postmasters have been more than obliging to rural people who often go in there at any hour they feel like it and try to make urgent telephone calls or have telegrams sent.</P>
    <P>I feel it would be well if the Minister could differentiate between these two types of people who have these offices.  If at all possible, he should try to ensure that they will be contented in their employment and will find it remunerative so far as carrying on the good work they are already doing is concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to Telefís Éireann, I feel it is something which is destined very much in the coming year to influence the trend of thought in this country.  For that reason, I believe it should be of the very best.  I believe it should lose no opportunity to try to get across to the Irish people our own ancient history, culture and native language.  I do not mean we <Col N="1186" /> should expect them to try to furnish completely Irish programmes for people who do not know the Irish language sufficiently well to interpret everything that comes across.  However, it is true to say that the Irish language has been taught in the national schools for well over the past 40 years.  Therefore, anybody of average intelligence who went through the national school should surely understand such simple phrases as go raibh maith agat and slán agaibh.  Very often, these are not used by personnel on Radio Éireann or on Telefís Éireann.  However, I did not rise to try to pick out the bad points.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that both Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann have at times put across excellent programmes that were much appreciated by the ordinary people in the country.  It is also true that programme planners seem to think that the rural population is composed of people who fall over themselves to listen to symphony concerts and other high-falutin programmes and often exclude our own Irish jigs and reels and ballads which the ordinary people enjoy and appreciate very much and which reflect and tell the history of our nation.  Those of us who have seen the <i>School Around the Corner</i> on Telefís Éireann and some of the ventriloquist programmes certainly realise the work that is being done in Telefís Éireann to nurse the people along towards becoming at least bilingual.  The idea of bringing Irish music and ballads from our exiles in America and England is also a very excellent one and these programmes are enjoyed by the ordinary people.  I congratulate the Radio Éireann staff on providing that service.</P>
    <P>Many complaints were received during the year regarding telephones but we cannot blame the Minister for this state of affairs.  Very often, it is said that there is a backlog of 2,000 or 3,000 but most people do not realise that that backlog goes back only a year or two.  Many people are making an application for telephones who a few years ago would not dream of having such facilities on their premises. Unless the cables are properly <Col N="1187" /> laid down and able to take the load, it would cause nothing but confusion. The Minister and his Department have made tremendous progress.  Everywhere one sees men laying cables underground and overhead.  Although the work is being done without any great show, the results are there for anyone who wishes to see them.  The Minister has been doing tremendous work since he came into office and he is to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>Some reference has been made by Deputies in Opposition to the appointment of subpostmasters, rural postmen, and so on.  Some of them have even gone so far as to accuse the Minister of favouring certain candidates rather than the men these Deputies felt should get these positions. In my short time here, I remember a question being raised here regarding the dismissal of a postman in the south of Ireland and I must compliment the Minister on the restraint he used on that occasion.  Time and time again, he was asked why this man was dismissed.  It was even insinuated that there was some political significance behind it.  Still the Minister kept cool and said that because his Department felt he was not fit to hold the position, he was dismissed.</P>
    <P>The particular Deputy went further and demanded the whole story.  Then the Minister very properly turned over his pages and was able to convince every Deputy before he had turned many pages that he had taken the right decision and had been more than lenient towards this person.  In fact, it was the opinion of every fairminded person that he was left too long in the job.  That does show that the Minister is not biased in any way.  I think it was this Government who set up the Appointments Commission for the holding of State examinations for people entering the Garda Síochána and various other services so as to ensure that these positions were not secured by political pull.  It is to their credit that they have done that.</P>

      <P>I want to express my grave concern that in connection with the £4 licence fee for wireless and television and after deducting costs of about £514,600 in connection with the broadcasting services, the Minister says it may be necessary to re-examine the position and increase the fee during the coming year.  Last year, there was an increase in postage and now the Minister says it may be necessary to increase wireless licences.  Many people will express grave concern at this move considering that some years ago we were paying only 12/6 for our wireless licence which was increased gradually to 17/6 and is now £1. Seemingly the Minister and his Department are not satisfied that the revenue from these licences is enough to meet their commitments.  The Minister and his Department would be well advised to think slowly on this matter before taking this step.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention a matter which I brought to the Minister's attention some months ago when I had a communication from the telephone subscribers in the Ballon area of County Carlow. They found that the service was very bad there during the busy hours.  I should like to say that it was due to no fault of the workers in the Ballon, Tullow or Carlow post offices. That was last November and I had at that stage a communication from the Minister stating that this was due to insufficiency of circuits between Tullow, Ballon and Carlow and that arrangements were in train to have these remedied.  I am sorry to say that after practically five months this position, as far as I know, has not been remedied and I draw the attention of the Minister and his Department to this fact so that they may have it remedied in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a big delay in my end of the constituency in dealing with applications for telephones.  It is five months since I asked the Minister how many applications there were in the Carlow area. Speaking from memory, I think he told me there was something <Col N="1189" /> in the region of 120, which he hoped would be dealt with within 12 months. I hope his Department will make headway in this regard, since the demand for telephones seems to be increasing all the time.  His Department are finding it hard to meet expenses in certain directions.  If these people were given the telephone service, it would certainly improve the financial position in the Department.</P>
    <P>For a number of years past, the GPO building in Carlow has not been at all adequate.  The Department purchased a site from Carlow County Council on which to build a new post office.  Speaking from memory, I think it was three years ago.  To date, not a stone has been laid on that site.  I am often perturbed to hear substribers complain about the telephone service in the town.  I never see eye to eye with such people.  I have always found the greatest courtesy and promptness on the part of the staff in the post office, but I know they are working under very adverse conditions.  The building of the post office should be expedited as much as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to the connecting of telephones, I had a particular case in Tullow. The Minister has the name and address of a subscriber there who in 1961 applied for an extension from his office to his house.  He is still waiting for that extension.  He is a professional man.  He told me it interferes with his professional work that he cannot get this extension.  I would ask the Minister to see what he can do in this matter.  It is most unfair that a person should be left waiting for that length of time.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned that rural postmen should be supplied with scooters.  In the year 1963, it is deplorable to see our rural postmen&mdash;some of them pretty aged&mdash;pushing around on pedal cycles trying to do their job in all sorts of weather.  I would fully support Deputy O'Donnell in suggesting that some type of scooter be supplied to our rural postmen.</P>
    <P>From references made here.  I take it that some people are under the impression some appointments as subpostmasters have been political <Col N="1190" /> appointments.  I am not accusing the present Minister of making these appointments on political grounds.  I should hate to think that any appointment in this country, be it as a subpostmaster or anything else, would be made on political grounds.  I know there are some political appointments, but I deplore them.  Everybody should be tried in fair competition.  No matter what job a person goes for in the postal service, it should not be a matter of appointment on political grounds.  I hope that whoever mentioned this previously is wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope the points I have raised will be looked into by the Minister.  In my short time in the House, I have always found him most courteous and helpful in meeting any questions put to him, whether in the House or privately in his office.  I would ask him to look into these matters, especially the position in regard to the Carlow Post Office building. It is essential that that should be gone ahead with as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department would be well advised to think again before increasing wireless licence fees. I do not know whether the Minister intends increasing them before or after the Budget.  It may be like the postal charges last year &mdash; we may have a second Budget.  But the Minister would be well advised to examine the matter before proceeding any further.</P>
    <P>It is certainly praiseworthy that the Minister expects the Television Authority to break even in 1962-63.  While there may be criticism of some of their programmes, I think they are putting on good entertainment and I wish them every success.  I should like to add my voice to that of Deputy Crotty in saying that the appointment of Mr. McCourt met with general approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister at the outset and when a member from this side of the House congratulates the present Minister, he does so sincerely.  Any time I have had occasion to visit him in his office, I have been received by him with the utmost courtesy and I have the highest respect for him. Nevertheless, there are certain aspects of his Department to which I wish to <Col N="1191" /> refer but purely in relation to his Department and not to him personally.</P>
      <P>Since I spoke on this Estimate last year, we have had some advance with Telefís Éireann but I am sorry to say that in Donegal we have yet to receive perfect reception.  In some parts, there is no reception whatever; yet we have officials of the Department visiting homes to inquire about licences and warning the people who have television sets that if they do not take out licences, they will be prosecuted.  I appreciate that this is the law and that if you have a radio set, you must have a licence; but I feel that the Minister should close his eyes to certain matters and concentrate on areas where they have good reception and where they are getting a service.  Plenty of people in Donegal have paid the £4 licence but they have paid it under protest.  Other people find it difficult to pay it and they think, and to some extent I agree with them, that the Department is collecting this fee under false pretences.</P>
      <P>Speakers from the Government side welcomed the introduction of Telefís Éireann to counteract the anti-national programmes and the bad programmes being broadcast by the BBC and UTV. I should like to congratulate the authorities of both UTV and BBC on some of their programmes because in many cases they have a more national character than those from our own service.  We must appreciate that both the BBC and UTV are British authorities and we do not expect them to have the viewpoint expressed by certain fanatics who claim to be better Irishmen than some of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What puzzles me about the service offered by Telefís Éireann is why our programmes must be canned.  There is no reason why the Authority should not visit rural Ireland and televise local functions which are part of the culture of rural Ireland.  Instead we have western films from America and gangsters and murder films from Broadway and Hollywood.  I should like the Minister to instruct Telefís Éireann to visit rural Ireland and film some of the functions in Donegal, for example.  I <Col N="1192" /> should like to see the regattas in Moville, Rathmullen and Killybegs being televised on each August Bank Holiday, or the finals at the greyhound track at Lifford.  Such programmes would be better than some of the tripe that is being sent out.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann not only collects the licence fees but also a certain amount of revenue by way of advertisements. I should like the Minister to consider that the BBC function purely on licence fees&mdash;the licence in England also costs £4&mdash;while UTV and ITV function purely on the amount they collect by way of advertisements.  Yet Telefís Éireann collects licence fees and revenue by way of advertisements and it is unnecessary for me to say that the Telefís Éireann programmes are anything but comparable with the BBC and UTV programmes.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I want to refer is that if one is addressing a letter to County Donegal, he must put in the postal address the names of one of the three sorting offices, Letterkenny, Lifford or Donegal town.  The Lifford office has 53 sub-offices, the Letterkenny office has 38 and Donegal has 25.  There are seven local offices which have opted to take a direct service from Dublin.  I am told that this is being done only in County Donegal. As you well know, Sir, this regulation was introduced some 12 months ago. Prior to that date, if you addressed a letter to one of your constituents and put the sub-office address on it, without the address of one of the main offices, that letter reached the constituent the following day.  Twelve months ago, a new regulation was brought in, or an old one was re-introduced&mdash;I just cannot work it out&mdash;and if you refrain from putting either &ldquo;Letterkenny&rdquo; or &ldquo;Donegal&rdquo; on the letter, it takes two days for that letter to reach your constituent. This is codology.  It is done because some tight-laced civil servant in Dublin decided that it was right.</P>

      <P>The Minister takes responsibility for his Department.  The officials do not come into this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that the Minister should instruct <Col N="1193" /> this tight-laced civil servant that when a person has to write &ldquo;Lifford&rdquo;, &ldquo;Donegal&rdquo; or &ldquo;Letterkenny&rdquo; on the envelope, it is most misleading.  When that person may have occasion in the summertime to visit Donegal, he could arrive in Donegal looking for Glencolumbcille; he could arrive in Lifford looking for Malin; he could arrive in Letterkenny looking for Bunbeg.  This is most misleading and absolutely unnecessary and I would ask the Minister to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>As television improves, the use of Radio Éireann will decline.  Most of us tune in to Radio Éireann for the morning news, the Hospitals Requests programme and the midday news.  I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of utilising Radio Éireann for more extensive hospital programmes.  Greater use could be made of Radio Éireann to make the stay of a patient in hospital more pleasant.</P>
      <P>The question of the installation of telephones has been dealt with by Deputy O'Donnell but I should like to refer briefly to the matter.  Every month I have to write to the Secretary of the Department asking the reason for the delay in installing a telephone.  We all appreciate that the Minister and his staff cannot provide the service for an applicant immediately on receipt of a letter in the Department but I cannot understand why it takes in some cases three years and three and a half years to provide the service.  I have personal knowledge of an application for a telephone made in 1958 and the telephone has not yet been installed.  There is no reason for such a delay.  I think there is some person in the Department who is not pulling his weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To rural users, the telephone is an absolute necessity in this modern age. Members of the farming community need a telephone service for the purposes of contacting a veterinary surgeon or the AI station or a doctor. If they have not a telephone in the house, they may have to travel three or four miles to get the message through.  I would ask the Minister to direct the Department to make an allout effort to clear off the backlog of <Col N="1194" /> applications for telephones from my constituency of North-East Donegal.</P>
    <P>I have the highest regard for the Minister; I have always regarded him as a real gentleman; but I have had occasion to come into the House and ask very pertinent questions about the appointment of postmen in County Donegal.  When the Press reports went out, as usual, the local Fianna Fáil supporters misrepresented the facts of the case and I should like to take this opportunity of assuring any person who read anything which I said on those occasions that the facts are beyond denial.</P>
    <P>There was a case in Donegal where a man was appointed temporary auxiliary postman.  He is a married man with four in family.  He was called for interview and because he was the only person who attended for the interview, he was appointed temporarily and was left with the thought that the job was his.  Three months later, he got a letter telling him that he must attend for a further interview.  Before that interview was held, it was common gossip, street-corner talk, a publichouse yarn, that the result of the interview would be that the secretary of the local Fianna Fáil cumann would be appointed to the post.  The reason for the delay in holding the second interview was that the boy had to attain the age of 18 years.  One fortnight after that boy became 18 years of age, the interview was held and he was appointed, in spite of the fact that a married man with four in family was disemployed.</P>
    <P>Arising out of questions I asked in the House, the Minister informed us that any person drawing unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit got preference in such appointments.  Here was the case of a man who had been drawing unemployment benefit, who had four in family, who had a small sideline job at £2 or £2 15s. a week which he supplemented by the £4 a week he had as auxiliary postman.  He appreciated that £4 a week addition to his meagre livelihood.  It was for him a case of working for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at £4 a week or emigrating.  He was content to work as a postman.  He was deprived of that livelihood because the local Fianna <Col N="1195" /> Fáil cumann put the screw on the local Fianna Fáil Deputy to put the screw on either an official's or the Minister's arm.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not have been aware of the facts of the case until after the appointment.  That may have been the case but after I had exposed the facts in this House, the Minister should have annulled the appointment of the boy of 18 years of age who was in fact secretary of the Fianna Fáil cumann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dolan from Cavan a few moments ago advocated political appointments and suggested that certain jobs were political appointments. We realise that certain jobs are political appointments.  That is an accepted fact.  A job such as auxiliary postman should not be subject to political pull.  Every person requires a job.  I realise that if a Fine Gael man was looking for a job and a Fianna Fáil man was looking for the same job and both of them had the same qualifications, the Minister would be inclined towards his Party supporter.  I would accept that because, in all fairness, if I were in his position, I would be inclined to take a similar view.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how a boy of 18 years of age would be given preference over a married man with a family of four, in view of the fact that certain other members of that household were already in jobs.  That is something that should be condemned. I promise that every time a similar case comes to my notice, so long as it is my duty to expose it, I will do so, and I will do so in a just and fair manner.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time something like that has happened in Donegal. Deputy O'Donnell referred to a letter which was received by the local Fianna Fáil branch secretary in Lifford in connection with the creation of 12 new jobs as labourers or linesmen.  The Minister for Local Government wrote to the secretary of the Fianna Fáil branch and to a Grade B postman in the post office instructing him that these 12 new posts were being created. The news reached the two individuals <Col N="1196" /> before it became officially known to the engineer in charge in Donegal.  I saw a copy of one of the letters and it was to the effect that they were invited to nominate six people to fill the posts. If those are not Tammany Hall tactics, I do not know the meaning of the expression.</P>

      <P>It is too bad that I was not a member of the House when this happened.  I shall conclude by saying that since I came into the House, I have found the Minister courteous and a gentleman in every respect.  On some occasions, I have found it difficult to say anything which might have offended him.  I hope that if I have done so, he will take it in the manner in which it was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up where the previous speaker finished by thanking the Minister for his availability and courtesy at all times.  In saying that, I do not want to be taken as in any way approving the statements made by the previous speaker to the effect that one must be affiliated to a Fianna Fáil cumann <Col N="1197" /> before one can get an appointment in the Post Office.  My experience of the Minister has not been along those lines. I have found him extremely fair and I have found that he takes into consideration the circumstances of the various applicants as a primary consideration. Of course, it is bound to be rather difficult for supporters of other Parties, because taking any half dozen applicants, four are likely to be Fianna Fáil supporters anyway, by reason of the numerical strength of the Party in the country.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment and thank the Minister for his personal attention to a matter in connection with the delivery of air mail letters to Kano in Northern Nigeria where there is a fairly large number of Irish nuns, priests and laymen.  I want to thank the Minister for the practical steps he has taken, arising out of my representations, which speeded up the delivery of airmail letters to that region.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties of the Minister in regard to the telephone service.  The expansion in that service has been phenomenal.  Of course, that is not a unique development; it is happening in every country all over the world.  The Department are entitled to be congratulated on having been able over the years to keep up, or almost keep up, with the demand. There are, however, some pockets and areas where the service is not as it should be, and, as I am sure, what the Minister would like it to be.  I notice that in recent times there was extraordinary difficulty about contracts in the Kiltimagh area.  I take it that the reason is, as I believe it is, that there are not sufficient cables to take in additional telephone lines.  I sympathise with the Department in their difficulty, but I would ask the Minister to keep that area in mind.  There are a number of people there who have applied for business telephones as distinct from private telephones.  Considerable hardship is being imposed on them by reason of the fact that telephones have not been installed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No reference is made in the Minister's statement to the dispute in Radio <Col N="1198" /> Éireann and Telefís Éireann.  I should like to compliment the journalists involved on the dignified way in which they have made their protest, to express the hope that the Government, having effectively intervened in the CIE crisis on behalf of a very large number of workers, will have the same concern for a small body of workers who, to my way of thinking, have established at least a <i>prima facie</i> claim for considerably increased remuneration, and to add that so far as the new television service is a creature of the Government, the Government should have regard to the goodwill they have enjoyed, and I am sure will continue to enjoy, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Authority and those who work under the Authority.  I hope, therefore, that because of the fact that the number of people involved in the dispute is small, the merits of the dispute will not be allowed to fall into the background.  I hope the Minister, or some other person, will use his good office to have it speedily brought to a conclusion, possibly through the medium such as that which was offered to the CIE workers, and which I hope will be accepted.</P>
    <P>Recently an examination was carried out under the aegis of the Department for linesmen in the Castlebar and Claremorris area, and, I presume, in other parts of the country.  As a result of that examination, a number of men who thought they had been quite satisfactory in their work over the previous three or four years, admittedly in a temporary capacity, were unsuccessful. I have some difficulty in understanding why these young men could not have been continued in that employment, particularly if there were sufficient work for them to be retained in a temporary capacity even after failing the examination.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the examination was thought necessary or desirable at all. In saying that, I am not to be taken as in any way criticising the Minister's decision to have the examination held. I am merely saying that I was not clear on the real purpose of the examination and that I would like to know, as a matter of information, and on behalf of some of those who were laid off, who <Col N="1199" /> felt they had given eminently satisfactory service to the Department during that period, and who possibly felt that their experience was at least equal to that of some who were deemed successful in the examination, what it was.</P>
    <P>In the main, the standard of courtesy and attention given to the public by the telephonists throughout the country is extremely high.  I have complimented them on this before and their standards of efficiency and courtesy continue to improve every day.</P>
    <P>I also wish to mention the cause of the postmasters and postmistresses who cannot be said to have adequate remuneration for their responsibilities and for the work they have to do.  As the Minister has pointed out, they cooperate in the distribution of Prize Bonds, which is a form of national service, and they have an ever-increasing burden to cope with in relation to telephones, letters and other duties. I should hope that they would be given increased remuneration quickly because a high standard of integrity is required from all workers in the postal service.  The postmaster or postmistress has a heavy individual responsibility in regard to staff and I feel that pay is not commensurate with such responsibility and that the position should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The final matter I wish to mention is the provision made in the British Budget whereby the whole amount of the broadcasting licence fee is to be given to the broadcasting authority there.  I admit that is intended merely for the purpose of helping the BBC to establish a second service and that it is not intended that a second service should be established here.  It is obvious from the experience that our broadcasting Authority is becoming increasingly tightened financially and it would be no harm if the Minister arranged with his colleague in the Cabinet to keep the needs of the Authority in mind in a few weeks' time.</P>
    <P>If that should involve an increase in the fee, I do not think it would call for much public criticism.  A person who had a wireless set before the television <Col N="1200" /> service was introduced would have to pay £1 and most people would regard the £4 licence as reasonable. If the wireless licence were increased by 10/- and the £4 added on to that, I think it would be to everybody's benefit.  Once again, I thank the Minister for his helpful attention and courtesy at all times and I wish him well for the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with the previous speakers who have complimented the Minister on his courteous manner in dealing with representations made to him.  One matter to which I wish to call his attention is the difficulty experienced by workers in having telephone charges reversed.  It often happens that a workman working outside his own area has occasion to make a phone call to his employer, but, if he finds himself out of funds, he is unable to reverse the charges.  I am told that one of the main objections would be the making of calls from public houses.  Surely that should not be an impediment to the provision of the necessary service.  It is not everybody who has the necessary change when making urgent and necessary calls.</P>
      <P>Some better system should be devised in connection with the making of trunk calls abroad.  Particularly at Christmas time, many people make calls and do not know the difficulties of calling back.  It has been found that people when making such calls do so in the belief that they can be rung back immediately but there is no arrangement by which that can be done.  It also happens frequently that one sees a queue of people outside a phone box waiting for their turn to make a call.  It seems that when a person is called back, the time allowed for that call is much longer than that allowed for the first call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effort should be made to have telephone kiosks erected in housing areas simultaneously with the development of the area.  There is a crying need for telephone kiosks in these areas and, in my constituency, they are particularly needed in Finglas.  Great difficulty is experienced by the residents in that area when they need the <Col N="1201" /> services of a doctor, ambulance or the fire brigade.  It means that people have to walk a considerable distance at night to make these urgent calls.</P>
    <P>Some improvement should be made in the arrangements for the cleaning of telephone boxes.  Insufficient staff appear to be supplied for that purpose and it is not very pleasant to enter a telephone box and pick up a phone which is obviously not clean.  Some effort should also be made to keep children from running in and out of these telephone boxes.  Some sort of catch should be put on the top of the kiosk so that it would not be as accessible as most of them are.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into the issue of television licences by private firms.  I have already asked the Minister to do something to ensure certain people will not make money from the issue of television licences. It is a fact that one firm in the city has a special office which does nothing else but give out television licences. One can go in and simply give the name and address, fill in a form and the licence is applied for.  The person signs a document under which he contracts to pay so much a week, plus an amount for interest.  Is it legally right for a person to make money in that way?  Has the Minister had any complaints that this is happening?  It is not right to have television licences on the HP unless the Department themselves sponsor such a scheme.</P>
    <P>I should be obliged if a little more attention could be given to the selection of casual workers in the Department during the rush periods.  Very often, the manner of selection is ridiculed: people say that those in most need of such employment are passed over, that those engaged are not selected from the local employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to find out how much money has been saved by the television and radio authority since the present dispute of journalists employed by them began.  It has been said around the city that there has been a saving on the wages of those journalists, that in fact efforts to settle the dispute have not been as genuine as they might have been, since, coming up to the end of the <Col N="1202" /> financial year, the Authority were anxious to save as much as possible and break even.  Now that the dispute has lasted so long, I suggest the Minister should intervene and endeavour to arrange a conference with a view to an early settlement.  It would settle one situation at least, where journalists are complaining that statements of national importance are being arranged and broadcast by nonjournalists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly pleased to learn from the Minister's statement that the amount invested in the Post Office Savings Bank has reached £97 million and that it is hoped it will touch the £100 million mark next year.  This is the establishment in respect of which children begin to learn the habit of saving.  It has all the facilities of an ordinary bank, with the added attraction that there is a post office in every village and parish in the country where people can put their money and be guaranteed a rate of interest even better than that afforded by ordinary banks.</P>
      <P>This time last year, I drew the Minister's attention to a drawback in the collection of mail in the three towns of Tyrrellspass, Rochfort Bridge and Milltownpass.  Although there is a morning mail delivery in the three, the postman will not collect the mail from the pillarbox.  That is done in the afternoon.  The reason given is that it would cause delay in the deliveries.  It means that letters posted there during the night must lie there until the following afternoon.  It is anomalous that while the mail is collected in the morning in Kinnegad, my home town, the postman then goes on to the three towns I mention and does not collect.  It would not cause any great delay to have collections taken there and it would not impose any extra amount of work on those concerned.  On the other hand, it would greatly facilitate business people and farmers.  There is an office in one of the towns where the staff work on until 5.30 p.m. preparing the post.  They then put them in the letterbox but they lie there right into the afternoon of the following day.</P>

    <P>We are very pleased in Kildare that <Col N="1203" /> the automatic telephone system has been introduced.  Like all innovations, it it still suffering from teething troubles.  At the moment, for instance, if one is making a call to places such as Naas or Newbridge, one must dial two or three times.  I am sure these are difficulties which can be overcome in time by the Post Office engineers but at the moment, it is a very definite drawback.</P>

      <P>Deputy Clinton gave notice that he would raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 11 on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before seeking permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment, I went through all the normal channels and used all the other means available to a Deputy to extract from the Minister for Agriculture the terms of an agreement which is supposed to exist between the Minister and the members of the Federation of Irish Feeding Stuffs Manufacturers, an agreement that they be given licences for the importation of maize and allowed without restriction to import wheat offals in return for their guarantee to take up the barley crop on 1st January each year. All my efforts failed to get from the Minister information which, I believe, should be available to all of us.  I understand that the terms of this agreement are not available even to Fianna Fáil Deputies so that it must be an even greater secret than the penny per gallon increase in the price of milk.</P>
      <P>I put down a number of questions and succeeded in getting some information but the final question appeared on yesterday's Order Paper as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture when he expects to be in a position, in accordance with his <Col N="1204" /> undertaking, to place on the Table of the House the terms of his agreement with the Irish Corn Traders' Association regarding the importation of maize and wheat offals in return for their guaranteeing the uptake of the barley crop.</P>
    <P>The reply was:</P>
    <P>The arrangement with the Federation of Irish Feeding Stuffs Manufacturers, of which the Irish Corn Trade Association forms part, was published as an agreed Press Notice on 20th July, 1962.  I have arranged for copies to be placed in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>I thought, on the face of it, that was a very reasonable reply and I accepted it as such.  I did not ask even one supplementary question.  But when I went down to the Library, I found, certainly not the terms of an agreement, but one side of the terms of the agreement and that was what the millers undertook to do.  They undertook to take up what was left of the barley crop on 1st January each year at certain prices and costs, but there was no indication as to the manner in which they were to be rewarded for this service, that is, if the service cost them anything.</P>
    <P>I am still convinced that there is an agreement in existence because this small group of feeding stuffs manufacturers&mdash;we could almost call them the privileged few&mdash;have been given a monopoly of import licences for maize and they are allowed to import wheat offals without restriction.  Personally, I think this is nationally undesirable because we are not getting feeding stuffs of the right quality and at the right price because we are exporting wheat to a degree that I believe to be unnecessary and importing very large quantities of both maize and wheat offals.</P>

      <P>I can answer that question very simply by saying I have actually placed on the Table of the House the agreement in question and if the Deputy reads it carefully, he will see that part of the document says:</P>
      <P>Requirements of imported coarse grains other than oats will be determined later in consultation with the federation.</P>
      <P>&mdash;and it has been.  I have concealed nothing at all.  I have nothing to conceal. I have striven to get the best arrangement for the marketing of feeding stuffs in the interests of producers that I could.  I am quite satisfied that in this agreement I have provided the best machinery that could be designed to achieve that end.  If I am not to be allowed to start from 1959, when the activities of Grain Importers, Limited, were brought to an end, then I cannot explain this as I should like to.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a)</i>  The figures for the Civil Service supplied in the answer to the question of 8 May, 1962, were, as the note to that question indicated, derived from the Civil Service census.  That pattern has again been adopted in computing the figures set out above.  As the figure for overtime is not available until some time after the end of the financial year, the 1963 figure contains an estimated amount for overtime and is to some extent provisional.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i>  Figures based on estimates provision.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c)</i>  Figure for Gross National Product 1962 not yet available.</P>

    <P>*Sur-tax assessed for 1962-63 is in the normal course payable on the 1st January, 1964, and does not, therefore, affect the yield for 1962-63.  It is presumed that in this case the reference to an increase or reduction in the rates charged in 1962-63 is to be taken as a reference to the rates charged in respect of the previous year, i.e., 1961-62, the sur-tax for which is payable on the 1st January, 1963, (i.e., in 1962-63).</P>
    <P>NOTE: Income tax and sur-tax receipts for any year consist of tax payments made in that year in respect of tax due for various years.  For example, the Income Tax receipt for 1962-63 consists of income tax paid in respect of <i>(a)</i> the year 1962-63, <i>(b)</i> the year 1961-62 and <i>(c)</i> various earlier years.  The sur-tax receipt for 1962-63 consists of sur-tax paid in respect of (a) the year 1961-62, (b) the year 1960-61 and (c) various earlier years.</P>
    <P>As regards (b) of the question, it should be noted that there is no significant difference between second year figures and those for a full year.</P>

      <P>Since the introduction of the new form of customs tariff on 1st January, 1963, the accounts of the receipts from customs duties are kept under headings which are not directly comparable with those formerly in use.  Accordingly, it will not be possible to give particulars of revenue from customs duties for the whole year 1962-63 under all the headings shown in the reply to Question No. 93 of 10th April, 1962: particulars under all of those headings will be available only, in respect of the nine months ended 31st December, 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special accounting arrangements have, however, been made to preserve continuity in the statistics under certain headings, viz.: Beer, Clothing and <Col N="1158" /> Apparel, Fruit, Motor Vehicles, Newspapers and Periodicals, Mineral Hydrocarbon Light Oil, Hydrocarbon Oil (other sorts), Package Duty, Spirits (Brandy, Geneva, Rum, other sorts), Tobacco, Wine and Parcel Post.

    <P>The receipts from all other customs duties for the period January to March, 1963, are accounted for under the headings in the new Tariff.  Detailed figures in respect of receipts under these headings will not be available before 15th May, 1963.</P>

    <P>NOTE:</P>
    <P>(1)  The figure for the year 1962/63 is based on the estimate amount of rates collected in that year.</P>
    <P>(2)  The figures for the year 1960/61 are based on the 1956 Population Census and those for the years 1961/62 and 1962/63 on the Final Returns of the 1961 Census.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> (3)  The figures for 1961/62 differ slightly from the figures in reply dated 13th February 1963 viz. £8 4 7 (Dáil Debates, Vol. 199 No. 10 Cols. 1299-1300). The reason for the discrepancy is that the earlier figure was based on the preliminary returns of the 1961 Census. The figure given above is based on the Final Returns which have since become available and which show a population increase of 3,638 on that given in the earlier returns.</P>
