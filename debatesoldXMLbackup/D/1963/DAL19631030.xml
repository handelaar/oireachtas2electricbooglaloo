      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider holding a household budget inquiry similar to that held in this country in 1951-52 to ascertain changes in the pattern of household spending which have occurred over the past decade, and to ensure up-to-date and accurate calculation of the consumer price index figures.</P>

      <P>The acute shortage of technical staff in the Central Statistics Office has delayed the planning for the Household Budget Inquiry which it was proposed to start in 1963.  The situation in that respect has now improved somewhat and a start has been made on the necessary preliminary work.  It is hoped to begin the inquiry in 1964.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the restriction on marketing of wheat by farmers, whereby it is mandatory on them to sell the wheat to those from whom they get the sacks on hire; if he considers that that system is fair; and whether in fact it constitutes a restrictive practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers normally market their wheat through the firm from which sacks are hired but I am not aware that it is mandatory on them to do so.  There is no statutory provision to that effect and no complaint regarding the alleged restriction has reached my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that anyone who has got sacks this year in my county has found that he has been unable to market his wheat to any firm other than the firm issuing the sacks?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to tell the Deputy what the position is as far as I am concerned up to this moment. Apart from the question of whether or not the tendency is to sell the wheat to the firm from whom the sacks are procured, since there is a fixed price, fixed standards and a scale of fixed <Col N="518" /> charges for the collection of wheat, I cannot see how there could be very much in the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if a person offers his wheat to a certain merchant who says it is unmillable, if my allegation is true, the grower then has no further opportunity of offering for sale to another miller who might well say it is millable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Prices of barley in EEC countries are based on a system of target and intervention prices fixed at the wholesale stage.  These vary from country to country, and within countries, depending on the degree of regional surplus or deficit, seasonality, quality differentials and other factors. Wholesale target prices fixed for the 1963-64 season in the member States are approximately as follows: France, £27 to £32 12s. per ton; Belgium and Luxembourg, £31 10s. to £32 19s. per ton; Netherlands, £29 6s. per ton; Italy, £25 14s. per ton and Germany, £34 8s. per ton.  The prices relate to barley of specified standard, including a moisture content of 16 per cent. Prices actually received by farmers would of course be somewhat below those prices.</P>

      <P>Audited returns in respect of the year ended 30th June, 1961, were received from the Equitable Insurance Company on 30th September, 1961.  They were complete and complied in every respect with the Insurance Acts.  An examination of these returns did not show the company to be insolvent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Audited returns in respect of the year ended 30th June, 1962, were received <Col N="529" /> from the company on 3rd April, 1963. These returns were incomplete in certain respects and did not comply fully with the Insurance Acts.  An examination of these returns showed the company to be insolvent.</P>
    <P>As to the accuracy of these accounts, my Department relied in each case on the auditors' certificate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied now that the certificate signed by the directors in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1936, was accurate for the year ended June, 1961?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the directors of this company, as in the case of every other company, relied on the certificate of the auditors.  In so far as the certificate of the auditors might have been inaccurate as far as the accounts in the last year were concerned, to that extent, the directors' certificate was not correct.</P>

      <P>May we take it that if the loss incurred by the Equitable Insurance Company goes back prior to 1962, it might go back for a number of years?  Would the Minister be able to comment on that?  Is it possible that the losses incurred in this company could have gone back for the past two or three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Insurance companies incur losses from one year to another in different branches of insurance.  The losses they incur in one branch might be made up in another.  It is not possible at this stage to find out to what extent losses may have been incurred in one branch or another and to what extent they affected the solvency of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the company did eventually become insolvent, does the Department take <Col N="530" /> any steps to go back over the audited accounts of previous years in order to find out whether the assets and liabilities, as stated in these accounts are, in fact, an accurate representation of the position at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department and I as Minister have certain functions in relation to insurance companies, the main function being the issue of a licence to insurance companies to practise, as long as they make certain returns and when and as soon as these returns show a state of insolvency, it is my duty then to do certain things, including the appointment of an auditor.  Immediately on the returns indicating in this case that there was insolvency, I applied to the court for the appointment of an auditor and from there on, it is a matter for the auditor to make whatever examinations he deems fit under the direction of the court.  That is being done at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we accept the certificate issued by the directors for 1961, then it is apparent that between 1961 and the next audit, the sum of over £107,000 is missing.  If that certificate is correct in 1961, that loss of £107,000 has arisen within the past 12 to 18 months.  In those circumstances, would the Minister now have an inquiry carried out into this company on the same lines as the inquiry into Irish Estates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am having the most effective form of inquiry possible carried out, inasmuch as an auditor has been appointed by the High Court and the affairs of the company are now being administered and wound up under the direction of the High Court.  I do not think there could be a more searching inquisition than that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a difficult problem and, as I mentioned to the House some time ago, I have that matter under consideration at the <Col N="531" /> moment.  It is not easy to ascertain what the losses are in insurance business, what the extent of them is, but I am having inquiries made and the whole matter is still under consideration.</P>

An Order entitled The Tipperary (South Riding) Compulsory Purchase Order, 1963, which relates to the acquisition of land necessary for the purposes of the Dundrum Regional Water Supply Scheme, was received on 4th April, 1963, and on 19th August, 1963, a second Order, entitled The Tipperary (South Riding) Compulsory Purchase (Labourers Acts) No. 1 Order, 1963, which provides for the acquisition of 23 sites for the erection of labourers' cottages, was received. Objections to both orders were received by me, and it will be necessary to hold public local inquiries before the orders can be decided.  Arrangements for the holding of the inquiries are at present being made.</P>

    <Title>Turnover Tax. - Motion of No Confidence.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That in view of the widespread public opposition to the turnover tax, the Dáil is of opinion that the Government have lost the confidence of the people, and, therefore, considers that they should resign forthwith.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party have tabled this motion because they believe it is in the public interest that such a motion should be tabled.  The Labour Party further believes that it is the desire of the public that the turnover tax should be tested by the vote of the people.  I want to make it clear from the start that as far as the members of the Labour Party are concerned, the opposition to the Government in their policy in relation to the turnover tax which they express in this motion is not merely opposition for opposition's sake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say that the Labour Party while in opposition <Col N="545" /> have never engaged in the policy of opposing merely for the sake of opposing.  We have on many occasions, even within the lifetime of this Dáil, voted with the Government on measures which we believed coincided with the policy and views of the Labour Party.  On the other hand, we had no hesitation in opposing the Government on measures with which we violently disagreed and which were in contradiction of the Labour Party's policy.  Our opposition in this matter of the turnover tax is not motivated by hatred or spleen arising from past events, nor do we intend, nor is our motion motivated by any intention to cause disruption or mischief.  It is not so intended because we considered this deeply and at length before we did decide to call for the Government's resignation to try to ensure that the matter of the turnover tax would be put before the people for their decision.</P>
    <P>Our motion is directly related to the turnover tax and I want to say straight away that we challenge the right of the Government, a minority Government, to impose this tax in face of the over-whelming opposition of the people. They are a minority Government who are always supported by some independents.When this turnover tax was introduced in the Budget last April, we were astounded that such an unjust and inequitable tax should be imposed on the general public.  During the discussions on the various Budget Resolutions, and on the various stages of the Finance Bill, we in this Party endeavoured to have this tax withdrawn or amended drastically, but, as is known, our efforts were of no avail. The Government spokesman said they had no intention of withdrawing this tax and what is more peculiar still, they failed to give any indication whatsoever that they would agree to amend it, even in the most trivial way.  It seems that in a dictatorial manner the Fianna Fáil Party were determined to put this tax through, even though they were a minority Government, dependent on the votes of two Independent members of this House. Worse still, they were determined to put through this tax despite the obvious <Col N="546" /> strong feeling of a majority of the people.</P>
    <P>In all this matter, it seems that the views of the people have been ignored by the Fianna Fáil Party, nor were the Party impressed in any way by the spontaneous opposition of the people. One remarkable feature about the feeling of the public in this matter of the turnover tax is that none of the demonstrations, none of the statements by the various organisations, was prompted in any way by any of the political Parties on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>A description of the turnover tax has been attributed to the Taoiseach, the description of a bitter but wholesome pill.  Needless to remark, a bitter pill is not necessarily a wholesome pill and if this is a pill to improve the nation's economic health, I would suggest that the Taoiseach and his advisers have made the wrong diagnosis completely and, having made the wrong diagnosis, proceeded to prescribe the wrong cure.  This bitter pill which is wholesome &mdash; the phrase used &mdash; as a description of the turnover tax, could well, in my opinion and the opinion of the Labour Party, kill the patient.</P>
    <P>We are not impressed, nor are the people impressed by the fraudulent attempts to justify this tax.  The Minister for Finance made a speech on Saturday night in Dublin city and in his attempt to justify the turnover tax said that the abandonment of this tax would mean the abandoning of economic progress.  He said that the adverse balance of payments would provide a bigger difficulty than now, that there would be higher unemployment, higher emigration, et cetera.  Our memories are not so short that we can forget this day week when the Minister of Finance got the approval of this House for raising a loan of £25 million to be devoted to industrial and agricultural development.  In his own words, this £25 million would be used to develop agriculture, industry, housing, sanitary services, schools, forestry, fuel resources, transport and the like. Surely we had a Capital Budget this year which in itself provides for industrial <Col N="547" /> and agricultural development and general capital development?</P>
    <P>We refuse to believe, and it has been impossible for the Taoiseach and the Ministers of his Government to convince the people and us, that our economic development is dependent on the taxation of tea, bread, butter, sugar and flour and all these foodstuffs.  We refuse to believe it is necessary to tax all these essentials of life so that we can have economic growth in this country.  It is ludicrous for the Government spokesmen to present the turnover tax in that guise.  In any case, we were assured by the Taoiseach on many occasions that all the money that was needed for capital development was there.  He said that if there was a worthwhile project, whether in agriculture or in industry, nobody need worry about the money and in saying that on many occasions, the Taoiseach never once referred to the fact that it would be necessary to get that money by way of taxing essential foodstuffs and other things.  Now we are told that our economic progress is dependent on the pill of the turnover tax and it is necessary to tax such things as matches, lollipops, sweets, medicines and such articles.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was also reported in his speech of Saturday night, in his attempt to justify the turnover tax, as telling his audience, and incidentally the public generally, that the burden of taxation as between tax on profits and expenditure is equally divided.  That is misleading.  What he said in respect of this year is true, that the turnover tax this year up to 31st March will realise something like £3½ millions to £4 millions.  It is true to say that the tax on profits and a few other things will amount to somewhat the same, £4 millions.  The burden of taxation may be equally divided this year.  It is equally divided because the tax on profits is a tax on the whole year.  The turnover tax operates from 1st November to 31st March, but the burden will not be placed equally on profits and expenditure next year when the proportion will be £12 millions as their income from the turnover tax and <Col N="548" /> £4 millions from a tax on profits and a tax on the income from rents.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this is deceit on the part of Government spokesmen in an effort to pretend that all sections have their equal share of the burden of taxation. Such is not the case.  In any case, as I acknowledged before, the Government have been pretty explicit with regard to their broad policy on taxation.  They have said on innumerable occasions in the past 12 months that their policy is to shift the burden from direct to indirect taxation.  I have said that as far as the Labour Party are concerned we oppose especially that basic principle.My interpretation of that is that the Government's intention is to lessen the tax on wealth and high incomes and to increase the tax on the public in relation to practically everything they buy.  That policy is demonstrated in their surtax demand.</P>
    <P>This Government, in their effort to shift the burden from direct to indirect taxation, have decreased the rate of surtax in recent years and increased the level at which surtax is paid.  I was amazed yesterday to hear, I think, the Minister for Finance in reply to a Parliamentary Question, say that the numbers of those paying surtax had fallen from 10,000 about five years ago to 4,000 now.  Is it seriously suggested, therefore, that that is an example of an equitable distribution of taxation?  The Government have, in effect, thrown away money &mdash; granted, not a lot of money but it is something that would add to the finances of the country.</P>
    <P>The stock justification for the introduction of the turnover tax is social welfare.  I would say that that, also, is designed to deceive.  It has been represented by members and supporters of the Government, that if the turnover tax is not introduced, then those who vote against the turnover tax are depriving old age pensioners, sick people, unemployed people, widows and all those in receipt of social welfare benefits of the increases proposed in the Budget.</P>
    <P>Will any member of the Government tell us if all this money will go to social welfare, as has been represented by some of their spokesmen? <Col N="549" /> The Government want to give the impression that their policy in the past two or three years has been to increase social welfare benefits.  I acknowledge the increases that have been given.  I gladly acknowledge that in the past four, five or six Budgets some increases have been given to the Social Welfare Vote.  But, then, Fianna Fáil speakers always told the House when increases were sought that, as more money came in, more would be spent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil speakers, whilst in Government, agreed that the social welfare benefits were low and should be improved.  But they said &mdash; their Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare and the Taoiseach said &mdash; in effect: &ldquo;If we get more money by way of tax revenue, we shall devote more money to social welfare.&rdquo;  They have not done that; they have not done that particularly this year.</P>
    <P>I want to refer the Taoiseach to Table 3 in the pre-Budget Tables issued to members of this House.  In 1961-62, total Government revenue amounted to £151.7 million: £25.7 million was devoted to social welfare, representing 16.9 per cent.  In 1962-63, total Government revenue amounted to £163.5 million; £27.9 million was devoted to social welfare, representing 17.1 per cent.  That was an increase of .2 per cent.  However, in 1963-64, it is estimated, according to Government sources, that the total tax revenue will be £181.6 million and that, of that, £13.6 million will be devoted to social welfare &mdash; representing 16.9 per cent of total Government revenue.  These figures &mdash; the Government's figures &mdash; demonstrate to me that, at a time when they are asking taxpayers to pay so much, the recipients of social welfare benefits are getting a smaller share of the cake.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, we had been led to believe by the Government that if they got more money, they could afford to devote more money to those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  I acknowledge what has been done this year in respect of the increases.  However, I remember times when Governments introduced new taxation in order to get, say, £1 million, £2 million, <Col N="550" /> £3 million or £5 million and in most of those situations, certain increases were given to those, say, in receipt of old age pensions.</P>
    <P>I remember when extra taxation was raised and when, after the Budget was balanced, there was a surplus of £1 million or £2 million.  We now have a situation where the Government propose to raise £16 million, £17 million or £18 million and still there is the same old 2/6 to the old age pensioners. Therefore, if this turnover tax is intended, as it has been represented, to do much more for recipients of social welfare benefits, I hold that more than the 2/6 should have been given to those in receipt of old age pensions.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, as well, that the withdrawal of the turnover tax would retard economic growth.  We are supposed to be frightened by these announcements by the Taoiseach and various Ministers of the Government. I suggest that the introduction and operation of the turnover tax could do serious damage to the economy and that the Government will be held responsible.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that there must be wage and salary increases as a result of the introduction of this tax. We were told of the concern of many of the Ministers of the Government about the eighth round of wage increases.We heard allegations by them as to how it damaged the economy.  We were warned that if the trade union movement looked for a ninth round, or were unreasonable in looking for wage or salary increases, great harm could be done to the economy.  Here we have a situation in which, by deliberate act of the Government, prices will be increased to such an extent that there will have to be a ninth round as far as wages and salary increases are concerned &mdash; and this will not be the responsibility of the trade union movement or of the National Industrial Economic Council.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises that in view of the introduction of this tax, with the consequent increases in prices all round, wage and salary earners will have to compensate themselves for the increase in the cost of living that will <Col N="551" /> undoubtedly come, because they are not prepared, nor should they be expected, to accept a lower standard of living with the introduction of this tax.  It is very difficult to assess the effect on the cost of living index figure of the introduction of this tax.  It was naïvely suggested at first that it could not be any more than 2½ per cent.  The Taoiseach said in this House on one occasion, either in June or in April, that the traders would absorb, if not all, part of the 2½ per cent.  In view of recent announcements, in view of recent positive increases by traders, there is certainly no evidence that traders or others will absorb any part of the 2½ per cent turnover tax.</P>
    <P>We asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce and we asked various spokesmen of the Government during the debate on the Budget if there would be price control.  As far as I can gather, the policy of the Government is, and always has been, that they should not interfere at all in prices: that, by dint of competition, prices would find their own level and that, by dint of competition, not alone would the 2½ per cent turnover tax be absorbed but there would be a greater incentive to traders to compete, to such an extent that maybe existing prices would be lowered.</P>
    <P>I gather that the Government are totally opposed to price control.  They went through the motions of pretending to have convictions arising out of price control when they introduced the Prices Act, 1958.  As far as I can gather, that Act was put into some pigeonhole and has not been taken out for the past five years.  There has never been an investigation of prices, under this Act, within the past five years.  Must we accept, therefore, that the Government's view has been that all price increases in the past five years have been justified?  Was there ever a single instance where the Government or some of their agents decided that an increase had to be investigated?  The Prices Control Act, 1938, was not anything like what the Labour Party wanted at the time, and they told that to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in no uncertain <Col N="552" /> terms when the Bill was going through this House.  In any case, we accepted it for what it was because it was the decision of this House.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions assured the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government of their co-operation in respect of the limited price control machinery and accepted the invitation of the Government to nominate some of their members to act on these investigation committees.Not once was any member of Congress on these committees invited to act in respect of any price increase.  So much so that in the past two years, Congress, representing hundreds of thousands of workers, have refused to nominate anybody, thus showing their utter contempt of Government policy &mdash; or should I say, lack of policy &mdash; in respect of price control.</P>
    <P>Even with the introduction of the turnover tax, with the evidence the Minister must have in his Department, with the evidence he sees daily in the newspapers and in the shops, of price increases, there still seems to be a reluctance to exercise any sort of price control.  The Minister was questioned in the Budget debate and he said he did not see any necessity for price control at that time.  He said weakly that, if he thought there were circumstances in which he should intervene, he would intervene.  Last week, he had questions from various members of the Labour Party and other Opposition Deputies asking him if he was prepared to investigate the increases that had taken place in the prices of certain articles over the past few weeks.  Again, he seemed very reluctant to do anything.  He made a weak threat to people that, if they carried on like this, he would be forced to do something.  He did not seem to me to be very positive about it or to be very strong in his desire to see there would not be undue increases in prices.</P>
    <P>Then we had this milk-and-water statement from the Minister through the Government Information Bureau last week.  It was a pathetic plea to manufacturers and industrialists to explain their increases.  I never saw a weaker statement in all my life.  He <Col N="553" /> wanted the industrialists to tell the people how the increases were made up. Of course, they could tell them, but the Minister did not say whether or not he would accept the explanation given by these people or, if dissatisfied with them, that he would have the price increases investigated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce does not yet seem to believe that there have been price increases in recent weeks, increases agreed among certain groups, increases that will not be the subject of any competition but will be permanent because groups of traders in this or that business have met and agreed that the price of articles will be increased in all cases by much more than 2½ per cent.  Yet the Government refuse to act in a case like that and expect the workers to restrain themselves as far as wage increases are concerned.  Many of the increases in the prices of foodstuffs in recent weeks have been described as increases in anticipation of demands for increased wages.  As a result, some of these increases have ranged from five per cent to 7½ per cent and ten per cent.  It is inevitable that workers and salary earners will look for increases to compensate for these increased prices, and we all know the traders will then put on a further increase to compensate for the wage increases negotiated.All this will be the responsibility of the Government and will happen despite the best intentions of the members of the National Industrial Economic Council.  If, as the Government say, they want an orderly pattern of wage and salary increases, they have certainly gone the wrong way about it with the introduction of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The main general plea of the Government seems to be that the money is needed.  I can see that it is needed for certain things, but the Government's policy as far as taxation is concerned seems to be to get the money by hook or by crook, on the principle that the end justifies the means.  A Government's job is not that simple.  The end-product is desirable, but the means must also be given equal <Col N="554" /> consideration.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach &mdash; I am sure he has the information available to him and I have not &mdash; how many countries in the world tax food.  How many countries in the world tax bread?  Bread, which is regarded as the bare essential of life, is taxed by us in this country.  Yet we go abroad and tell certain well-heeled businessmen how prosperous the country is and how prosperous it is going to be, but never tell them we have to tax the bread, butter, tea, sugar and flour of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must remember it is only a few years since the Fianna Fáil Government found it desirable to subsidise tea, bread, butter, sugar and flour to the extent of £12 million or £13 million.  Has the standard of living and have earnings so improved that we now should find it necessary to tax these same commodities &mdash; that from subsidising them to the extent of £12 million or £13 million, we should now tax them to probably the same extent, apart from taxing clothing, footwear, household utensils, hire-purchase transactions at 2½ per cent, or more when it is reflected in the price?</P>
    <P>The Government say it is a sound policy to tax expenditure.  What sort of expenditure do they mean?  They say it is sound policy to tax expenditure in order that the people may save. Are the people expected to save by reason of a tax on bread?  Are the people expected to deny themselves bread and meat in order that they may save?  Surely that would be false economy, so false that even the Minister for Health, as Minister for Health, would recognise it would be very bad policy to tax the people in respect of commodities so essential to life.  Is it sound policy to tax food and medicines at the rate of 2½ per cent and, at the same time, to tax at the rate of 2½ per cent motor cars, jewellery, furs, expensive clothes and luxury electrical appliances?  Surely that sort of tax could not be equitable or just&mdash;to make the loaf of bread subject to a turnover tax of 2½ per cent and a Jaguar car subject also to the same percentage of tax?</P>
    <P>Medicines are taxed.  Is the Government's general policy to tax medicines, <Col N="555" /> medical appliances and drugs on the principle that if there is a tax on expenditure, people will save more? Does the Taoiseach know that while medicines are taxed, veterinary medicines are not?  If a member of the family, boy or girl, wife or husband, is sick and gets a prescription from the family doctor and presents it to the chemist, he or she is expected to pay 2½ per cent or more, and this in order to ensure that a child will be cured of a heavy cold, pneumonia or other disease or illness in order that we may develop our agriculture and industry. If, however, somebody buys veterinary medicine in bulk to cure a pig, a cow or a horse, there is no turnover tax and this is an equitable and just tax! If one wants to buy medicine for greyhounds to ensure that they will go either faster or slower, there is no 2½ per cent tax but if you want to cure pneumonia or rid a child of disease, you are subject to 2½ per cent or, as will happen, much more than that.</P>
    <P>How can the public be expected to consider that these bitter pills are wholesome?  The Government do not want to talk about these things.  They prefer to be doctrinaire and speak broadly about industrial and agricultural development, the adverse balance of payments and investment abroad and at home.  The people are concerned about the things I mention, and which Fianna Fáil will not talk about: the price of butter which we are told through the newspapers is to be increased by twopence a lb.; the price of sugar which it is announced will be increased by ½d. a lb.; the price of tea which is to go up 4d. a lb.; the price of soap which is to go up 2d. a lb.; and coal which, it is reported, is to be increased by £2 per ton and that £2 per ton will apply to tens of thousands of tons of coal imported about six months ago and are now to make a profit for those who brought them over and above the normal.</P>
    <P>Petrol is to go up by 1½d. per gallon. The people are concerned about these things and it is just a bit too thick for us to accept, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce tries to tell us, that all this coincides with the <Col N="556" /> increase &mdash; say, in respect of soap &mdash; in the cost of raw materials.  Cigarettes are to go up by 2d. per packet; the pint and the bottle of stout by 1d. to 2d.; whiskey, by 2d. per glass.</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech said very definitely that, in his opinion and that of the Revenue Commissioners, all these things have reached saturation point, meaning that if taxation were increased any further, consumption would go down.  Now the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach do not seem to be concerned with the fact that these articles are being increased in price.  The 2d. on the packet of cigarettes would give, I think, over £2 million, perhaps £2.5 million, but the Government do not want that money.  The ld., as far as I am aware, yields about £1 million on cigarettes and tobacco but the Government would get only 2½ per cent. Where would the remainder go?  Are the Government prepared to throw that away to traders and manufacturers?  I think it was daft for the Minister for Finance to talk of these things reaching saturation point.  Those who want to smoke will continue to do so and pay the extra 2d. and, in my opinion, it would be far better that they should pay it to the Minister for Finance to do certain things with which the economy of the country is concerned rather than put extra profits into the pockets of those who deal in cigarettes.</P>
    <P>We are reminded, as if it were something new, by the Minister for Finance that as far as the people are concerned, all taxes are unpopular.  We know that: nobody wants to pay more no matter what section of the community he belongs to, but surely a tax on all things is a bit too thick and is something which I am sure the backbench members of Fianna Fáil do not support.  A significant thing about the turnover tax is that while the Taoiseach has energetically defended this tax and behaved energetically in other directions and while some Ministers have attempted to defend the tax in a broad way, I have not heard any defence at all by those in the back benches.  Whether that is loyalty, mistaken loyalty, or <Col N="557" /> sheepishness, I do not know, but if this were a good thing, if it were all the things it is claimed to be by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the backbenchers would be on their feet week after week in its defence.They do not defend it because they do not believe it is just and equitable.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in accordance with his own peculiar strategy, proposes an amendment to the motion put down by the Labour Party and there we have expressed in the first line or two the Taoiseach's usual indignation, the usual Simon Pure attitude &mdash; everything that is good is on that side, everything that is pure.  The interest of the nation is on the Fianna Fáil side; they are the custodians of all things progressive, all things national, and anybody who attempts to put down a motion such as we have down, is irresponsible and mischievous.</P>
    <P>There is also contained in this amendment an allegation or insinuation that we in the Labour Party with other members of the Opposition opposed every proposal in the Finance Act, 1963.  The Taoiseach knows that is &ldquo;cod&rdquo;: we did not.  The Taoiseach knows, and the Minister for Finance knows particularly, that we approved, as did members of other Parties, the continuation of the taxes already there.  We supported vocally the corporation profits tax and we were prepared to walk into the division lobbies with Fianna Fáil, if there was a division on that matter, and we said that.  We supported the increase in the tax on profits from rents vocally and expressed our willingness to vote with Fianna Fáil if a division were called for.  We also strongly supported vocally the proposals by the Minister for Finance and the regulations to prevent tax evasion and this to the tune of £4 million which incidentally would exactly pay for all the social welfare increases proposed to be given in any 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has his own strategy and he is long enough a member of the House and the Government to be able to employ the best strategy, but I would describe this amendment as the <Col N="558" /> last throw of a desperate gambler.  I do not know if he means to be deliberately deceitful but this amendment in which he alleges irresponsibility and so on on the part of the Labour Party is something that the public certainly will not accept from him.  I suppose the Labour Party do not come into that.  It is silly, I think, for the Taoiseach to suggest also in his amendment that agricultural and industrial development is dependent on the turnover tax.  If that is so, will he say in his reply how much of the turnover tax is to be devoted to capital development?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says he is determined not to go to the country.  Who does he expect to applaud him for saying that? There is no particular merit or virtue in the Taoiseach being determined to hang on to office, in view of his slim majority, or what may turn out to be tonight no majority at all.  Of course he is determined not to go to the country.  Again, as if there were some merit or virtue in it, he says he will not walk out on the job?  Who does he think he would be displeasing if he walks out on the job?  As far as I know, the consensus of opinion in the country is that people want the Government to be tested; they want to have an opportunity of passing judgment on the Taoiseach and his colleagues and on Government policy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach seems to think, as some of his predecessors seemed to think, that he and his Party have a divine right to rule.  As I said earlier, they seem to imagine that nobody else has any interest in this country, that nobody else is nationally-minded, that all these virtues are enshrined in the hearts and minds of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I think it is shameful that the Taoiseach has stayed on so long in view of the many adverse decisions given against him in the past six or nine months.  The Labour Party did not win the Dublin North-East by-election.  Neither did the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Fine Gael candidate won the election; but whether it was the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party won it, the decisive factor in that election was the rejection of the turnover tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach at that stage should have had regard to the minds of the people, should have had regard to the wishes of the people, and should have, at that stage, decided to test the turnover tax at the polls.  Any other Government I know of in such circumstances, and with no majority, would surely let the people decide.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach &mdash; let me refer to it once more &mdash; suggests in his amendment that we are irresponsible and mischievous.If he really thinks we are irresponsible and mischievous, if he thinks that the people think we are irresponsible and mischievous, why does he not let the people decide?  If we are so irresponsible and so mischievous, then the people will soon cut us down to size and increase the numbers in the Fianna Fáil Party.  If, on the other hand, the Taoiseach and his Party are so confident of their policy, if they are so confident that the turnover tax is so popular, if they are confident that the people believe the turnover tax is necessary to do all the things the Taoiseach says will be done in this amendment, surely the logical thing, surely the honest thing, surely the easiest thing for the Taoiseach to do is to go to the country?</P>
      <P>I do not know if he is so confident about all these things.  In view of the fact that he has not an absolute majority of his own Party, would it not be in his own interests &mdash; if I may be permitted to give him advice &mdash; to go to the country and, if he is so confident, he may return with a comfortable majority?  If it is desirable to go to the country with favourable proposals, then I think it is only right and honest to consult the people on an issue about which there is such strong feeling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not say the Taoiseach has abused power.  I would say he probably is a man who is fond of power, but the Taoiseach seems to me to think that, when he gets power from the people, or from a majority of this House, that power is absolute power. The power the Taoiseach, or any Taoiseach, gets is delegated power, and he gets that from the people; and the people are entitled to demand that that <Col N="560" /> power be given back to them so that they may, at a general election, either delegate it again to the present Taoiseach or delegate it to some other person or some other Party.</P>
    <P>We put down this motion because we believe, as I said, that it is in the public interest that this should be done.  We believe the public want to be placed in the position in which they can adjudicate on the turnover tax.  It is for that reason and the many other reasons I have given in my speech that we call now on the Government to resign and to give the people an opportunity of making their decision as to whether or not the turnover tax should be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. It is quite correct to say that the Taoiseach finds himself in a completely different position from that of his predecessor.Time was in 1932 and 1933, in 1937 and 1938, in 1943 and 1944 when a Fianna Fáil Government Taoiseach, not satisfied with a majority, always decided on kicking over the traces within 12 months in order to increase his majority.  The present Taoiseach and the present Fianna Fáil Government have broken with one custom of the past, namely, stampeding everyone at a particular time because they thought it suited them.</P>
      <P>From the Taoiseach's statements and from the statements of many members of the Government, we are, apparently, living in most pleasant circumstances at the moment.  Reading his speeches abroad and the speeches of his Ministers, when they are abroad, the theme song is very like that popular number &ldquo;Island in the Sun&rdquo;.  In the United States, we had the Taoiseach recently depicting the wonderful advantages in this Island in the Sun of his.  We have had Ministers on the continent availing of their opportunities, when sightseeing, of course, to explain to the people in far-off lands the wonderful advantages given by the Fianna Fáil Government to people who come into this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach rather overstepped himself in the United States when he stooped so low as to make comparisons between the different political Parties <Col N="561" /> in these Twenty-Six Counties and his own Party and that at a time when he was paid by this State to represent those Twenty-Six Counties.  However, all that seems to be but part and parcel of the policy of the Government, a policy of attacking everyone as frequently as possible so that eventually all will get tired of the attack.</P>
    <P>In this Island in the Sun canvas painted by Fianna Fáil things are growing rosier and pleasanter and agents employed by Fianna Fáil are inviting industrialists from other countries to come in here and set up establishments here.  No return will be asked from them and, at the same time, Irish employers and Irish workers are put in jeopardy year after year because of tariff reductions to help the foreigner. On top of that, this 2½ per cent tax will be imposed on the worker in the factory, the worker who may be told in a week or two that his job is at stake because of imports.  The worker is told it will be all right for him to pay this 2½ per cent tax on foodstuffs for his family, on clothing for his family, on all the necessaries of life for his family.  That is apparently one of the sane policies of the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I know that for the past few years the Taoiseach and his many supporters were most vehement in condemning the workers.  They attacked them over what was termed the eighth round of wage increases.  Ministers of State told the workers that it was important that there should be some restraint, because, as the workers were told, the giving of increases in wages would impair the position of the country on the export market.</P>
    <P>What is happening now?  Fianna Fáil, under the Taoiseach, are now forcing the workers into the position of having, of necessity, to demand an increase in wages to protect their families against the rise in prices which has already been so noticeable and to which will be added from Friday onwards the 2½ per cent tax.  Then we are told by the Taoiseach, his Ministers and supporters, that unless we are competitive, unless the workers remain silent and do not ask for an increase, we will have no hope of getting a <Col N="562" /> foothold in the markets of other countries.If we lose our trade in these foreign markets, it can be said that it started on 1st November, 1963, the day the Fianna Fáil Government introduced the 2½ per cent tax on the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish drew particular attention to the amendment &mdash; we will call it such &mdash; by the Taoiseach where he speaks of the irresponsible and mischievous actions of certain political parties, but the irony of the situation is where the Taoiseach implies that apparently the line we are taking would interfere with the maintenance of the present public services.  Did not a Fianna Fáil Government, an inter-Party Government and a Cumann na nGaedheal Government continue to provide the services without imposing a 2½ per cent tax?  Did not the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Government last year provide for the maintenance of the public services without the 2½ per cent tax?  Did they tell the public at the last election that it would be essential for them to impose such a burden on the workers by increasing, through Government action, the cost of living so that so-called services might be continued, services that could be questioned perhaps, services that could be pared down?  I have in mind such things as our embassies abroad. It may be said by the Taoiseach that we may not save much, but let us not forget the words of Harry Lauder when in song he advised: &ldquo;Always take care of the penny: it will turn into pounds some day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is not interested in the pennies but in the millions, and the easier they are got, the easier they are spent.  We are not satisfied that the money, even at this stage, is being properly spent.  We know that from various sources, including the Department of Health, but that is another matter.  The Taoiseach instead of examining the position and finding out on whom he can call to pay the little extra, decides that the easiest thing of all is to make the old age pensioner and the worker pay.</P>
    <P>Long before now I accused the Taoiseach and I do so again.  I am referring to the question of price control. <Col N="563" /> Deputy Corish said that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a half-hearted or timid way suggested last week that if prices continued to soar, he would do something about it.  We had in this country a Prices Advisory Body.  Does the Taoiseach remember his remarks about that in 1958?  Does the Taoiseach not now admit that by his very actions at that time in what we may truly say was disbanding that important organisation, he let prices gradually rise until now we are faced with a situation in which they have got completely out of hand?  Here are the Government responsible for the workers having to fight for the eighth round of wage increases because of the Government's inactivity.  Having regard to so many increases in all costs, whether in regard to foodstuffs, clothing, housebuilding or anything else, the very inactivity of the Government in connection with price control was such that they are now faced with a dilemma which they know to be anything but pleasant.</P>
    <P>By the middle of this month, the index figure will show us increases in the cost of living.  The Taoiseach, or one of the Ministers, stated today that in comparison roughly with the August-September period, the cost-of-living had increased by a little over 1½ per cent, but I am convinced that in the middle of this month, when we get the next figure, we will find, because of the numerous increases in the past six, seven or eight weeks alone, that the cost-of-living will have soared steeply.  The irony of it all is that the Government who failed to make any attempt to protect the body dealing with the control of prices is the very Government who are going to gain most by increased prices.</P>
    <P>They tell us feebly that if prices are inclined to go much higher, they will do something.  Why should they?  If the legitimate price of a certain article is 7/6d, the shopkeeper will pay on that 2½ per cent to the Government If, because of lack of competition, the shopkeeper can charge 10/- for it or, better still, if he can charge 12/- and get away with it, he will pay 2½ per cent on that to the Government. <Col N="564" /> Therefore, we are now in the extraordinary situation where the higher the prices charged, the better it is for the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance suggested in connection with the Budget that the 2½ per cent tax will bring in approximately £10 million in the year.  He based his figures on the general cost-of-living and the general charges for all commodities, but the greater the increase in the sale price, the more the Minister will profit by it.  I am convinced that it was most dishonest for the Minister at the time to suggest that the Government might make £9 million or £10 million when in actual fact by their own inactivity in connection with price control and by their encouragement in relation to increases in prices, they hoped to get, and probably will get, if they are left in office, not alone £10 million but perhaps some £18 million or £19 million.</P>
    <P>At that time, when the question was being discussed on the Budget in this House in the April-May period, one of the frontbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party said there was nothing to stop these traders &mdash; or perhaps he meant Fianna Fáil would not stop them &mdash; increasing prices up to 40 per cent.  That is the whole kernel of the matter.  At the present time, the Taoiseach cannot find a way out of it. I said before, and I say it again, that I believe that outside of Parties, all others are entitled to vote any way they wish.  The Independents are entitled to do what they like.  Let us not forget they must ultimately account, not to the House, but to their constituents.</P>
    <P>I recall one Independent who supported the Government at the time. Perhaps he believed in it himself.  He went out of his way to show that the increase of 2½ per cent would only cost the old age pensioner, who got an increase of 2/6d, tenpence and that the balance would be profit.  Now let us take the present position.  Perhaps that member may be prepared to re-examine his statement in the light of present costs as against those at the time he made his statement.  Surely the old age pensioner &mdash; I am speaking <Col N="565" /> more particularly of rural areas as against other areas &mdash; is entitled to a bag of coal?  That has gone up 2/-already, plus another 2½ per cent. Surely the old age pensioner, as Deputy Corish mentioned here, must of necessity provide himself with the wherewithal to eat and live?</P>
    <P>We have seen that the 2-lb. loaf of bread is to be increased by 1½d.  The old age pensioner living on his own would hardly get a 2-lb. loaf at a time. He would probably get a 1-lb. loaf and that may go up by three-farthings. Are farthings in circulation at the present time?  Oh, no.  The price will go up a penny.  The shopkeeper may gain a farthing by the increase, but, if he does, that will ultimately come back to the Government and the Government are a party to the robbing of the old age pensioner by that over-charging.The same must be said with regard to the increase in the pound of butter and the increase in the pint of milk for these old people.  There is no such thing, of course, as 2½ per cent for them.</P>
    <P>In many cases it will work out at a much higher rate because the local shopkeeper will probably not be anxious to deal in halfpence.  He certainly will not have farthings.  He will make it the round penny.  Do not let anyone suggest that if there is a halfpenny over that, he will give it to the customer.  He will keep it for himself, but, by every overcharge on the part of the shopkeeper, the Government are gaining falsely.  Therefore, this Independent member must now understand that with the increase in the price of bread, tea, sugar, butter, milk and the bag of coal, the 2/6d. the old age pensioner gets is gone long before he can lay his hand on it.  Therefore, we must start off by admitting that the 2½ per cent tax is a burden &mdash; a severe burden &mdash; upon the people who in the winter of their lives, should at least be entitled to some consideration by any Government in this State.</P>
    <P>As well as the old age pensioners, we naturally have the case of the rural workers, the farm workers, the road workers and other allied workers.  We know that in the rural areas the wage structure is on a pretty low level.  Unfortunately, <Col N="566" /> it may actually differ in cities and industrial areas but in the rural areas, £6 per week is the average wage.  There is no doubt about that. Take the case of a man with a young family.  How many loaves of bread will a young family eat in a week?  Is the breadwinner to deny them a bit of butter?  Must they use margarine? What about clothing for the children? We are told by the Fianna Fáil Party, by the Taoiseach and his Ministers that in their case the couple of shillings in the children's allowances will make all the difference.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party know that they are fooling the people.  The trouble is that they are fooling the Irish people.  I do not mind the Taoiseach going to America or the continent and talking about the beautiful Island in the Sun but I object to his taking out of the pocket of the worker in rural Ireland at the end of the week 2½ per cent increase in the charge for the food he has to get for his children in order to keep the Government going on what the Taoiseach states in his amendment is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish made it perfectly clear that it is not so long since the Taoiseach stated in this House that there is no shortage of money for any work of a capital nature.  The money is there.  We are told that very often but now of course the shoe is on the other foot.  In order to protect themselves against the people who are the victims, the people outside the House on the low wage structure, in order to try to fool these people, Fianna Fáil now tell us this is not the story.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish drew particular attention to another very important aspect of the matter &mdash; but let us fill in the picture a little further.  Let us take the case of people needing medicines, drugs and tablets.  Again, we have in our towns and villages as well as in our cities, borderline cases &mdash; the people who are refused medical cards. What about the huge increase now imposed on them at a time of illness? At least the unfortunate man who is lucky to have a medical card may have some kind of protection as <Col N="567" /> regards medicines but the other person who is just over the borderline, the man whom the county manager cuts out, the man who has no card, black, white or blue, has to pay dearly for these tablets, drugs and medicines.  They were dear enough before, but now we are imposing at least another 2½ per cent on them. Some of us know, perhaps to our grief, what hardship this may cause in times of illness.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides know what the effects of this tax will be in such cases but the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Government are prepared even at this late stage to insist that these people shall pay more in their efforts to fight the dreadful diseases from which they may suffer.  It is hard lines when a so-called Republican Government, a so-called Christian, democratic Government are prepared to sacrifice the rights of those people by such a vicious imposition.</P>
    <P>Relating my remarks to the rural areas, the ordinary workers, even those who may enjoy the protection of medical cards, will suffer from this new imposition.  Even though they may live in small houses, hundreds of thousands of them are ratepayers and of course will be obliged to pay increased rates because this 2½ per cent must be recouped by local authorities for increased charges in hospitalisation and in other spheres of local administration.On 9th July last, a member of this House who shall remain unnamed said, and I quote from column 410 of Volume 204 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>If it were purely a question of increases in income tax or a specific tax directed to foodstuffs, I think an increase in income tax might be more equitable.</P>
    <P>That word &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; sounds bad to some of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>But not to Fianna Fáil, apparently.  They cannot have it both ways.  Surely this is a direct imposition on people who can least <Col N="568" /> afford to pay, on the unfortunate man to whom a shilling is as valuable as a pound is to a richer man.  Therefore, this is a most inequitable charge and I must now say of it that it is the product of a policy which is unjust, unchristian and inequitable as far as the working people are concerned.  Surely then the Taoiseach must realise whither he is sailing.</P>
      <P>Last week in this House, we listened to an announcement which I thought had a touch of irony about it.  We were being asked for a £25 million loan.  The banks and insurance companies, of course, are jumping at the offer because they will get 5¾ per cent, a tidy bit more than the 2½ per cent which the directors of these companies and banks who can well afford it will have to pay by way of turnover tax.</P>
      <P>In recent years, we have listened to both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance lambasting the ordinary workers, urging them to commit themselves to small savings which, they say, are very important.  I know hundreds of old people who are paying 6d. and 1/- a week into insurance policies to help, as they say, to give them a decent burial.  These are their total savings and they find, even when they live to enjoy it, that they may get less than their capital back.  Now those unfortunate people, scraping and indeed starving to pay this 6d. or 1/-, find themselves straddled with this turnover tax &mdash; these people who have been paying these small amounts to provide against having to end their days in the district hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are the people who will suffer most from this 2½ per cent tax; they are the people who will have to pay 2/- plus 2½ per cent for a bag of coal. To the others, the wealthy people, the Fianna Fáil Government say: &ldquo;We will be generous; we will give them 5¾ per cent; the State cannot do without them&rdquo;.  How can we say in this Chamber that we are acting in accordance with Christian teaching when we ask the weaker and poorer sections of the community to pay the last halfpenny they have while we see others living in the lap of luxury?  That is what the Government and the <Col N="569" /> Taoiseach are doing and encouraging, and they cannot deny it.</P>
    <P>One Minister last week, in a sort of taunt at the Opposition, said in a jocose manner that we were afraid of an election, that we did not want an election.  Let us all be honest and say that when it comes down to brrasstacks as human beings, none of us wants an election, but there is this difference between our political philosophy and that of Fianna Fáil &mdash; I suppose the Fine Gael policy does not differ from ours in this respect&mdash;that we completely disagree with the Fianna Fáil Taoiseach who said that the only time for an election in Ireland is when it suits Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Our philosophy is directly opposite to that.  We realise we are members of this House, thanks to the decision of the general public.  We do not believe &mdash; we have no right to believe and no right to shirk our responsibilities &mdash; that if it suits us, we should try our utmost to stay here as long as we can. It is what happens outside this Chamber that must concern us most. It is the economic conditions and the social conditions of the people throughout the length and breadth of the Twenty-six Counties that must be our main concern.  Therefore, let the Taoiseach understand that where we part company with Fianna Fáil policy is when they say that there should be no election &ldquo;until it suits us&rdquo;.  We say there should be an election when the general public demand it and when, in the interest of honesty in public life and of the wellbeing of this country, a general election is demanded of the Government.</P>

      <P>In moving the amendment which appears on the Order Paper in my name, as Deputy Corish facilitated the House by reading out the terms of his motion, and as I do not want to be outdone in courtesy, I propose now to read out mine.  I move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the Dáil, regarding as irresponsible and mischievous the action of <Col N="570" /> certain political parties in continuing to oppose the tax arrangements made in the Finance Act, 1963, without proposing alternative taxation to provide for the maintenance of the public services; for their extension in the spheres of education, health, housing, and social welfare; and for the fulfilment of the Government's Programme for the nation's agricultural and industrial development and social progress, confirms its support for the Government and urges them to proceed with the vigorous implementation of their Programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put down this amendment to give Deputies the opportunity and indeed the obligation to make known to the Dáil what they stand for, not merely what they stand against.  We are all against taxes.  Most of us are against sin also, but there is this difference: we can avoid sin if we try hard enough but we cannot avoid taxes.  We realise here, as well as Deputies opposite realise, that people do not like taxes. We know that, if they are told they can avoid increases of taxation by voting against the Government who imposed them, their disposition is always to do so.</P>
    <P>This is the political situation which the Opposition Parties are now trying to exploit to their own advantage.  I am not criticising them for that.  That is the game of Party politics as they understand it and play it.  Neither am I blaming them for their effort to take advantage at this time of a temporary vacancy in the Government Party, due to the death of one of the Government Party members.  My criticism of the Opposition Parties is that they are in this matter completely dishonest and deceptive, that in trying to play on the people's dislike of new taxation, they are not presenting the other side of the picture.  They are not telling the people what lower taxation and lower spending on Government services mean to the ordinary people, the ordinary people about whom they are professing to be concerned.</P>
    <P>No country can pull down its spending on desirable and necessary Government services, or reduce the pay of its <Col N="571" /> public officials, without suffering adverse economic and social consequences, and those who recommend that course to the Dáil and to the country are under obligation to discuss these consequences.  I do not think it is the Government who are on the defensive in this debate.  It is the negative, defeatist attitude of the Opposition Parties which is under criticism.  It is the Deputies opposite who are, in my view at least, in need to defend themselves to the people and to history.  We have mapped out the country's road ahead to higher levels of economic and social standards and it is the Deputies opposite who want to divert the country into the bog of confusion and indecision.  The duty of justification is on them, not on us.</P>
    <P>This country spends on its public services a smaller proportion of its national income than most other countries, certainly most other European countries.  The proportion of our national income earmarked for public services, turnover tax and everything else, is not any higher than it has been; and by no standard of comparison can this country be described as being overtaxed.We all want better and more extensive public services, more development in agriculture and in industry, more Government help in stimulating that development, better farm supports, better housing, better social welfare benefits, better health and better education.  We want to have these services here as good as those enjoyed in any other country.  It is right that we should want them; it is right that we should strive to get them.  There is nothing unworthy in wanting them, provided we can secure them by our own efforts.</P>
    <P>This Government have regarded as their main duty that of organising the country's social and economic development so that these benefits will be made possible and we assumed, and I think rightly, that the people of the country desire this progress.  We assumed, perhaps too readily, that they understood what this progress necessitated, particularly in respect of obtaining by taxation the money necessary <Col N="572" /> to make it possible.  We can have these benefits by paying for them.  We cannot have them otherwise.</P>
    <P>This progress is not something which can be obtained in a haphazard manner.Progress must be planned and these plans must include provision to meet the cost.  Otherwise, such planning is useless.  This is the fundamental issue that divides us, the fundamental issue that divides Deputies opposite from Deputies on this side of the House.  How fast we should try to go in extending these public services which we all desire is another matter and one on which there can be a difference of opinion.  We believe that, with a rising national income, the scope of these desirable public services should be improved, even if it means some extension of taxation.  We do not think we are trying to go too fast.  We are not going as fast as I would wish us to go.  The Opposition must be presumed to stand for the slowing down of our social progress, cutting down these services, going backward instead of forward.</P>
    <P>If the turnover tax is repealed, the money which it is expected to bring in will not be received.  Do I have to tell Deputies that the Government cannot pay out money if it has not got it?  The business of Government cannot be carried on with IOUs.  That would mean that the money which have expected to come in would not be available to us.  It would mean that the extension of the public services which we have planned for this year would have to be abandoned, the higher children's allowances planned for this year could not be paid, the higher social welfare benefits could not be established.  It would mean that the increases recently awarded under arbitration to national teachers and civic guards would have to be cancelled, that the higher farm supports and the other services which are now provided to Irish agriculture would have to be curtailed, that the new heifer calf scheme announced last week would have to be abandoned. The plans for the improvement in education, for improved health and housing, including the new farm building grants announced yesterday, would all have to be abandoned.  These are all current charges which have to be <Col N="573" /> met out of current revenue.  They are not capital charges which could be met by borrowing as Deputy Corish seems to suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies who vote against the Government vote against the maintenance of the tax structure which is necessary for these services. They are voting for a reduction or abandonment of these services.  The slogan of the Opposition Parties is &ldquo;Slow down&rdquo; or &ldquo;Halt&rdquo;.  Ours is &ldquo;Go on&rdquo;.  Perhaps there is a case for marking time on social progress, perhaps there is a case for the postponement of salary improvements to public servants even when awarded under arbitration. Perhaps there is a case for abandoning all the plans and improvements for which legislation is at present before the Dáil or in course of coming before the Dáil, but if there is such a case, it has not been made by Opposition Deputies here or elsewhere.  No Deputy opposite has attempted to present that case.</P>
      <P>The Opposition Parties, both of them, either because they want to confuse the people or because they lack the courage to disclose their true minds, are defaulting in what I regard as their honourable obligations in that respect. Deputies opposite have had many opportunities during the long discussion on the Finance Bill and since to disclose their ideas about alternative policies or alternative taxes but they have not done so.  The Labour Party, during the course of the discussions on the Finance Bill, but not today, made some effort to meet their obligations in that regard but what they said was too vague.  They always kept one foot outside the door so that they could withdraw again if circumstances appeared likely to be difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael made no effort at all.  Well, they have a further opportunity in this debate.  I have already, in public, challenged them to state what is their policy.  Are they in favour of alternative taxes to those in the Finance Bill, some other system of taxation than the turnover tax, or are they in favour, instead, of curtailing these Government services <Col N="574" /> so that new taxation will not be necessary?If they fail to answer that challenge here today, that will be by far the most striking outcome of this debate and one which the people of this country will not fail to notice.</P>
    <P>My amendment is not mere political taotics.  It is a device to force Deputies opposite, if I can, to declare their position; to say whether they are for or against economic progress, recognising that progress will cost money; whether they are for going back down the hill again merely to save themselves the unpleasant responsibility &mdash; and for all politicians it is an unpleasant responsibility &mdash; of voting for tax changes or supporting taxes proposed by the Government in office.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, as we all know here, primarily, a political debate.  It is natural and, indeed, it is desirable &mdash; and I will be the last to criticise the efforts of Deputies of any Party &mdash; for Deputies to seek to win advantages for their Parties, but our role and our duties as public men extend much wider than that.</P>
    <P>What do Deputies opposite envisage for the country?  In what direction do they want us to move?  We are entitled to ask them these questions.  They are in my view obliged to answer them if they wish to be taken seriously by the people.</P>
    <P>We have now set up here in this country a rate of economic progress greater than anything ever achieved in our history.  It will not be easy to keep it up.  But, surely, we should do all we can to try to maintain that rate of progress?  There are no signs that the people of Ireland are getting tired of the effort.  Quite the contrary; I believe the enthusiasm for economic and social progress amongst the people is stronger than ever and I believe there is also an evergrowing understanding, if, as yet, an insufficient understanding, of what it requires.  It is bad national business, in my view, to suggest that we can now coast along, that henceforth it will be all a downhill run.  I do not believe and I have never said that future progress will be easy.  It will not be easy.  We cannot sustain this present rate of economic growth and social development, much <Col N="575" /> less speed it up, unless we as a nation are prepared to put money into it.</P>
    <P>That is true of economic progress of every kind and in every sector.  It is certainly true of social progress because, in our circumstances, social progress requires Government action, action financed through the national Exchequer, to carry out some degree of income redistribution in favour of the weaker elements of our community.</P>
    <P>In my amendment, I am asking the Dáil to declare for progress, whatever it may involve, although it must be our concern in the future as it has been in the past to make sure that the burden will never become too heavy. We ask Deputies who are concerned with the welfare of our people and the future progress of our nation, to reject this policy of quit and retreat which the parties opposite are preaching, even if that policy might have the consequence of making their own personal political positions easier and solve some problems they may otherwise have to encounter with their constituents.Those who want an easy life, those who are not prepared to fight for the realisation of their aims, should never have come into politics in the first instance.  The real issue in this debate, as every Deputy here knows, however he may attempt to conceal it by irrelevancies, is whether this Government are to continue with their development programme or whether it is to be interrupted by a general election.  Both the motion moved by Deputy Corish and the amendment in my name are just the pegs upon which the issue is hanging.</P>
    <P>I know that many Deputies will not, shall I say, think that this is a suitable time of the year for a general election, and an election at this time would not be my own choice, but the business of the nation must be done and it cannot be done by a Government without the necessary minimum Dáil support.</P>
    <P>In the course of an earlier debate on this issue before the Dáil recessed, I expressed my belief that in present political circumstances our system of electing members of the Dáil may well <Col N="576" /> mean that for many years to come we will have a series of Governments with small and insecure majorities.  These Governments, whoever comprise them and whatever their Dáil strength, will have to deal with taxation.  Deputy Corish seemed today to be arguing that only a Government with an overall majority of its own Party should propose new taxation.  That argument appears to be absurd and, if followed to its logical conclusion, would bring government into chaos in the circumstances we are likely to encounter here.</P>
    <P>I have considered it my duty as Taoiseach to try to avoid a situation of repeated elections, to try to avoid the political instability to which they could give rise.  Many times in the past two years, it would have been much easier for me, and justifiable in the circumstances, and probably to the advantage of my Party, if I had sought a dissolution.  There were periods when the members of my political organisation were urging me to take that step.  I tried, however, to make my intentions clear when I was elected as Taoiseach in 1961, when I said that I would not seek another election except in circumstances of a Dáil defeat or such deterioration in conditions here that effective administration was impossible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish argued today that because the Government lost a by-election in this year we should immediately resign.  He was a member of a Government in 1956 which lost three by-elections in a row and did not resign &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; until the following year when the number of unemployed was touching the 100,000 mark and when the money had gone out of the Exchequer as fast as their own courage and, rather than face the difficulties they had created, they decided to quit when the Dáil was in recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition Parties who opposed the constitutional change we proposed in 1959 to enable the system of electing members of the Dáil to be <Col N="577" /> amended seem now, to me, to be trying to prove to the country how right we were then.  My determination, my decision, to avoid a general election, if that were possible, and to avoid it for so long as the Government's work of national development is not obstructed or delayed, is due mainly, however, to another consideration.  It is due mainly to my conviction that the best possible argument which exists and which can be used when we are trying to interest people abroad in Irish economic development, a really important national asset which we should not voluntarily destroy, is the appearance of political stability which this country presents.  If we were always running back to the people to resolve our political difficulties, with the prospect of a succession of unstable and short-lived Governments, we would present the same appearance to the world as France did before de Gaulle or Portugal before Salazar.</P>

      <P>This debate may be the last debate in this Dáil.  Let us try to avoid clowning while it is going on. My reading of the political situation as it exists now is that a general election at this time would give an indecisive result and that almost certainly we would be forced into another election within a matter of weeks and, perhaps, two elections, before we would have reached a situation in which a Government faced the Dáil with a sufficiently secure position to enable it to carry on an effective administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Newspaper columnists and leader writers like to invent political scares and crises but, if Deputies will agree with me that the main national task facing us all at this time is to protect the country's economic and social progress, they will agree also that these scares and these political crises do not help and that reasonable stability in government is essential.  The Government decided on the introduction of the turnover tax which is now being challenged after very protracted consideration of all the alternatives.  Deputies opposite know as well as we do that the Government can no longer rely on the old standbys of revenue &mdash; beer, <Col N="578" /> spirits, tobacco and petrol&mdash;as the main sources of indirect taxation revenue. The merits of this turnover tax, the reason why it has to be comprehensive in its scope, and its probable effects, have been all fully debated here over long weary weeks before the Finance Act was passed and I do not intend to go into them again.</P>
    <P>This country, like others, needs for its future development a broadly-based tax of that kind which will ensure that the revenue available for public administration will increase in proportion with the national resources as a whole.  Most of the countries in the world have had to adopt a tax of this kind.  Why do Deputies opposite think we can achieve progress like theirs without a measure similar to this which they have used? Deputy Corish waxed eloquent here about what he called a tax on food and he asked if there are any Governments in the world who did it.  The majority of the Governments in Europe have a tax of this kind, a comprehensive retail sales tax.</P>

      <P>In our circumstances, the turnover tax we have devised is far less drastic and far less costly to administer than other types of sales tax such as other countries have adopted.  In some of those countries, they have taxes which apply whenever goods pass in commerce, a tax on the <Col N="579" /> production of the manufacturer, on the transactions of the wholesaler and of the retailer, but we have devised a simpler, cheaper and much more easily understood tax.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Norton wants to be expelled, I am quite prepared to facilitate him.  I will not deny him the opportunity.  I am quite sure there are some Deputies opposite who would think that was the easy way out of their dilemma.</P>
      <P>When we decided on this turnover tax, the Government, as Deputies opposite should realise by now, were fully concerned to ensure that married men with young families and persons requiring help from community funds under social welfare schemes should be protected against any possible consequences from it.  Deputy Desmond was talking about the rural worker with a family of young children.  By reason of the arrangements made by the Government, there will be higher children's allowances and that worker will be better off, and better off in hard cash, from this on.</P>
      <P>No Government of this country or any other country has been more concerned with the protection of the interests of those of our people for whom the economic problems of living are heavy.  It is because we have that concern that children's allowances were raised and extended to include the first child in every family.  That is why social welfare payments have been increased in greater proportion than the tax.  All those people about whom Deputy Desmond was professing such concern have been shielded against the consequences of this tax on prices.  If we should find that any hardship is being caused anywhere amongst our community, we shall not hesitate to propose to the Dáil further measures of the same kind as they may be required in accord with our general aim of reducing social inequalities and helping those who are less well placed than others to help themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it should be that prices are going up to an extent that is not justified, that traders of any kind in any area <Col N="580" /> are using the imposition of this tax for their own undue profit, as Deputies opposite have suggested they are, and particularly if there is evidence of concerted action amongst groups of traders to raise prices in this way, then the Government have powers under the Control of Prices Act and the Restrictive Trade Practices Act which will be fully used.</P>
    <P>When Deputies talk about the grave consequences that could arise from a tax of 2½ per cent on the turnover of retail shops, do they forget that over the past two years, in 1961 and 1962, the average price level went up by five per cent?  Do they know that all over the country there are retail traders entering into these trading stamp agreements by which they are undertaking to pay five per cent on their turnover?</P>
    <P>In recent years, the wages of workers and incomes generally in this country have risen faster than the rise in prices so that our people are now better off in real terms, better off in their living standards than they were, and that process will continue.  It is the policy and the aim of the Government to make sure that it will continue.  Whatever price changes may result from the turnover tax, it is our intention to speed up the expansion of our national economy, to speed up the growth of our production, so that all the people will be not merely as well off as they are now but better off.</P>
    <P>This Labour Party motion with its reference to grave hardship is not merely a grotesque exaggeration of the situation but reveals their incapability of understanding the requirements of a progressive development policy.  They have suggested that they would have supported the Government if we had come here with a proposition to get the revenue required for this programme of ours by increasing the tax on incomes instead of by this turnover tax.  To get the same amount of money would have required raising the standard rate of income tax by 1/9d. in the £.  That would have given us the highest rate of income tax in the world.  It is a tax that would fall mainly on skilled workers, upon the craftsmen, the technicians, the managers, the professional men, the very classes we must <Col N="581" /> seek to try to keep in Ireland and to encourage here if we are to achieve the progress we are aiming at.  We cannot build Ireland by our hands alone; we need brains and skill as well and we should not deprive ourselves of these resources by taxing them out of the country.</P>
    <P>The increase in company taxation which we propose this year &mdash; and I agree that the Labour Party supported it &mdash; was decided upon by us with very considerable hesitation.  It does not seem to have stifled enterprise or reduced our rate of development but that was something we had to consider and consider at length and very carefully.Deputies will have seen that inflationary forces are becoming very strong in countries which are very near to us and they will have noted the measures which are being taken by the Governments of these countries, the very drastic measures being taken by other Governments in order to contain these forces.  An unbalanced budget, an attempt to solve these political problems by resorting to cowardice or by resorting to borrowing in order to meet the Budget deficit &mdash; which is what Fine Gael appear to have in mind if some of Deputy Dillon's utterances are capable of interpretation and which even Deputy Corish appears to have suggested here this afternoon&mdash;would let loose all these inflationary forces here and, in my judgment, it would be economic suicide at this time.  In a very short number of years, and indeed, in a very short number of months, the price that would be paid by our people in depressed living standards, in rising unemployment and in frustrated hopes would far exceed anything that this turnover tax would cause.</P>
    <P>In any case, we have not got the borrowing capacity to spare which would enable us to cover a shortfall of our current revenue which we should be meeting by taxation, and at the same time fulfil our capital development programme.  All the money we can raise on capital account is required for the fulfilment of our capital programme.  Because of the upward movement of world prices due to these inflationary forces which are at work in other countries, and due at <Col N="582" /> the same time to the exceptional circumstances of the enormous Russian purchases of wheat which have elevated shipping freight rates everywhere, some price increases not associated with the turnover tax are becoming operative.  Deputy Corish and Deputy Desmond spoke about the increase in the price of coal as if that was due to the turnover tax when they knew very well that it arises from considerations outside the control of this country.  This coal has to be imported at the price we can procure it at.</P>

      <P>It is, I suppose, from the viewpoint of the Government just bad luck that other factors should be operating to complicate the full public understanding of the effect of the turnover tax on the level of prices. These other increases would have appeared at this time no matter what Government were in office.  I do not think the adjustment of present price levels to absorb this turnover tax will take very long.  We have the experience of other countries to guide us in that. In a matter of months the existence and operation of this tax will hardly be noticeable if no other considerations operate and world prices become stabilised.  The rise in the cost of living in 1964 because of the turnover tax will not be greater than the average rise in the cost of living in 1961 and 1962.  The rise in the cost of living because <Col N="583" /> of this tax in 1964, will be far less than the rise in any year in which the Coalition Government were in office.</P>
      <P>Of course we know that some people and some classes will seek to ensure that they do not bear any part of it, that it will be passed back to those whose circumstances do not give them any means of defence.  All expenditure whether it is on personal consumption or Government services must eventually come out of production and the rise in the value of total national production will in this year far exceed the amount of the tax and next year our progress and economic growth will continue unless folly brings us back again into an economic crisis such as that which developed in 1956 and from which fortunately we have since emerged.  Over the past three years Government expenditure has increased on all these services about which I have been talking, the services which Deputies are always urging should be still further expanded in a quite remarkable degree.</P>
      <P>Over that period, Government expenditure on social welfare services has been increased by £4½ million; Government spending upon our educational services has gone up by £6½ million; Government expenditure upon farm-price supports and other aids to agriculture has gone up by £12½ million; on housing by £3¾ million, on health by £2½ million.  On these services alone, ignoring all others, ignoring all salary and wage adjustments for the benefit of public officials, Government outlay over the past three years has increased by £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the new tax is needed for.  Do Deputies want these increases cancelled now?  Is this the policy that they are going to present to the public if they get the chance of going to the public?  Is there one Deputy here who ever urged that course in this House? Is there any Deputy who during the course of his membership in the Dáil voted against these increases?  On the contrary, we know that the Government is faced with a continuing volume of demands for further improvements in these services.  Whatever the feeling of Fine Gael Deputies they have never <Col N="584" /> urged the avoidance of taxation by restraint in the growth of these services.I know that these services are not dependent on a turnover tax but they are dependent on some tax and if Deputies opposite want these services, want to see them expanded as they have been, and are not prepared to support the turnover tax, what tax will they support to make them possible? Do they think that money falls into the Exchequer like manna?  Frankly, I must confess that I do not know what the Fine Gael policy is.  If there is one it is concealed in ambiguity and verbiage, the type of verbiage in which Deputy Dillon excels, full of sound and simulated fury and signifying nothing, like Hamlet, except that it is the general idea that they are against the Government.</P>

      <P>You cannot get away from your past like that.  The records shows that over the years Fine Gael have opposed every new idea, every new development; that they are basically motivated by a lack of confidence in the Irish people to mould their country's future competently. Their reluctance to disclose any ideas which they have about the future &mdash; if they have such ideas, they are certainly keeping them as the best-guarded secret in Ireland &mdash; may be due to the fact that they have no ideas but it is far more likely to be attributable to their instinctive realisation that if they were to disclose their real thinking and intentions to the Irish public, the prospect of another Fine Gael Government would become even more unacceptable to the Irish people than ever before.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish recently, in a public speech, expressed the same criticisms of the policy, and the actions taken by the Government in implementing this policy, of bringing into the sphere of national policy-making all the organised elements of our community and of sharing responsibility with them. This is a policy which I aim to continue for so long as I remain in the Government.  It is the kind of democracy in which I believe &mdash; not a concentration of power, authority and responsibility at the top but its dispersal through the nation; not the final determination of policy in all details by the Government but by a process of discussion and, if possible, by agreement.</P>
      <P>I believe it is only when democracy has devised workable methods of achieving this dispersal of authority and responsibility, devised the means as well as the will to secure plans for national development by agreement, within the ambit of accepted national aims, that we can hope to face on equal terms the repressive, inhuman but unquestionably efficient, methods of the totalitarians.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; or perhaps could more generously be interpreted as concerned with whether the Government are to go ahead with their development programme or their programme is to be interrupted by a general election?  It is not a question which I think we should ignore.  What has happened elsewhere could happen here.  Those of us who believe in democracy and who have responsibility in this respect &mdash; and this applies to all members who are elected to this Dáil &mdash; cannot concentrate on Party tactics without looking to see where the ship may draft while the wheel is being left unattended.</P>
      <P>It may be far too much to see in farmers marching, teachers talking about striking and the manner in which other sections seem to want to press their sectional aims in ways which will achieve the maximum of public inconvenience and discomfort, as the first signs of a weakening of Irish democracy.If the appearance of weakness or division in the Dáil, or undue preoccupation with the affairs of Parties, or of personalities, leading to Government instability or ineffectiveness could grow here, we need not try to console ourselves with the illusion that human nature is any different in Ireland from what it is elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are my thoughts and explain why I as Taoiseach never allowed the Government over which I have presided to deviate one hair's breadth from the course which we considered to be right just because it presented some political difficulties or dangers.  We have tried, notwithstanding that rigid adherence to policy and principles which unites our Party, to be satisfied with even minimum Dáil majorities.  It is why we have tried to meet the difficulties arising from organised sectional pressures induced by the appearance of Government weakness <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Dáil in the process of getting our policy fulfilled, and why we have tried to a degree never before attempted in this country to keep the people informed of all the facts of our national situation and of the Government's intentions, and why we are now striving to bring into the constructive tasks of policy-making and nation building all the important elements <Col N="587" /> that have a contribution to make&mdash;and many of them have an important contribution to give &mdash; without inquiring into the political views of those whom we consult or whose guidance we seek before taking our decisions.</P>
    <P>I said here before, and in other places more recently, that during the years since I became Taoiseach, the rate of progress, economic and social, has been far greater than at any previous time in Irish history and that this has been achieved without financial difficulties &mdash; with balanced Budgets and without any serious problems arising in respect of international payments &mdash; that the confidence of the people in themselves and in their country's future has been restored and strengthened and that, across the world, the name of Ireland is better known and more respected now than ever before.  This is something of which we are proud and of which we are entitled to be proud.  No matter what the future brings, it is something that cannot be undone.  We have shown, given clear and sensible plans and effective Government, what the Irish people are capable of achieving &mdash; and because this has been done once, things in this country will never be the same again.</P>
    <P>It is by these standards of achievement, the standards of achievement in Government, of capacity and efficiency in the administration of the affairs of the nation as a Government, that all future Governments in this State will be judged.  So far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, these are the standards by which we want to be judged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Taoiseach was speaking, he laid great emphasis on the necessity of preserving this country's reputation for stability.  I want to endorse emphatically that view.  I think that is something of which this country has a right to be proud &mdash; that in the relatively short period since we achieved our independence after so many centuries of struggle and after surviving all the introductory <Col N="588" /> events of that independence, we are entitled to say before the world that we are in a position to provide for our people as stable a Government as there is to be found in any democracy in Western Europe.</P>
      <P>Is it any service to that reputation for political stability for a person who for the time being happens to head the Government to proclaim that if he ceases to be head of the Government, chaos and pandemonium will sweep the land?  There is no stability in a country where there is only one possible Government.  That may be true of Ghana and Liberia and Cuba, but surely it is not true of Ireland? Surely we have in Ireland parliamentary institutions capable of providing our people with a Government from the elected representatives of our people?  I have never doubted it and I am not doubting it now.  That was an illusion which a certain well-known predecessor of the Taoiseach nursed to his bosom for 18 years, but he survived the shock of discovering he was not indispensable.</P>
      <P>When I hear the Taoiseach proclaiming today that he views the future of this country with alarm when he does not see on the horizon a de Gaulle or a Salazar, I wonder why he did not go on to say &ldquo;or a Franco or a Castro&rdquo;. The answer is that we do not want that kind of stability in this country.  We do not want a stability that rests and depends for its survival on one man.  We have not got it, and God forbid that we ever should.  We want, and have, a stability that rests on a popularly elected Parliament; and so long as our people are free to choose their representatives, they will never lack a stable Government in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach in this improvident observation he has made has created in the mind of any individual who had intended to stake his fortune in this country the deplorable illusion that if this Government should be swept aside by the Irish people, the prospect of stable institutions in Ireland is in doubt, I want to say &mdash; and I am convinced I speak for the vast mass of our people on this &mdash; that that is a ludicrous illusion. There is no country in the western world with more stable institutions than <Col N="589" /> Ireland enjoys today, and whatever Party constitutes the Government, any potential investor here is assured he will find in this country a stable Government resting not on the will of one man, but on the will of 3,000,000 free people here.</P>
    <P>We must make allowances for the Taoiseach.  He is manifestly from his speech today a tired man, and who would blame him for that.  He has had a very exhausting time trotting around the United States, although I hear he enjoyed himself, and I am glad.  But when so erudite a head of State as the Taoiseach begins to describe the New Zealanders as throwing boomerangs and proceeds to record for us the dramatic picture of Hamlet reciting Macbeth, we are entitled to say on the evidence of this geographical and literary falling away that he lacks something of his usual vigour and <i>panache.</i> I understand he has had a tiring time and in returning to the gloomy ranks of his Party, who were in a position to report to him the developments during his absence &mdash;&mdash;</P>

But I would urge him to distinguish most carefully between the prospects of his own Party and the prospects of this country.  They are two very different things.  The prospects of the Fianna Fáil Party are at the moment deplorable; the prospects of the Irish nation, I am glad to think, are very good, because we were never nearer to a change of Government than we are this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are at present discussing the motion standing in the names of the Labour Party.  We put down a resolution on the Order Paper framed in somewhat different terms which was designed to direct the Government to exercise their power under the 1963 Finance Act to postpone the operation of what, we will submit, is a wholly undesirable tax until such time as the people were permitted to pass upon it again after the verdict they had already passed in North-East Dublin. <Col N="590" /> For reasons best understood to the Ceann Comhairle himself, that was ruled out of order.  Now we are faced with the net issue of a vote of censure on the Government, to which certainly this Party most heartily subscribes and for which this Party will take the greatest possible pleasure in voting when the time of voting comes.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on that on account of an intervention made by the Taoiseach in the course of the discussion which ensured upon your ruling, Sir.  We urged upon you that you should reconsider your ruling in the light of the fact that there was express power in the Finance Act to postpone the tax if the Government chose to do so, that we, as Parliament, had given them that power and so should be entitled to call on them to invoke it.  The Taoiseach then intervened to say that even if you changed your ruling, he would not provide Government time to discuss such a motion.  I want to suggest to the Taoiseach that that is a deplorable attitude for the head of the Government and the Leader of the House to adopt.  Whether he likes the terms of a motion set down by a responsible Opposition in Dáil Éireann, it is his duty to treat it with the respect to which it is entitled.  Unless he is prepared to accept that duty, Parliament will not function.</P>
    <P>I admit the Taoiseach may have felt himself considerably upset, and this is confirmed by the quite astonishing speech to which he himself made reference today.  He repaired recently to Cavan for the purpose of sharing in the jubilation of a fortieth anniversary party for his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.  I think we would have been entitled to expect a benevolent and cordial expression of appreciation of the services of the Minister for Agriculture and a suitable reference to his long period in the public life of this country but far from it.  From the newspaper reports I read, the Taoiseach never referred to Deputy Smith at all; practically the whole speech was devoted to a denunciation of me.  I have come to the conclusion that the Taoiseach had nothing very flattering to say about <Col N="591" /> the Minister for Agriculture and he thought the best way to please him was to abuse me.  In that the Taoiseach might not have been very wrong.  I have no doubt it added to the entertainment of the evening and pleased the person to be honoured by the event.  But it did seem a strange and incongruous occasion on which to launch himself out on this violent assault.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach followed that here today and the line taken today is to paint the picture for us that, unless we all how our necks and accept the yoke he proposes for us, disaster threatens the nation, that if we are not all prepared to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to his proposals, nothing but catastrophe awaits our people.  That may be good enough for the purpose of keeping his own rather jangled ranks together but it cuts no ice on this side of the House because we have been through all this before.</P>
    <P>I want to recall to the House what we know of this man.  I remember in 1947 the present Taoiseach was Minister for Industry and Commerce and on this occasion he went to Letterkenny to address a public meeting, not a complimentary dinner.  He said, and I quote his words as reported in his own newspaper, the Irish <i>Pravda,</i> of September 15, 1947:</P>
    <P>We are entering four years of most acute difficulty in which economic disaster will threaten on every side and our only weapon of defence is our capacity for hard work.  If that weapon fails us we are finished.</P>
    <P>Mercifully, three months later he was put out of office and when we took over it became our duty to examine what plans and schemes our predecessors had in mind to deal with what they apprehended was going to be disaster.  We knew subsequent to that speech that a supplementary Budget had been introduced, bringing in a number of new taxes as being absolutely essential to carry on Government. We knew that a resolution proposed by this side of the House that old age pensions should be increased by 2/6d. <Col N="592" /> had been rejected by the Government because they said the State could not afford it.  We discovered that the present Taoiseach had on his desk a draft Bill for submission to the House giving him power to freeze the wages and salaries of everybody in the country and make it a criminal offence for any employer to give increases.  And that was the picture that was drawn then, very similar to the picture that is drawn now.</P>
    <P>I want to recall what actually happened.He went out of office and we came in.  Within two years every one of the new taxes that he had said were absolutely indispensable to save the country from bankruptcy had been repealed.We increased allowances for married men under the income tax code.  We increased allowances for children and dependent relatives.  We lowered stamp duty on house purchase, and income tax liability on elderly people.  We abolished death duties on estates up to £2,000.  We lowered income tax and removed additional taxes that Fianna Fáil had put on beer, tobacco, cigarettes and entertainment and in the course of the same year or the next we introduced the principle of conciliation and arbitration for all public servants.</P>

      <P>In the same period &mdash; Deputy Norton was then Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; we introduced two Acts increasing the means allowed to an old age pensioner from £39 per year to £80 per year, radically altering the whole basis of the old age pensions code and over and above that, Fianna Fáil having declared in the following year that an increase of 2/6d. a week to the old age pensioners was unthinkable, in the first year of our office we consolidated the existing 5/- that the old age pensioners were receiving in kind and added 2/6d. to it and we provided that every rural old age pensioner in the country would get an <Col N="593" /> extra 7/6d. in cash and in the case of every other old age pensioner, an extra 5/-.</P>
      <P>In the last Budget we submitted to this House, notwithstanding other benefits provided, we made provision for a further increase in old age pensions of 2/6d.  All that was done subsequent to the speech I have quoted by the present Taoiseach and during that period &mdash; I asked the House to remember this &mdash; while Deputy Morrissey was Minister for Industry and Commerce we put 1,000 people into industrial employment every month we were in office.  We increased industrial employment by 37,000 persons in that period of three years.</P>
      <P>But that was only the beginning of it because during the same period we abolished compulsory tillage with the hordes of inspectors that afflicted the farming community and we introduced the land project, the lime scheme, the farm building scheme and we guaranteed prices for pigs and feeding barley.  Then we went to London and negotiated the 1948 trade agreement the benefits of which we still feel.  We promoted exports of frozen box beef to the USA for the first time and began a trade which is still running to the tune of about £1 million a year.</P>

      <P>We increased the price of calves from 10/- to £20 apiece.  I do not say that every time we come in after Fianna Fáil we can repeat a performance of that kind but am I not entitled to say that having achieved that after being told by the present Taoiseach that we were entering four years of most acute difficulty in which economic disaster would threaten on every side and that our only weapon of defence was our capacity for hard work and if that weapon failed us we would be finished, if that is the record we can present at the end of 3½ years in office are we not entitled to say that bad as the situation is which the Taoiseach confesses to now, if he would only get out and make way for people who are not panic-stricken it is very likely we can do as well again?</P>

    <P>I notice that the Taoiseach said on <Col N="594" /> his return from America that he had learned methods of aggressive politics in the short period he was there.  These are unlikely to intimidate anybody in this House but evidence of megalomania does and when a person begins to see in himself the personification not only of de Gaulle but also of Salazar and is only deterred from referring to Franco and Castro by their disagreeable associations, I detect in him a development of megalomania which is becoming a positive menace.</P>

      <P>That was a likely remark of any public house bully in the country but when you hear a man saying: &ldquo;Behold a substitute for de Gaulle and Salazar and their kind of stable Government,&rdquo; there is real danger.I can recognise the fellow who is hauling off to hit everybody in a public house but the man who begins to dream he is Napoleon &mdash; Grangegorman is full of them.  He will come in some day in a cocked hat, if he does not take care of himself.  We do not want an authoritarian ruler here and I suggest to the Taoiseach's colleagues that they should go to work on him to restore his sense of proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told social benefits are to be increased in this Finance Act.  We approve of that; we think it is a good thing and we have said repeatedly that the first charge on our resources should be the improvement of our social services.  We are glad that the old age pension will be increased to 35/- a week.  We are glad that the other social service benefits will be improved and, when we take office, these improvements will be given effect to.  But I want to say now that, if the Government's proposal to tax the essential necessities of the people's lives is allowed to operate, we will have a 1963 repetition of the removal of the food subsidies, which was done for the <Col N="595" /> purpose of raising on that occasion not £15 millions but £9 millions, and a repetition of those practices which are characteristic of Fianna Fáil and which have operated steadily to raise the cost of living in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to warn this House that if this most recent attack by the Fianna Fáil Party on the essential foodstuffs, fuel and clothing of the people, is suffered to take place, it will not be very long until the purchasing power of the 35/- a week old age pension will be less than the purchasing power of the 10/- a week old age pension in 1939.  Remember, before these increased costs went on, the increase in the cost of living according to the Government's own statistics had reduced the purchasing power of the 32/6 pension to about 10/10 in terms of 1939 values.  With the increase now envisaged, not only the 2/6 will be eaten up but probably more as well.</P>
    <P>Our policy was consistently, and we made great sacrifices to achieve it, to keep price levels stable in this country in so far as we were able to control them.  Let me quote once more the wisdom of the Taoiseach on this topic.  The Taoiseach had a word to say in 1956.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But not ten years wiser. Progress appears to be in the opposite direction, almost to the point of mania today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now the common theme of Ministers that the Government is powerless to control the upward movement of prices.  Do they not realise that, unless they devise some method of maintaining stability of money values, of preventing prices rising further, all their exhortations to save will be useless and the increased level of investment which they are seeking will not come about?  ... The Government cannot get savings without giving an assurance of stability of money values. Have they thrown in the towel <Col N="596" /> completely in relation to this question of the cost of living?  Is it good enough now for the Minister for Finance to come in here and say that prices are going up because of factors which are outside the control of the Government?</P>
    <P>At least, at that time our claim was that, in respect of every factor within the control of the Government, we would not let the cost of living go up; but, if there were factors outside our control, these we could not control. His comment on that was: &ldquo;You are not doing enough by controlling the things within your control.  You have thrown in the towel when you do not claim to control the things outside&rdquo;. Fianna Fáil have now gone the length of saying, as the Taoiseach was explaining today, that the price of coal, and the price of wheat, and the price of flour are not within his and their control.  The Taoiseach goes on to say: &ldquo;Having declared my inability to control the price of coal, the price of wheat, and other things, which are rising owing to international developments, I now declare the Government's intention of raising the price of butter, of milk, of bread, of meat, of boots, of shoes, of turf, of everything else, which we do control; and, if the price of coal has gone up as a result of an increase in freight rates, then I am going to put a tax on the coal and the freight rates in order to raise the price still further.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am proud of our record.  I am proud of the fact that we fought hard to hold back the increase in the cost of living because we said it was a fraud on the poor to give them 2/6d. with one hand and take it back with the other.  If we give an old age pensioner an extra half-crown we expect him to be able to buy more with it and, if he is not able to buy more with it, then we are guilty of fraud in offering it. The avowed policy of this Government is: &ldquo;Give it to him with the left hand, but take it back with the right, and make a virtue of that transfer of the money from one pocket to the other. Give that as evidence of your concern for and interest in the old age pensioner and the poor.&rdquo;  I say that is a patent fraud.  I say the Taoiseach and his <Col N="597" /> supporters in all those benches know perfectly well that not only will the recipients of social welfare lose in the increase in the cost of living but the increased social welfare benefits will provide a good deal of this revenue as well.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in one of his recent orations &mdash; I think it was on the occasion of the &ldquo;Smith Dinner&rdquo;&mdash; that three times he entered public life to reform the situation and that he could not face the thought of doing it again. It is marvellous what brazen-faced audacity will encourage a man to say. The Taoiseach first entered office in this country in 1932.  In the first six years after that we had the Economic War.  No farmer that remembers that will bless that recollection.  We got him out just before he had time to pass an Act through this Parliament making it a criminal offence to raise any man's wages in this country.  He came back again in 1951 and his contribution to the gaiety of nations was to remove two-thirds of the food subsidies that we had provided to keep the cost of living down.  We put him out after that and, by gum, he came back again in 1957, and his contribution then was to remove a further £9 millions from the food subsidies, and he now presents us with a turnover tax.  If that is a record of which the Taoiseach is proud &mdash; his three sallies in Ministerial office in this country &mdash; it is a record I have no desire to share with him.</P>
    <P>We can talk until the cows come home, as the Taoiseach loves to do, on his programme &mdash; the Blue Book.  It used to be a Grey Book.  Now it is a Blue Book.  For anyone who has bothered to sit down and read it, it is characterised by two distinctions.  It is a rather poor version of the OECD Report on expansion in Europe, which I presented on behalf of OECD to the Council of Europe six months ago last March.  The figures only are taken and vague calculations are made, taking a fifty per cent increase in the year 1970 as the basic figure, and working backwards.There is only one concrete figure: that is a proposal to increase the annual output of the cattle industry of this country by 50 per cent by 1970. The only basis upon which such an <Col N="598" /> ambition could be founded would be for the cows of this country to all begin to farrow instead of calve.  The object of these exercises is to propound to the nation that the only people concerned in industrial development or expansion in this country are the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  Where are the increases in industrial exports over the past seven years firmly rooted?  Am I right or am I wrong?  That programme had its origin and draws its sustenance today from three sources &mdash; the creation of the Industrial Development Authority, the passage of the Industrial Grants Act in 1956 and the enactment of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill of 1956.  Who were responsible for them?  Deputy Gerard Sweetman, Deputy William Norton and Deputy Daniel Morrissey were, and I remember when Deputy Morrissey brought into the House the proposal for the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority, the present Taoiseach's only contribution was to say that he wanted to serve everybody employed in the Authority with notice that the day he got back to office they would be out of jobs because it was his intention to wind up the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>I want also to recall to the House the language used by the Taoiseach when referring to the Industrial Grants Act in this House, when he said he regarded the proposals and the form of assistance then being proffered to industrial development in this country as thoroughly undesirable and unsound. Yet when he took office he adopted the Industrial Development Authority, he adopted the Industrial Grants Act and expanded it, he adopted the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act and expanded it.  But we are all forgetting that the concepts on which all that expansion has been built were formulated by the present Taoiseach's predecessors in the teeth of his ridicule and opposition, and I declare that if you ask responsible industrialists, the vast majority will tell you that what really affected industrial expansion and industrial exports was the concept enshrined in Deputy Sweetman's Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) <Col N="599" /> Act of 1956, and what caused many of them to be established was the concept of the Industrial Grants Act formulated by Deputy Norton when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I think every side of this House ought to bear an important factor in mind.  We can get intoxicated by listening to blather about everything riding high, wide and handsome and wholly forget that no nation in the world today is an island.  The economic conditions of this country, as of every country in the world, are very materially conditioned by the economic conditions of its neighbours.  There is a remarkable coincidence to the west and to the east of us: there are general elections coming up in twelve months' time.  It is not peculiar to Ireland.  It can happen in Great Britain and the United States too.  The Party in office who are looking for a renewal of their mandate are scraping the barrel to provide a boom and there is a boom going on in Great Britain and in the United States.</P>
    <P>Like the hurricanes that blow about the oceans, we can get the backlash of these balmy breezes and we should not forget the measure of importance these conditions have for this country and we should not ever dismiss from our minds the situation we will have to deal with if in the future, as could well happen, the boom at present progressing in the United Kingdom of England, Scotland and Wales, or in the United States, should cease to move. We should be grateful for the boom because the longer it goes on the better it will suit us, but we should not ever allow it to go from our minds that if it should cease and we have new problems to consider, the Taoiseach's euphoria might be considerably qualified.</P>
    <P>I was amused listening to the Taoiseach as he vacillates between violent and scurrilous attacks on the Fine Gael Party and lofty declarations that we do not matter a damn.  The interesting thing is that even if we do not matter a damn in his judgment, we represent nearly 400,000 voters in this <Col N="600" /> House.  The Taoiseach would do well to remember that.  I noticed recently the Minister for Justice, Deputy Haughey, entering the lists to reinforce the observations of his father-in-law and he added, more in sorrow than in anger: &ldquo;Nobody wants a general election in this country except Fine Gael and the Labour Party&rdquo;.  Would I be unreasonable if I said that was a euphemistic way of saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil do not want a general election&rdquo;?  God knows, after Dublin North-East, I have every sympathy with Deputy Haughey in believing that the Fianna Fáil Party do not want a general election.  Now we come to this ringing challenge from the Taoiseach today: he wants to know in the month of November the full details of the Fine Gael Budget to be introduced in April, 1964.  I propose to deal with that but I cannot refrain from first giving the House a quotation from one of the Taoiseach's most colourful colleagues, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  Deputy O'Malley was making a contribution to the proceedings of the House on 16th May, and I quote him from column 560 of volume 157 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the Book of Estimates shows that there is an increase under the majority of the headings.  There is an increase in nearly every single item.  I think I have quoted sufficiently to show that the Government will now have to revise its policy.  Someone could have interrupted there, as people are so fond of interrupting, and asked: &ldquo;What would you have done?&rdquo; It is not for us to answer that question. The people over there are the Government and it is for them to say what should be done.</P>
      <P>And I want to draw the special attention of Deputies to this, which is the plum.</P>
      <P>It was very clearly stated by both Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Lemass that no further increases in taxation would take place after 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> They have both started to sing a very different song since Deputy O'Malley was speaking seven years ago, and remember it was on that undertaking that they went to the country.</P>
    <P>Now I want to examine this whole proposition that the only means of raising the revenue necessary to carry on the country is the turnover tax.  I know that proposition is too grotesque and idiotic to deserve the attention of anybody except the most unsophisticated members of the Fianna Fáil Party. However, it requires some examination in case there should be anybody in the country deluded by it.</P>
    <P>We are presented with the concept of the turnover tax as if it were so revolutionary a plan that nobody had ever thought of it before.  What is it? What in fact does it do?  It produces revenue from petrol which has gone up by 1½d., from drink which has gone up by 2d. a pint, from tobacco which has gone up substantially.  It produces revenue from all the traditional sources of revenue, but it also produces revenue from butter, bacon, bread, clothing and fuel.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Taoiseach that the only result of the turnover tax is to raise prices without a corresponding advantage to the Exchequer, which has been made responsible for the raising of the tax.  I want to say we are opposed to it for the reasons that we believe it increases the cost of living by taxing the essential food, fuel, and clothing of the people, and because we think a tax that does that is a bad tax.</P>
    <P>We oppose this tax because we are convinced that consequent on that inindiscrimate taxing of food, fuel, and clothing, we will have an increase in the cost of production all along the line which is calculated greatly to abridge our competitive capacity in the foreign markets of the world at a time when it was never more necessary we should make ourselves as competitive as it is humanly possible to be.  We also oppose it because it is a tax so devised that it will create widespread confusion in every business house in Ireland.  I know there are elements in this country who are inclined to say that the shopkeeper is a kind of public <Col N="602" /> enemy.  I do not know why that should be and I want to say that the shopkeepers of this country are probably employing more people at good conditions than any other industry we have. The distributive trades are probably the largest employers of labour in the land and, in the vast majority of cases, they are employed at decent rates of wages and in good conditions of employment.  There is no reason or justification for a concerted attack on the business community of this country as something that is disreputable. Production depends on distribution for its profits and success.</P>
    <P>Every shopkeeper in this country has had the daily operation of his business turned into a nightmare.  For those in a large way of business it has involved substantial additional cost in hiring the necessary clerical assistance to keep their accounts in order.  Those in a small way of business are harassed by uncertainty as to how this tax is to be collected and how they are going to deal with it.  For those reasons we of the Fine Gael Party are opposed to it and would repeal it if we are elected to office consequent on the general election which I believe will take place in the very early future.</P>
    <P>I am sick of the repetition of the question &mdash; if you are not going to have a turnover tax what tax are you going to have?  I answer that question clearly and definitely &mdash; I am not going to draft the 1964 Budget for presentation to Oireachtas Éireann in November, 1963.  I am perfectly certain, and I pledge my word on it to the people of this country, and that still counts for something, that there are ample resources within the framework of the Irish Exchequer from which to derive by acceptable taxation whatever moneys are necessary without taxing the essential food, fuel and clothing of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not the slightest danger of it.  I am quite certain that we can put proposals before the country which will command unanimous support.  I am also sick of the assertion that the Minister's father-in-law is indispensable to this country. Neither father nor son-in-law are indispensable.The country can survive the return of both of them to their normal avocations.  We propose, as a Party, to introduce a bold programme of capital investment by the Government wherever private enterprise fails to fill the gap, but I want to add this, and I do so with the full consent and approval of my colleagues, that we set a reasonable criterion for public capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>We acknowledge that there may be areas of desirable public capital expenditure where it may not be possible to have an immediate profit in the accepted commercial sense of the word but we do say that the reasonable capital investment of public money does require that the investment should have some prospect of meeting the interest charges which the borrowing of that money involves while at the same time providing decent wages and decent conditions of employment for the people employed in it.  That is not a criterion invariably operated by the Fianna Fáil Party and there we differ from them.</P>
      <P>If you are to have sustained capital investment, it must follow the pattern I have now laid down.  If you simply want to spend money on the purchase of votes, that criterion can go by the board.  I view with the gravest apprehension public capital expenditure which may lead to catastrophic disaster.  If there are one or two instances of that nature, the whole public incentive to capital investment will disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power of this House to pursue a consistent policy of capital investment depends ultimately on the <Col N="604" /> approval and support of the people as a whole.  I want to prescribe the principle that the Government of this country can and should intervene only where private enterprise has failed to fill the gap and where good employment, with good wages and conditions, is possible as a result of capital investment by the State.</P>
    <P>I am appalled at the cold-blooded refusal of Fianna Fáil to recognise any reasonable hierarchy of priority.  It made me physically sick to read the description that Deputy Declan Costello gave in this House recently of conditions in the city of Dublin, of the description that Deputy Jones gave of conditions in the city of Limerick, of families thrown out on the side of the road, of mothers sent to one institution, of fathers sent to another, of both separated from their children because their houses were falling down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And at the same time, if you read the record of the capital investment programme of this Government you find that from 1957 to a year ago there was a steady and sustained reduction in the number of houses built in this city, in Limerick, Cork and Galway as well.  You find a Government authorising a great expansion in building activity financed from private and public resources while at the same time you have a situation in which houses are falling down.  Those facts cast discredit on the ability of the Government properly to handle the resources of the country for the benefit of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to advert to the belief which is growing in the mind of the Taoiseach that the destiny of this country is linked with his own progress and that of the Party of which he is president.  I think one of the things about which we in Ireland should rejoice is that we have in this country an alternative to any existing Government.  If we are the Government and if we fail to keep faith with the people it is a good thing that Fianna Fáil are sitting opposite to us in sufficient strength to offer a possible alternative.  I think that is a thing in which this country should rejoice, that <Col N="605" /> if a Government tends to crumble and break up, as this Government is doing, we are not faced with the political vacuum which seems to haunt the present Taoiseach.  We are not faced with the dilemma of a French, Portuguese, Cuban or Spanish Government. We have in our Parliament an alternative Government which can take the place of the Government in which the people have lost faith.</P>
    <P>I want to be perfectly frank about this.  I am not dismayed that our Government being in office may possibly go wrong.  Our Government being in office for some time may lose the contact with the people that a good Government should retain.  If they do, then I regard as the true source of political stability in this country the evident fact that the Irish people have available to them readily in their own Parliament a constitutional alternative to the Government that they no longer want.  We here in Ireland have that alternative and we should be proud of it and at this time I think we should thank God for it.  If we had not, I would be frightened.  It is because I know we have that I face the future with absolute confidence.</P>
    <P>I do not think any rational public man in Ireland today will deny that the Fianna Fáil Government have lost the confidence of the people.  Now, they may wriggle and they may twist and they may elude an election for a month or two months or three months. They may succeed in scraping through tonight.  I think it is doubtful but it is possible.  They will have to face a by-election in Cork where they will certainly be beaten.  They may struggle back here and by avoiding action and so forth may stagger on for another couple of months.  I believe that will represent a period of instability, not because people fear there is not an alternative but because they see that Fianna Fáil is dead but will not lie down and that is the great evil of a Government which is dead and will not lie down.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Taoiseach, after all the hullabaloo, his Government is dead and at present it will not lie down.  I suggest to him that he ought to lay it out decently and let us bury <Col N="606" /> it and then go to the hustings on a general election.  I pledge on behalf of my Party that we will loyally accept the verdict of the people, whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>I exhort Fianna Fáil not only to say from the teeth out that they will do the same but to demonstrate by their action that they are eager and willing to take that verdict in order that they may abide by it.  There is only one way in which they can give demonstrable proof of that and that is by calling on the President, if not tonight, then early tomorrow morning, and we can settle it this side of Christmas who is to be the Government.</P>
    <P>I think from the look of the Taoiseach a few months holiday would do him good and that is all to his credit, if he has worked himself to a rag prancing about the United States.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the terrible picture painted by Deputy <Col N="607" /> Costello in regard to conditions in Dublin and people thrown out on the street.  People were thrown out on the street because in that emergency the Corporation decided that only families would be housed.  As a result, old people were admitted to the Mendicity Institute and places like that.  I alone am the one who got these people housed&mdash;the older people and others &mdash; and off the street.  One does not hear now of the plight of people in Jervis Street and other places.  All that is finished, or the best part of it has been dealt with, due largely to my efforts and my efforts alone.</P>
    <P>In fact, when I put down a motion asking that those old people be considered for separate dwellings, I was opposed and after a bitter fight on the Housing Committee I won by one single vote and some members of the Fine Gael Party opposed me.  So, therefore, if there are no longer people on the streets and if old people are now being housed, it was due to an hour's bitter row on the Housing Committee.  I am not ashamed nor afraid of the people because if it came to an election, people would hear the truth. They would hear it in such a way that they would think twice before putting out a friend and putting in a secret enemy.</P>
    <P>Some people think that because I have taken a certain stand and because certain vested interests find in me a target, I would be a victim but I can fight and no one need worry about me.</P>
    <P>I did not come in here having had everything served up on a plate.  I came in here the hard way, with neither money, nor organisation, nor anyone.  I came in on my hands and knees and beat my way in here and no one need &ldquo;kid&rdquo; himself that he will easily beat me out because there are thousands of people in this city who were saved in some manner, thanks to my efforts.  In fact, I could claim here and now that I helped materially 50,000 in this city in the past 12 months, and I can prove it.  Do not worry.  When the time comes, when I put all those facts before the people, and you put your negative policy, they will choose carefully between their <Col N="608" /> friends and some enemy who is merely trying to get over by a trick or a sleight of hand.</P>
    <P>I am not swayed by other people's emotions.  I hope I can claim that I have a very keen analytical mind.  At least, those who ever opposed me admit that.  Perhaps those who have never opposed me do not know that.  I can assure the House that I have a keen analytical mind and unless I am convinced by facts and figures, I will not accept what other people say.  It is all right for Deputy Dillon to say he has some plan but I am here to be convinced.Even as a simple person, let alone a person with a keen, analytical mind, how could I accept the negative do-nothing, say-nothing proposals of the Leader of the Opposition?  The people at large are simple people.  They do not understand politics.  They think only in terms of today and the things immediately around them.  They do not see into the future although it is the future that hits everybody.  Unless you anticipate and prepare for the future, you will be constantly hit.  The man in the street does not understand that.  He just knows that someone is going to charge him threepence or sixpence extra.  It does not occur to him that the person who is pretending to be on his side is a wolf who is treating him like little Red Riding Hood, trying to get his confidence and then, having got it, having no mercy on him.</P>
    <P>What is my policy here?  Naturally, I like politics.  What are we all doing here?  I understand politics and I believe I can match my wits and brains against those of anyone in this House. I am not the leader of a Party.  I have only the powers of an individual&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy here is to try to get the maximum increases for people in social benefits.  I had a motion here last night dealing with that.  My purpose here is to get greater benefits for these people but I am realistic enough to know that unless there is money available, it is only a dream. <Col N="609" /> The Government have proposed something.I am not in love with them any more than anyone else but they have a plan.  It is a proposal to get a certain amount of money, £11 million, we are told.  I am hoping it will be £20 million because if it is, it may not be necessary to have any further taxation in the next year or two.  If that is achieved, then it is possible that all those old age pensioners who are hoping some day to get £2 or 50/-will actually get it.  However, if they get barely the £11 million, the Budget will only be balanced and it will be possible only to maintain whatever increases we are giving instead of improving social benefits.</P>
      <P>I take a special interest in disabled people.  They got 2/6d. in this Budget, 2/6d. last year and 2/6d. the previous year.  Disabled people have got a half-crown increase for three years in succession but during the years of the Coalition Government, they got nothing.  This benefit was introduced in 1954 when disabled people got £1 but they got nothing extra until 1961. It was largely due to my constant agitation here that the Dáil woke up to the fact that there were such people as disabled people and the main reason they were forgotten is that they came within the health category and not the social welfare category.  I have been trying as best I can to have them put in the welfare category so that in future they will not be forgotten.  However, the fact remains that these disabled people have 25/- and that next week it will be 27/6d.  I am advocating that these people should get the same amount as non-contributory old age pensioners and that if there are substantial increases, they should also get such increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a realistic fellow, I came in here to be convinced and I am not convinced.The Leader of the Labour Party simply mentioned a couple of taxes of which he said he would approve and that £4 million could be got.  I am not accepting that and, anyway, the Leader of the Labour Party would be the junior in any Coalition Government.  It is the Fine Gael Party who would be the seniors and they opposed the corporation <Col N="610" /> profits tax; in fact, the Fine Gael Party do not agree with any other Party.  Therefore, you have a possible coalition Government divided amongst themselves, one Party saying they would not mind a few taxes on the well-to-do that might yield £4 million &mdash;but there is no evidence of it&mdash;and the other Party not in favour of what the Labour Party advocate, although they themselves advocate nothing. How can a person like me be convinced by that negative, divided attitude of people who want to form a Government?</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to say that the people do not like the tax.  The public representative's job is to advise and guide the people.  The man in the street has not got the experience or the financial knowledge necessary. Therefore, it is the public representative's job to think ahead, to advise people and prevent them from walking themselves into some trap.  It is all right to go before the people in a general election at the end of a period of office but you cannot go along with the people every time.  The people will object to any tax.  Let us say for argument's sake that the Fine Gael Party fooled the people into putting them into power without disclosing their hand, where would they get the £11 million or the £20 million?</P>
    <P>Do not forget that £11 million will not be enough.  It will not cover next year.  What would the people do then? Surely the people would not throw their arms around Deputy Dillon? Surely they would march up and down O'Connell Street and hold monster meetings?  Surely there would be deputations in here and people would be writing letters to the members? Surely there would be a revolt among Independents who would not agree to the taxation and surely there would be a demand for a general election? Surely the whole thing would start all over again?  Surely we are not here to create crises?  We are here to do a job of work and if we get in, we should be allowed to pursue and advance our case and then go to the people periodically.</P>
    <P>What evidence have we got that the <Col N="611" /> turnover tax is going to cripple everybody?There is no evidence; there is only hearsay.  During the week, I read that certain firms had announced they were going to absorb the tax and would not put it on.  A number of the supermarkets have said they are not going to put it on.  The tote people have said that they will not put it on. I can imagine a big store deciding not to put it on and all the other people putting it on and then what will the people do?  They will go to the big store and boycott the others and the others will have to cut their prices. There is no evidence that this is going to crucify anyone.  This is a flame which is being fanned because naturally the one ambition of members of political Parties is to become Cabinet Ministers and to go around in flashy cars and to be entertained.  That is very nice.  They referred to the Taoiseach's visit to America but their mouths are watering because they were not over there.  Naturally they would like to have been over there.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that the Opposition would like to get into power but the only way they can get in is by fanning some flame, by exaggerating and trying to frighten the people.  During the by-election in Dublin North-East, they certainly fanned the flame in a way in which it is unlikely to be fanned again.  They had the people worried to death about what would happen them.  They had the business people worried.  This tax gets at the business interests in a way in which a flat tax cannot get at them.  A flat tax means that money is put on some goods and perhaps the shopkeeper puts on a bit for himself but this tax gets behind what he is doing on the quiet. It gets at all the machinations of business people.  It gets at transactions and various incomes, interest on money in the banks and all to such an extent that the Government hope to hook £4 million or £5 million from these people and which they would not be able to get by a flat tax.  That is very important and that is why these people are in a panic.  Naturally we all would be.  If I were a shopkeeper, I would not like it, but Governments are not there to suit individuals or groups of <Col N="612" /> individuals but to do justice to everyone and if a person is doing well, to make him contribute.  The proof that this tax is getting at those people is the fact that Fine Gael objected to that feature which the Labour Party accepted.  The fellow with the money is going to contribute £4 million but Fine Gael will not have that.  They will be the Government; it will not be the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Let us talk now about food.  This aspect of course has been used to fan the flame.  It all sounds very fine but do not forget that not only is the food of the poor taxed &mdash; those who get the money back &mdash; but the food of the rich is also taxed.  Do not forget all the thousands of people who go into hotels in the evening and have chicken dinners and pay 15/- to £1.  They will be paying the tax on a £1 dinner and not on a fish and chip dinner.  When you look at it this way you will see that this tax will take £2 million or £3 million out of the pockets of such people, the fellows who lower &ldquo;large ones&rdquo; all day.  If this money were not obtained in this way, it would have to be obtained in the usual way and there is no way other than taxing cigarettes, beer and so on.</P>
    <P>Try to understand that the shopkeepers are not like the poor.  The poor have no experience.  They do not think.  The shopkeepers and business people are cute and that is why they are shopkeepers and business people. They look ahead; they anticipate the future; and they are concerned about matters about which the poor know nothing.  When they heard about this tax, they said: &ldquo;This is going to get at us in a way we did not expect&rdquo; and they poured money into the pockets of the Fine Gael Party.  Remember the big march which was held here six months ago?  Ten thousand people in flashy cars.  They all got a few pounds in their pockets and first-class tickets from the country.  Why were they so anxious to defeat the tax? Surely it was not because of their softness of heart for the poor man in the street?  Why are they now profiteering?Because of revenge, naturally, because the Government have got at them and got at £5 million or £6 million <Col N="613" /> which can be used for a good cause.</P>
    <P>Take the question of beer.  There should be only a halfpenny on a bottle of stout or on a pint by right but they are putting on a penny.  Deputy Dillon said it was twopence but he is wrong. That may be the case in some places in the country but in Dublin it is a penny.  It is up to the Government to be tough with these people and I am telling them to be tough with them and if they have not got sufficient power to deal with them they should introduce a Bill immediately to provide the necessary powers.  I believe that if the people have to pay only 2½ per cent, a miserable 6d. in the £, they will not object.  In fact, I have heard no objections.  The only objections I heard were from some of those shopkeepers who were shedding crocodile tears for the poor a few months ago.</P>
    <P>Someone said to me: &ldquo;We will have to pay on a pair of boots costing £2&rdquo;.  What will they have to pay? Only 1/-, but they will spend more than that playing Bingo every week. Some people in my area subscribe to two or three pools every week.  What is the argument about?  Let us take the people in the social benefit class. Take an unemployed man with a wife and five children.  He will get half-a-crown for himself and for his wife and he will get increased social benefits which will work out approximately at 11/- extra per week, not a month.  He will get 2/6d. for the first child and 3/4½d. for the other four.  What has he to pay?  An unemployed man never has more than about £4 maximum, and he does not pay tax on the whole £4 because he does not pay on rent or such things as insurance or bus fares.  Let us say, for argument's sake, he had to pay 6d. on the £4.  That would be 2/-.  He hands out 2/- and he will get back 11/-.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose, for argument's sake, the shopkeepers decide to rob him and charge him 5 per cent, not 2½ per cent. All right, then.  Allowing for what he is charged, allowing for the profiteering, it will cost him 4/- but he will get 11/-.  Therefore, following this up any way you like, the proposal in the turnover <Col N="614" /> tax actually does cover the cost of living as far as the poor are concerned.When all those tears are shed about the tax on bread and butter, and so on, it is all covered and, therefore, it is costing them nothing.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to do away with the tax on food they would miss £2 million or £3 million on the flashy crowd, on the hotel crowd, as well&mdash; the crowd that eats big.  Therefore, they are getting in a couple of million pounds plus a couple of million pounds corporation profits tax.  They are getting £5 million or £6 million that they would never get on the flat tax &mdash;and they are giving it back.</P>
    <P>You are not to judge this tax on what will be done this year.  It must be remembered that the Government could not be expected to give increases in social benefits this year.  How could they be expected to do so in a year when there was a deficit of £7 million? In other words, if we needed £7 million to balance the Budget nobody could expect that this year there would be an increase in social welfare benefits. Therefore, the social welfare benefits are being granted to cover all the bogeys the Opposition are inventing.</P>
    <P>I am a futurist.  I am looking into the future.  I do not live in the present. That is the advantage I have over other people here.  If there is any hope in the world of those social welfare benefit classes getting something substantial like 5/- and 10/- it will take time and it must be done in easy stages.  It is easy for people to talk about &ldquo;a miserable 2/6d.&rdquo; you cannot judge it in that way when you remember that there are hundreds of thousands of people who will get the 2/6d. every week.  When you look at it in that way, you begin to think in terms of £3 million and £4 million. To give 2/6d. here and there it costs £3 million and £4 million. Therefore, when you talk about giving them 10/- you are thinking in terms of £8 million and £10 million.  If the Government said: &ldquo;We will give everybody in receipt of social welfare benefit 10/- `buckshee' this year and impose the 2½ per cent tax on everybody&rdquo; it is not easily done.  It can be done only in stages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> The reason I am accepting the turnover tax&mdash;not that I am in love with it any more than the Government&mdash;is that it balances the Budget.  It protects the people who will have to pay on food supplies.  But the important thing to me is that it gives the Government a real chance of getting a hold of money which will enable them next year or the following year to give something substantial that will enable those people to get a higher standard of increases.  I see in the long sense&mdash; not in terms of people cribbing on the streets.  People have no experience. They are easily fanned and flamed.  It is well known in the play <i>Julius Caesar</i> by Shakespeare that Brutus inflamed the crowd and when eloquent Mark Antony came he too inflamed them the other way.  That is the public.</P>
    <P>It is up to the public representatives to think for the public&mdash;not to run with the public.  That is cowardly. You think for the public.  You advise the public and you try to put them on the right lines but you do not run with the public.  I hold that that is cowardly and that eventually a man who does that is found out.</P>
    <P>If there were an election tomorrow, I would have a hard fight because some of those things I am talking about are not understood by people. I would be trying to save them from themselves but they might not understand.The world is full of people who die on a cross to save people from themselves&mdash;do not forget that.  People do not understand but they have to be saved.  People like Gandhi and even Christ himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In my own way, I do it because I know they have no hopes: if it is money that they want, they have no hopes unless it is gathered in and that cannot be done by promises. The money must be there.  All the allegations are lies because, as I said, it serves the Opposition.  It gives them the chance to get out in the swank car: that is understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were not convinced, certainly I should not be supporting the Government.I do not worry about opposition. <Col N="616" /> I believe there are enough people, in the long run, who are honest and decent and who will see your work and the road you are travelling.  I believe I shall survive any election: do not &ldquo;kid&rdquo; yourself about that.</P>
    <P>I sat down this evening and was working out what would happen if this Government went tomorrow.  We are asking for an election.  All right; I shall deal with that.  It is said that the Government should look for a mandate to impose this tax.  If it is necessary, therefore, always to go to the country to get a mandate if you want to initiate policy such as increases in taxation&mdash;if that is accepted &mdash;then the Coalition Government will have to go to the country again themselves because they have not stated their taxes.</P>
    <P>If they come back and put money on everything how can they justify it? In the <i>Evening Herald</i> this evening, there is a reference to a possible general election.  The editor says: let the Parties put their programmes before the people.  I accept that.  I accept that this is a turnover tax.  It is not as bad as it is painted.  It hits the well off.  The other people have no policy, or, if they have, they will not express it.  I shall refer to the phantom tax of the Opposition as &ldquo;the turntable tax&rdquo; because the Opposition intend to turn the tables on the voters, if elected.  On the assumption that all these taxes will go if the present Opposition are returned to power and everybody can drink another small one and there is no need to pay the proposed tax on it&mdash;if that is what they are putting before the people&mdash;and then they come back and start putting on their taxes, will they not then be turning the tables on the public?  What else is it?</P>
    <P>I accept the leading article in this evening's <i>Evening Herald:</i> put your programme before the people.  I accept that.  What is the £11 million or £15 million going on?  It does not stop there.  There are the farmers and the teachers.  Recently we had a strike of post office workers, which was supported by the Opposition.  All this means there must be more money and more taxation.  What taxation will the Opposition impose?  Apart from the <Col N="617" /> £3 million or £4 million the Labour Party said they could get by soaking the rich, what about the other £8 million?  What about the millions wanted for the old age pensioners?</P>
    <P>All these things matter to me.  That is why, in the interests of the people, I am accepting the Government's proposals.I have no alternative.  I will not deceive the people, even though it would pay me to deceive them.  It does not pay me to support the Government.I know allegations are made, but I watch every single paper in Ireland to see if they make any single remark on which I could bring them to the High Court.  I went on a short holiday to England this year.  I had to travel steerage as usual and travel midweek to avail of the cheaper fares.  People say that I got this and I got that.  I did not get a &ldquo;butt&rdquo;; I had to go steerage the same as I go every year. Talk about getting an advantage! I said some time ago I could have been Lord Mayor of Dublin if I voted against the Government.  That is true.</P>

While Deputy Coughlan is looking after his bookie's shop and his pub, I am in the Corporation looking after my work.  On merit alone, I deserve it.  When I was offered the Mayoralty by two deputations, I refused it, and I have a Fine Gael councillor, a Fianna Fáil councillor and a Ratepayer's councillor to witness that I was offered the Mayoralty. I had everything to get by being false to my convictions.  But I feel a better man by being true to them.  I feel very tough within, and any man with conviction feels tough within.  Do not mind wealth and power.  That is why I am afraid of nobody.  Suppose there were an election and I were beaten, I would come back and head the poll in the first by-election.  What is the difference?  All the agitation would start again.  The minute this crowd got back, there would be crisis after crisis.  To get in here I used to shove a handcart down to the scrapyard. <Col N="618" /> Nothing is dirty that does not injure the soul.</P>
      <P>The only thing I wish is that I could speak to the people.  It is a waste of time speaking in here.  No man can convince vested interests.  If there is an election, what I have to say will go to every single constituent.  I will put the other side and put it very clearly.  I will bring home to the people that within the past six months certain gentlemen hoping to get some of my votes not only actually voted not to give people in the street a house but voted to put up the rents.  I have it on the minutes.  Those people think I am some softy to be knocked over easily, but they are making a mistake. Let the Opposition say how they are going to get the money to advance the old age pension from 35/- to 40/- or 50/-.  Do not take advantage of the fact that people are simple-minded and object to giving anything away. Suppose the people had to decide on everything objectionable, they would vote for no taxes and nobody would be paid.  There would be nothing for old age pensioners.  It would be back to potatoes and salt, back to the work-houses.Since income tax was introduced during the Napoleonic struggle, there has been mass objection to it, even when it was 3d. in the £.  If the country were facing an invasion tomorrow and the people were facing slavery for another 300 years, would they vote in favour of conscription if the Taoiseach asked for a mandate? No, they would rather be slaves.  Men have to work for the people, guide them and inspire them.  In the second year of the American Civil War when conscription was put to the people in the States, there were riots and a large number of people were killed in New York alone.  If you allow the people to decide objectionable things, you will have nothing.  I have experience of people with no children wanting a house before people with children and people not yet married wanting a house before those who are married. People are selfish.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is unprecedented because of the fact that this turnover tax became law under the Finance Act passed some four months ago.  The various stages of the Finance Bill were passed by a majority of this House.  This motion and the Fine Gael motion ruled out of order were put down this week, not because of any public pressure or change of feeling among the people.  If so, we would have had a motion of this kind, a motion of no confidence, immediately after the passage of the Finance Act under which this turnover tax became law.  These motions came for only one reason&mdash;the death of the late lamented Deputy Galvin.  The Opposition Parties, with rather indecent haste, before his bones were cold, endeavoured to take advantage of the situation here to try to bring down the Government. Let nobody be fooled as to why these motions are tabled.  Let nobody be <Col N="620" /> fooled outside the House, particularly the electorate in Cork, as to why these motions were tabled.  They were tabled for the very reason I have given.</P>
      <P>These people waited like vultures over a grave to use a political opportunity to get this Government out of office, without having the courage to tell the public what type of Government is to come in to replace this Government.  Also, these motions have been put down with these people cynically refusing to propose any alternative methods of taxation that would provide the money necessary for the Exchequer to carry on and finance national government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish referred to what he described as the cheek of the Taoiseach and the Government to impose this tax, and said that we were a minority Government.  He also admitted, rather naïvely, that the money was needed but he was just as silent as the Fine Gael leader as to how this money was to be provided.  He was silent on one very important matter for him personally and that is to say what form of alternative Government he suggests if this Government are replaced.</P>
      <P>Throughout the whole of Deputy Corish's speech, he was silent as to the role he would play, should this Government be defeated.  He is going to leave the door open, at all events, for another coalition Government just the same as the one in which he formerly participated and which brought this nation to the edge of bankruptcy.  But I think the people outside, whatever about Deputies here, will not be satisfied with statements from some backbench Labour Deputies on this issue. Particularly, the people who will soon be voting in the Cork by-election and this House are entitled to know what is going to be the attitude of Deputy Corish in the event of more instability in Government here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as the Taoiseach said tonight, that we advised the people to take a certain course in changing our system of election.  That advice was rejected, mainly, in my view, because of the pictures that were painted and the fears created in people's minds as to what would happen if we changed the PR system.  We came back after <Col N="621" /> the last election, not with an overall majority but, of course, with by far the largest Party and the only Party capable of forming a Government. The Taoiseach, on behalf of the Party, undertook to the nation that as far as he could, with the resources at his disposal under our democratic procedure, he would carry on government.  We have, irrespective of our position here, published our programme and we have carried out that programme and have not deviated from it one inch regardless of the danger in which some of these measures would involve us politically in this House.</P>
    <P>We know Deputy Dillon and his Party are quite entitled to promise anything they wish to the public because you will notice they will always qualify it by saying that they will do this, that and the other if they are returned with a Fine Gael majority. Everybody knows there is no hope on the horizon, to use one of his own expressions, in the foreseeable future, that Fine Gael can possibly get any majority.  They are here with 46 or 47 seats and under our present structure here the only alternative to this Government is some type of machination between Fine Gael and the Labour Party and it is very strange that Deputy Corish on all public occasions, notwithstanding directions given by trade unions, notwithstanding some public statements by Deputies of his own Party, notwithstanding Deputy Larking having gone on record as to what Fine Gael did to them in the dark of the night as well as during the day during the period of the last Coalition Government, has been careful not to give any public undertaking that he will not, if the occasion arises, join in another Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>He referred tonight to the sheepish backbenchers of Fianna Fáil and said that they were rather silent.  I invite the &ldquo;sheepish&rdquo; backbenchers of my Party to examine the image of this revolutionary Labour leader, the pin up boy of the <i>Irish Times</i>&mdash;the two things do not fit in very well&mdash;as to his intentions on behalf of Irish labour. Everybody who has judged the records knows that if this situation arises again Deputy Corish would undoubtedly take <Col N="622" /> the very same action that he took when we had a similar period of instability before and join in forming a Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Rural Deputies know that it happens from time to time about the springtime that no matter what strain of hen the farmer has an odd one runs wild, goes out and lays under a whin bush and eventually comes back with a multi-coloured clutch that neither the farmer nor anybody in his household bargained for.  The strange thing about that type of hen is that, having done that once, you can bet odds on she will pursue the same policy the following year and the year after unless she is roped in.  We know from Deputy Corish's attitude here tonight, he has been so anxious to rush in with Fine Gael to endeavour to defeat the programme and policy of the Government, that that is what he has in mind.  The people who support Labour outside are entitled to ask Deputy Corish, as I do, not to be so shy on this issue because it is much more important for the people to know whether he intends to do the same as he did before or take the advice of some of his fellow Deputies and of the trade unions and not be caught up again in the disaster of another Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the record of that final, fatal year for this country and for that particular Government in 1956.  As far as rural Ireland is concerned, it was a disastrous year, so much so that the figures of 100,000 unemployeed and 55,000 emigrants were an all-time record brought about by the financial collapse of the policies of that Government.  One of the Departments which has a vital effect on employment and on the economy of rural Ireland is the Department of Lands.  When the cold coalition winds started to blow, Deputy Sweetman called in all the boys, including Deputy Corish, who was then a Minister in that Coalition Government.  He told him there was no money to be found and £8 million must be lopped off. The direction went out to each and every Minister.  The Department of Lands was one of the first to come under the axe; in one week, Deputy <Col N="623" /> Blowick had to lay off 653 men working under the Irish Land Commission because no money could be found for him.  He was ordered to cut his cloth to the extent of £112,000.  Forestry work had to be curtailed.  In local government, the results were disastrous. Housing had to finish.  Contractors could not meet their bills.  In my own county, the county manager had to issue a direction that no cheque for more than £20 could be issued by the Mayo County Council.</P>
    <P>Those were some of the achievements of that Coalition Government in the fatal year of 1956.  The direction was given by the Minister for Finance, and other Ministers were told they would have to settle for a priority of unpleasantness.My heavens, what a priority of unpleasantness it was for the people of this country then.  That disastrous financial position snowballed because of a complete lack of public confidence and lack of faith in the then Government.</P>

      <P>There was recession in every branch of the public services. There was recession in every branch of public spending.  From the provision of money for mineral exploration, up and down, there was no phase of <Col N="624" /> national effort that had not to be either curtailed or completely closed down because of the disastrous position brought about by coalition government in this country.  Indeed, it reached the stage when, just before selling the furniture to pay the bills, they had to start selling some of our airplanes in order to provide some money to keep going.</P>
      <P>That was the situation in 1956 and that undoubtedly would be the situation again tomorrow if we were faced again with the tragedy of coalition Government here.  Mark you, I do not think that will happen, but it is just as well that the people should be reminded about what happened then. It was because of massive unemployment, massive emigration, the disaster and woe, and loss of confidence throughout the country, loss of faith in our own people and in our own institutions, that the people, when they got the chance at last, gave this Party the greatest majority and Party could get under the system of proportional representation practised here.</P>

      <P>That happened because the nation was brought to the verge of disaster and the people, irrespective of Party affiliation, realised that the one hope was to put a Party in power who would elect a Government capable of ruling.  That was done.  It took a considerable time to bring the country back to the position in which it is today because, once confidence is destroyed, it is not easily regained.  It is very easy to destroy confidence in the State, in our system, in our ability to progress, in our ability to move by our own efforts.  Once confidence is destroyed, it is not easily built up again.  It took this Party in Government a considerable time to restore confidence in ourselves, the confidence that is so evident now everywhere one goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assert, and I do not believe anybody will accept that this is solely due to outside forces, that the figures are <Col N="625" /> there and cannot be denied, figures to show the economic progress that has been made.  There was never in this State so much confidence by our own people in themselves.  There was never more evidence of the community spirit throughout the length and breadth of the land under the leadership that is given.  There was never more faith on the part of our people, young and old, in the ability of all our people to carve out a future for themselves in this land.  There was never more hope amongest our people as to what can be attained economically by ourselves with our own efforts under wise and sound leadership.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office on the last occasion, they published for all to see the course we proposed to pursue in the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  Not alone did we reach the target set out in that Programme but, with the wholehearted co-operation of our people, we exceeded the target beyond our wildest dreams; we had more than seven per cent per annum increase in our gross national product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In some years, it went as high as seven per cent.  It was an average of four per cent.  In the new <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> having made the goals set out in the first one, we propose to move forward as set out in that Programme for all to see and to achieve the further expansion in our economy that is likewise there for all to see.</P>
      <P>We have also told the people, both in the Budget this year and before it, that it would be necessary to finance this Programme, that if we were to achieve the expansionist programme we have set out to achieve, the nation must finance it.  We have provided the means by which this Programme can be financed in the turnover tax which we regard as the fairest form of taxation to finance the new <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which will set another headline and give another lead in the march of progress of this nation under the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon came in here to <Col N="626" /> support this motion and, mark you, when it comes to cheek and neck, Deputy Dillon is not short.  He began by taking the Taoiseach to task about what happened during the war years when he had to control wages, and said that the people threw the Taoiseach out after that.  Of course Deputy Dillon conveniently has a very short memory because even the Party he now belongs to, even the Blueshirts, would have nothing to do with him. They passed him over.  He was the king's man in this House, the only king's man, in those years, and he comes in tonight as the queen's man to make the queen's speech for the boys.</P>

He was slow to tell even his colleagues where he is to find the money that must replace this turnover tax or how he will provide the national finances, how he will continue any of the programmes laid down by us for national development, if he or those who support him get the reins of office.</P>
      <P>In addition to the matters set out in the new <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> there are many other measures of national importance that require substantial extra financing. Introduced to this House in recent months have been many such measures and the new Land Bill, which has been circulated to Deputies, requires a very considerable amount of extra money. The acquisition of land alone will require an increase of £5 million.  There are to be new loans and grants for small farmers for house building which will increase expenditure under those headings by 50 per cent.  I feel sure all these measures will be applauded by rural Deputies.</P>

      <P>Increased grants in respect of in-calf heifers were announced by the Minister for Agriculture recently.  These new grants will amount to £15 per head.  That will run into a very large expenditure indeed.  Unlike Deputy Dillon and <Col N="627" /> his colleagues, this Government do not publish a <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> without providing the necessary measures to enable the people to achieve the targets we set out, and under this scheme of the Minister for Agriculture are the means to increase the cattle population to the target set out.  That is our reply to the sneering references made on the other side of the House that all our cows would have to have triplets.  The difference between Fine Gael and us is that when we lay down targets and a national programme, we come along with enabling legislation to help our people achieve the national targets we set.</P>
      <P>We have achieved all the targets set. Step by step we are introducing the legislation to make our further targets realities.  More money is required for the vast national afforestation programme planned by this Government and which is continued year in, year out.  In dealing with this question, let me say that one of the Coalition tricks was illustrated in 1956 when they announced a programme for the planting of 17,500 acres but provided money for 15,000 acres only.  We have been progressing at the rate of 25,000 acres a year steadily for the past four years.</P>

He is shaking in his shoes about what may happen tonight because it is the last time he will sit here if there is an election.  The House knows all about the expansion of our industrial arm which has exceeded all expectations and which must proceed apace if we are to absorb our rising population. The House knows well that there is a still further demand for increased social benefits if the nation can afford them.</P>
      <P>Let me say now that not alone in this year's Budget but in every single Budget introduced by this Government the social welfare classes got their share in so far as money could be afforded for them.  That has always been the policy of this Party.  If we are to continue with this programme of national economic expansion, if we are to continue to encourage our people to continue the efforts they have so successfully made in achieving the targets set for them in the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, this turnover tax is one of the vital sinews.</P>

He is being just as dumb on this issue as Deputy Dillon but he is prepared to guard as closely as Deputy Dillon the secret of how the revenue from this turnover tax could be raised otherwise.  His policy is: &ldquo;We shall tell you when the election is over where we will find the money.&rdquo;  I do not believe our people are so silly as to fall for a line of that kind.  I do not believe they will fall for the Coalition pig in the bag which Opposition Deputies have tried to sell to them across the floor of the House tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully confident, notwithstanding the opportunism of this motion, notwithstanding Deputy Corish's reference to the sheepish members of the backbenches of Fianna Fáil, notwithstanding the Houdini exhibition of Deputy <Col N="629" /> Dillon here tonight, that the people throughout the length and breadth of this land appreciate the achievements of this Government in bringing the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> to fruition.  I am fully satisfied that the sheepish backbenchers of Fianna Fáil will come back to crow over the graves of the opportunist Coalition Deputies, of the Blueshirts over there, and I can here and now undertake to the House on behalf of this Government that, irrespective of the boasts here, we shall follow the strong train behind the Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, to lead this nation to further economic expansion and to further prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is one obvious defect in the Government's case this evening.  In order to substitute for a sound argument, both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Lands have repeatedly raised their voice.  It is not necessary, in order to emphasise the present situation, to shout or talk loudly about it.  The facts are quite simple.  We are opposed to this turnover tax because we believe it is unnecessary, inequitable and indiscriminate in its application to our economy.  It will cause widespread inflation and it will raise the cost of living on every single individual, on each family and on every household.</P>
      <P>Not merely will it raise the cost of living to each individual, family and household but it will raise the cost of production and thereby affect agriculture, and, in particular, industry. Fianna Fáil have attempted to plead, during the course of this debate and during the debate on the Finance Bill last summer, that that tax was inevitably necessary, that the ordinary sources of revenue were no longer adequate to meet the tax requirements of the country and that unless this tax were imposed, it would be impossible to carry on the various essential services on many of which there is general agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We deny that assertion and we refuse to accept that claim.  We do so because when we examine the basis on which this tax was introduced, we find that there is a strong volume of informed opinion against a purchase <Col N="630" /> tax or turnover tax in its present form, and that that informed opinion is not confined to politicians or to those concerned with it, either here or among local authorities.  This matter was the subject of most exhaustive and careful examination by the Commission on Income Taxation.  That Commission brought in two reports, a majority and a minority report.  The majority of one and consisted of six members of the Commission while the minority report consisted of five.</P>
    <P>In the majority report in which a purchase tax, not a turnover tax, was recommended, there was a specific statement that that tax should exclude a number of commodities.  Included in those commodities was a fairly lengthy list of goods, but, in particular, it recommended that the exclusion should apply to goods essential to agricultural production, industrial production, exports, both agricultural and industrial, food, particularly essential food, fuel, newspapers and books, non-durable household goods and goods already subject to heavy customs and excise duties, such as tobacco.</P>
    <P>These exclusions were specifically recommended by the majority in their recommendations that a purchase tax be introduced.  In addition to the recommended exclusions which were specifically mentioned in the majority report, the minority report was solidly opposed to a tax of this character. They sought the advice of a number of outside economists and these people, three of whose statements are contained in the report, stated that they were opposed to a purchase tax in this country.  One of them was Reverend Paschal Larkin, OFM Cap, Professor of Economics in UCC.  He said:</P>
    <P>The expediency of a general purchase tax is very controversial.  Its suitability for this country is very questionable owing to our low per capita income, and our rather static consumption habits.  Even in England there is a strong campaign for further substantial reductions in purchase tax, and its ultimate abolition.</P>
    <P>Professor Duncan of Trinity College said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> All sales or purchase taxes possess three qualities in common: They are excise duties, falling with greater or less inequity according to their technical construction.  They are regressive, since, to raise revenue in significant amounts, they must fall on articles of common consumption. They impose vast amounts of paper work and accounting on traders and consequently predispose to evasion.</P>
    <P>Mr. David O'Mahony, Lecturer in Economics, University College, Cork, said:</P>
    <P>A purchase tax would tend to raise the cost of living and thus stimulate demands for increases in money incomes, which would in turn increase costs and thus impair our competitive position.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to quote other opinions on this matter from different economic sources but there is one very strong argument against it, made, not by economists or by any member of that Commission, but by the Taoiseach when he sat over here as Deputy Lemass.  He is reported in the Dáil Debates of the 17th May, 1956, at column 621, Volume 157 as saying:</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that most people who have written upon the theory of public finance subscribe to the view that it is desirable that the number of separate taxes should be kept as few as possible, that the State should rely for the bulk of its revenue on a few main taxes and should not try to multiply the number of separate taxes.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>There is an obvious reason for that.  It is undesirable that the hand of the tax gatherer should be brought into business.  The number of business subject to the regulations which is necessarily involved in the collection of taxes should be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>That was Deputy Lemass in 1956.  He continued:</P>
    <P>Government intervention for taxraising purposes in any business always results in waste and is a cause <Col N="632" /> of higher costs as well as of higher prices.  Furthermore, it is obvious to expect that the smaller the yield from any tax, the higher will be the proportion of that yield absorbed in collection expenses.  And, the wider the number of taxes, the greater the prospect of successful evasion by individuals.</P>
    <P>That is a pretty wide argument against a broad-based sales tax, purchase tax or turnover tax.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons advanced by those who signed the minority report is contained in paragraph 14 on page 75 of the Third Report on Income Taxation which says that a purchase tax under any guise is a bad tax.  Nobody has been more vocal on the question of price stability than the Taoiseach.  One of the reasons why the White Paper on the pay pause was introduced was to emphasise the need for price stability and the desirability of a step by step approach in the relationship of national income to wages and salaries.  It was stated that the national economy would be best served by a constructive national approach to that problem.</P>
    <P>One of the most hopeful signs in recent years was the decision of the Federated Union of Employers and the trade union organisations to meet in the Joint Labour-Employer Conference which took place in July of last year and which has met since. Does anyone doubt that that enlightened concept will be jeopardised, if not torpedoed, by the inflationary effects, the cumulative effects, of the price rises inherent in the present 2½ per cent proposal as enshrined in the Finance Bill?</P>
    <P>One matter that has been the subject of comment here in recent weeks has been the fact that there have already been widespread price increases.  Some of these price increases are undoubtedly due to external factors, to causes outside the control of any Government.  Leaving aside the ones that are outside our control, look at the position in which medicines have been invoiced to chemists at eight per cent of an increase.  Where is the 2½ per cent?  Where are the reasonable increases which the Minister for <Col N="633" /> Industry and Commerce asserted he is prepared to take action if exceeded? When does reasonableness cease to exist?</P>
    <P>We were told that this tax was 6d. in the £, that it was a simple tax, that administrative costs of collection were infinitesimal.  Already, in the case of beer, the tax has meant an increase of seven per cent.  In the case, as I say, of medicines it has meant eight per cent.  It is going to mean in a variety of cases anything from eight to ten per cent because of the cumulative effect.</P>
    <P>One of the disabilities in this tax is, as Deputy Corish pointed out in the initial speech here this evening, that not alone is the tax on those goods and commodities which are the traditional suppliers of revenue, such as tobacco, beer, spirits, increased as a result of this tax, but instead of the Minister for Finance getting all the revenue from whatever increased taxation would be imposed upon them, portion of it is now siphoned off to the trade and absorbed in other costs.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that some of the traditional taxes would result in diminishing return but is it not a fact that already in this Budget there is a penny on the pint, 2d. on cigarettes; but there will be a cumulative effect which will affect and influence, if it does not jeopardise completely, the rational approach to the wage and salary structure enshrined in the Labour-Employer Conference.</P>
    <P>One of the claims made by Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach is that they have a modern progressive approach to the present situation.  It is worth while examining that.  I think some of their more eloquent spokesmen described it as a dynamic modern approach.  One of the benefits introduced by the inter-Party Government when elected in 1948 was conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service. That conciliation and arbitration was extended to include civil servants, Garda, the Army, teachers and a great variety of public servants.  What were the circumstances in which that decision was taken, that enlightened legislation passed by the inter-Party Government?It was introduced after a <Col N="634" /> period in which Fianna Fáil had had an overall majority, in which there had been for months a teachers' strike, in which, because of the refusal to grant arbitration and conciliation, people had to take the only action available to them to enforce their demands and to secure a reasonable and rational approach.</P>
    <P>Quite recently, we had the experience of the reluctant refusal of the Government to extend arbitration to some of the remaining categories not already brought within the ambit of that conciliation and arbitration machinery and the Taoiseach got eloquent here this evening and asserted that if we did not give this money, there would not be money to pay for the salaries and increases for teachers, guards, the Army and other State personnel.That kind of bogey talk does not wash.  Remember, the only Government who refused to implement an arbitration award in this country were Fianna Fáil, in 1953, when they refused to back-date the award given by the conciliation and arbitration machinery to the Civil Service.  What happened? When we were elected in 1954, we not merely implemented it but gave back the backmoney that was denied to the people and that had been approved under arbitration and conciliation.  Is that evidence of a dynamic, modern, enlightened approach to the problems of the wage and salary earners in this community?</P>
    <P>Have not Fianna Fáil been dragged into the 20th century?  Have not they been forced into it by the widespread demand, not merely of the trade unions but of every vocal element in the community, that had to exact for themselves a reasonable and fair approach to the problem of wage and salary adjustments and to the needs of decent people to get what they were entitled to and to have their problems considered in a rational and sympathetic way?</P>
    <P>One of the other embryonic proposals that never saw the light of day when Deputy Lemass was Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1957 was a Prices and Efficiency Bill.  That Bill was in draft form when I went into the Department of Industry and Commerce in 1948.  Like myself, the <Col N="635" /> Taoiseach has not a very elegant style of handwriting.  One of the recommendations in the draft proposals was that there should be drastic penalties for a refusal to implement the directives which would be mandatory not merely on traders but on trade unions. These draft proposals did not appear severe enough to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and, in his own handwriting, with the initials &ldquo;S.F.L.&rdquo; after it, was a direction that the penalties should be increased to £500 in respect of firms who failed to implement the directives and the direction that criminal proceedings would lie against those who failed to accede to directives contained in the awards of the tribunal which would be established under that legislation.</P>
    <P>These are known facts.  One, in the case of the refusal to implement the award in respect of the Civil Service, teachers and others, the refusal to backdate it.  All that does not indicate a dynamic, modern approach.  In fact, it refutes the suggestions made that if there is a change of Government, there will be no money to pay the increases granted in respect of public servants.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned, our record in arbitration and conciliation is one of which not merely are we not ashamed but of which we are proud.  We are prepared to implement, and have implemented in the past, every single award in respect of any category of public servants and we are prepared, further, to extend arbitration and conciliation to any other category not yet within the ambit of the existing machinery and who have a legitimate claim to be incorporated within it.</P>
    <P>One of the factors upon which Fianna Fáil have laid great stress in the course of this debate is the claim that there has been a remarkable increase in production and a general improvement in the economy since the change of Government.  One of the proposals which was specified in some detail by the Taoiseach when in opposition was a proposal to provide over a five-year period&mdash;and now Fianna Fáil have had a total of six-and-a-half years in which to implement <Col N="636" /> that policy&mdash;100,000 new jobs, and these jobs were not to be provided in Birmingham or any other part of Britain; they were to be provided here.</P>
    <P>In <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued prior to the Budget this year, we find that the total number in employment in 1962 was 1,068,000.  In 1956, the year which Fianna Fáil are often criticising as a bad year, the number in employment was 1,127,000.  That drop in employment has taken place at a time when improved economic conditions are supposed to exist here.  Not merely has that happened but, at the same time, there has been a very substantial decline in the number of houses built.</P>
    <P>One of the claims which has been made in the course of this debate and in the course of other discussions over the past few months is that Fianna Fáil have a broad social programme for improved conditions.  Remember, monetary benefits alone do not provide a progressive or enlightened or sound social programme.  In fact, one of the characteristics of the Fianna Fáil administration has been that the increases given in old age and widows' and orphans' pensions have all been less than the increase in the cost of living, whereas during our period in office when we gave increased social welfare benefits to widows, orphans, old age pensioners and others, the increase was always higher than any rise in the cost of living.  We always endeavoured to keep these benefits higher than the actual rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>However, now when we are supposed to have improved social conditions and when we are supposed to have moved into an improved era, what has been the record in respect of housing?  I quote the figures in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, 1962, published in May.  In 1956-57, in the rural areas, 1,648 houses were built by local authorities; in the urban areas, 2,263 were built.  In 1957, in the rural areas there were 1,617 and in the urban areas, 3,167.  The total number of houses built with State aid in 1956 was 9,837 and, in 1957, 10,969.  Then, after five years of Fianna Fáil in office, we find that in 1961 in the rural areas, 627 houses were built and in the urban <Col N="637" /> areas, 836.  In 1962, 455 houses were built in the rural areas and 783 in the urban areas.  The total for 1961 was 5,798 and for 1962 it was 5,626, approximately half the number that was built by the inter-Party Government in 1956 and 1957.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that people think that the Government have lost touch with reality or have ceased to have contact with the needs of ordinary people?  How would it be received in this House if in 1956, in order to meet the housing problem, we brought caravans along and set up a caravan colony?  Would it not be asserted that we thought that what was good enough for itinerants was good enough for the nation?  That is not our policy.  We built houses and we will do it again. We want to see people put into decent homes and living in decent conditions, given reasonable stability and not being provided with caravans as temporary dwellings because of the toppled structures due to the lamentable delay and inactivity on the part of the Government and on the part of the Department of Local Government in sanctioning speedily and in sufficient numbers the necessary houses, particularly in Dublin city, Dún Laoghaire and other urban areas and in some rural areas as well.  That is an example of the less progressive activities of this Government during their period of office.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to consider social benefits without adequately considering the need for proper housing, proper accommodation and without affording people a reasonable prospect of providing a home for themselves and their families.  The idea of having itinerants' dwellings provided as a contribution to solving the housing problem is, as far as we are concerned, the very negation of social progress and the very negation of a national advance.Bringing in temporary dwellings may be all right for a city that is blitzed during the war or for a city that suffers from an earthquake or some other unforeseen disaster, but far from being a progressive, enlightened approach to the national social problems of this country today, it has all the hallmarks of the worst <Col N="638" /> features of the poor law system inherited from Britain over a century ago.</P>
    <P>One of the claims made in the course of this debate as well as in one or two recent speeches by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Justice is that nobody but Fine Gael want an election.  Of course that does not wash. I can understand the sensitivity of the Minister for Justice after his experience in his constituency in Dublin North-East.  It might have been true to make that claim before one by-election that has taken place in the past six months but, remember, that was a five-seat constituency in which at the previous election Fianna Fáil had a majority of three out of the five seats and many Deputies will recollect the prodigious expenditure of effort and money on that occasion because the only Party that has the money to spend in elections on the scale on which they do spend are Fianna Fáil. They spent a vast sum of money, not only on the ordinary election propaganda but on a film that was shown over Telefís Éireann.  That was the occasion on which it was found that &ldquo;Stan was not the man.&rdquo;  We found that, having been in a minority, we became a majority emphatic so far as the direct vote between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil were concerned but the Labour Party candidate's vote increased and there was a most dramatic, informative and significant transfer of votes from the Labour candidate to the Fine Gael candidate which represented an overwhelming majority against Fianna Fáil and against the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there are any people either in this House or outside it who want to bet on a certainty, but the greatest certainty for a reasonable wager at any odds since Bahram won the Derby is the Fine Gael candidate in the Cork city by-election.So far as this Government are concerned, they may, either as a result of close voting tonight or some other temporary device, postpone the inevitable defeat but it is only a postponement.They cannot avert it and what Dublin started Cork will finish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> One of the claims that this Government have been making over a period is, as I said earlier, that they are progressive and enlightened and that everything is lovely.  On the one hand &mdash; and it is indeed a strange mixture of contrasts &mdash; you have occasionally the Taoiseach arrogant and intolerant and on the other hand, the Party present a picture of smug complacency. I do not care which picture is accepted but I want to examine for a moment the claim that they have an enlightened and progressive approach to one of the really great problems.  One of the matters to which we must face up realistically is that the whole key to our future progress and development depends not merely on our own exertions, ability and capacity but on the type of education we are prepared to provide for our people, that we must be prepared to provide the best possible standards and the greatest number of opportunities and that we will strain our resources to the utmost to do so.</P>
    <P>We have no great resources of raw materials or untapped mineral wealth. We have certain distinctive attributes. We have undoubtedly a fertile soil and we have a people of natural ability and skill.  If given the opportunity, and provided with a chance to train and equip themselves, academically, technically or scientifically, or in a trade or craft, they have an ability which is equal to that of those of any other country in the world, and are prepared to work as hard and as energetically and skilfully as any other people.  However, in the past that has been denied to our people.  One of the claims made by the Government is that they have a progressive approach. There is general agreement about providing not merely the best primary and secondary but vocational and technical training as well but one of the tests we have to apply in this matter is the amount of money provided by the State compared with the total national Budget.</P>
    <P>I find that the total sum for educational services for the financial year 1930-31 contained in the Supply Estimates was £4,967,000 or 21 per <Col N="640" /> cent of the total Supply Estimates. Thirty years later, after years and years of Fianna Fáil administration, the total provision for educational services was £19½ million, or 13.4 per cent of the total Supply Estimates. We have not kept pace commensurate with the growth in public expenditure and with what we were spending in 1930-31 on education.  We spent 21 per cent of the total Supply Estimates then and in 1961-62 we were only spending 13.4 per cent.  Is it not obvious that we have got to invest in education?  We are faced with the likely rise in France in the next decade of a doubled public expenditure on education and in this sphere the Taoiseach would do well to copy de Gaulle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we want the turnover tax for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Britain recently published the Robbins Report which proposed vast expenditure and the most dramatic changes in the whole approach to educational problems ever presented in that country.  There are two neighbouring countries with both of which we have close trading and other ties and we are away behind them.  We have not even kept pace with the rate of expenditure we had 30 years ago.  If we are to make progress we have to invest in education, to invest in our own people and provide them with the best possible standards and make up for the drawbacks in physical disabilities and the lack of raw materials which affect a small country like us compared with other more prosperous and better equipped countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the matters which I believe to some extent has affected the Taoiseach's approach and the approach of Fianna Fáil in this matter is what I have said in regard to the intolerant suggestion that only Fianna Fáil are fit to govern.  Remember that this State and this House was established without Fianna Fáil and since then we have had repeated Governments some of them with Fianna Fáil and some of them without Fianna Fáil and the country was governed better <Col N="641" /> without them than it was with them and it will be governed again without them.  I was struck recently by a quotation referring to the outgoing Prime Minister in Britain.  It was a quotation from Burke which said: &ldquo;What shadows we are and what shadows we pursue&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing which has affected the Taoiseach is that because this country received a good welcome in the United States of America and because of our position abroad he thinks everything is satisfactory.  It would be a mistake for the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil to be confused by the fact that at present we have in the world something we never had before, a President of the greatest country in the world who is of Irish extraction. It is natural enough that when a representative of the Irish Government goes to America he should get a warm reception.  But do not confuse that with the fact that a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach or Ministers get a warm reception there.  We have achieved an eminence in world affairs that we had not got before but it was this Party which brought this country into the League of Nations as well as into the United Nations and we have left Fianna Fáil all this machinery and all the opportunities for seeking for themselves whatever temporary kudos is to be gained from such a trip as that on which the Taoiseach recently went. Remember we have got to come back and render an account of ourselves to the people and the electorate.  We have done that in the past and loyally accepted the decision of the people and abided by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that what has happened in Dublin North-East is an indication of the opinions of the vast majority of the people.  It is a pity to wait until we get the result of a single by-election.The effective, clean and honourable way, which would reflect credit on the Government and the country and show us up as a mature democracy, not merely capable of running the country but of justifying our proud tradition and claim as a Christian people capable of running a <Col N="642" /> democracy efficiently, effectively and fairly, would be to offer the people, who are the ultimate masters, the ultimate arbiters of public policy, an opportunity of electing an alternative Government.  This motion and the Taoiseach's amendment may postpone, but it cannot avert, the people's decision that they want an opportunity to vote and when they get it, they will change the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long.  With the permission of the Chair, I should like to repeat what I said on 25th June last, as reported at columns 1637 and 1638 of the Official Report.  On that day, after failing to get an opportunity to speak, Deputy Norton suggested to you, Sir, that, if you were agreeable, he would give me three minutes of his time.  This is what I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin prefaced his contribution by a quotation from President Kennedy's book.  May I take the opportunity of quoting from that wonderful man, P.H. Pearse: &ldquo;If one man redeemed the world, one man can free a people&rdquo;?  It seems to me that Deputy Sherwin now believes that he can free or save a Government.  I listened to the Minister for Justice this afternoon stating that if he had been a candidate in the Dublin North-East by-election, there would not have been the same result.  I do not know whether that is correct or not, but I was impressed by the result of that by-election. Indeed, I lost money on it because I considered that Dublin North-East was the best organised Fianna <Col N="643" /> Fáil section in the city and realising the organising abilities of the Minister for Justice, I thought it would be almost impossible that they would not get the seat.</P>
    <P>It has been stated, and I believe, that this 2½ per cent tax was responsible for the result in Dublin North-East.  I wonder if the Minister for Justice or the other Ministers are so divorced from the ordinary people that they cannot understand that the man with six or seven children is not going to gain anything.Apart from his expenditure on the ordinary necessaries of life, he will find that this week Johnny has to get a pair of boots and next week Mary has to get a dress for her First Communion or for her Confirmation and the increase in social benefits will mean nothing.  I am very close to the people and after the wage earner has settled his PAYE tax and then this additional tax, any increase which he is now getting will be absorbed.  It should not be taken that I am against a purchase tax.  I know that a purchase tax works very successfully in other countries.  If the Minister could not make up the leeway by eliminating food and household commodities, then I must say I am losing confidence in our Minister for Finance.  I do not think the last speaker, the Minister for Health, when he was Minister for Finance would have had much trouble.</P>
    <P>I am very perturbed about the fact that Deputies apparently are using the privileges of this House to refer to people outside and apparently there is no protection if a Deputy, through the Chair, charges that bribes have been offered to him. Surely if that is true, something should be done about it.  We still have not repealed our bribery and corruption legislation and I hope that before this debate concludes, in the same way as the Taoiseach contradicted a statement made by the same Deputy on a previous occasion that he had been invited to join each of the Parties, and as the Leaders of Fine Gael and Labour <Col N="644" /> also contradicted him, his suggestion during this debate will also be contradicted and disowned.</P>

      <P>I have finished with that quotation.  Again on 10th July last, speaking on the purchase tax, and as reported at column 635 of the official Report, I said:</P>
      <P>You will get it now.  This has been referred to as a purchase tax. Deputy Sweetman went into the matter very carefully this morning and said it was an additional tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite contrary to the practice of the House. The Deputy is reading his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  I still believe I am capable of doing it.  However, again on 16th July last, I reiterated that I was not opposed to taxation or purchase tax, provided it was not a tax on food.  I pointed out that if it were a tax on food, I would oppose it, irrespective of the consequences.  Those are my words.  I reiterated that sentence even tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened very carefully to the Taoiseach today when he said that people would be compensated for any loss arising from this 2½ per cent turnover tax on food by increases in social services. <Col N="645" />I should like him to be more specific in that statement because I said in July that irrespective of the consequences, I felt that any increase on food was unjustifiable and would be a hardship on the people.</P>
    <P>I believe the demonstrations in Dublin were not against Government policy but were against the turnover tax and that the demonstrations were the only way in which the people concerned could indicate their views.  One might reflect that the Commission on Income Taxation were of the opinion that food and the necessaries of life should be exempt.  In the past 48 hours, we have been very generous in making exemptions and in catering for sections of the community, mainly the farming community.</P>
    <P>I am considering the people.  We are their messengers to the Dáil and we bear their message.  The sentiment of the people in my constituency is 100 per cent against an increase in the price of foodstuffs.  I repeat, as I said in June, that I am losing confidence in our Minister for Finance, or in the Cabinet itself, if they cannot get the money they require without taking it from foodstuffs.  Some years ago, I had the temerity to label myself as &ldquo;Honestly Independent.&rdquo;  I trust that whatever happens tonight, it will be just another indication that I am honestly independent.</P>
    <P>I must say that I could not agree that the people have lost confidence in the Government so far as policy is concerned but only in regard to this 2½ per cent turnover tax on food.  If any action of mine tonight should help to terminate the life of this Government, I know that many people will express their dissatisfaction.  I said in July I was tired listening to references to 1956-1957 and I felt that Deputies had forgotten 1847.  In 1847, we had not &ldquo;died a winter.&rdquo;  I believe that is an old western expression.  We did not die either in 1957, but we were gasping.  The building trade was gone, and I should not like to see that happen again.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have supported the Government's economic programme and have never voted against <Col N="646" /> the provision of money for running the country.  Tonight, I have had many telephone calls.  I understand that the Press, who rarely quote me except perhaps in three little lines, feel that Deputy Carroll is going to abstain. That is one thing I have never done. Reference has been made to the first Government in this House.  I was against the majority 41 years ago&mdash; the elected Government of this country. I was wrong then and presumably I will be wrong if I am with the minority tonight.  However, I am disturbed as to whether I am doing the right thing.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the speech of the Taoiseach today.  Irrespective of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, nobody wants to see a position in which we have unstable Government here.  The Leader of the Opposition stressed the need for a stable Government.  I do not think a Government with the support of two Independents can be considered a stable Government.  Within the past six months, I have gone into one division lobby and then another on the same day to try to show my independence.It has been stated in this House that I am Fianna Fáil in disguise.I do not think my actions since I came into this House substantiate that.</P>
    <P>I hope that for once Deputies will try to approach this matter as representatives of the people and not as Party members.  It is not to be suggested that anything I do tonight is done because I am afraid of an election or want an election.  It would be a sad day for this country if a programme that has had the support of the majority of the House up to now should be upset because the Taoiseach will not listen to the voice of the people protesting that they do not want a tax on foodstuffs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish said that the Taoiseach did not use his powers.  I think the Taoiseach did use his powers at a time when he was in a position to create an impression in the country and outside it of complete prosperity.  He did that by his control of the means of communication&mdash;newspapers, the radio, television and so on.  It seems to me that during the period prior to the Common <Col N="647" /> Market negotiations, when he created this impression that we were a prosperous society, he made it very difficult for anybody to believe in such a booming society and find itself faced with its present predicament of looking for money from the basic necessaries of everyday life.  In fact, he himself was the most important victim of his own propaganda.</P>
      <P>We are opposed to this sales tax and we intend to vote against it.  We are concerned in particular with the most important trend this tax demonstrates.It was referred to by Deputy Corish in his opening speech in which he said they disagreed with the trend away from the raising of funds by direct taxation towards the raising of funds by indirect taxation.  We believe that social justice demands that ability to pay should be the primary consideration in the raising of taxation.That is an attitude or point of view which can be held.  The opposite can be held and is held at present by the Taoiseach and his Party.  It is the strictly doctrinaire, conservative point of view.</P>
      <P>It is good to believe&mdash;to hope, at any rate&mdash;that the main Opposition Party intend to lead their policies away from the practice followed by Fianna Fáil in recent years.  It is worth remembering that this is a relatively new development.  At one time the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were penalised for their decision to impose penal taxation on people not able to bear it.  I do not want to reopen these things now but they suffered at that time and probably have learned from it to some extent.  At the same time, between 1932 and 1939, the Fianna Fáil Government at that time did take the view that the welfare of the people was of primary consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think anybody who looks at the record will see that in slum clearance, house building and so on.  Most of the rudimentary social advances we have made were made at that time and during that period.  They were not spectacular advances.  Similarly, advances were made in education.  But, for some reason best known to the Taoiseach, that has changed since the <Col N="648" /> period during which they won the loyalty of the Irish people on repeated occasions for the consideration which the people believed the Fianna Fáil Party showed to them at that time, and they were time and time again returned to office.</P>
    <P>It is only now that the Taoiseach has altered that fundamental policy to the trend, which has speeded up at a remarkable rate, of finding the money needed to run the country not from the wealthy minority, not from the people best able to pay but from the people least able to pay, the wage-earners and salary-earners.  There is no doubt at all that this charge can be proved to the hilt in recent years in regard to the Government's behaviour.  That is what has caused this great resentment on the part of the public.  That is not a creation or a figment of the imagination of Opposition Deputies. The fact is that they are taking this decision to put the Government out&mdash; nobody wants to put Governments out &mdash;and it is not an irresponsible act on their part but a decision to act because the people want that decision taken. That is quite clear.</P>
    <P>This two-and-a-half per cent tax is merely like the bombs at Sarajevo. It is merely an incident in a long campaign.  The public are tired of Fianna Fáil Government; they have had enough of it.  They have seen through Fianna Fáil and they want to be rid of Fianna Fáil Government. The best proof of that is to have a general election and then we shall find out for certain.  The reason is I believe because they have departed from their old ideals of concern for the majority and they have decided that they will protect the welfare of the minority.</P>
    <P>This is the basic conflict in every society and in some cases where there are dictatorships nothing very much can be done but, fortunately, I believe here in Ireland we are going to be able to do something about it.  The strange thing is that a shrewd, able politician like the Taoiseach should have believed that he could continue to get away with this continued exploitation of the majority in order to be able to do whatever he wanted to do for his wealthy friends in the minority.  In <Col N="649" /> recent months he has created on a number of occasions an atmosphere of great crisis.  First, we had the euphoria of the Common Market when he was creating the idea that we were in a position to go into the Common Market and compete against the Germans, the French, the Belgians and the Danes and all the others, and that basically all industries here were sufficiently sound to be able to do this.</P>
    <P>When he first said that we contradicted his statement.  We said that between 50 and 60 per cent of our industries were incapable of standing on their own feet and at that stage the Taoiseach accused us of all sorts of anti-national policies but the CIO reports have shown who was right and that, basically, private industry in Ireland is grossly unsound and grossly inefficient and, in fact, is going to be the direct influence in putting the Taoiseach's Government out tonight because it is the state of industry, whether it is capitalist or socialistorganised industry, that determines the level of prosperity of a particular society.  It is because private enterprise capitalism is not able to create the wealth needed to give these benefits that all Parties want in a society such as ours, better education, health services and social services; it is because it cannot find and has not found the money to do that.  Then the Taoiseach has no alternative&mdash;or any other Taoiseach in those circumstances, any Taoiseach who believes in this type of organisation of industry&mdash;but to continue trying to squeeze dry an already overburdened tax population.</P>
    <P>The very thing in which he believes, private enterprise capitalism, is going to be the cause of his downfall.  All through the years he has preached this gospel, this doctrine that it would be possible to make it operate so that it could create wealth and in order to do this he has treated them like the privileged child in the family.  He has given them every sort of benefit and incentive, every sort of assistance and help that could be conceived and, of course, one of the things that disturbs me most is that this Taoiseach is probably the one man, is the only man if it were possible to do it, who could operate private enterprise profitably <Col N="650" /> in Ireland.  If it could be done the Taoiseach is the only man who could have done it.  I do not believe it is possible and at the same time have the type of society which we want here.  I believe he tried to do it.  I I believe he has failed to do it.  I believe there is nobody in the Opposition who can make it operate here either and I hope they will have the sense to see where this has led this man who devotedly believed in this whole conception in the organisation of an economy.</P>
    <P>I am not going to dwell on the CIO reports.  Anybody who has read them knows that there is only one CIO report which has come out and which indicates that we have some sort of viable industry in woollen manufacture and so on.  Outside of that, every single one of them, even the most recent one on the iron and steel industry, has condemned the whole conception as grossly inefficient and in order to perpetuate that or try to establish that system and that society we have penalised our people over the past 40 years since the foundation of the State because the money could not be found by Ministers on both sides for health services, for education, for better old age pensions.  Both sides can be indicted on these charges with justification and it has always been due to the fact that there has been this insistence that private enterprise capitalism could raise the money but it has never done so.  That is not exceptional to Ireland.  There are very many much wealthier countries than Ireland where it has been tried and has also failed, the most important being the United States of America where five to ten per cent of the people are permanently unemployed and where there are 30 million or 40 million on the verge of poverty all the time.</P>
    <P>He has this hysterical position and <i>pari passu</i> with it his suggestion that we are a glowingly prosperous, booming society ready to take on the giants of the Common Market and he then comes along and tells certain groups of workers, such as ESB workers, that they could not get certain increases because it would bankcrupt the country. He more or less implies that.  He <Col N="651" /> threatened jail all round for anybody who controverted that idea.</P>
    <P>Then he turned to the unfortunate salary and wage earners faced with cost of living rises, the unfortunate housewives faced with trying to feed their children with rising prices and he appealed to the trade union movement and to the workers not to ask for wage or salary increases and the result was that the unfortunate workers took a voluntary cut in their cost of living.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the trade union movement agreed to that but it was probably that they had the national interest at heart.  I believe it should be the first responsibility of the Government to provide a reasonable standard of living for the public generally and they should not ask salary or wage earners to make these sacrifices.  They should not have asked the trade union movement to ask the workers to do it either.  This is to me the primary sign of failure.  They made these demands on workers at a time when they were giving widespread and costly concessions to their wealthy friends in the minority, at a time when company profits rose by 56 per cent, salaries and wages rose by only 20 per cent.  There were widespread remissions of taxes for companies and company directors.  There were remissions of taxes on exports.  There were accelerated depreciation allowances, and we have the position now where shareholders are tax free on their profits. At the same time, we have the worker asked to restrict his demand for wages.</P>
    <P>We have, too, the position referred to by Deputy Corish.  Surtax payers were actually given concessions.  There are only 10,000 of them in this country.  Will someone tell me who was lobbying for these?  Who is concerned for the surtax payer?  Who is worried about the surtax payer?  What kind of hardship does the surtax payer suffer?  Does he find it difficult to buy bread, butter, tea and sugar for his children?  Does he find it difficult to buy boots for his children?  Does he find it difficult to buy clothes for them?  Why should surtax payers get any consideration in a society such as ours in which we tell the old age pensioner <Col N="652" /> we can pay only 37/6 or £2 a week, in which we cannot afford to give our youngsters a proper education, in which we cannot provide health services for our sick?</P>
    <P>Is it not symptomatic of the insanity of the Taoiseach and his Government in recent years that they should have gratuitously told these people, whose pockets are already overflowing with money: &ldquo;Right, we will press down and give you more still, lest you feel hard up or lest you suffer any hardship.&rdquo;What was the reason for that? Ten thousand people were given a total of £600,000 in tax concession. Why?  Who paid this £600,000?  Had not every penny of that money to be found?  We have been told many times today that money has to be found. Yes, that £600,000 had to be found. Who paid it?  The unfortunate man who was told not to ask for a wage increase or a salary increase, the unfortunate man who was told to accept a voluntary cut in his standard of living.</P>
    <P>What does that voluntary cut mean?  It means that the children get bread and margarine or bread and scrape instead of eggs, and meat, and a well-balanced diet, so that the surtax payers can buy yachts, or motor cars, or go on continental tours, or what-have-you.That is the kind of madness and folly for which the Taoiseach and his Party will pay tonight.  They will go out because of it.</P>
    <P>In addition, the wage and salary earner had to meet an increase in tax-action while the burden of tax on the higher income groups was reduced. The company director, the shareholder, the profit earner and the person in receipt of unearned income got cash bonuses from the Government for doing damn all, for running industry in a grossly inefficient way, as has been proved by Government inquiries into their activities, not by any inquiries of mine.  These Government-sponsored inquiries showed these companies to be grossly inefficient.  Instead of penalising them for their inefficiency, they were actually rewarded for it.  They got further tax concessions in each of the recent two Budgets.</P>
    <P>The astonishing thing to me is that the people have tolerated this discrimination <Col N="653" /> against them for so long.  This discrimination has been practised by both sides over the past 40 years and the mass of the people, or their children, have never been able to get any kind of higher education because they could not pay for it, never been able to avail of a proper health service because they could not pay for it, could not afford to put by for their old age and are compelled to live in poverty, and all the hokum then by both sides of this House, and their powerful supporters outside, that poverty and misery and deprivation are noble and honourable and fine: we believe in the independence of the individual; we believe he should be able to pay his way; we believe in the sturdy rights of the father to look after his children.</P>
    <P>What do you do about it?  You pay him £9 a week and you expect him to have eight, nine, ten or 11 children and educate them.  You expect him to send them to university on £9 a week.  You expect him to send them to secondary school on £9 a week.  You expect him to pay his doctor's bills.  You expect him to keep proper food in their bellies on £9 a week.  You expect him to look after his old people on £9 a week.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of sententious, sanctimonious humbug to which I have listened since I came into this House, and before it.  You fool them and mislead them with all kinds of rubbish and then you do not give the unfortunate people the money to do the things you tell them should be done and which you know it is impossible for them to do on £9 a week.  That is the average wage; and you tell them to cut that average wage by taking a voluntary wage freeze.  You tell them you will send them to jail if they try to improve that average wage. Remember the Taoiseach's Bill that lasted some 12 or 24 hours in this House.</P>
    <P>We have the position now in which these unfortunate people are told that we do not subscribe to the welfare society; it is demoralising.  At the same time, we go on paying our people this paltry sum, paltry in the context of present living costs.  Fortunately, <Col N="654" /> the people are at last beginning to catch on to the monumental fraud that has been perpetrated on them over the past 40 years.  They are beginning to look around them and wonder why it is our people whom we send to Britain can get by in a welfare State without becoming demoralised, without having their independence demoralised.  They see their young nieces and nephews going to secondary school and university.They know the standard of health services; they know the care taken of people in their old age.  They are at last beginning to wake up.</P>
    <P>We have industry here, grossly inefficient industry in that it cannot compete on the export markets, cannot compete because of its inefficiency and its high cost of production.  That high cost of production runs side by side with the lowest labour costs in Europe: real earnings, Ireland, base 100; Netherlands, 104; France, 125; United Kingdom, 154; Norway, 167; Germany, 187; Denmark, 200; Sweden, 235.  We have no export market. Instead of being the Japan of the West, with our cheap labour market, we still cannot create competitive exports in industry.  I do not understand why it is the worker has stood it for so long. I do not understand why it is the salary and wage earner has stood that position for so long, the position in which he gets £9 a week, in which he is grossly underpaid <i>vis-à-vis</i> the continental worker, in which he is moderately underpaid <i>vis-à-vis</i> his colleague in Britain, and in which all these men in all these other countries, in addition to having better wages than the Irish workers, have also better social services, whether they be old age pensions or unemployment benefits, though there is virtually no unemployment in most of them.</P>
    <P>The position is that the average wages here have dropped from 73 per cent of the British average in 1948 to 64 per cent of the British average in 1960.  The position of the worker here has worsened not only in relation to the wages of his British comrade but also in relation to the social welfare aspect.  In Britain, the worker is not asked to spend his £10, £12 or £15 a week in educating his children or in providing health services for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> The same applies in relation to our educational services.  There is this scandalous apartheid which exists here whereby if you are the child of a worker or of a white collar parent in moderate employment, you simply cannot get into the universities or to the secondary schools.  For that reason, we practise the art of intellectual castration of our youngsters at the age of 14. These are the reasons why the Government tonight are going out.  These are the reasons why the people are justified in putting them out.</P>
    <P>While all this ballyhoo has been going on about the expanding economy, the unfortunate people have been crucified.  The unfortunate housewife going out with her £2 or £3 finds she cannot buy the amount of tea, bread, butter, clothes for her family that she would wish to buy.  I do not know how the members of the Government and those behind them seem to be so ignorant of this reality, appear to be so ignorant of the desperation of the housewife at the present time faced with the problem of trying to feed her family in the teeth of continuing mounting prices.</P>
    <P>The cost of our social services here, again cannot compare at all with that of Great Britain.  In comparison with the wages paid here, we cannot compare at all with several other countries and in addition, we find that here the Government do not believe in any kind of price control.  Prices here, accordingly, are in the order of eight per cent higher than in Britain and, because distributive costs are lower here, prices here in fact work out at ten per cent higher than in Britain. Are you proud of that type of society where the average man has to try to live and bring up a family?  Surely, with the imposition of this turnover tax on essential commodities, that ten per cent will become 15 per cent or 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>It will become impossible for the average parent to go on living in this country; it will lead to a massive increase in the rate of emigration. People will have to go; people will be starved out of this country because they cannot afford to live here as a result of this discriminatory type of <Col N="656" /> society which is being built up by the Government.  We have afforded to industrialists in this country tariff protections to try to put them on their feet, to try to build them up, and the answer the unfortunate consumer gets is to be made a captive consumer, because that is what we are in this country.  These unlimited protections given to industrialists were paid for in tax concessions ultimately produced out of worker's pay packets.</P>
    <P>The Government's policies have failed in practically every aspect you could wish to investigate. The most recent disclosure is that they are now completely to abandon the whole of the west of Ireland under this year's industrial legislation.  We are now given to understand that the programme to establish industries in the west has been abandoned, and this epitomises and illustrates the hopelessness of a Government in trying to develop an economy in the interests of the masses of the people.  We were to try to keep the Gaeltacht areas populated, to try to keep the people in rural Ireland. We all accept that point of view but it has now been shown clearly and without any equivocation that private enterprise in future is not going into the west of Ireland, that industries will be started only where they will make the most money.</P>
    <P>That is the way private enterprise capital acts here, so why continue this humbug protest that you will make industry do what you want it to do when it will do exactly as it wishes? The purpose of private enterprise capital here is not to provide the people with the money to give better social services, to provide better educational facilities for our children, to improve social conditions generally. Its purpose is to help a few people to get extremely wealthy by the exploitation of the workers, and it has succeeded very well indeed.</P>
    <P>The grants given by An Foras Tionscal are 80 per cent higher in the past year, but the £800,000 which was said to be available for the promotion of industries in the west of Ireland has been withdrawn.  The undeveloped areas of the west are now to be given <Col N="657" /> only £450,000 while the rest of the country is to get £2,119,000.  So much for the Government's policy in regard to rural depopulation, in regard to the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>We have seen that our social insurance contributions have been going up at a time when the wealthier people in the community have been getting still more wealthy.  We have seen no significant improvement in employment.  Deputy Cosgrave gave figures to show that over the past ten years, there has been a drop in the total number of people in employment. We know that we have squandered the brains, the intellects of the young people by refusing to give them education.</P>
    <P>We have been asked to make alternative suggestions to this turnover tax.  The basic point was put by Deputy Corish at the beginning.  It is a question of finding the money &mdash; of finding the money from whom.  The Government have decided it is primarily from the salary and wage earners.  There was a figure in 1959 which put the total tax income at £82 million when gross taxable incomes amounted to £525 million.  I am sure that relatively the figures are much the same at present. There is no doubt in my mind that it would be possible to find the money the Government want from a source other that that which they suggest, which is bread, butter, tea, sugar, consumer goods of all kinds, certainly the non-luxury goods.  It is clear there is enough fat in the total moneys available to the Government to find the money without imposing this brutal, unfair and unjust form of taxation.</P>
    <P>We believe that it should be possible to find the money which the Taoiseach requires from the total of wealth that is available.  The specific proposals I would make are that an annual wealth tax should be paid on incomes.  This tax is in practice in many other countries in Europe and is one which should be perfectly easy and simple to operate in this country.  There should be a capital gains tax and the Government should not be afraid to take back the £600,000 which it gave to the surtax earner when it reduced the level <Col N="658" /> of taxation and increased the rate at which surtax should be paid.  Company profits should be taxed and an attempt should be made to see that a greater percentage of profits is put back into industry rather than distributed.</P>
    <P>One of the cases made here when there are suggestions that there should be some control of wealth of this kind, when there are suggestions for increased taxation in relation to company profits and surtax, a tax on industry, if you like, is that such a tax would be a disincentive to industry.  As far as I can see, nothing could make Irish industry less efficient than it is. There is a clear example of other countries in which higher rates are imposed in regard to surtax, company profits and so on, that they are much more efficient in these countries than we are here, in spite of the fact that they have what this Government would call a high burden of taxation. If these people do not like it, let them lump it.  There is damn all that they can do about it except to pay the taxes. If they decide to go out of business rather than pay this taxation, then we should replace them with State companies, a proposal which is the only real solution to our economic problems.</P>
    <P>One of the things that always amazes me is the suggestion that increased taxation on wealthy people would be a disincentive to industry.  Why should it be a disincentive?  When you ask people to allow the freezing of their wages, or to pay another 2½ per cent in taxation and thus reduce their standard of living, it is not believed to be a disincentive to them to work.  Why should there be this discrimination between the two sections of the community? Why should it not be a disincentive to work to the wage earner if his salary is cut or if he is asked to accept a voluntary wage freeze?  There seems to me to be a complete lack of logic in the whole approach of the Government in this matter.</P>
    <P>When we suggest that there should be price control, we are told that it would not be desirable to operate it in our circumstances.  Within recent months, we have been told by the Taoiseach that a state of emergency exists, that the country is in a bad <Col N="659" /> way and that it could not afford any further salary and wage increases. That was a serious decision to put to the country.  In that emergency situation in which the public were asked to make sacrifices, surely the manufacturers should also be asked to make sacrifices.  That happened before during war time.  If the Government do not have a complete and insolent contempt for the intelligence of the people, they should show that the wealthy person is also making a sacrifice, the wealthy person who has been treated with kid gloves by the Government over the years.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the operation of industry in Ireland in private hands is going to create the wealth which will allow Ireland to give to its people the standard of living, the condition of health services, the conditions of education and the care of old people which we are told by both sides of the House it is their intention to give.  I do not think that can be done by private enterprise.I believe the only solution is public ownership all along the line, in which labour and capital would be mobilised for the creation of the optimum amount of wealth of which the country is capable.  Until our society accepts that point of view, and it is the point of view of eight-ninths of the world at the present time, then this type of crisis will continue to rise and little change will take place in the lives of the people.</P>

      <P>I do not think the lengthy diatribe from Deputy Dr. Browne to which we have just listened is very helpful to us in making a true assessment of the Labour Party motion and the Taoiseach's amendment.  In brief, we regard as irresponsible, destructive and downright dishonest the attitude of mind which we see displayed here by Fine Gael in seeking to postpone or negative the provisions for a turnover tax contained in the Finance Act which this Dáil passed into legislation some months ago.  At this stage, the Government have embarked on a <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> the second Programme, <Col N="660" /> which is designed to ensure a 50 per cent rise in national income by 1970, which is designed to ensure the creation of more than 100,000 new jobs in the decade between 1960 and 1970.</P>

      <P>The Blue Book states that the proposed increase in industrial employment would necessitate the creation of 100,000 new jobs.  We are well on the way to the attainment of that target.  What we say is that an attitude of mind in the House which seeks to negative the taxation proposals designed to ensure the acceleration of our economic progress over the next seven years is irresponsible, destructive and downright dishonest.</P>
      <P>It is apparent that any reasonable examination of our public services and their proposed extension demands a tax structure which will yield the revenue designed to ensure the maintenance of these public services at their present level and their expansion and extension in many fields.  I shall mention briefly the fields specified in the Taoiseach's amendment to the motion which will require extended support from the State which can come only through increased taxation. In the field of education, mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Dr. Browne, the full revenue from the proposed turnover tax could be spent to very good effect.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education has announced detailed proposals providing for further extension of technical and technological education.  I wish, with Deputy Cosgrave and, I am sure, Deputy Dr. Browne, that we should have a very wide extension of our present scholarship system so as to ensure that scholarships are available to a greater extent to pupils to enable them to get maximum education and fit them for the challenging years which lie ahead in this country.  In that field alone there is ample scope for full utilisation of whatever revenue funds may be garnered from the turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> In the field of health, at the moment, an Oireachtas Committee is sitting and investigating in detail various practical proposals for the improvement of our health services.  I happen to sit on that Committee.  The proposals which have been getting a majority support heretofore are proposals which will cost more finance if we are to ensure that our people have the modern up-to-date health services which so many people in this House desire, and rightly desire.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to social welfare where in future years we will continue to follow the policy which we followed in the past few years of progressively increasing the various social welfare benefits year in, year out, so that we can have a comprehensive range of social welfare benefits as a proper basis to look after the needier sections of the community.</P>
    <P>In agricultural development, there was announced in the past few days by the Minister for Agriculture a very practicable proposal designed to ensure that the target set in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in regard to raising cattle output will be reached and, despite some of the jesting remarks by Deputy Dillon, in which he decried the possibility of this target of 1½ million being reached by 1970, we say the £15 grant for the in-calf heifer over and above the present grant, will ensure that that target will be reached.</P>
    <P>Similar remarks apply to the improvement grants in the current Estimates for lime and fertilisers designed to improve the productive capacity of the land so as to provide better grass and ensure greater stocking.</P>
    <P>Increased expenditure will undoubtedly arise when the new Land Bill becomes law, under which the Land Commission are being given increased powers to go into the open market to buy land with cash for the relief of congestion, transfer young farmers out of the congested areas and grant them loans to buy farms in the eastern areas.  There are provisions whereby the Land Commission will go into the business of purchasing land from elderly and incapacitated people and compensate them on an annuity basis.  All of these provisions will <Col N="662" /> mean increased funds for the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There is a similar situation in regard to industrial development as a result of the efforts by way of grant and loan designed to ensure greater efficiency from the industrial arm so as to provide for the growing level of industrial exports which we have been succeeding in getting in recent years.</P>
    <P>All of these matters I have mentioned are specifically set out in the Taoiseach's amendment.  They are all matters which require increased revenue finance, matters which, apart from the capital investment required, will require increased revenue finance. These funds can only be obtained by devising a broadly based tax structure which in the years ahead can yield the necessary revenue to a Government to provide for the desirable improvements in these directions.  It is patently dishonest to suggest that development along the lines I have mentioned can succeed without an adequate tax structure to provide the revenue through which it can succeed.  Indeed, the Labour Party, I know, is with us in their desire for the proposals which I have just mentioned.  The Fine Gael Party have never believed in that sort of approach.  The Fine Gael Party have always been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As one would expect, the Taoiseach put on his political armour this evening and delivered to the House one of those typical brash speeches which we have come to expect from him on occasions like this.  The Taoiseach thinks that fiery phrases, a low appraisal of his opponents' ability and wild assertions completely unsupported by facts establish what he says as absolutely infallible.</P>
      <P>As everybody will guess, the whole House was wrong, except the Taoiseach.He was the combination of wiseacre and the crystal-gazer and only he could see the future.  He cast himself here this evening in the role of an infallible pathfinder.  If he was trusted, it was only a matter of days until this country would reach at least the fringe of the promised land.  Some of us have been hearing these speeches here for the past 30 years and the promised land seems now further away.  We have not even been keeping up with it on the promises made by the Taoiseach in the past.</P>
      <P>In a very robust performance this evening, the Taoiseach put up one Aunt Sally after another and knocked them down to his heart's content.  With a sword of light of his own special brand, he smashed all the windmills within sight.  All the ogres were banished and the Taoiseach sat down then full of hope.  What kind of hope filled his breast, I do not know, but I am quite sure there was one hope there, that is, that he will not have to go before the people at an early general election.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach can have one tonight.  The Taoiseach, in his motion, described people as pursuing an irresponsible course because they opposed and continue to oppose the turnover tax.  If you continue to oppose the turnover tax, you are irresponsible.  Does that mean that the 6,500 people who deserted Fianna Fáil in the recent by-election in North-East Dublin and who voted for them at the previous general election are also irresponsible because they would not vote for a turnover tax about which they were never previously consulted? The 6,500 people, then, presumably responsible people, who voted for Fianna Fáil at the last general election, decided that they were not going to be harnessed any longer to this insane chariot which compelled them to vote for a heavy turnover tax on their slender incomes.</P>
      <P>However, notwithstanding the sprats thrown from the opposite benches, I want to get back to the main issue raised in this debate.  The simple and single issue raised by the Labour Party motion is the turnover tax.  It is on that issue and that issue alone that we want this House to decide what its policy will be in respect of this Government.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach tried to confuse the issue by talking on a variety of other matters and his colleague, Deputy Lenihan, the Parliamentary Secretary, followed in similar vein with his newfound skill as a fisherman, which I understand the Taoiseach has assimilated with great speed.  He has set many lines in the hope apparently of catching simple and stray fish in the Independent group and in the hope of landing them before the vote is taken.</P>

      <P>The one issue towering over all others in this debate is the question of the turnover tax.  Approval as one can easily accord to isolated facets or segments of Government policy matters nothing compared with the main issue.  That main issue is: Are food and all the other necessaries of life of the people to be taxed?  That is what this House has to decide tonight.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary on an occasion such as this, with the limited time at our disposal, to go over the ground that has been covered since the Finance Bill was passed and I do not propose to do it.  However, it is not out of place to ask what was the origin of this turnover tax.  From where did we get the proposal?  Who endorsed it that it came before Parliament?  When was it endorsed and what was the authority of the people who first sold this idea to the Government and then persuaded them to underwrite it with their signatures so that it might be inflicted on the people without the people once being consulted about the matter?</P>
      <P>There was an election two years ago, not a very long time ago.  During the election campaign, there was never a mention or a murmur about this turnover tax.  No hint whatever was given that it might be the subject of a realistic discussion when the election was over.  It was never mentioned to the people at the election.  It was carefully concealed from them during the entire period of the election.  In other words, the Fianna Fáil policy on the turnover tax <i>vis-à-vis</i> the people was to keep the people in the dark, which is a rather strange interpretation by Fianna Fáil of government with the consent and approval of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The silence on the turnover tax was sufficient to enable the Government to get back to office, if not with a clear majority, at least with enough to occupy the offices in Merrion Street and to occupy the Government benches here.  Therefore, after getting a vote or nearly getting a vote of confidence from the people&mdash;because they failed to get it at the last election&mdash;they took up the position as the Government but they have done so by concealing from <Col N="666" /> the people who voted for them what they intended to do if they were fortified with sufficient votes and seats to resume the reins of office.</P>
    <P>If North-East Dublin, 18 months after the election, rejected the Government candidate in a by-election with all the support that the Government could give that candidate, together with the gentle and eloquent voice of the Tánaiste there on the Government side, in how many constituencies up and down the country would that performance have been repeated if the people knew in time that the Government had this turnover tax in store for them?  However, they got what suited them for the purpose of forming a Government and now that they are in office&mdash; how long is another matter&mdash;the Taoiseach proposes to tax every article of food and every scrap of clothing worn by the people, and in addition, to tax every other necessity of life.  It is all being done without it having been once mentioned to the people that this rod was in pickle for them.</P>
    <P>An effort will be made to say, of course, that this is necessary in order to improve the social welfare benefits. Anybody who says that knows that he is not speaking the truth, and that statement would not stand two minutes examination by a fourth-class schoolboy.  What are the facts?  In four months of this year, the Government will raise about £4 million, about £3½ million of it from the turnover tax.  The cost of the social welfare benefits in the four or five months left of this financial year will not amount to £1,750,000. Next year's social welfare services are estimated to cost about £4 million but next year the turnover tax is estimated to yield at least £12 million so that there is easily a gap of £8 million between what will be spent by the Government on the social services next year and the £12 million which will be syphoned off by this turnover tax which is being imposed on the people.  These millions are being extracted not as part of the ordinary tough operation of taking taxes from the people about which they know and on which issues they have been previously consulted <Col N="667" /> but by an arrangement under which Parliament gives the Government the authority to do it, the people not having been consulted beforehand.</P>
    <P>Let us say this&mdash;because it is clear the effluxion of time has done a good deal to show this issue to the people in all its nakedness&mdash;it is the ordinary person who buys at the shop counter, the ordinary consumer, who will pay this tax.  Nobody else will pay it.  The manufacturer will not pay it, nor will the importer or the distributor.  The people with slender resources will pay it, the people who are seperated from the workhouse only by their ability either of brain or brawn to earn a week's wages.  It is on the mass of these people that this burden will fall as if there were no other shoulders in the country capable of bearing it.</P>
    <P>We were told in the first instance, when the Finance Bill was due and when the country was being used as a guinea pig by the Government to see what sort of excuses for the turnover tax would work best and get the best reception, that this tax was a small tax and that the shopkeepers were such a generous and magnanimous fraternity that they probably would not bother to collect the tax at all, that they would pay the 2½ per cent tax out of their own tills and would not charge the consumer at all. But of course that humbug and fraud had a very short life because the manufacturers and shopkeepers proved themselves to be realistic.</P>
    <P>They said: &ldquo;We are not going to pay 2½ per cent tax on turnover; we are not going to give the Government £12 million out of our pockets each year&rdquo;.  When they complained to the Government, the Government switched over and said to the manufacturers and shopkeepers: &ldquo;All right, if that is the way, you can recoup yourselves from the consumers&rdquo;.  The Minister for Finance said, when I asked him a question about who was going to pay this tax, that he did not care who paid it, his concern was to get the money and he was going to get it.  That was clearly a declaration that the consumer was going to pay.  But when the device of saying that the shopkeepers and <Col N="668" /> the manufacturers would pay fell, the Government resorted to another device. They said: &ldquo;Well, maybe that is so; they will not pay, but there is another element in this which is very important&rdquo; and they brought out the deceitful old wizard called competitiveness. They said: &ldquo;Of course there will be such competition among traders, one with another, following the turnover tax that in fact you will not feel the 2½ per cent.  Prices will come down and you will be able to get the commodities, 2½ per cent notwithstanding, at less than you paid before the tax was imposed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That also had a very ephemeral life, for the simple reason that the traders, the manufacturers and the importers came together and long before the tax was due to operate, issued instructions to their customers that &ldquo;these will be the new prices in future.&rdquo;  In many cases that was said without any regard to the fact that the turnover tax was to be imposed and in a number of instances &mdash; as the Department of Industry and Commerce could find out, if it was energetic enough to do so &mdash;many of these traders have said: &ldquo;Here are the prices for the future. At a later stage we will tell you what the prices are when the 2½ per cent tax comes into operation.&rdquo;  Many of these manufacturers have got pre-turnover tax increases in their prices, although they will be followed by another 2½ per cent increase at least from the 1st November when the turnover tax becomes operative.  So far as the consuming public is concerned, what was first said by the Government speakers to be a trivial tax of 2½ per cent which would probably be paid for them by manufacturers is now in many instances turning out to be a substantially larger percentage deduction or increase than was at first foreshadowed.</P>
    <P>Each one of these devices, with the tenacity of a medicine man attached to an Indian tribe, has been tried by the Government to confuse the people, to mislead the people and to give them the impression that everything would be all right.  Now the people standing on the threshold of the 1st November, 1963, see that they are to pay increases which in many instances will <Col N="669" /> vary from 2½ per cent up to 15 and 20 per cent.  But that is not all.  The manufacturers and the shopkeepers have killed the notion that they will pay.  This old wizard, competition, is dead.  The manufacturers and distributors have arranged that.  They have fixed the prices but a new menace has come on the horizon, one which was not there when the Finance Bill was introduced, that is, the menance caused by the pre-turnover tax increases which the Government have brought to a head because of the manner in which they themselves have shown that it does not matter if you interfere with prices.  Manufacturers and distributors say: &ldquo;If this is to be a free-for-all and the Government are to take 2½ per cent of the price of our commodities, then it will be a free-for-all for us as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What have they done?  They have said to the Government: &ldquo;Collect your 2½ per cent from the consumer but we are getting in beforehand to get a five per cent and ten per cent increase&rdquo;.  The result has been that because of the manufactuers' move, on the one hand, and the distributors and importers acting with them, and the Government's 2½ per cent, the consumer is going to pay a pretty nice bill.  The other day a daily newspaper quoted a spokesman of RGDATA as saying that price increases by members of the Association were bound to vary considerably and that it would be virtually impossible to give a list of increases in the trade.</P>

      <P>Then it goes on to indicate price increases and said that the standard price of butter would be 4/9d, sugar would be up and tea would be up.  Butter is to cost us 4/9d. in the future.  It must be a very melancholy reflection that, according to a reply to a Parliamentary Question on 23rd of this month, the people of Kuwait <Col N="670" /> are now eating Irish creamery butter at 2/1d. per lb. per lb., that the citizens of the Lebanon are mopping it up at 1/10d., that the Italians are eating it at 2/1d. per lb., having eaten over 10,000 cwts. last year at 1/9 a lb.  But we are to pay 4/9d. under this economic policy.  Irish butter at 4/9d. for the simple Irish but for the comrades of Kuwait 2/1d.</P>
      <P>I believe the Government have precipitated a crisis in the price levels by their shortsighted and ill-considered policy.  I cannot imagine this turnover tax as having been an attempt politically to deal with our problems here.  I believe this is the product of some mind that lives in a vacuum and comes out now and again just to see what sort of world there is outside the vacuum.  It is clearly short sighted policy from the stand-point of our people.</P>
      <P>I have never seen such widespread indignation as that manifested against the Government's proposal to impose this tax.  Prices are now all haywire. It is only a short time since, in the most solemn tones, the Taoiseach told us about the necessity for a pay pause. We had lectures on the need for stability of wages, on the need for stability of prices, on the need for care, for prudence in relation to prices, wages and profits, lest we might price ourselves out of the vital export markets on which our future so much depends.  Now all this solemnity has been blown skyhigh, when we see what has happened by the deliberate policy of the Government in increasing prices.  Prices do not matter now, the manufacturers and the shopkeepers think.  The Government think the same because they will get their hands on £12 million each year which will be taken off prices and which the consumer will have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is still agitated as to what he will do with the price control machinery.It is as clear as daylight that there will be no price control machinery, so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.So, what have we now?  We have the recent increases &mdash; still the current increases.  We have a turnover tax increase.  As a result of these two, we shall have dwindling wages so far <Col N="671" /> as the workers are concerned, with, from the workers, inevitably, a demand for compensation in the form of increased wages for the increased level of prices.</P>
    <P>Does anybody blame the workers for looking for more wages when goods cost more?  Does anybody blame people for getting compensation? Take the ordinary poor devil who has to work for wages each week and does not get much after a hard week's toil.  Does anybody blame him for making sure that, if the State and the manufacturer, the shopkeeper and the distributor will get the money, he should get sufficient to enable him to provide for his wife and children?  He will start now on a ninth round of wage increases.  When he is asked the reason why, on this occasion he will be able to give the Taoiseach as the explanation for the ninth round of wage increases&mdash; the incompetent, inept way in which the whole question of prices has been handled by this Government.  Clearly, the Government will be responsible for the ninth round of wage increases.  They will be responsible for the higher cost of production at home.  In respect of our exports, on which, as I said, we depend so vitally, the Government will be responsible for all the disadvantageous consequences which flow from the development of a high price policy at home.</P>
    <P>If the people had endorsed this proposal, the Government would have some justification.  However, with no endorsement from the people, with no endorsement from anybody in the House except his own Party and two Independents, the Government nevertheless go ahead to force through this issue.  The only time anybody was consulted about this tax when they could express their minds freely was in the Dublin North-East by-election when the Government lost heavily and 6,500 people who voted for Fianna Fáil in 1961 deserted them in 1963 when they heard about the turnover tax proposals.  Where, then, I ask the Taoiseach, is there authority to proceed with this tax?  There is none, in my view.  There is none in the view of <Col N="672" /> the Labour Party.  This motion is designed to make that crystal clear and to enable Deputies to vote accordingly.</P>
    <P>If you stand now and look back over the past ten years, a striking change of vista presents itself.  We had food subsidies up to 1951.  Having declared they did not intend to abolish the food subsidies, Fianna Fáil came along in 1952 and abolished £9 million worth of them.  There was still a balance there in 1957 but they came back to office again in 1957 and abolished another £9 million worth of food subsidies&mdash;which meant that, thanks to Fianna Fáil, the whole policy of food subsidies came to an end.  It was their responsibility that these subsidies ended. The wheel has now run more than its own circle.  From food subsidies, Fianna Fáil have so evolved themselves that they are now the one Party in this country who want to tax food and the only Party in the country who have ever taxed food.</P>
    <P>Somebody once said that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. If that is true, there must be many expansive minds in the Fianna Fáil Government.  As I said before, and I just want to touch slightly upon it again, it is not true that the turnover tax is necessary to finance social services.  This year, social services will cost £1,750,000.  The people will pay £4 million in turnover tax.  Next year, they will pay £20 million in turnover tax and the cost of the social services will only be £4 million.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us recently that he thought the time had arrived at which there should be a turning to the left.  One is now entitled to ask if this is part of the turning to the left training&mdash;this imposition of the turnover tax.  We are now taxing the food and clothing of the weakest and most helpless section of the community.  We shall have the same rate of tax on tea, bread, butter, sugar and clothes for the poor person living on an old age pension, on a non-contributory widow's pension, as for a banker or for a wheat or cattle reacher.  Standing at the counter and buying the same quantity of goods, the old age pensioner will feel a great thrill of equality in paying the same tax as the other two wealthy people.</P>
    <P>Do you think that is social justice <Col N="673" /> or fair play?  I thought taxation, among democratic people, rested on the principle that it should lie most on the backs of those most capable of bearing it.  In this case, it is being put on the backs of the weak and the helpless because they are numerous.  The backs of the wealthy and those well endowed with this world's goods have come relatively unscathed from the effects of this tax.</P>
    <P>Is it necessary, as any part of the Government's policy, that we should walk into this economic EI Dorado in which the Taoiseach talks about putting the same percentage tax on a bottle of champagne as on a bottle of milk?  Is it necessary to tax butter at the same rate as it is to tax fur coats and expensive motor cars?  Why, if we consider social justice for a moment, do we not allocate the tax to the backs most capable of bearing it? At all events, it gives us all a part of the turn to the left policy.</P>
    <P>The sooner somebody presents the Taoiseach with a compass, the better for the nation.  At all events, whenever the turnover tax has been discussed in the past by groups, and so on, it has been discussed in this context, that a turnover tax on a variety of commodities, not defined but easily capable of being picked out and grouped, would be a substitute for some other forms of taxes.  Some people were prepared to play with the idea of a sales tax which would yield a certain sum of money and enable the Government to remit other taxes which were then being opposed.  What happened?  We now have all the other taxes, and the turnover tax as well.  So, instead of swopping one for the other, we now have the two&mdash;the normal scale of taxes plus this specially vicious one introduced on this occasion.</P>
    <P>It is quite normal, when fixing the sale price of a commodity, to have regard to its commercial value&mdash;cost of raw material, labour, transport, overheads and so on.  That adds up and enables you to sell the finished article at a certain price.  That goes for everybody.  That was the principle of ordinary sale.  It was never the method in the past of applying tax that you imposed the tax heaviest on those who <Col N="674" /> could bear it least.  That is what this Government have now done or are trying to do.</P>
    <P>Our view on this whole matter&mdash;we want it to be perfectly clear and uncomplicated and not mixed up with other issues&mdash;is that as a Labour Party we are opposed to taxation on the poor and the weak.  It is not a question of being opposed to the raising of taxation.  We are prepared to vote for taxation, but we are not going to give a single vote to permit the weak and the helpless to be selected as the first target of taxation by the Government when they want money for the time being.</P>
    <P>Talk about social welfare benefits. These benefits are already too low.  We have lower rates of social welfare benefit than Britain and the Six Counties and lower still than in the democracies of Western Europe.  What we are doing for social welfare recipients is partially recognising a claim which ought to have been recognised even before now.  But the fact that public protests are continuing, and that they are widespread, is a clear indication that the ordinary people do not regard the turnover tax as something which should be used as a mere partial rectification of the treatment which our social welfare classes have got from the public purse in the past.</P>
    <P>Not only is there widespread public complaint on this matter, but even Fianna Fáil supporters, if one talks to them as I do, cannot explain what the Government have done.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators seem to have taken a vow of silence that they will not speak in public on this matter.  I take it that is not because this is a logical popular proposal.  I take it it is because nobody can defend this, not even the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>The vista which Fianna Fáil put before the people is that when a new babe is born its clothes are taxed.  During its infant life, its youth and adult manhood, and passing on to the <Col N="675" /> autumn of its life, so long as there is a Fianna Fáil Government, it will pay taxes during its whole life.  That was never the lot of a person born in Ireland until now, and that Party is responsible for it.  Somebody said the shroud will be taxed when they die. Fianna Fáil have now established for themselves&mdash;why I do not know&mdash;the unenviable record of being the only Party who believe in a tax on the necessaries of life, the foodstuffs and clothing of the weakest and most helpless section of the community.</P>
      <P>Now we have an opportunity of testing the situation.  An election may be a fearful and difficult exercise, but in present circumstances the only honest course for those who believe in democracy is to have a general election, so that the people can be consulted, can know what the issues are and be allowed to vote accordingly.  They voted in the dark in the last election. If you give them a chance of voting now with this turnover tax supported by the Fianna Fáil Party, the reins of office will be something which will not trouble you for a long time in the future.</P>
