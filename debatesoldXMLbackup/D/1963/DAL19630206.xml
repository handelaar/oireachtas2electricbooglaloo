      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by re-opening the question of Partition. The Government's interest in the re-unification of the national territory has been maintained irrespective of developments in external trade relations, and every opportunity of making progress towards its realisation will be availed of.</P>

      <P>The average number of persons on the Live Register at the middle of each month of 1962 was 46,569.  The percentage unemployed is calculated by relating the number of currently insured persons on the live register, excluding those in agriculture, fishing and private domestic service, to the estimated corresponding currently insured population. This figure for the year 1962 was 5.7 per cent.</P>

      <P>I have had enquiries made from Dublin Health Authority and I understand that the position regarding deductions from the pensions of old age pensioners who are in St. Kevin's Hospital for limited periods of time is not indicated in the first part of the question.  The usual arrangement is that no charge whatever is made in such cases.  Further, I am informed that where old age pensioners are in the hospital for protracted periods, it is the standard practice to allow the pensioner to retain, in addition to 10/- per week, a sum sufficient to meet his outlay on rent.</P>

The matter is still under examination in my Department in the light of the reply which the Labour Court has furnished to that communication.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that cases have arisen recently in which jewellery imported from <Col N="1076" /> abroad and hall-marked in this country was later found to be incorrectly hall-marked; and if he will give a full account of the procedure for hall-marking of native and imported jewellery in this country, the number of persons employed in this work, and their qualifications, conditions of employment, and remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;no &rdquo; but I would look into any case of incorrect hall-marking if sufficient particulars of the case are brought to my notice.  Hall-marking of precious metals is carried out by the Assay Office, an independent body established by charter over three hundred years ago.  The number and qualifications of persons employed in the Assay Office and their conditions of employment and remuneration are not determined by my Department, and I have, therefore, no detailed information on these matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No special grants were made available to county councils for snow clearance operations in 1947, but councils were informed that the expenditure involved could be regarded as ordinary road maintenance costs.  This meant that the expenditure was partially recoupable from the <Col N="1077" /> Road Fund in certain circumstances and in accordance with the scheme of grants then in operation.  In the present instance also snow clearance is regarded as a maintenance operation and, as explained to the Deputy in reply to a previous Question, half the cost is recoupable from grant in the case of main roads.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As explained to Roscommon County Council in reply to the request referred to, every road authority in the country would welcome an opportunity to press their claims for increased grants by way of special deputation, now that the 1963/64 scheme of Road Fund Grants is under consideration in the Department.  I could not single out particular county councils for special treatment in this matter and so I have made it my practice not to see deputations about the grants in such circumstances.  I am, however, always ready to consider any written representations made by the council, or by any road authority, in regard to the grants and the Roscommon County Council have been so informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that no <Col N="1078" /> other road authority in the past month has asked for a deputation to be heard by the Department ?  Would the Minister state why he refused to hear the case of the Roscommon County Council, having first received a written representation?  Would he say why he refused to receive a deputation which was in a position to put further points to him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out that the scheme of Road Fund grants is now under consideration in the Department and, naturally, every county council would like to get as big an allocation as possible and would welcome an opportunity to press their claim by way of special deputation.  If the Minister agreed to receive a deputation from one county council, he would be likely to find himself in the position of having to receive deputations from every other council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <P>Is it not a fact that Roscommon County Council appointed a special sub-committee to wait on the Minister and that that sub-committee had information which made it essential that the Minister should be seen?  Is it not also a fact that the council appointed the three Dáil Deputies for the county to put that information before the Minister?

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands the qualifications laid down by his Department for (a) farmers with valuation under £15, (b) cottiers, and (c) agricultural labourers, which are necessary for them to be eligible for the allotment of land by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The selection of allottees by the Land Commission is governed by Section 31, Land Act, 1923, which prescribes that the Land Commission, in deciding as to the suitability of applicants, shall be satisfied as to their competence to work land and their intention to do so and not to sell, let or assign it.  The Section also sets out the various classes of allottees to whom advances for the purchase of parcels of land may be made.  In the disposal of acquired lands, the following order of priority operates:&mdash; displaced employees, uneconomic holders, migrants, trustees for communal purposes, cottiers, other landless applicants.  Put more precisely, the relief of congestion is the primary objective of Land Commission policy.  For the economic and proper working of an enlargement, it is desirable that it should be within reasonable distance of the allottee's residence; such distance has been accepted as about one mile.</P>
      <P>Where land is available after the reasonable requirements of those who are solely or mainly dependent on agriculture have been met, provision is made, as far as circumstances permit, for cottiers and landless applicants. The congestion problem at present is such, however, that the claims of those already on the land in an uneconomic way must take precedence over other aspiring groups of applicants for land which becomes available to the Land Commission for division.</P>
      <P>Under current policy, holdings and enlargements are to be planned, in all areas, to provide family farms of 40 to 45 acres of good land or the equivalent in land of varied quality.  All applicants with holdings below that level are eligible for consideration for enlargements.  Where, however, the acreage available for distribution is insufficient to bring all the qualified and genuinely deserving smallholders, within the prescribed distance, up to the optimum level of 40 to 45 acres, then the land will be distributed in a fair and reasonable manner amongst as many of such qualified smallholders as is practicable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on the circumstances of each individual case. Naturally, an individual who came into the service of the previous landowner only within six or 12 months cannot expect to get a present of a holding worth nowadays between £7,000 or £8,000.  The displaced employee who is to get land must have farming experience and must have considerable service as an employee of the previous owner.  He must also be competent in the working of the land. In the case of the man with shorter service, the law provides that a cash payment or gratuity can be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to extend the scope of the <Col N="1087" /> powers of the Board of Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery of Ireland to make loans of works of art from the Gallery's collections.  This matter has been under consideration for some years.  The original Act of 1854 under which the Gallery was established gave the Board no power to make loans.  Subsequently, powers to make loans were conferred on the Board by virtue of the National Gallery of Ireland Act, 1928, but these powers were very limited.  They extended only to the lending of pictures for inclusion in public exhibitions held in Ireland or abroad under the management and control of public or local authorities, or of educational institutions, or of institutions or associations founded and maintained for the promotion of art, science or literature.</P>
      <P>The Board of Governors and Guardians recommended, in April, 1961, that it should be authorised to make loans of works of art to the official residence of the President, to the Houses of the Oireachtas, to Irish diplomatic or consular missions and to approved Irish institutions in Ireland.  The Bill now before the House provides for the additional powers requested by the Board.  In addition, the Bill proposes to extend the powers of the Board somewhat further in order to enable it to make loans of works of art to all State-owned premises in Ireland or abroad. Without some such provision in the Bill the Board would not be in a position to lend pictures to, for example, the Irish pavilion at the forthcoming New York World's Fair, should it be decided to display pictures by Irish artists or pictures of Irish interest therein.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was circulated, it has come to my notice that it is possible that Section 1 (c) might not cover everything we had in mind because of the fact that certain properties which are held in trust for people might not legally be regarded as belonging to the State.  A verbal amendment which I propose to introduce on the next Stage will cover this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the Bill proposes to empower the Board to lend works of art <Col N="1088" /> to exhibitions in Ireland or abroad sponsored by An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Advisory Committee on Cultural Relations or other bodies approved of by the Board.</P>
    <P>The additional powers to lend works of art provided in the Bill are to be exercised by the Board of Governors and Guardians at their discretion and without prejudice to the prestige of the Gallery and the quality of works of art kept for permanent exhibition; and, in every case, the final decision to make loans will rest solely with the Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The objects set forth in the Bill are very desirable.  As the Minister has mentioned, the original legislation setting up the Gallery goes back quite a long time prior to the establishment of the State.  The first thing that strikes one looking at this Bill is the difference between it and the original legislation, whether intentional or otherwise, in that in this Bill the question of insurance is omitted.  Under the 1928 Act, the Governors at that time were empowered to lend objects of art but there were certain obligations on them, including insurance.  That is a matter on which the Minister might advise the House.</P>
      <P>The promotion of art in the country is most desirable.  The fact that works of art have been, in the main, centred in Dublin is a matter which has been referred to on Estimates for the Department of Education and the suggestion has been made that the works of art which are a national heritage and trust should be made available to the community at centres more readily accessible to the people than the capital city.  That is not an easy object to achieve but the effort would be well worth while.  In that respect, I would ask if local authorities are included in this Bill as persons to whose care some of these objects of art may be lent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that the Bill will help to create a wider interest in and appreciation of art by making pictures available to audiences in rural centres or at least in the larger centres of population throughout the country. We welcome the measure from that <Col N="1089" /> point of view.  We have something to show, not only at home but abroad and if this Bill helps to advertise more fully the art treasures which we have, it will be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions, reference has been made to the fact that the cataloguing of objects of art is not as complete as some would wish it to be.  Quite recently, questions were addressed to the Minister in that respect.  The National Gallery is a treasure house and it is only right that a complete inventory of the works contained therein should be available to interested persons.  I would suggest that more space should be made available for the exhibition of these works of art.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the Bill, I would draw the Minister's attention to the question of insurance and would ask him to let us know if provision for insurance is included in this Bill, as was included under Section 2 sub-section (2) of the 1928 Act, under which the Governors were to take steps to preserve the property as they thought proper, including by insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>We also welcome the Bill, principally because it will give to the people outside Dublin an opportunity of seeing the works of art held by the nation.  That is a very good idea.  At the moment the Gallery possesses far more works than it has space in which to display them and many valuable works are covered up in the cellars of the Gallery.</P>
      <P>When permission is granted to places outside Dublin to hold exhibitions, such exhibitions should be held in conjunction with some kind of festival, such as the festival in Wexford and the festival in Waterford.  We in Kilkenny are at the moment undertaking the renovation of Ormonde Castle.  That castle has one of the finest galleries in the country and I am sure that the people in charge there will be looking for the concessions which this Bill proposes to give.  In that way the people in that part of the country will see these works which they would not see in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In tourist centres abroad, art exhibitions <Col N="1090" /> are frequently held and I think the same thing could be done here especially in view of the uncertainty of our climate.  It would be good to encourage more indoor attractions.  Such exhibitions would be one of the best indoor attractions for tourist centres. The discretion left to the Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery in deciding the suitability or otherwise of the place where these works are to be shown seems all right.  From experience, these people are usually very particular and I am sure they will not give permission unless they are satisfied the works will be quite safe.</P>
    <P>I had also in mind the question which Deputy Jones asked about, insurance, and the matter of transport of large works in particular.  I could imagine an amount of expense and trouble being involved and in some cases the making of security arrangements also.  I would ask the Minister to clear up these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Oddly enough, this Bill pinpoints the manner in which Ministers of State can be spancelled by all kinds of obscure regulations.  It is an odd commentary that we must have a special measure in this House to enable them to do something simple like this.  I seriously doubt if the French National Assembly had to pass a special measure to send the Mona Lisa to New York but we must pass a special measure, apparently, to send comparatively less important pictures, although some might dispute that, to the provinces here.  However, it is something we must do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This simple measure gives me the opportunity to raise again the desirability of bringing nearer to the people of this city the treasures which we have in what I regard as an obscure backwater where the National Gallery is situated.  The tendency all over the world to-day is to try to bring art and objects of art and appreciation of art and of the beautiful things of the world as near as possible to the masses of the people.  One of the methods that has been used successfully to do that, particularly in England, has been to open galleries and exhibitions on main thoroughfares in areas where large numbers of the <Col N="1091" /> populace ordinarily congregate and will come in to see what is going on out of idle curiosity which may eventually develop into appreciation of the arts.  This has proved a financial success also in England and other places.</P>
    <P>Here we have a National Gallery in a part of the city which for one of those strange reasons which nobody can explain is not very much frequented. It is a city square but it is an area which does not ordinarily carry a very great number of pedestrians on any day.  I have often, as I am sure other members have, seen persons coming to the front gate of Leinster House in hundreds and inquiring for the National Gallery, particularly during the summer, and having to be directed to the other side of this block of buildings.  That illustrates the point I am trying to make. The location of the Gallery is not very well known even to people who are ordinarily resident in the city or who are constant visitors to it.  The Minister might give some attention to the need to have the location of the Gallery made more fully known by means of advertising or maps and he should try to bring into operation the organisation known as Bord Fáilte so that they could do something in this regard to help publicise the National Gallery more than is done and make it more easy for people to get to it, have it properly sign-posted and so on.</P>
    <P>As the Bill provides for the removal of works of art from the Gallery and their public display in other places, I should like to refer to the need which exists for the public exhibition of works of art which are there but which should be placed outside the Gallery on public display in places where large numbers of Dublin citizens could see them. I refer particularly to the very excellent statue of George Bernard Shaw, one of the greatest sons of this city who attained literary greatness and became a world figure and Nobel prize-winner and whose statue is in somewhat of an alcove in the National Gallery.</P>
    <P>Shaw himself, in a letter to a friend of his recently deceased, Mr. Patrick O'Reilly, the famous dustman friend <Col N="1092" /> of Shaw, expressed the view that this statue, because of its artistic excellence, quite apart from the fact that it was a likeness of himself, should be made visible to the Dublin people and I have on occasion suggested to the Minister by means of question and otherwise that the Board of Governors of the Gallery could not do better than to make this statue available to the Board of Works.  We all know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Finance is very appreciative of art and has expressed himself as agreeable to the proposition that this statue and others of a similar kind should be displayed in the most obvious place for the purpose, St. Stephen's Green.</P>
    <P>I am taking the opportunity to remind the Minister of the need that something should be done along these lines and also to suggest to the Governors of the National Gallery that in view of the fact that the Gallery has benefited by over £500,000 by reason of the Shaw bequest, we have gained more from Shaw's work in actual cash than from the efforts of any other individual that I can think of, at least this much should be done in honour of the man.  He was a native of the city and many times crossed the Green on his way to work in Molesworth Street before he went to make his name in London.</P>
    <P>There are other matters also which the members of the Board of Governors of the Gallery might well consider. They have there a number of other statues, some of them representations of famous people, some of middling people, and some of people who are pretty bad.  They should at least help to promote throughout the world the knowledge that here in the city of Dublin, there is a literary tradition, and every opportunity should be availed of by people who have an interest in art, such as the people in charge of the Gallery are supposed to have, to promote the idea that people should come to Dublin from all parts of the world to see the places where Shaw, Joyce, O'Casey, Yeats and many others lived whose names do not spring to my mind at the present time but who are well known throughout the literary world.  This <Col N="1093" /> promotion should be helped by the Board of the National Gallery by the public display of statues of those people.  I would suggest that the centre of such a display should be made at Stephen's Green because of the fact that the ordinary visitor to the city and even the ordinary citizen finds difficulty in locating the National Gallery because it is situated in a backwater.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an obvious step that should have been taken years ago.  It is quite obvious that what we have here in the nature of artistic treasures should be brought down the country into the various cities, towns and villages and made available to the people for their enjoyment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome measure.  I hope that when collections are being made up to be sent down the country, they will be representative and worthwhile.  It would be an obvious thing for the people in charge of the treasures of the National Gallery not to let great treasures out of their sight and not to send them down the country; but with modern transport and modern heating and ventilation in galleries and rooms down the country where these pictures would be exhibited, the people in charge of the National Gallery could feel quite safe. I know that the local people will see to it that insurance and everything else is all right and the necessary precautions are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say in regard to what Deputy Dunne has said about the late George Bernard Shaw that the National Gallery have come into nearly £500,000 out of only one of his works, <i>Pygmalion</i>, which was used as the libretto of <i>My Fair Lady.</i> That shows us that the National Gallery have a great asset in the Shaw bequest, that it is an improving asset and that more money is coming in.  I would like to see, when collections are being made up, some of the great pictures recently bought sent down the country to let the people in the south, west and the north west see such great works of art. I do not think that we were grateful enough to George Bernard Shaw for his great and generous bequest.  I <Col N="1094" /> would support Deputy Dunne in what he says, that we should exhibit his statue and let it be known to the youth of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Shaw bequest to the National Gallery is the greatest bequest they have received.  It looks likely that the money will be continually pouring in and more pictures will be bought.  That is all to the good.  We bought old masters with the first sum we got and I would submit that it would be good to purchase some modern works now, and some by our own living painters. I am sure that Shaw would like to see this done with his bequest and that through the College of Art, there should be competition for all classes of people here in Ireland to submit pictures and that substantial money prizes, not just trophies, should be given.  Artists have to eat as well as anyone else, and from what we read and know about them they starve more than people in any other profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but you will bear with me in that, Sir.  There are fine places down the country to exhibit pictures.  We have had some pictures exhibited in Waterford several times and as Deputy Pattison mentioned, one of the finest picture galleries in the country is in Kilkenny, attached to Ormonde Castle.  I saw that when the Ormonde collection of pictures was in this magnificent gallery, magnificently lighted.  I am sure that the people in Kilkenny who are promoting the taking over of the Castle will do the kind of job that officials of the National Gallery would like to have done on this gallery.  I am saying that with an eye to my own constituency, because I know that Kilkenny is only a matter of thirty miles away from Waterford.</P>

      <P>We will send them by CIE.  We will see the Minister for Transport and Power about that, but we will have to walk with them to Tramore, I am afraid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting a good number of the pictures out of the National Gallery <Col N="1095" /> will give the people there an opportunity of making a speedy inventory and a complete catalogue.  They could look to the catalogues on the Continent and even in Britain, especially the catalogue of the Wallace collection. They should produce a catalogue on that style with the best of the pictures in colour.  I would point out to the Minister that that could be done by Irish printers.  Some of the great printing houses in Dublin and all over the country are quite capable of printing a magnificent catalogue, and we should have them.  I believe that I am pushing an open door when I say to the Minister, that he should make that recommendation to the Governors of the National Gallery.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I will say this, that when the pictures are going down the country, it would be good to let the people know that they are going down.  We should make use of our own resources in advertising them, and it should be made known over Radio Éireann and Telifís Éireann, because if there were a promotion of that kind, with the Minister saying that the pictures were leaving on the way to Cork, Kilkenny, Waterford or Limerick, it would help to attract the people.  I hope that the principals in the schools will see to it at their own convenience that their pupils are brought to see the pictures we send down.  It is mainly for the younger people we would send them down.</P>
    <P>I have been journeying for years trying to find out the meaning of a phrase I have heard so often at public functions, at dinners, here in the Dáil and on the hustings, about our national heritage and our way of life.  Nobody could ever tell me what that was, or give me a proper definition.  Today some of my colleagues opened my eyes and I found that portion of our national heritage is in the National Gallery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a rural Deputy, I welcome this Bill inasmuch as it will enable us to take to our schools and colleges some of the treasures that are stored in the National Gallery.  It is <Col N="1096" /> true that lack of space, or proper heating factilities, or many other factors, may have prevented the removal in the past of these works to centres in the country, but this is a tremendous step forward inasmuch as it will give our students, scholars and youth in rural areas a chance of developing an appreciation of the great art in these pictures. Vocational schools and colleges would, at least for a while, be ideal places in which to exhibit, or even heated town halls or courthouses all over the rural counties.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that even the ordinary people would appreciate the opportunity of viewing these treasures, some of which are priceless.  Indeed, I am sure some of the people living in Dublin have never troubled to see them for themselves.  It is very often a case of the nearer the chapel, the farther from God.  I also feel that many people travel abroad without having seen Ireland first and they have little knowledge of the vast amount of treasures which we have produced down the ages.  This should be a wonderful incentive to people to become art-minded and to appreciate the heritage that has been handed down to us, to have a better understanding of the past and a better appreciation of the work which went into creating some of these great treasures.  Many people have heard of the dispute over the Hugh Lane pictures and many people wondered what they were like. Thousands of people would very much appreciate the opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but, at the same time, the controversy awakened an interest, even in the ordinary people, in works of art.  I do not think there will be any objection to this Bill; the Minister is doing something which will be of great benefit to the country, and to those engaged in this sphere of education, in providing an opportunity for people to see these works which are at all times available in the capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill really proposes only a small change in the existing situation.  It does, however, give us <Col N="1097" /> an opportunity to discuss the Gallery and its administration.  For a small country, we are very fortunate that this collection is in the capital and indeed any other city with a population of half a million people would be very fortunate to have the pictures we have in the National Gallery and also in the Municipal Gallery.  It is understandable how they have come to be there.  Dublin was the capital city and was and is the seat of government and did inherit a patrician tradition.  The people of Dublin are very fortunate to have this collection at their doors in a most accessible and beautiful gallery, and despite what Deputy Dolan said, it is only at a cost to them of their share as taxpayers. Indeed, it is rather ironical good fortune for the city that rejected Hugh Lane and if the Corporation of Dublin had been more enlightened earlier, the pictures to which the last speaker referred, the Lane Collection, could have been included in the proposals in this legislation and legislation that preceded it.  However, they were not enlightened enough and I hope that they understand how fortunate they now are.  In other respects, for instance, in the present situation of the very generous offer of a concert hall, I hope the people of Dublin will be more co-operative than they were in 1910.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides a slight relaxation of present conditions which permit pictures from the national collection to be sent to centres in the country, local government buildings of a suitable character.  But the people do not know this and I discovered it only some years ago when we tried to get some pictures from the collection for a general exhibition in Cork.  We got a dozen pictures from the Governors of the National Gallery and they were all third-rate.  We tried to put up a very good front but they were not good pictures and there were far better pictures available there.  All the pictures in the Gallery, because they are owned by all the people, should be available for any special purpose or any exhibition in any part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the preliminary to all <Col N="1098" /> that is the provision of a complete and proper catalogue because 99.9 per cent. of the people do not know what is under the control of the Governors. I suspect that some of the Governors do not know what is under their control, either.  We should, of course, acknowledge at this stage our national gratitude to the windfalls that have come to us from strange places.  The Shaw bequest has far exceeded the intentions of the donor, I believe, but then Bernard Shaw never realised how much more money there was on Broadway than there was in the Royal Court Theatre in London.</P>
    <P>Our gratitude for that windfall should be acknowledged in some way in addition to that suggested by Deputy Dunne.  I think a plaque should be erected on the premises at the National Gallery because there is no doubt that never has such munificence come the way of the Governors. This one single request enabled them to go into the big picture market and it is very fortunate that it should have happened when this inflationary wave has brought the price of great works of the Impressionist period into the realms of fantasy.</P>
    <P>There is a curious shortcoming in the present situation.  This collection is the property of the nation but it has not been catalogued or valued completely, I feel sure, ever.  The collection must be worth several millions of pounds but we never hear anything about it; nobody makes a report on the work of the Governors from year to year.  In the Dáil Library, I have asked to get a report of the Trustees of the National Gallery and I have found that in the 40 years since the State was established, no such report was ever made.</P>
    <P>I should like to know, members of the House would like to know and the people would like to know, when the Trustees of the Governors meet, who appoints them, what, if any, decisions they make.  I think the Minister should ensure that from now on an annual report will be provided by the temporary Trustees of this very valuable national property.  I should also like to be told by the Minister <Col N="1099" /> what buying policy is being pursued at the moment.  There has been some disputation in the public Press about the recent acquisition of the Murillo painting.  This, I know, is very thorny ground because art appreciation is a very curious thing&mdash;what is one man's meat is very often another's poison&mdash; and there is a fashion in painting.  The work of painters which was very valuable a few years ago has declined in value while the Impressionists and post-Impressionists now are worth a king's ransom.  You could have bought some of those for old rope in 1920.</P>
    <P>It is a very important thing from the national viewpoint, and particularly because of the great funds now at the disposal of the Governors of the National Gallery, to know how these Governors make their decisions. A good picture of the kind we read about in the newspapers, a Cezanne, a Monet or any of the Impressionists, would cost as much as Tulyar cost and its purchase could easily be as speculative.  It is not easy to please everybody but the Minister should be able to tell us if there is a clear policy of buying defined anywhere and whether we are filling gaps.  In other words, are we completing representations from different schools and are we seizing opportunities of picking up works that, even though speculative, might be worthwhile in the long run?</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think that the first line of policy would be to complete our representation of all the schools. For that reason, I think an annual report from the Governors is highly desirable.  What have we got?  I am aware of the difficulties of cataloguing a great collection but I should be interested to find out if an attempt will now be made to bring the cataloguing up to date.  It is very desirable, particularly in the light of this legislation, that this cataloguing should be completed so that those who might seek to benefit by the facilities now being widened would know what is there.</P>
    <P>The very act of cataloguing would let us know whether it might not be wise and desirable to get rid of a lot of the material in the National Gallery <Col N="1100" /> because I think we have got many bad pictures there, as well as some very fine ones.  We could get rid of a lot of third-rate stuff, either by sale or bestowal, because I feel it is cluttering up the stores.  We should not send to other centres such third-rate stuff when they ask for an occasional exhibition because, as Deputy T. Lynch said, the directors might feel an ordinary human reluctance about the temporary lending of the plums, the prizes of the Gallery.</P>
    <P>On the question of insurance, it is doubtful whether insurance is a wise policy at all.  I think the State should really carry the insurance now.  There is one picture in the Municipal Gallery in Charlemont House at the moment, a Claude Monet which, given fortunate circumstances, could run up to £200,000 at an auctioneer's bench in either London or New York.  I would take a bet that it is not insured for more than £5,000.  I am pretty sure of that and I should like the Minister to clear our minds as to the needlessness of insuring at all.  It is practically impossible to get rid of all these very valuable pictures nowadays.  You could take them and hide them but you could not take them and get money for them. I therefore question whether insurance should not be discarded altogether and the State stand the racket.  There is a question, of course, about pictures being sent down the country on loan but I doubt if insurance should apply even there.  As long as they remain inside the shores of the country, I do not think we should be throwing away vast sums of money in insurance cover because we cannot possibly hope to cover what we have since it would exceed the entire income of the National Gallery.</P>
    <P>In the matter of public relations. it is desirable that the people in the country who, after all, own the collection, should be aware of what they have.  I do not know how the postcard or larger-sized print reproductions are selling but I should like to see them on the counters.  I think we should be at least as active in this respect as they are in the English galleries and in all galleries in Italy and France.  Coloured lantern slide <Col N="1101" /> transparencies can be made very cheaply and they are a remarkably competent type of reproduction.  They would be available for lecturers all over the country and would be invaluable in schools.  The lectures conducted by Mr. White, now Curator of the Municipal Gallery, were valuable and useful and the Minister should impress on the Governors of the National Gallery that he regards that kind of activity as being very valuable.</P>
    <P>When school books are being produced&mdash;and this is in the Minister's country&mdash;reproductions of some of our National Gallery possessions should be used to illustrate them.  A set of coloured blocks is expensive but related to the circulation and the cost of a standard school text book, it would be a very small part of the cost. The very fact that these are our own pictures in this Gallery would add enormously to their interest.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly approve of those excursions which are arranged for school children to the city of Dublin but no matter how important it is to go to the Zoo or the biscuit factory, it should always be insisted upon that a brief visit be paid to the National Gallery.  I would recommend also to the Minister that he should discuss with his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that one of the most effective programmes on British TV in recent years was the Herbert Reade illustrated lectures on art.  They were enormously interesting and something similar should be done here.  We should bring to light all our art possessions and do everything we can to make people aware of them.  This Bill does help in that regard and I hope that advantage will be taken of the opportunities provided by it.</P>
    <P>There are bodies in the country who could organise with the greatest ease interesting and useful exhibitions of parts of the National Gallery collection so that all the people in the country would have access to their own treasures and so that they also, along with the very fortunate citizens of Dublin, could enjoy these treasures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very cheered by the active interest of Deputies in this <Col N="1102" /> question of the lending of pictures.  Of course, this Bill deals only with the power of the Board to lend pictures and it is an <i>ad hoc</i> measure.  I am sure the Board of the National Gallery will be very stimulated by the recognition in this House of the great influence the Board can have on taste and art education throughout the country by their using the powers which this Bill and the other Bill gives them.</P>
      <P>The catalogue question has been raised again.  There is a complete catalogue of the Italian paintings available and there is a full catalogue of all the works in the Gallery, about 1,800 now completed and being proofed.  As Deputy Barry says, the proofing needs very careful and expert attention so it cannot be published for some time, until it is fully proofed and until everybody is satisfied with its accuracy and other matters.  Cataloguing is, I understand, a difficulty in all galleries but this one should rid us of a lot of criticism which people have brought against the lack of labelling and about the difficulty in finding their way through the exhibition.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that of the works of art which we have, a very big number are in storage.  There is no room to hang what we have and this problem is being dealt with as far as Dublin is concerned.  Incidentally I think Dublin is very fortunate in this Gallery and I would not agree that it is out of the way.  It is beautifully situated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect it could and I hope it will.  At this period, we are depending on the development of artistic taste, artistic appreciation and artistic education.  All these things are very much tied up with the general <Col N="1103" /> appreciation by the public of things which are of good taste and things which are artistic in value.  Countries which are to the fore in matters of art are there because children growing up see nothing on all sides but things which are beautiful in architecture, painting, and so on.  We should try to show what we have of beauty to all our people.</P>
      <P>The 1928 Act specified insurance of exhibitions held under Section 3 of the Act and it referred to exhibitions outside the National Gallery.  The onus was put on the Governors of the National Gallery to be careful.  It included provision for insurance of its exhibitions but it did not put any onus on them or anybody else in relation to insurance, if the exhibitions being held outside the Gallery were not being held by the Board of Governors.  I can see the great difficulty which would be involved in doing this.  I imagine that the provision in the Bill to lend would provide for the lending to responsible people and of course there is a general onus on the Board of Governors to be careful where they send their pictures. They have the final decision and I do not think it would be possible to make a provision for insuring all places where they are permitted to lend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 3, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; 3&mdash;(1)  The proprietor of a hotel is under a duty to receive at the hotel as guests all persons who, whether or not under special contract, present themselves and require sleeping accommodation, food or drink and to provide them therewith, unless he has reasonable grounds of refusal.</P>
      <P>(2)  Subject to the terms of any special contract, the proprietor is under a duty to provide such accommodation, food or drink at the charges for the time being current at the hotel.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment which, in fact, substitutes a new section for Section 3 has a couple of purposes.  First of all, we want to make it clear in what manner Section 3 will apply in the case of a person coming to a hotel with a special contract.  Under the section as it stands, the duty imposed on a hotel proprietor to receive all comers applies primarily to guests coming without a special contract. Where a person has a special contract &mdash;in other words, where he has booked in advance or made a reservation&mdash; the proprietor's duty to receive him arises, in the first instance, out of the contract itself.  Of course, as I have already indicated, it is the intention that, if a hotel proprietor refuses to honour a contract, the guest can fall back on and rely upon the statutory duty to receive.  As the section is drafted at the moment, I do not think it makes this intention quite clear.  I am satisfied, and I think the House will be satisfied, that the statutory duty to receive all comers should be specially expressed to apply to all persons, whether or not they come <Col N="1106" /> under a special contract.  I think it will be agreed that subsection (1) of the new section achieves this.</P>
    <P>Where there is a special contract, that is, where a person has made some special arrangements in advance, the proprietor may be bound under the terms of that arrangement to provide the guest with accommodation, food or drink at special prices.  It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that the statutory provision will not interfere with the contractual right of the guest to receive accommodation, food or drink at those special prices.  Subsection (2) of the proposed new section seeks to achieve this, by beginning with the words: &ldquo;Subject to the terms of any special contract....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second purpose of the amendment is to meet objections which have been raised by the hotel industry about the obligation to provide accommodation, food or drink at &ldquo;reasonable prices&rdquo;.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that this provision is a re-statement of existing common law.  The object is to ensure that a hotel proprietor will not be able to evade his duty by offering to all comers, as he is supposed to do, accommodation, food or drink at excessive prices, and thereby in reality evading his obligations. The hotel industry have recommended to me that the obligation to supply at reasonable prices could be availed of by difficult, eccentric or unscrupulous persons to create unnecessary difficulty for hotel managements and to upset the normal running of their businesses.  They maintain that the provision about reasonable prices is unnecessary nowadays because all such prices in registered hotels are published by Bord Fáilte, and if a hotel proprietor seeks to charge more than the published price, his registration can be terminated.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the expression &ldquo; reasonable prices &rdquo; would, in fact, give rise to the difficulties that the hoteliers seem to envisage but, in deference to their objections, I have decided that we should possibly make the situation a little clearer.  As the House will see, subsection (2) now stipulates that the duty is to provide <Col N="1107" /> accommodation, food or drink &ldquo;at the charges for the time being current at the hotel&rdquo;.  Possibly that wording is a little more satisfactory, and it is certainly more satisfactory from the point of view of the hotel proprietors.  It is a change which, as I said, I have agreed to make in deference to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment, so far as the phrase &ldquo;reasonable prices&rdquo; is concerned, is designed, as he acknowledges himself, to meet the point of view put up by the hotel proprietors.  I think that the point they made to the Minister&mdash;and it was argued in this House&mdash;was a valid point in that it might be extremely difficult to interpret or express what &ldquo;reasonable prices&rdquo; meant.  Different people would take a different view.</P>
      <P>I am not entirely sure that the Minister has not gone a bit too far in the opposite direction in this amending section.  He is undoubtedly removing the measure of protection which existed under the section as originally drafted for the customer, the ordinary member of the public going to the hotel.  However, I am not raising any protest.  I think the Minister has endeavoured to meet both points of view in the amendment.  He has also made it clear and effective in the amendment that the hotelier has a duty, both under the statutory duty which is being imposed by this Bill and the duty under the special contract which exists as between the hotel and the customer or a group of customers, but I am wondering if the last phrase in subsection (1) of Section 3 might not enable a hotelier to contract out of a special contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is given an overriding right under the section, as I read it even in the case of special contracts, to refuse to serve a customer if he has reasonable grounds for that refusal. Obviously, there is no case law yet as to what will constitute reasonable grounds and I simply want to be clear in my mind as to whether or not that phrase is intended deliberately to govern not only the case of the statutory duty being imposed by the section <Col N="1108" /> but also the case of the hotelier <i>vis-à-vis</i> a customer with whom he has a special contract.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase is intended to qualify the statutory obligation. Naturally, the contractual right would still remain but, in my view, would not be affected by the insertion of the words &ldquo;unless he has reasonable grounds for refusal&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 10, before &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;suitable&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is again to resolve some doubts raised here on Committee Stage, and possibly on Second Stage too, and also to allay some fears expressed by the hotel proprietors. Under sub-section (1) of Section 5 as at present drafted, a hotel proprietor might be obliged to receive all property of any description, no matter how bulky or cumbersome, subject only to his having space for it. That is the fear the hotel proprietors have about the section.  It is the fear they expressed to me.  It is not, in fact, the intention&mdash;certainly it is not my intention&mdash;that the proprietor should be required to receive property which is, for example, objectionable, excessively cumbersome, or which, for any other valid reason, it would be unreasonable to expect him to admit. The amendment seeks to clarify the position by providing that the proprietor need admit only property for which he has suitable accommodation. In other words, if a guest were to bring along his pet elephant, the proprietor would not be under any obligation to receive it.  Unless he had accommodation available and resources suitable for looking after elephants.</P>

      <P>So long as the pin remains in the grenade, the grenade is quite safe and can be left safely lying on top of a locker, or anywhere else.  I put this forward seriously because I do not think the Minister has really met the case put up here. The Minister has brought in an amendment to expand the section by providing that this will apply where there is suitable accommodation, whereas, under the section as it stands, the reference is simply to accommodation. It seems to me there is a case to be made, from the hotel proprietors' point of view, that it may be unreasonable to ask him to take in any property, even though he may have quite suitable accommodation for it.</P>
      <P>On the last day we were discussing this, I mentioned that you might have the case of an object of particular value and a hotelier might not have the particular type of insurance which would enable him to feel entirely happy in his mind about keeping on his premises such an object.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the only test now is as to whether the accommodation is suitable.  The Minister would be meeting the situation more fairly, I think, if there were some modification of the section to allow a hotel proprietor to give notice to a guest that he will not accept a particular article on specified grounds; he should be required to specify the grounds and, if those grounds are reasonable, the duty of acceptance should be removed from him.  I am not keen on limiting the section.  Speaking as an individual, I think it is a good idea that guests should feel they have, as they should have, as full a measure of protection for both themselves and their property as it is possible to give them.  We must try, however, to hold the scales evenly between the guests, on the one hand, and the hotel proprietor, on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this section, it is open to a guest to insist on the hotel proprietor accepting (1) an article which may be dangerous and (2) an article which for some reason, such as excessive value, the hotel proprietor may not want to take.  There is another aspect in connection with an article which might be <Col N="1110" /> dangerous in a special sense.  It might for example, be combustible.  The hotel proprietor's insurance policy might be invalidated or the premiums might be increased by reason of his having to accept articles virtually of all sorts.  It might be a tin of petrol, or something of that sort, for which suitable accommodation might be available, but the article might not be covered by the proprietor's insurance policy.  If through mishap, a fire were to start or that account, it is quite conceivable that the insurance company could argue that the hotel was not covered because, under the terms of the policy no such article should have been brought on to the premises.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is an easy section to enable the Minister to be entirely fair from both points of view It is one which requires a good dea of attention.  As it stands, I do no think the Minister has dealt with the situation adequately, though this is an improvement on what was there before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this matter of dangerous substances specifically with the draftsman because this was one of the matters the hotel proprietors raised.  The draftsman is quite satisfied that the amendment gives them all the protection they want.  He assures me that the section as now drafted means that the discretion is given to the proprietors to refuse admission.  I am not sure that any real difficulty would arise in any of the cases Deputy O'Higgins has instanced.  In the case of the dangerous substance&mdash;the hand grenade, the explosive, or the tin of petrol&mdash;I am quite certain the court would regard the fact that the insurance company would not cover the article as a reason governing the unsuitability of the accommodation.  If a hotel proprietor were to say to a guest that he could not accept a particular item because he had no suitable accommodation, he would go on to say: &ldquo; I have nowhere in the hotel which an insurance company would regard as suitable.&rdquo;  In my opinion, that would be a perfectly valid reason for his maintaining that he had no suitable accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> Deputy O'Higgins is right in saying that this is a matter of trying to preserve the balance between the rights of the individual visitor coming to the establishment and the rights of the owner of the establishment and it is difficult to achieve something entirely satisfactory from both points of view.  However, I think we have hit upon a reasonable compromise in the phraseology I now propose.  In any case where the proprietor has suitable accommodation, and it must appear to be suited to the particular thing in question, then I think he should be under an obligation to receive, but, if his accommodation is not suitable, he should be entitled to refuse.  I could give this undertaking to Deputy O'Higgins, that the Bill will be going to the Seanad and if anybody comes up with a better suggestion between now and then, I will consider it. Deputy O'Higgins and I are both anxious to achieve the same result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to ask the Minister to think of the position with regard to another Act which he has put through the House, the Official Secrets Act.  There are sections in that Act which make it an offence to have documents which are declared by the Minister to be secret and confidential in one's possession or at one's house.  If I have such a document and I engage a room in a hotel, I can say to the proprietor that this document is declared by the Minister to be secret and confidential, that I am telling him that and that he knows that if he takes it into his hotel, he is committing an offence.  In such a case, I am availing of my rights under Section 5 of this Bill and I can demand of him to take it in. As far as I can see, he must do it.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask the Minister what is the position with regard to the visitor who does not engage a room and is only there for a meal? I take it the position still is that the hotel proprietor must take reasonable care that he will not injure the visitor's goods but that there is no special obligation on him to take them in charge.</P>

It is not the intention that the hotel proprietor should be liable in that case and the proposal in the amendment is to substitute the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;precincts,&rdquo; I think it is a better word and should meet the views expressed by the proprietors in this regard.</P>

      <P>The debate on the Second Reading of this Bill has been very comprehensive and I welcome the many points raised and suggestions made in the course of it.  At this stage, it is true to say that the Bill has been pretty well received and the House does recognise the need for this type of planning legislation.  Quite a few doubts were expressed by a number of Deputies about certain aspects of the provisions of the Bill, and at this stage I propose to deal only with the main points raised.  I should like to assure the House that if I do not deal with all the points raised, minor as well as major, it is not because I am not aware of them, and I can give an assurance that they will be completely and fully considered between now and Committee Stage in every aspect as they have been put here in the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones agrees that planning authorities should be relieved of the obligation to produce a planning scheme of the kind envisaged in the 1934 Act.  He also then goes on to welcome the provisions in this Bill providing for a more practical and less rigid form of development plan. He puts forward the view that the Bill is more suited to deal with urban than rural problems and that it is really suited to the problems of large centres of population such as Dublin and the other cities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan, who followed him some time later, thought that provision should be made to give priority to the planning of those large urban centres and that we should leave over the planning of other areas till a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These views, as the House is well aware, have not been accepted by many Deputies, including Deputies <Col N="1115" /> Barry, P. J. Burke and Tully, who feel differently, that there is a need, and an outstanding one for planning in the rural areas.  I should like to point out that the Bill does, in fact, recognise that there is a distinction, and without any doubt, a very clear one, between urban and rural problems. Section 19, for instance, requires that the development plans for urban areas must include objectives which are somewhat different from the objectives which must be included in the development plans for rural areas. In the rural areas, the same type of development plan will not be necessary, but that is not to say that rural planning problems do not exist.</P>
    <P>One may mention the obvious problem of the preservation and improvement of natural amenities which are of such vital importance to the tourist industry.  An examination of the Third Schedule to the Bill will disclose the variety of matters which might be dealt with in a development plan.  It will be the duty of each planning authority to make its choice of the particular matter or matters appropriate to its own needs and its own capabilities.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the position of development plans in relation to the control of land use.  The development plan will form the framework against which development will be guided by the planning authority. Unlike the planning scheme envisaged under the 1934 Act, the development plan will not fix the final and detailed destiny of every last iota of land on the map.  It will in fact declare the authority's policy in broad but definite terms for the development of its entire area.  Emphasis should be laid on the broad though definite terms rather than the detailed procedure that was called for and was desired and laid down in this House as being required under the 1943 Act.  There is that very distinct difference, though both measures would, and are intended to, reach the same end, that is, controlled, proper planning and so on throughout the country and throughout the territory of every planning authority in the country.</P>
    <P>These development plans, of which <Col N="1116" /> words we hear quite a lot, must be based on surveys which will give a picture of the existing situation in respect of, first, population structure and trends; secondly, land use, location of residential accommodation and its relationship with industry, commerce and public utilities; thirdly, traffic requirements; and fourthly, industrial and commercial resources and potential, including capacity of existing services and communications and relationship to shipping and airport facilities.  Finally, the surveys will embrace the needs and facilities for leisure, education and other community developments.</P>
    <P>An analysis of the surveys will show the unused resources of individual areas, their suitability for particular forms of industrial and commercial development and their needs for improved amenities and community facilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that development plans may be made in stages. Again, I think that is important from the point of view of the approach of our local authorities to this rather onerous and probably somewhat difficult task.  Later plans will be filled in as planning and development activities proceed.  Developing techniques in industry and commerce influence both the kind and amount of land and services required.  Social attitudes and needs are subject to growth and changes, and economic conditions vary. These factors will be reflected in the planning authorities' assessment at the periodic reviews of development plans.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made in the debate to the question of the zoning of land use.  The Bill provides that in the cities and towns the development plan shall indicate the objectives for the use solely or primarily of particular areas for particular purposes, whether residential, commercial, for industry, agriculture or otherwise. Thus the indication of an area as an area primarily for residential use will not necessarily mean that the establishment there of a shopping or office centre is precluded.  Similarly, the provision of dwellings or even light industries is not necessarily precluded in an area indicated as a commercial area. The aim must be to follow the trends <Col N="1117" /> of voluntary development and to study carefully the wishes of property owners.  Trends damaging to the values and amenities of existing properties and to the interests of the community must obviously be restrained and restricted.</P>
    <P>The need for planning of land use and the value of such planning to the prospective developer and industrialist were well stated by Deputies, notably Deputies Crinion and Clinton. I fully agree with Deputy Clinton's view as to the need for a positive contribution by local authorities towards creating employment opportunities in their areas.  I also share his views as to the necessity for planning authorities to consult outside interests in relation to community development. The making of a development plan will be a function of the elected members. People should consider that and let it sink in&mdash;the making of a development plan will be the function of the elected members of our planning authorities.  On these bodies as elected members we have serving many successful business men, farmers, representatives of farmers' organisations, members of chambers of commerce and of the general business, industrial and agricultural life.  I hope that in these planning authorities planning will become a vital element of our administration.</P>
    <P>I suggest that these planning authorities, following the trend of views expressed by Deputy Clinton, should in all cases try to ensure that the views of all local organised groups will be obtained and listened to in the preparation of these plans so that all will be working to the one end which is greater prosperity and better usage of what we have at our disposal; so that the advice of all these people, in addition to the views of the members of our local authorities, will add up to the point where we are getting the best from the minds of all who are in any way interested in the development of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I might add that while I was in the United States of America, I found that what you might call public participation in the whole development and planning programme was a feature which was developed to a pretty advanced <Col N="1118" /> degree and one which I think, in their set-up, was conducive to very much of their present re-development being made possible.  In other words, the co-operation as well as the knowledge and know-how which they were able to obtain from these local development groups helped them to attain what they set out to attain, that is, re-development of blighted and broken-down areas.  That is in a sense part of our problem here and just as it has been found in the United States to be of assistance to the authorities to have the public, and particularly public associations, participating, advising and giving of their best, the more help and assistance we can get from the greatest number of public organisations, the sooner will we reach the goal which this Bill has in view.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill have been the subject of criticism by a number of Deputies on the ground that people's right of appeal to the courts has been removed and reference was made to the position under existing Town and Country Planning Acts under which planned schemes could be the subject of appeals to the High Court and had also to be placed before each House of the Oireachtas.  Two separate points are raised in that criticism.  The first relates to the right of appeal to the High Court, given by Section 31 of the 1934 Act and also Section 5 of the 1939 Act.  Careful examination of these sections will reveal that in fact they actually restrict the rights of citizens rather than give them something which it is now said we are taking away.  There is inherent in our democracy a right of access to the courts but these sections.  Section 31 of the 1934 Act, and Section 5 of the 1939 Act, limited the period within which recourse might be had to the court.  The particular point in those two Acts was really a restriction rather than something we enjoyed to the full.  We are not really doing what it was said we are trying to do, that is, taking away from the people something they have been enjoying.  In actual fact, it was a restrictive clause inserted in those two Acts.</P>
    <P>The second point made seems to imply that constitutional rights will <Col N="1119" /> be taken away.  All members of the House will realise that no Department and no Minister in any Government has a Bill drafted which he is aware will wilfully take away, or attempt to take away, any constitutional rights.  It should also be remembered that if in the drafting of a Bill&mdash;and I do not admit it is such in this Bill&mdash;such right were endangered, it still does not matter whether it goes through this House in that form because the law made in this House cannot take away a constitutional right.  Nothing we can do by ordinary legislation can in fact take away a constitutional right which is enshrined in the Constitution, the procedure for changing which we all know, but we cannot do it here.  The right of any citizen to the protection of the High Court will remain unimpaired. In other words, the rights of people under the Constitution cannot be abrogated by something we do in this House.</P>
    <P>I should add that every action of the Minister or the planning authority will remain subject to restraint of the court, unless the action is both in accordance with the Constitution and the law as made by this House.  In other words, the Minister and the local planning authority under this Bill will not be enabled to take away anything, or do anything, in respect of which the laws enacted by the House have not already given permission.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we need have no fear, although it is natural enough in certain cases that fears might well be expressed, that we will lose any constitutional rights by reason of any section of the Bill or for that matter, any other Bill.  Under the 1934 Act, there is an elaborate procedure laid down in connection with the adoption of a resolution to make a planning scheme.  For one reason or another, many planning authorities had difficulty in following this procedure exactly and, because it might be very serious if at a later stage the resolution was invalidated, provision was included in the 1939 Act that if no owner of property applied to the High Court, within two months, for annulment, the resolution would thereafter <Col N="1120" /> be deemed to be valid for all purposes. Since the Bill provides no parallel to a planning resolution under the 1934 Act, there is no need to provide for any court application for annulment.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the 1934 Act enabled any person whose property was affected by a planning scheme to apply to the High Court within one month of the Minister's Order approving the planning scheme.  On such application, the High Court could annul the scheme or part of the scheme if the scheme or part of the scheme contravened or was not authorised by or was not made in accordance with the Act.  In other words, the court could not review the merits of the scheme or any provision in it and could only annul if the scheme were found to be <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>Up to now, the period allowed was only one month.  If no application were made within the month and the Minister made an order appointing a day on Which the scheme was to come into force, the scheme would have statutory force and effect as from that day.  If there was something really wrong about the procedure that we are now wiping out, if it were not found to be wrong until after a month had elapsed and the day appointed named, there was nothing thereafter anybody could do.  This, in fact, is the misunderstood provision which has brought about criticism to the effect that we are taking something away.  That was the restriction section which we had made available to the courts in the 1934 Act specifically, and under the 1939 Act partially.</P>
    <P>While a development plan, which we have not been told about, is similar in some respects to a planning scheme, the vital difference between them is that the development plan does not purport to control or regulate development as does a planning scheme.  It was necessary in the case of a planning scheme to ensure that its validity could not be challenged, once it had come into operation, and therefore a limited period only was allowed.  In the case of development plans, in future any person may apply at any time to the courts for a ruling that it is <i>ultra vires.</i> In other words, there is no restriction of time within <Col N="1121" /> which, if a person finds there is something wrong about a proposal, he can make application to the courts.  It was not necessary to incorporate any provision in the Bill for such an application, since there is no intention of limiting the time within which it may be made.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to Section 53 of the 1934 Act which enabled application to be made to a district court to quash a notice of intention to exercise powers under Part VI of the Act.  This part deals with a contravention of planning schemes and has never become effective, for the simple reason that no planning scheme has ever being brought into operation.  In those circumstances, it is idle to say that existing rights of recourse to the courts are being taken away.  Theoretically, in some way they may have existed but they were very restricted, and if they did exist at all, they could never have operated because the circumstances never obtained and I do not think they will ever obtain.</P>
    <P>A planning scheme under the 1934 Act was a legislative rather than an administrative form of legislation and control.  It was for this reason that provision could appropriately be made for laying it before the Oireachtas and for the making of applications to the district court to quash proceedings for enforcement.  A planning scheme under that Act had the force and effect of law and was accordingly capable of judicial interpretation, but even so, Section 52 only enabled the district court to inquire into the question of whether circumstances existed enabling the responsible authority to exercise their power of enforcement.</P>
    <P>The court also might consider whether there was, in fact, a contravention of a provision in a planning scheme but it was not enabled to consider the merits of the provision or of the scheme generally.  In addition, as I have already explained in regard to the limited period for annulment, it was not open to the district court to consider, on an application under Section 52, whether the particular provision of the scheme was <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>The position in regard to the making <Col N="1122" /> of development plans under the present Bill is fundamentally no different from the position under the present law.  If the development plan, in the opinion of any person, is not made in accordance with the procedure laid down, or if it exceeds what is empowered by law, an application may be made to the High Court for a declaration that the plan is <i>ultra vires.</i> Since the Bill does not limit the period within which an application may be made to quash a development plan, it will be appreciated that it is the intention to improve the position as compared with that which obtains in regard to a planning scheme under the 1934 Act.  In other words, we are removing, and improving by so removing, the restriction on time within which application may be made to the High Court.  In fact, there will not be any restriction on time in the future and that means that if anybody thinks or feels there is something wrong at any time, the passing of time will not have taken from him, as it would have under the 1934 and 1939 Acts, his right to go to the High Court seeking a declaration.</P>
    <P>Appeals under Section 80 of the Bill from decisions of planning authorities will relate primarily to the administration of planning and to the policies associated therewith.  In determining an appeal under Section 80, the Minister is not exercising a judicial function. The function is, in the main, an administrative function, but he must of course keep within the provisions of the law, and if he does not, if he steps outside those provisions in his dealing with those matters, then an appeal lies to the High Court on any such matter. Furthermore, if any question of law arises in relation to an appeal, there is provision in Section 80 for reference of that matter for decision by the High Court.</P>
    <P>I should point out that Section 80 also provides for oral hearings, representing an improvement on the position in relation to the present system of determining appeals, which makes no specific provision for oral hearing.  I feel sure that all the members of this House who have knowledge of the difficulties that are encountered in <Col N="1123" /> trying to make the best of an appeal case will agree that the oral hearing provision is a distinct improvement on the procedure in the past which, by and large, involved all written submissions.</P>
    <P>The Minister is charged in this Bill with administering the planning law. Part of this duty is to ensure that the planning authorities, as distinct from the individual owners, will prepare their development plans and that they will decide on applications for development as they come up.  The Minister also has the duty of determining appeals from decisions of the planning authorities.  Again, might I emphasise, the Minister is not determining or interpreting law in regard to those functions put on him by the legislation.</P>
    <P>Decisions made by planning authorities on application for planning permission are not isolated occurrences like offences which are normally dealt with by the criminal courts or which come up by way of civil actions in the district courts.  Each of these cases involves an isolated occurrence which has no direct relation to a pattern of behaviour or administration.  Decisions made by planning authorities under their planning powers must form part of a pattern and must accord with the policy of the planning authorities. There is, therefore, an immediate distinction between what is dealt with in the courts and what we propose to have dealt with by way of appeal to a Minister of State, in this case, planning appeals which must conform to the pattern or policy of a planning authority.  Unless the courts are aware of this policy and of the administrative pattern, they cannot be the most appropriate authority to determine whether particular planning decisions should or should not be upheld.</P>
    <P>The criticism of injuring an individual is not the ultimate criterion.  In general, the common good, the development plan and the objectives which the planning authority have set themselves to achieve are the proper criteria.  The Minister is in a position to determine whether the injury which a planning decision would involve for an individual would be out-weighed <Col N="1124" /> by the injury to the community or the loss to the community by a particular objective not being achieved.  He must also consider the question as to whether or not money would be available to compensate for a decision adverse to private interest.  A court could not investigate such a question.  These are administrative matters which are best dealt with by administrative machinery.</P>
    <P>Where an individual is injured by a decision, provision is made in appropriate cases for compensation.  I would like to illustrate the meaning of what I am saying by reference to a typical appeal.  For example, the developer proposes to erect a structure which would obstruct an important view or scenery which is of special attraction or interest, or would impede the future widening or a road, or would obstruct the creation of a public right-of-way to the seashore, or would obstruct the proper layout of an industrial estate. These are matters which are appropriate for decision in the first instance by the planning authority and by the Minister on appeal in relation to planning policy.  I would like to emphasise that the planning authority in deciding applications for permission and the Minister in deciding appeals cannot do so in an arbitrary fashion.  They are bound by specific restrictions in the Bill.  I should also like to emphasise that the planning authority in deciding on a planning application must give reasons for their decision.  The Minister also in deciding appeals must give his reasons for his decision.  Where the reasons given for decisions are considered to be outside the scope or authority of the Act, it is open to any person aggrieved to appeal to the Courts, that is, to seek a declaration from the Court that the decision is <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>Therefore the court does remain as the protector of the interests of the aggrieved parties in all phases of this measure.  The fact that the appeals are in an administrative way dealt with by the Minister does not take away from the fact that the Courts are still there as the final arbiter in matters of the interpretation of the law and to keep all of us from going outside the law in any decision that <Col N="1125" /> may be arrived at whether by the local authorities on an ordinary application or by the Minister on appeal from the decision of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that there will under the Bill be so many appeals that the Minister will not be able to deal with each appeal personally and that the widow or any poor person will not get the same consideration as the larger concerns.  I would like to assure the House that as I indicated in my opening statement on the Bill every appeal gets my personal attention and that an appeal in the terms of the simplest letter gets the same attention as appeals involving major issues and bigger concerns.  I can give that assurance and I am certain that whoever will occupy the position of Minister for Local Government will act in the same manner if this measure becomes law.</P>
    <P>Another allegation was made by Deputy Donegan that the Minister will tend to uphold the decisions of the planning authorities because of what is called &ldquo;collusion&rdquo; or &ldquo;cohesion.&rdquo; A number of Deputies who spoke after him did not agree with him.  I deprecate that suggestion that there is collusion of cohesion between the officials of the central department and the local department which would lead to a wrong decision.  It is an interesting fact that even at the moment one-third of the appeals before the Department of Local Government under our present law have been upheld.  In other words the local authorities have been held to be wrong in their original decisions in one-third of all the cases that have come to us on appeal.  That is a fairly good indication to the Deputy and to the House that collusion does not exist and that if any such collusion did exist it certainly has not been influencing the decisions of the Ministers for Local Government down through the years.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to emphasise in relation to appeals is that no new principles are being introduced in this Bill.  The local government code and indeed many other Acts involving the individual provide for appeals to Ministers.  For instance, <Col N="1126" /> in the case of land acquisition proposals, an appeal lies to the Minister from any person who objects to the acquisition of his property by a local authority.  An appeal lies to the courts on questions of law and the same will apply in relation to planning matters, with which we are concerned in this measure.  There are many other instances also where appeals lie to the Minister and not the courts, except, again, on questions of law.  That principle is preserved right down through all the situations where there are appeals to the Minister on various matters.  In the last analysis, if there is a point of law or a question of law, subsequent to the appeal to the Minister, there is an appeal to the courts for determination of the law.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated in my Second Reading statement, the cost of appeals should be kept to a minimum from the point of view of the individual, the taxpayer and the ratepayer. It is my desire that the system of dealing with appeals should be as simple and inexpensive as possible, consistent with the fullest consideration being given to every individual case.  I should again emphasise that I do not envisage a battery of senior counsel, junior counsel and solicitors being employed, or that it would be necessary to employ them, on every case that comes for oral hearing, which these hearings will be in the future.</P>
    <P>If it so happens that one party to some disputed decision which is on appeal is in circumstances which enables him to employ such people to put his protestations for him, and to outline his case, and make the best possible case for him, and there is someone else, an aggrieved party with the opposite view who has not got the wherewithal, and cannot afford any such luxury of professional people to represent him and make his case, I can assure the House that due note will be taken of the fact that that person is appearing unaided, as it were.  The side which may not be very well equipped with legal, architectural, engineering, professional, or what you will aid, will not lose the appeal and their interests in the appeal will not be overshadowed or <Col N="1127" /> overlooked by way of argument, because that argument was made and presented by professional people in a better way than the way in which a poor person might be able to present his case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones and other Deputies took particular exception to the provisions of certain enforcement sections where the phrase &ldquo;any other material considerations&rdquo; occurs.  I am examining this matter and I can say that I will do my best to try to meet the points made by the Deputies who raised them.  Again, Deputy Jones, and I think also Deputy Tully, referred to the cost of planning, and expressed the hope that it will not be too great.  That is the hope of all of us.  At the same time, as I indicated in my Second Reading statement, what is important is to ensure that what is done is done well.  It is not merely the cost that must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I should say that the planning authorities are not obliged by this Bill to go further than the circumstances of their finances will allow.  I hope some of them do not read that too literally and decide that their finances do not allow them to go anywhere.  I do not think we would go that far with them but, by and large, it will be taken in a reasonable way. That is what the position will be.  It is not intended that we should be unreasonable in trying to get done what it is not possible to do financially or otherwise, but, at the same time, we are not likely to stand aside quietly and acquiesce in complete inactivity on the part of any local authority or planning authority which alleges that it cannot do anything because of the financial position it might find itself in.  There is a remedy for a local authority which has reached that stage.</P>
    <P>In contrast to that, Deputy Barry expressed a fear that there might be an inclination to be too niggardly.  He mentioned cheeseparing.  I hope that cheeseparing will not be allowed to obscure the need for proper planning. I sincerely hope it will not.  I join with Deputy Barry in expressing that sentiment <Col N="1128" /> in regard to this very important matter.</P>
    <P>In considering the question of cost, the local authorities should remember that the losses result from bad lay-out of areas and streets, and disposition of structures of various types.  The waste of time, effort and money which can be attributable to road traffic congestion, underdevelopment of valuable land, particularly in the business and commercial quarters of central urban areas, lengthy and unsatisfactory lines of services and communications, is quite considerable and the saving which can result from the avoidance of those conditions and from the efficient functioning of towns and cities should be properly taken into account when assessing the cost of planning.</P>
    <P>If we couple with that what I have already said, that we must see to it that what is done is well done, a huge saving from the national point of view and the local authority point of view can result from proper planning.  If we take all that into account, we will find that what may appear to be a large sum that could be attributed to planning, as such, is not really so large, and that in fact what it will give by way of better functioning to the entire community services will far outweigh the amount that might have to be put up at the initial stages to bring about the better planned community we all hope for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the position of local representatives.  I must say that I am in considerable agreement with the Deputy's views on this matter.  I think it is very important that local representatives should be aware of their powers under this Bill. The making of development plan is a reserved function and other activities in the Bill are also specifically reserved to the elected representatives.  Quite apart from these specific provisions, it is, of course, open to the elected representatives to exercise their powers under the County Management Acts. They can, for instance, require a manager to keep them informed of any executive decisions which he proposes to take.  Not very many local authorities, I think, have so required their <Col N="1129" /> manager to my knowledge.  They may also require the manager to give any information they wish to have in regard to any executive function performed, or to be performed, by him and they can requisition the manager to exercise a function or to refrain from exercising a function.</P>
    <P>Taking those safeguards in the existing law into consideration, and the reserved functions that have been and will be given to the local authorities in this context, there is no fear&mdash;at least, I have no fear&mdash;that the elected representatives will be left out of these matters and overlooked, or that their powers will be in any way lessened or taken from them.  In fact, if I had any such fear, I would go to any lengths to ensure that such did not come about.  I am satisfied, however, that with the provisions in this Bill, plus the safeguards that already exist, such will not be the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry, Deputy Tully and Deputy Gallagher referred to the amenity problems which exist and the need for powers to control developments which disfigure the seaside or other scenic areas.  I hope that these powers will be exercised in the interests not alone of the tourists but of our own citizens as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan went to some lengths to make a case for allowing landowners to permit the erection of hoardings, provided that good scenery or views were not affected.  If Deputy Donegan had taken a second, and even a third, look at the Bill, he would have seen that it provides specifically that in dealing with applications for planning permission, which, of course, would include applications for permission to erect advertisement hoardings, the planning authority is restricted to considering certain specific matters.  Similarly, the Minister, if there is an appeal from a decision of the planning authority, is restricted also to considering certain matters. There is no foundation whatever for the view that developments which are not obnoxious and do not offend the provisions of the Bill with regard to amenity will be automatically refused permission.  That was, I think, the note he struck; certain things would be <Col N="1130" /> wiped out by virtue of the passage of this Bill, without any consideration being given to the merits of any individual case.  That is not so.  From the general tenor of the debate, I think Deputies generally recognise that advertising hoardings can be a source of disfigurement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is particularly true in relation to our scenic areas. I want it to be quite clear that I shall not shoot down these hoardings as if they were sitting ducks.  Every case will be considered on its merits.  Some of them have merit.  Unfortunately, too many hoardings have been erected which result only in disfigurement, particularly in these scenic areas to which I have referred.  It is the indiscriminate and widespread advertising hoardings we want to control, and these will be controlled under this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outdoor advertising is, of course, a form of commercial activity of long standing.  It is not something new, but there is certainly a great deal more of it today than there was in the past.  Such advertising can add life and colour to townscapes.  This is particularly true if illuminated advertising at night.  Planning seeks to secure that outdoor advertisements are not placed indiscriminately but are well designed and well located.  Those engaged in the advertising industry are generally in agreement that there should be control and that there should be enforcement of that control.  They welcome these provisions, even though they may in some cases weigh heavily upon those concerned.  They agree with us that advertising hoardings, if properly designed, can enhance a vista or, in some cases, not do very much damage to the scene.  They also agree that badly-kept, badly designed, and badly-placed hoardings can be the ruination of some of our best scenic vistas.  I believe we shall have the full co-operation of those engaged in this business.  That co-operation will naturally make our job, whether at local authority or ministerial level, so much easier; the easier it is made, the better <Col N="1131" /> the job will be done in the interests of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully and Deputy Crinion referred to the problem of badly-kept hoardings.  The Department and the various local authorities recognise that this is a problem and specific provisions are made in the Bill to require badly-kept hoardings to be tidied up and put into good repair.  This should solve the problem of some of the worst of these hoardings at the moment.  They will either disappear altogether or be put into proper order.</P>
    <P>I should like at this stage to thank the various bodies, associations and individuals who sent in comments on the Bill.  All the suggestions I have received from these public-spirited citizens are being considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett objected to the powers contained in the Bill which enable the Minister to require the planning authority to vary a plan.  The Deputy, I think, misunderstands the provisions.  The purpose of the provisions stems from the fact that the Minister will not formally approve the development plans.  Since he will not formally approve, the question might be asked as to how then any degree of national uniformity will be achieved as between the various planning authorities.  It is an order to achieve uniformity that the power to vary is being inserted in the Bill, so that plans can be brought into line by the Minister, who, while not approving in a formal way, will look through the plans and, if he finds something sticking out like a sore thumb as between one planning authority and another, he can ask the local authority concerned to vary the plan and bring it into line.  Where uniformity will be of the essence is in the matter of regional or national planning.  We shall have to have regard in this particular to arterial roads, water and sewerage schemes, the regional planning of industry, amenity area orders, national planning, and so on.  If the Minister did not have power to vary, such uniformity as we all desire would not be possible at all.</P>

      <P>When this debate was adjourned on last Wednesday night, I was dealing with the E1 Dorado promised to the farming community as a result of full membership of EEC being made available to this country.  The reason I was dealing with that particular matter was that the small farmer in Ireland has not a clue as to what is in store for him, if the Government's application for full membership is accepted at some stage.  The proof of the situation as far as farmers of this country are concerned was contained in the long speech made by the Taoiseach yesterday in which he stated that the six countries which comprise the Common Market are self-sufficient in all kinds of agricultural production, with the exception of beef.</P>
      <P>His words bear out what I have said that although the door might open to the Irish farmer for dairy and milk products, for bacon and bacon products, the rooms inside are filled.  It is little consolation for the Irish farmer to be told that he is free to get in and that he will get the same rates as anyone else in Europe when we know that the demand in Europe is fully filled and that the big difficulty facing EEC is over-production of agricultural produce.  They have no way out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they want to restrict production, the best the Irish farmer can get is a quota system into Europe.  If they are insistent on reducing production in <Col N="1133" /> Europe, it means that a number of farmers will have to go out of business in Europe.  At the moment provision is being made to remove over eight million people from agriculture.  A committee of the Council of Europe is making the necessary arrangements whereby eight million people will be put out of agriculture.  I think that fact should be made known to the small farmer in Ireland so as to allow him to make a decision as to whether or not he would be in favour of full membership.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Taoiseach stated that beef is the only line in which there is a possibility of an attractive proposition for the Irish farmer in Europe and it is even more significant that the element in the Irish farming community who support the Government are the rancher element.  The spokesmen for the rancher element at every dinner are full of enthusiasm for entry to the Common Market.  We know they do not represent the small farmer and it is a disgraceful position that these alleged spokesmen for the farming community are being accepted as the spokesmen of the small farmers.  We know that if the small farmers are turned to the production of beef, there is no possibility of their survival in this country.</P>
    <P>I believe that a referendum is absolutely essential on this issue of the Common Market, particularly in the light of the Taoiseach's statement that our application for full membership stands.  This is the biggest issue facing the Irish farmer since the foundation of the State.  They have been kept ignorant of the real significance of what full membership of the Common Market means.  The Press, radio, television, political commentators and so-called economic experts have all taken the one line that the Common Market is ideal and essential for this nation. Having taken that line, it is quite apparent that the ordinary man in the street, the businessman, the small farmer, the factory worker and the small shopkeeper are getting only one side of this picture.  They cannot have the time or the means at their disposal to examine into what could be <Col N="1134" /> the alternative picture to what has been painted by these enthusiastic spokesmen.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this vital issue is one that should be decided by this House.  I do not believe that the issue of handing over the sovereignty of the State to an outside body, over whose actions and decisions this Government will be unable to exercise the slightest influence, is a matter that should be dealt with by &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; and &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; in this House.  I do not think it is right that this House should decide this matter without a referendum on giving up our independence and our proud position in the United Nations as a small nation speaking independently.</P>
    <P>I do not think this House should be in a position to decide, without consulting the people, that the Irish farmer's right to the ownership of his land should be taken from him in so far as the foreigner would have the same rights to live here and buy Irish land and work it.  I do not think it is right for this House to make a decision that would undoubtedly sound the deathknell of the small farmer.  I do not think this House is entitled on its own to make a decision that would possibly lead to 100,000 workers in Ireland losing their jobs.  On the one side, we have people like the economist who writes on behalf of the Government and speaks, too, often on Radio Eireann telling us that there will be a certain amount of unemployment, but we also have people who, in my opinion, are equally expert and equally well equipped to speak on this matter.</P>
    <P>I want to quote what Mr. Crotty, University of Wales Department of Agricultural Economics, had to say on 21st September in that regard.  He said:</P>
    <P>A decline in employment in the primary industries, agricultural and manufacturing, will give rise to further unemployment in the secondary industries such as building, transport etc. </P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>An estimate of 100,000 redundant workers following the removal of protection does not seem at all too high. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> I do not propose to go into details on this, but I want to make clear the reason why we believe a referendum is necessary.  The livelihood of perhaps 70,000 to 100,000 people &mdash; and I believe 100,000 is the more correct figure &mdash; will be jeopardised.  Those people are entitled to be consulted on a matter that affects their livelihoods. This House is not entitled, without consulting the public, to take on the full commitments that we have promised to take on in political and defence matters.  The promise has been made without any reservations by the Taoiseach in his application for membership of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this House is entitled to reverse a decision taken 30 years ago that this country would pursue a policy of neutrality and stay out of warlike combinations.  I do not think that reversal should be carried out before the people have been consulted through a referendum.  We have a decision stated by the Taoiseach that we will accept the full political and defence commitments, and yet in this country we have undoubtedly a very strong opposition to the idea of doing away with neutrality.  Are they to be allowed in any shape or form to make their views felt to have a proper decision made on what they think about that decision?</P>
    <P>We have the Trade Union Congress last July making it quite clear in a resolution unanimously adopted, that the country's stand in the United Nations must be continued and that we must have no part in political or defence <i>blocs</i> in Europe or elsewhere. Without bringing him into the political field at all, we have even the President who in November last said in Galway that neutrality is the policy of the Irish people and that it is a precious policy.  They are not my words; they are a quotation from what Mr. de Valera said in Galway last November.</P>
    <P>We have Deputy Aiken on record at least three times in the past two years condemning <i>blocs</i> or defence commitments and pointing out that Ireland's place in the United Nations was an independent one, that she was <Col N="1136" /> not a member of any warlike group or any defence <i>bloc</i>, and that he felt that it would be disastrous for Ireland to be a part of any such <i>bloc.</i></P>
    <P>That viewpoint is there.  How is it going to be felt?  Are the people who feel so strongly on this not to be allowed to exercise their rights to give their assent or otherwise on a matter of this importance?  I believe that the workers of Ireland will be against the idea of full membership when they realise its implications to them and their families, and I want to make it clear that they do not now realise those implications.  I also believe that the people I have referred to, the small farmer and the worker in rural Ireland, will be opposed to the idea of full membership when the true implications of that membership are made known to them.</P>
    <P>I want to say that a deliberate campaign has been initiated and pursued by the Government to hoodwink the public as to the true implications of membership of the Common Market. We had the Minister for Lands flying kites in Kerry and Mayo on neutrality, and we had the Taoiseach coming into the Dáil the following week shooting down the balloons that were flown or blown up by the Minister. Weeks afterwards, we had the Taoiseach himself going abroad and stating quite clearly that we were prepared to accept the full implications of membership.</P>
    <P>Briefly, I would like to put this on record, and this is not what I or somebody of my point of view said. These are three of the quotations from a daily paper which is in no way friendly disposed towards the views of Deputy Dr. Noel Browne and myself. This is what it has to say on the Taoiseach's conduct in its leading articles.</P>
    <P>On January 19th, 1962, under the heading &ldquo;Into Europe&rdquo;, it said:</P>
    <P>The entire opening section of his speech was given over to declaring how European this country is.  An Taoiseach said without qualification: &ldquo;I desire to emphasise that the political aims of the Community are aims to which the Irish Government <Col N="1137" /> and people are ready to subscribe and in the realisation of which they wish to play an active part.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The leader goes on to say:</P>
    <P>As far as the people are concerned, this is hardly the truth.  How many people in the country have any inkling of what the political aims of EEC are?  How much has the Government done to enlighten us in any detail? </P>
    <P>It went on to say this:</P>
    <P>It is essential that the full implications of the Taoiseach's line are put before the people.  The foreign and defence policies which the people have supported deserve better treatment than to be dumped without ceremony. </P>
    <P>That was last January.  Then in October, 1962 they quoted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. MacCarthy) Acting Chairman (Mr. MacCarthy)">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 31st October, 1962.  Referring to the Taoiseach's conduct in the Dáil, it said :&mdash;</P>
      <P>On defence he tells us nothing has been demanded; he says in Germany we are ready for anything. We must not waste time speculating on what will happen if Britain does not enter, he cautions here; to a foreign audience he suggests we will seek a way to pursue our application in any event. </P>
      <P>Then it went on to say :&mdash;</P>
      <P>Irishmen, North or South, will not long tolerate being treated as children, being told to keep their place and not to shout, and not to ask questions.  Democracy does not automatically accept that Prime Ministers know best. </P>
      <P>Finally, the <i>Irish Independent</i> on November 3rd, 1962, in a leading article headed &ldquo;Clear the air&rdquo; says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> Let there be no mistake about it. The official policy of our Government is that Ireland is willing and ready to take part in the military defence of the West.  It is also Government policy that Ireland is prepared to enter a formal military alliance, a course that no Government has followed since 1937. </P>
    <P>And then it says :&mdash;</P>
    <P>For some reason the Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, shrinks from telling us what he tells our friends in Europe. </P>
    <P>Further on, it says :&mdash;</P>
    <P>Taking part in a Western military alliance will mean that Irish troops will be directly involved in plans to deter any Soviet aggression.  It will mean that Ireland turns from being well disposed towards the West's cause to being actively engaged in protecting it. </P>
    <P>It also says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Likewise, it should involve the end of any military service under the United Nations, since, as Mr. Aiken pointed out last year, only nations free from alliances are likely to be acceptable at present. </P>
    <P>It finishes by saying that if the Government are not prepared to lead, then they should refrain from attempts to confuse.  Those are quotations from the newspaper supported by the Party which also supports our entry into the Common Market.  They have put the view that the full implications are not known to the public.  I, and the group to which I belong, maintain that the public have not got a clue about the full implications.  In those circumstances, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the only way to make the full facts known to the public is through a referendum.  I second the motion and I hope the House will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to make a couple of points.  Deputies Dr. Browne and McQuillan have dealt with many matters but, to my mind, they never really came to the motion itself, or to the case for it.  Both Deputies dealt with the relative merits of full membership <Col N="1139" /> and association, with our general economic development, and many related matters of this sort, but they did not at any time come to the specific case for the motion or attempt to establish any such case.  The reason why they did not do so, and why they spoke at length about so many other matters is that in fact there is no real case for the motion as such.</P>
      <P>This is a representative parliamentary democracy where government is vested by the people in their elected representatives in this Oireachtas and in the Government elected by this Oireachtas.  We have not got in this country any system of direct government, either executive or legislative, by the people by means of a referendum and our whole parliamentary structure is designed to avoid the necessity for such a cumbersome and expensive procedure.  The constitutional position in this regard is quite clear.  The Government are specifically authorised under the Constitution to make treaties.</P>
      <P>All such treaties must be laid before this House, unless they are of a technical nature.  There is an obligation on the Government to lay these treaties before this House so that the House may have an opportunity of discussing them.  If the treaty involved does not bring any corresponding change in our domestic law, then that is the end of the matter.  However, if the situation is that the treaty involves some change in our domestic law, then that change can be made only to the extent authorised by this Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas is the legislative body, the law-making institution and it must come into the picture if a treaty involves changing our domestic law and it must legislate to give effect to those changes.  Otherwise this Dáil has only the function of discussing a particular treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution does not contemplate or envisage in a case of this sort, our adhering to a treaty like the Treaty of Rome, or any of the associated treaties, that the matter should be brought before the people by means of a referendum.  In fact, the exact opposite is the position.  The Constitution <Col N="1140" /> clearly contemplates that the making of such a treaty is a matter entirely for the Government and the Oireachtas, in accordance with the procedure laid down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan however might say: &ldquo;Very well; if it is clear that there is no constitutional obligation on the Government to refer this matter to the people by means of a referendum, there is at least a political obligation.&rdquo; They might conceivably advance the argument that the Government have no political mandate to proceed to have this country adhere to the Treaty of Rome.  The answer to that argument is also quite clear.</P>
    <P>During the last general election campaign, the Taoiseach and most of the Ministers of the Government made it absolutely clear that it was the Government's intention, if re-elected to office, to pursue our application for full membership of the European Economic Community as vigorously and as actively as possible.  Our application for full membership was lodged in Brussels two months before the last general election and everybody in the country was aware of the fact that as far as the Fianna Fáil Party were concerned they were committed to apply for full membership of the European Economic Community.  In practically every speech which the Taoiseach made during the course of that campaign, he adverted to that fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>But he did not say what the implications were.  He told them it was an E1 Dorado.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty of Rome was published for everybody to see and read and in many speeches during the course of the general election campaign, he adverted not alone to the fact of our application but also to the difficulties that our adherence to the European Economic Community would bring in its train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there was not a copy of the Rome Treaty available in this House for two years after its coming into <Col N="1141" /> operation?  How does he expect the ordinary man in the street to know about the Treaty of Rome and the 400 pages it contains, with 380 emergency escapes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan made a very long speech without a single interruption from me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment I am merely making it as clear as I can that during the course of the last general election, when this Party who now from the Government were seeking election, they went out on the hustings before the people and indicated clearly time and again that it was their policy to bring this country into the European Economic Community as a full member if possible.  Not only that, but time and again during the course of that campaign, Government speakers adverted to the difficulties which would arise for this country in the event of our adhering to the Rome Treaty and the preparations which we must make to meet them.</P>
      <P>I quote from a speech made by the Taoiseach on 3rd October, 1961, in Cork, and the quotation is from the <i>Irish Press</i> of the following day:</P>
      <P>We have time to prepare the country for its entry to the Common Market, but I cannot tell you how long because that is one of the matters still to be negotiated.  This work has been started and it must go on. That is what makes it important in relation to this election.  The changes taking place in Europe are not something we can stop or avoid or even slow down.  All the countries of Western Europe have taken a decision to combine in an economic community in which there will be no barrier of any kind to trade. </P>
      <P>Could anything be clearer or more specific than that?  On 2nd October, 1961, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 3rd October, 1961, the Taoiseach referred to the Common Market again, at a Fianna Fáil rally at the GPO.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a reference to the changes which would result in Europe because of <Col N="1142" /> the development of the Common Market he said that it would have advantages for this country but is would also have difficulties.  It was that situation which made the present election exceptional. </P>
    <P>I want to establish that there can be no argument about the Government's mandate to bring this country into the EEC without a referendum, whatever arguments may be put forward about the relative merits of full or associate membership or about how membership of the Community will affect our general economic development and so on.  Our Constitution does not contemplate a referendum in matters of this sort and in so far as this Government require a political mandate, they received it clearly and definitely at the last general election.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should make it clear at this stage&mdash;it is not really relevant but it may be of interest&mdash;that it is fairly likely if we were to adhere to the Treaty of Rome and the subsidiary treaties, then some amendment of our Constitution of a technical nature might be required to enable us to meet specific obligations.  That, of course, could only be achieved, first of all, by a Bill introduced here, and subsequently by a referendum.  However, that is not what is at issue here in this motion.  The Deputies challenge the decision to join at all and the right of the Government to proceed with our application for full membership without referring the question to the people by a referendum.  My argument is that there is no basis, either constitutionally or politically, for such a contention and I ask the House to reject the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We still believe there is an excellent case for putting this issue to the people for their consideration. We are assuming that the Taoiseach intends to go ahead and look for full membership and we feel equally sure that this probably will not arise&mdash;we do not think we will be accepted for full membership.  We must, however, pursue the motion because the Taoiseach has refused to face the realities of the present situation and declares that he intends to go ahead with the idea of full membership. <Col N="1143" /> We think this issue should be put to the public for their consideration, to make their decision.</P>
      <P>I do not know why a society such as ours, a relatively young society in self-government, over the years should always consider itself bound by a particular precedent in any particular set of circumstances.  God knows, most of us accept now that times have changed in recent years and we are now faced with this very far-reaching decision.  I do not see any reason at all why the Government should not take the view that in these special circumstances, special consideration should be given to it.  Fortunately, under our Constitution, there is the machinery of referendum.  I do not think the Minister or the Taoiseach should allow himself to be bound by precedents, since a referendum would be an efficient way of finding out how the people feel about this issue.  The referendum should be accepted as special machinery to decide a special occasion.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Minister can seriously suggest that in an issue like this, about which all of us on both sides of the House, including the Taoiseach and I suspect, the Minister for Justice, are in a considerable state of ignorance as to the true implications of this proposition, it is possible to test public opinion through a general election.  Even the Taoiseach, who is the best informed of us all, has only limited knowledge of the true implications of this situation. Surely, in those very special circumstances, it would be wise for the Government to take the view that we should have a national debate on this specific issue as soon as we know where we are, and as soon as we best can find out what the true implications will be for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot seriously suggest that it was possible to find out the feelings of the people through the machinery of a general election.  I do not really believe he believes that.  If he has a choice of trying to find out what people think about, say, public ownership or free health services or better education services, on the one hand, by putting these as specific <Col N="1144" /> issues to the public in subsequent referenda, or taking three, four or five of them altogether and going to the public saying: &ldquo;That is a collection of items I want your views on&rdquo;, does he think he would get a truer reflection of public opinion by going with the mixed bag to them or going to them with a specific issue?  Surely the Minister would agree the decision he would get after a national debate would be a much sounder decision than one taken on six or seven issues which are normally involved in the process of a general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we should have a referendum on every issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>To achieve perfection, the Minister is probably correct.  It seems to us that in order to try to get the truest index on public opinion on this desperately important issues&mdash;we can make mistakes about agriculture, health and social services but there is always an opportunity of improving them or putting out the Government responsible for them&mdash;we must put it to the people by way of referendum.  It has side implications of such far-reaching importance that it is not one that should be taken anyway hastily.</P>
      <P>One of the cases which the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition have often made is for the sacrosanctity of the whole idea of democracy.  I agree with him in that, although I think its chances of survival as we know it are negligible.  However, generally speaking, one does hear much talk on all sides of the House about the democratic idea, public opinion, the public decision.  One of the main objects of going into the EEC was supposed to be to try to preserve the democratic idea in Europe. Charity begins at home; so does democracy.  We could start at home in implementing this democratic idea.  We should trust the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all due respect to the Minister for Justice and the other members of the Government, there is very little doubt that this decision was taken by the Taoiseach.  If we extend it to the other Ministers and say they had some say in it and agreed with it, we may say essentially they are imposing this <Col N="1145" /> decision on the public in so far as they have taken the decision without referring to the public in any specific way about the issue.  As someone once said: &ldquo;When I want to know how the Irish people are thinking, I look into my own heart.&rdquo; The Taoiseach has tended to follow that philosophy and used it in this instance.</P>
    <P>Surely that is the essence of democratic centralism in which the Communists believe and to which we are so strongly opposed.  We believe the public to be their own masters, that we do not know better than they, that they have a right to decide on vital issues that concern them, and that we are not a sort of aristocratic ruling class who must decide these issues because we have some God-given right which they have not got and which allows us to come to the right decision without making a mistake.</P>
    <P>The fallacy of that proposition of the infallibility of the Taoiseach or his Ministers was never more emphasised than during the past 18 months in which the Taoiseach has made numerous categorical statements which have since proved to be completely erroneous.  I know any human being can be wrong.  I cannot blame him for being wrong but I am blaming him for thinking he cannot be wrong.  It is apparently the general over-all feeling he is beginning to have about himself, even having made many mistakes and misjudgments of the position.  The really sad part is that he is not prepared to accept the fact or, having accepted it, to act on it, that is, to be more cautious in the future and in order to be certain that he is not wrong in this instance, to put the matter to the country in the form of a national debate and then abide by the decision of the people.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is so certain the people are on his side in his decision, then he has nothing to fear.  The public will give him the referendum and he will then be able to go ahead with ratifying the Treaty.  This is such an exceptional circumstance that the desirability of using the referendum in order to find out public opinion is one which should be seriously considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> There is another consideration.  As the Minister said, we presumably will have to have a referendum in order to alter the Constitution and to establish the right of the Brussels courts to override decisions in our Supreme Court, whatever the formula is.  That being so, we intend to have what the Minister describes as the costly and cumbersome paraphernalia of a referendum. What is the objection to extending the referendum and getting public opinion at that time on this very important issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you not need two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, if that is so. I do not know but it probably would be wiser.  It might be rather complicated but very recently, at the time of the Presidential election, there was one in relation to our electoral law which was rather complicated and the people handled it extraordinarily intelligently, although I would not expect the Minister to agree with me on that.  It is possible for the Government to hold a referendum on these two points.</P>
      <P>Have the Government given any consideration to what would happen if, on holding a referendum about our subscribing to the Treaty of Rome and about altering the Constitution to give these powers to the Brussels courts, it went against the Government?  What would they do then?  Surely they would have to go back on the Treaty of Rome.  Facing a referendum on the Treaty of Rome, surely those of us who opposed the idea of going into the Common Market as full members and abandoning our neutrality as a corollary, would be tempted to use the referendum as a vote of confidence in the decision to go into the EEC as full members, would try to get it reversed and would try to get a decision against accepting this amendment of the Constitution for the convenience of the courts.  I think we would be justified in taking that stand as the only one left to us by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may think that savours of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> on our part, that the two of us might go out on a national campaign in this regard.  We are quite capable of doing that, but <Col N="1147" /> at the same time, as far as we know, we would be sure of having fairly considerable support from the trade union movement, that is if they adhere to the meaning of the motion passed by them in the middle of last year, that they do not want any departure from the military position we now occupy, which simply involves our commitments in UNO.</P>
    <P>Will the Government not find themselves fighting this referendum on a relatively unimportant issue because the question of the courts, from the point of view of the public, is a relatively unimportant issue?  Will they not find themselves fighting this issue as a vote of confidence on the decision to sign the Treaty of Rome?  In that way, the issue will be confused, and deliberately confused, and in that way they might find themselves&mdash;I do not know what they will have to do&mdash;trying to get out of the Treaty of Rome. The Taoiseach says you cannot get out of it but he may find himself with no alternative but to repudiate the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Surely in order to try to prevent that position arising, it would be much wiser for the Government to decide to take the two issues to enable the people to say: &ldquo;We believe you are wrong; we believe you are misinformed.&rdquo; That would be the first question and the second would then be the authority to amend the Constitution.  The Minister said it would mean two issues on the referendum card, but that certainly would not be as complicated as the nostrum with which he supplies us, the last general election in which we were talking about all sorts of things: unemployment, emigration, agricultural policy, health policy, social welfare policy, education, the failure of one group and the success of another group, and a thousand and one things.  Buried deep in that was the whole idea of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Taoiseach would seriously suggest that he got a clear national debate on the question of the Common Market during the last election. I can support that view without any real difficulty at all.  If one goes through the various comments by the <Col N="1148" /> different Ministers and ex-Ministers, it is quite remarkable to see the amount of misinformation they seem to have got hold of about the Common Market. I do not pretend to be better informed than anyone else about the EEC.  I merely say that I am as ill-informed as many other Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition made the point that we had to take full membership because if we became associate members, ultimately we must become full members.  He was quite wrong in that.  The Leader of a large Party should not be wrong on such an important issue but he was wrong on it.  The Taoiseach made a number of confusing statements.  He may not have had all the facts at his disposal but he certainly created great confusion in the minds of many of us.  At column 890, Volume 195, of the Official Report, I asked the Taoiseach would membership not lead to our having to make military commitments?  The Taoiseach replied:</P>
    <P>We have applied to accede to the Treaty of Rome.  That is the only application that we have made and it is the only matter on which negotiations are proceeding. </P>
    <P>On another occasion, Deputy Norton asked whether there was any obligation on us to enter into a military agreement as a condition of our entering the Common Market and the Taoiseach said that there were no commitments of that kind in the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>On the military side, clearly there is great confusion and uncertainty about it and, of course, there is still the political side.  At column 457, Volume 195, of the Official Report, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The political implications of membership of the Community are in an entirely different category, as they are nowhere precisely defined and are, indeed, still the subject of negotiations among the Six. </P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan asked what the political and defence commitments might be and the Taoiseach replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>This country is negotiating for <Col N="1149" /> membership of the European Economic Community, and that is all. </P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan asked what were the defence and political implications and the Taoiseach replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We are negotiating for accession to the Rome Treaty. </P>
    <P>The main thing I want to try to show is that this is a particularly confusing issue.  It is an issue about which there is a lot of genuine confusion in the minds of people who have discussed it, including the Taoiseach.  In his statement to the <i>New York Times,</i> repeated at Brussels, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We are prepared to go into an integrated union without any reservations at all as to how far this will take us in the field of foreign policy or defence commitments. </P>
    <P>I asked him was he prepared to have nuclear bases in this country and he said: &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister must agree that it is difficult to reconcile all these conflicting points of view or decisions put forward by the Taoiseach.  How can you accept without any reservations at all in this day and age defence commitments, without implicitly committing yourself to the positioning of military establishments, air forces, nuclear bases, Polaris bases, or what is the most modern thing?  Does the Minister seriously suggest that the EEC with all its implications was discussed, debated, considered and voted upon by the public at the last general election?  Surely no one can seriously put that view forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan gave the statement made by the President.  He clearly is very confused about the position and indeed his statement about the necessity of retaining our neutrality raises a point which might be of interest to lawyers.  Does he not have to sign the laws which are passed here in order to make them binding?  What would be the position if he conscientiously believed that we should not, as he said, abandon our neutrality but should retain our present neutral position and not allow <Col N="1150" /> the country to be used as a military base and he felt morally bound to refuse to sign the Bill?</P>

      <P>However, as I say, this is a position in which there is a great deal of confusion, a great deal of misinformation, a position in which most of us try to find out all we can. When I mention these names, I am not in any way criticising those who own them.  I have had my share of misunderstanding of the Treaty of Rome. But this is all the more reason, it seems to me, why the matter should be put forward finally as clearly as it can be put by the Government, on the one side, and by someone on behalf of the Opposition on the other side.  The decision is a very serious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that he has seen no indication of any public anxiety as to the possible effect on our foreign policy of full membership of EEC.  At the same time, he does not appear to be prepared to ask the public what their views are.  I wonder do the public know all the implications of the Taoiseach's statement about accepting &ldquo;without any reservation as to how far it would take us in the field of foreign policy and defence commitments&rdquo;.  That could easily mean accepting nuclear warheads here. As a result of the course of events in Canada, we can see now a reasonable possibility becoming a more than likely probability with the present trend on the part of General de Gaulle pushing the Americans out of Europe. The Americans may now be looking for alternative positions.  The decision <Col N="1151" /> could well be a very serious one.  It is a decision upon which the public so far have not been asked to comment.</P>
    <P>All this conflicts with the Government's policy over the years at the United Nations.  That policy was ratified by the people at the general election.  They accepted it.  They accepted our policy of neutrality.  I think the Minister will concede that. The general impression amongst the people was that we were uncommitted militarily, whatever about ideologies. If a decision on that was taken by the people, I think one can fairly say they favoured neutrality, the policy of non-commitment as adumbrated by the Minister for External Affairs at the United Nations.  Had the Government gone to the people and said that they had abandoned neutrality or their position of non-commitment and would enter militantly into the Cold War, does the Minister think his Party would still have got their votes?  The general line of policy of the Minister for External Affairs was to try to stop the spread of the Cold War.   His various motions in the United Nations won world support for their objectivity and their general attempt to reduce the temper giving rise to world tension.  If that were the issue put to the people at the last general election, then it can be fairly said, I think, that the Government got support for that view.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs also put down a number of motions designed to restrict the spread of nuclear warheads.  I think the people ratified his behaviour in that regard in the last general election.  This new decision by the Government is a complete reversal of their earlier decision. The Government are the supreme authority.  They make the decisions, but they should not try to pretend that they have the people with them in these decisions.  To my knowledge, this particular issue was never put to the people during the whole of the last general election campaign, and it is wrong for the Minister to say now that this decision was ratified.</P>
    <P>Had it been put to the people, it would have been essential to point out <Col N="1152" /> to the people all the implications of it. But the implications were only really seen a few months ago when the Russians put their nuclear warheads into Cuba and, from the American point of view, altered radically the balance of power in this awful nuclear argument that is going on President Kennedy took the steps he thought justified at the time&mdash;the blockade and so on.  The blockade brought with it consequent hardship on the Cuban people, on the women, and children. They are always the victims of the policy leaders in every war.  What is to stop a similar position developing here if we suddenly proclaim we are taking in NATO or American warheads? Surely Mr. Khruschev will have the right to say that there is a precedent for taking very severe action and telling us, as President Kennedy told the Cubans: &ldquo;We will blow the world to pieces unless you get these things out&rdquo;.  What is to stop Mr. Khrushchev taking precisely the same steps, with us on the receiving end? We would find ourselves faced with a war, with President Kennedy's 200 million and Mr. Khrushchev's 500 million going to die in the course of a very short atomic war as a result of a decision we took here, a decision the Taoiseach took without any authority.</P>
    <P>We are talking now in times so complex that it is really even difficult to imagine the possibility, but the possibility is there.  It is a real possibility. That is the measure of the decision we are taking; that is the scope of the decision.  I would strongly object but naturally I would prefer that the public should know what is involved in this departure from our traditional policy.  From the point of view of the people generally, every war is fought with the weapons of the last war.  The cavalry drown in the mud of Paschendaele.  When the 1939-45 war occurred, the people had no idea of the meaning of civilian warfare. They had no idea of what bombing could do, no idea of the results of bombing.  We are quite incapable of understanding fully the implications of nuclear war.</P>
    <P>We have the example of a tiny island like ourselves involved in this appalling madmen's game of chess, <Col N="1153" /> very nearly becoming the victims of it themselves and bringing with them a great many others in the process.  For that reason in particular, we believe the Taoiseach cannot claim that he has the authority of the country behind him on this issue.  If he will not have a referendum, then let him have this general election, this very inefficient way of deciding a single issue, but at all costs the Taoiseach should refer the matter to the country.</P>
    <P>I am quite astonished at the extraordinary equanimity of all Deputies in facing this problem.  Facing the military problems puts the fear of God into me.  I am quite terrified of the possibility of any of these dreadful weapons coming near us.  We do not know what the military commitments are.  The Taoiseach has made that clear and he has made it equally clear that he does not know what the political commitments are.  How can Ministers seriously suggest that this matter was decided during the course of the last general election and authority given for it?  The Taoiseach was right to the extent that he did mention the Common Market and that there would be free trade.  He got a decision on that but not on these other matters.</P>
    <P>If de Gaulle goes ahead with his master plan for Europe, this concept of a force from the Atlantic to the Urals, with this possibility of becoming a third force between America and Russia, possibly as a mediator but essentially with an anti-American bias under which America would be hoofed out of Europe and sent back to America, is a completely different concept from the one the Taoiseach postulated here as likely.  His concept was that there would be a rigid line between East and West and that we would play our part in glaring over the East Berlin wall at the Russians. Apparently that is not the present concept at all.  There is complete unpredictability as to the future which may arise with the deaths of de Gaulle and Adenauer and the coming to the fore of completely new people.  I do not know how the Taoiseach can look to these possibilities without being very worried, and I do not know how the <Col N="1154" /> Leader of the Opposition can do so either without telling the public of these possibilities.</P>
    <P>They cannot tell the public how many people will be disemployed as a result of full membership of EEC. They cannot tell us anything about our agriculture except what the Taoiseach told us yesterday when he said that Europe is self-sufficient in everything but beef.  What is the farmer to do?  The Taoiseach cannot tell us about the new taxation system there may be or about the change in the cost of living.  The general opinion is that 40 per cent.  of our industries will go to the wall.  These are very serious considerations and ones that should be put to the public in the form of a referendum.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the public are really very concerned about the unity of Europe in which the Taoiseach says we are interested, the matter the former Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, said we would campaign for, this unification of Germany.  I do not believe the public would be anxious to take part in any campaign in Central Europe. I think the public and the Government of the day were very intelligent in not going into the last war.  They would have been mad to go into it and it was only a baby war compared with the thing we are now facing.  We were right in 1949 to refuse to go into NATO.  The present Government were right to resist the appalling and unchristian temptation to go into an attempt to wipe out the Russians in the name of Christianity.  I think that was a really blasphemous conception.  I think the Government were right to resist this temptation and to play no part, beyond the part of the non-committed or the neutral.</P>
    <P>Look at the magnificent role we have already played in the Middle East.  I think we have made some contribution to UNO.  There were serious defects in our handling of the Congo situation but we helped in some way to create an independent society there. There was a great need for a neutral in Europe.  Suppose that some plan is put into operation for the demilitarisation of Europe.  They will need non-committed troops to police that area.  We <Col N="1155" /> are no longer non-committed.  We are now committed solidly to one side and to that extent we have deprived ourselves of our former usefulness.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the people are with the Taoiseach and with the Leader of the Opposition in that but my submission is that the case has not been put to them and that it would be quite impossible to put it to them within the framework of a general election in which so many other considerations are involved.  The machinery of the referendum has been used in the past for infinitely less important issues.  I do not think the Minister seriously suggests that the cost of a particular device should be allowed to stand in the way of the efficient operation of the democratic machinery.  We think that it is worth the trouble to obtain public opinion, even if the machinery is cumbersome, which we do not think it is.</P>
    <P>Even if it is a costly way of getting the opinion of the public, I still value very highly the opinion of the public on this matter because every man, woman and child is involved in it. They are all involved and they have a right to have this decision put to them, to be treated as an adult democracy, as they are in spite of the many mistakes they make from time to time in the types of Governments they return.  Certainly in the decisions which they have had to consider in the form of referenda, particularly the one in which there were two rather complex issues, those of P.R. and the Presidential election, they behaved with remarkable astuteness and intelligence.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Government are seriously concerned with this whole idea of using the democratic machine at their disposal, they should accept our motion, and put to them the matter of full membership of EEC, should it ever become a real decision, with the questions, first of all: &ldquo;Do you believe we should go into the Common Market?&rdquo; (2) &ldquo;do you believe we should go in as associated members?&rdquo; (3) &ldquo;do you believe we should go in as full members?&rdquo; and <Col N="1156" /> a fourth question making it quite clear that going in as full members means the abandonment of our neutrality with all the consequences of the positioning of military bases, airforce establishments, military research establishments of one kind or another, and the positioning of nuclear missiles or Polaris bases in the country.  Ask them those four questions and then everybody will be quite happy to abide by their decision.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully questioned whether adequate provision would be made to enable access to be given to the seaside.  I just want to reassure him and the House that this is one of the purposes of Part 5 of the Bill.  It is my very sincere wish that our local authorities will avail of this particular provision of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton suggested that there should be a time limit on appeals, and in this regard I want to say to the House that I am not to be taken as being complacent in this matter of the time required to deal with appeals. As I indicated in my opening statement on the Second Reading, it is my intention to increase the staff dealing with appeals in my Department. Furthermore, it is my conviction that oral hearings, as provided for in the Bill, will tend to hasten decisions and in addition to that, I feel that a further speeding up will be brought about by the prescribing of forms of application <Col N="1157" /> for permission which will tend to make available all the documentation necessary at the outset, rather than as at the moment, coming in dribs and drabs.  When one party to the dispute appeals, the matter must in turn, by correspondence, be referred back to the other party for comment and this brings about interminable delay which is not avoidable.  As I say, the prescribing at the outset of forms for application will go a long way to obviate delays in future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones questioned the desirability of giving power to planning authorities having regard to what he called their bad performance in the exercise of planning powers to date. For my part, on consideration, I think that planning authorities who have adopted the Planning Acts have done a reasonably good job considering the extraordinary difficulties associated with the legislation under which they were attempting to work.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the monotony and absence of community services in relation to suburban housing schemes.  I should say that I share this view and I could not agree more with it.  I would go further and say that it is one of the aims of the Bill to ensure that housing schemes are provided with these services at the appropriate stage.  Part III of the Third Schedule to the Bill makes provision for these services and planning authorities will be obliged to have regard to these provisions where they are included in development planning.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cummins and Deputy Carroll made a plea for better and higher regard for amenity in relation to urban development.  This again is one of the objects of the Bill and in this connection I endorse the view expressed by Deputy Barry that town planning involves not alone physical planning but also mind planning.  Personally, as Deputies are aware, I have endeavoured to make a start on this matter and tried to educate myself and as many others as I could in regard to what planning means and what it can achieve.  I intend to take this matter as far as I can and to ensure that this country does not fall behind but advances <Col N="1158" /> and keeps pace with the best developments in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones referred to the repeal of portions of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, under which local authorities are empowered to make building bye-laws.  Under these bye-laws, local authorities have to approve or disapprove of plans submitted within one month.  Failing that approval, the applicant is deemed to have obtained the approval by default.  The Deputy states that this is one democratic right which will go under this Bill.  The position in fact is that the building bye-law provisions of the 1878 Act which, I should point out, has not been universally availed of by local authorities, will not be repealed until building regulations have been made under the Bill.  Those regulations will, by virtue of Section 64, provide for approval being deemed to have been given, unless a decision is issued within two months.  This will bring the period for deciding matters under building regulations into line with the period for deciding planning applications under the Bill.  The principle that applicants must get a decision within a given period is in fact retained.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy referring to the building regulations said that unless in the making of the regulations there is close consultation with all interested parties, the danger would arise of a further period of fruitless local administration and strife between the various local authorities and the professions and trades interested in town planning and building development.  It is my intention, when draft regulations have been made under the Bill, to send the draft to all interested associations and bodies for their comments.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy Jones asked how many arbitrators will be necessary to determine the various claims for compensation likely to arise under the Bill.  As I indicated in opening, it is not possible to say what claims for compensation will arise but I would point out that there is power in the Property Values (Arbitration and Appeals) Act, 1960, to appoint more than one arbitrator so that we are not likely to find ourselves shorthanded or <Col N="1159" /> find that the legislation falls short in that regard.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the powers proposed to be given to planning authorities to carry out work in default of the person on whom enforcement notices have been served. There is no new principle in that. There are many provisions in the existing codes such as the present Planning Acts, the Housing Acts and the Public Health Acts, enabling local authorities to enter on lands and carry out works and recover the costs in default of compliance with statutory notices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the financial aspects of the Bill.  He said that the Bill when it becomes law will make the Dublin Corporation liable for very large sums of money, particularly with regard to the acquisition of property, street widening, new development and so forth.  He asked to what extent the planning authority would be assisted financially.  As I indicated in my opening statement, the grants at present payable to local authorities and other bodies by the Minister for Local Government for the development of public amenities, including the clearance of derelict sites, will help to further the amenity objectives of the Bill.  The portion of the development plans relating to public works will, of course, rank for State assistance as at present.  Road improvements and carparks, housing schemes and sanitary services, libraries and institutions, are examples of works and services which may be provided for in development plans but the cost of which is not ascribable to planning as such.</P>
    <P>In other words, all of those things I have mentioned, and probably a number I have not mentioned, are in the category at the moment that they are subject to large-scale assistance and large-scale help from central funds and where such operations in the future are part and parcel of the planning operations and re-development, they will still rank for recoupment. Whatever help was given in the past will still obtain.  Therefore it is not possible in a hypothetical case <Col N="1160" /> to take a re-development project and consider what the total cost of knocking down or rebuilding it for the various public purposes which might be included in the list I have given would be, and add up all the cost under the grant and say that is one of the fantastic sums that will fall on the Dublin Corporation.  That would be the gross total and from it must be deducted the various substantial amounts of assistance which would be given.  Indeed not all of it could be said to be related only to planning and development because there would arise on the new re-development economies in the manner of servicing the community which would have to be given a notional value.</P>
    <P>In regard to the development of central areas, local authorities may already have on hands cleared sites which can be made available for re-development by private enterprise. Such re-development would be of direct value to the ratepayers because it increases the rateable valuation and generates local economic activity.  It is not possible to forecast now the pace or extent of re-development which planning authorities will feel they should undertake or what net liabilities will fall to be borne by planning authorities in respect of such re-development or in respect of compensation related to planning restrictions on development by private interests. It is only fair to add that it is not possible to forecast at this stage with any degree of accuracy what will arise by way of compensation because of the various heads of operation under which any given local authority may propose to work under the terms of the Bill.  However, I can assure the House that all these matters will be kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley made the point that neither the local authority nor the State should be permitted to depart from the development plan in any development which they themselves may carry out.  Under the 1934 Act, State authorities could not be bound by the provisions of a planning scheme and in the interim period they were not obliged to submit their proposals for approval by the planning <Col N="1161" /> authority.  Section 82 of the Bill is a very considerable advance on that position.</P>
    <P>In connection with Deputy Colley's reference to semi-State bodies I would like to explain that the Bill does not exempt them from the standard procedure in relation to control of development.  They will be obliged to apply for permission and may make an appeal in the same manner as anybody else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe suggested that it was possible for bodies like the ESB to do what they liked under existing legislation and thought local authorities should be empowered to decide where overhead wires should be allowed or where certain buildings might be constructed.  The Bill contains the necessary provisions towards that end.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Booth and Deputy Colley raised the question of traffic and road planning, particularly in the metropolitan area.  The suggestion was made that the division of responsibility between three agencies prevented any effective co-ordination.  The Oireachtas has only recently enacted a comprehensive measure dealing with these matters but they are vitally important in this sphere of town planning also. It is one of the objects of the Bill to secure the greatest possible measure of co-ordination in regard to road planning and adequate provision for the solution of traffic problems in so far as it is feasible by the reservation of land and the regulation of development and user.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmons also mentioned the question of co-ordination in connection with space for the extension of factories and the erection of new office buildings and other commercial or industrial developments.  As I have already indicated the Bill gives ample power to planning authorities to provide sites for such purposes, if it should be necessary and if Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council find themselves unable to cooperate in such matters, that would be an appropriate case for the use of the powers available to me under Section 22.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> A number of Deputies have tended to compare the development plan as envisaged in this Bill with the planning scheme provided for under the Act of 1934.  It is important to bear in mind that the development plan is only a part of the planning system for which the Bill provides.  A planning scheme under the 1934 Act, assuming that one could be made, would in itself control and regulate development&mdash;it would constitute the complete planning system and not merely a framework within which the day to day decisions would be made.</P>
    <P>In this connection, Deputy Noel Lemass was under the impression that properties would be affected by a development plan and that immediate liabilities of a very substantial nature might be placed on the Dublin Corporation. This is not the case.  No development liability attaches to the development plan for which this Bill provides.  That is one of the fundamental differences between it and a scheme made under the Town and Regional Planning Act of 1934.  If such a scheme were made it could entail a substantial aggregate of compensation liabilities as soon as it came into force.  Claims for compensation in respect of restrictions imposed by the scheme itself were required to be made within twelve months of the coming into operation of the scheme, or such longer period as the scheme itself provided.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in my opening statement, the provisions of the 1934 Act in these respects were unsatisfactory both from the standpoint of the local authority and that of the individual property owner.  Compensation under the Bill will be related to the individual planning restrictions as they arise, that is, when the planning authority refuses permission or imposes restrictive conditions when granting a permission for development.</P>

      <P>On this question of urban renewal in the centre of cities which will require extensive preparation, I take it the Minister has in mind what happened in England where they accepted the fact that there will be large losses involved.

What I would suggest is that I have given some considerable information in answer to the questions posed by Deputy Briscoe.   That information will appear on the record and if, having fully digested it, if it is possible fully to digest it, the Deputy still feels in difficulty about it, I shall be glad to communicate with him further.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The individual property owner benefits because he may make his claim for compensation without having to wait for an overall plan or scheme to come into operation. Planning authorities will also benefit because they will not be obliged to go further than circumstances of their finances will allow. They will not be faced with the situation which could arise under the 1934 Act of having to pay as soon as their plan is prepared for schemes which might never be realised.  That was one of the obstacles which made the position under present law impossible.</P>
      <P>Before closing, I would like to refer briefly to the lectures which Deputy Barrett suggested were intended for propaganda purposes.  In my Second Reading speech, I indicated the circumstances in which I arranged for these lectures.  They were intended originally for local authority officials but as I have already stated, they were so valuable in explaining the purpose and methods of planning that I felt they would assist local representatives in considering the obligations and responsibilities which this Bill will impose on them.  Deputies on all sides of the House have expressed their appreciation and I would like them to know that I have in mind arranging for further lectures as and when circumstances permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that many Deputies <Col N="1164" /> attended these lectures&mdash;I did indeed suggest that all public representatives should be invited.  Not one Deputy has echoed or supported the allegation made by Deputy Barrett.  I might add that the lecturers gave their services free.  They were recouped merely their travelling and subsistence expenses.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that one of the most obvious reasons for our failure in this country to make progress in the field of town planning is that public representatives find the subject so difficult and that they have not the time to sit down and study it.  Accordingly it is my intention as I have already indicated not merely to provide courses and lectures for officials of local authorities, but to try to make available whatever facilities I can to enable local representatives to play their full part in the proper planning and development of their areas.  Furthermore, I think no sincere person will question that it was right to initiate such lectures at a time when it was vitally necessary that we should have informed criticism.  What we most need in dealing with a measure of this kind is intelligent and knowledgeable comment from the persons who will be called upon to implement the measure and from those who will be affected by it.  I feel that this House will agree with me that not merely was it desirable to stimulate interest in town planning at this time but that these lectures have been of real assistance in furthering the objects which it is the purpose of this Bill to secure.</P>
    <P>I think there is no doubt that the position of the individual is improved by this Bill as compared with his position under the Act of 1934.  From the point of view of the local authorities also, there is no doubt that it will be an improvement. The more flexible system of control, which is a feature of the Bill, the provision for periodic review of plans, the provisions for oral hearings, the necessity for giving reasons for decisions, binding both on the Minister and on local authorities, all conduce towards a more open and satisfactory system than that provided under the existing law.</P>

      <P>Might I put to the Minister a couple of questions I have been requested to ask him?  He mentioned already that the making of a plan is a function reserved to local authorities. I want to ask him whether a Section 4 motion under the County Management Act could be applied here.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Minister has mentioned that the overriding appeal in the Bill is to the courts.  I think he mentioned the High Court.  Has the Minister considered at any stage the question of whether, in the interests of expense, it should not have been to the circuit court, which sits in the areas of local authorities and where the applicants would be resident?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can look into that matter.  Quite honestly, I am not too sure about the costs, but I think this is something well worth looking into. If it could be made available on a local basis, it should be cheaper.  If it is feasible and expedient to do this, we shall try to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest respect for the Minister's industry in this matter, but we must take into account the number of appeals in England and the fact that the 1934 Act, as amended by the 1939 Act, was not fully availed of.  Now it is the intention of the Oireachtas to ensure that all planning authorities will come in under this new Act.  I think the Minister would be putting a very heavy burden on himself if he considered he would be able to deal personally with all the appeals that might come to be dealt with.  That is why I mentioned this question of appeals.  The experience in England has been that there were 5,000 or 6,000 appeals annually under the Town Planning Acts.</P>
      <P>In the Bill before us appeals to the courts are provided for in Sections 5, 21, 34, 51 and 81.  Appeals to the Minister are specifically mentioned in Sections 18, 26, 27, 29, 30, 33, 36, 37, 44, 45, 46, 48, 56, 65, 83, 86 and 87. In the majority of sections, therefore, the appeal seems to be to the Minister. In only five of the sections is direct appeal to the courts mentioned.</P>

      <P>On the latter point, whether or not it is mentioned in the Bill, the appeal is to the court on a matter of law.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first point the Deputy raised, the question of Section 4, unless I misunderstood the Deputy's question, I think I have already dealt with it in a pretty comprehensive way.  I mentioned the matter as having been referred to by Deputy Corish and I followed that up at some length.  I do not know whether the Deputy was present or not.  However, we can have it out further, if that is not sufficient.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that supply companies like the ESB can be controlled under this Bill and their activities, about which we have so often grumbled, can be checked. They must now apply, as other groups do, to the local authority for permission?</P>

      <P>That would be very desirable in respect of a measure such as this requiring a considerable amount of consideration.  Might I suggest to the Minister that in a Bill such as this, consisting of eight Parts, it might be possible to deal with a number of sections per day so that we would know how many sections we might deal with.  We should not be expected to deal with sections hour after hour.</P>
