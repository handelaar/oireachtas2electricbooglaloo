    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 6, to delete lines 8 to 11.&mdash;(Deputies Jones, T. Lynch, and McGilligan).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain how painting could materially alter the external appearance of a structure?  I agree it could superficially change the appearance of a building.  Would the Minister also enlighten me as to who will decide this matter as to whether a material alteration has been made in the structure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As an example of where a material alteration could be made by painting, you could have a terrace of cut-stone houses or, say, Georgian houses, and some person, for his own good reasons, decided to paint one house in the terrace.  Regardless of colour, I should imagine, that could be a type of case where material alteration would probably be determined to have been made.  As to who determines what is a material alteration in such a case, in the first instance, it would be the planning authority and in the final analysis, on appeal, it would be determined by the Minister for Local Government.  That would be under Section 5 of the Bill as now proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>A terrace of Georgian houses has been mentioned here already.  I seem to remember that the Minister quoted such an example.  The protection for such cases has come, not from any authority, but from public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the measure of control the Minister envisages, this Bill will come into operation on a certain date; he will then find himself applying this part of the Bill at different stages in different parts of the country.  In the meantime, there will be in force an <Col N="1219" /> Act which prohibits the doing of any of these things in those areas in which the Minister declares the provisions of the Act to be applicable.  Local authorities will have three years in which to implement the provisions of this Bill and to make a development plan or enforce controls.  In the meantime, does the Minister envisage a form of interim control and who will operate this interim control?  Suppose an individual decides, between the passing of this Act and its implementation by the local authorities, that he will alter the aspect of his house in some way, is there a danger that at a later stage someone may come along and tell him to change it back again?  Again, should he seek permission or approval after the passing of this Bill, how is it envisaged that he will get the permission or approval if there is no plan?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Bill, there are exemptions in relation to certain developments and these exemptions will certainly be extended under the regulations that will be made.  With regard to the interim period between the passing of the Bill and its coming into force, which is, I think, what the Deputy has in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be an interim period since the local authority will have a period of up to three years between the passing of the Act and its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is true that the mere passing of the Bill makes it immediately applicable all over, the Bill envisages, as the Deputy is aware, the continuation of the existing controls under the law at present.  If any alteration or development is carried out in accordance with the existing law, it will be quite legal and no action will be necessary.  New plans made under new legislation cannot affect the situation, provided the change is in accord with existing legislation.  With regard to the future, if there were no planning authority and no plan in existence, developments or alterations for which the individual was not obliged to have permission would remain legal, since they would not conflict with any plan, <Col N="1220" /> even though they might appear at a later date to be contrary to the terms of the new planning scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to painting, presumably the Minister intends to apply this Bill, in the first instance, to the larger built-up areas, and Dublin in particular, but, up to this, people in rural areas did not have to apply to the local authority for permission to paint or plaster.  Does the Minister envisage that all will have to seek permission after the passing of this Bill?  Even within the next three years, will a person be obliged to apply to the local authority for permission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If painting, plastering, or external repairs, or even new construction, comes within the law as it then stands, then people would be obliged to seek permission; otherwise, they would be acting illegally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>And, otherwise, they could be made to change it subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wanted to get from the Minister.  Individual responsibility and freedom will be changed somewhat with the passing of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not materially changed.  It will be only in extreme cases, and these will arise but rarely, in which it may be held that a material change has taken place because, for example, a Georgian house or a cut-stone house has had its facade materially altered to such a degree as to offend against aesthetics and interfere with neighbouring structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This will bring about bad public relations all over the country.  It seems rather extraordinary that a man who owns a house should have to apply to the local authority if he wants to paint it or do something to the front of it.  We have had experience in reconstruction schemes of how long it takes to get permission.  A very difficult situation could arise.  An architect might <Col N="1221" /> decide that a particular colour was not suitable.  I admit that the position is different where Georgian houses or those which might be classed as ancient monuments are concerned.  Naturally, these must be preserved.  I suggest it would be much easier if the Minister put in a clause with reference to the preservation of period houses or dwellings classed as ancient monuments, and so on.  It is those the Minister is really trying to protect but, under this legislation, a net will be cast over the whole country.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion we were discussing this, it was said uniformity would be a good thing.  I think we should try to get away from uniformity. It is something from which people have been trying to get away.  There was a time when there was practically nothing but long rows of drab houses, all painted the same dull colour.  Now the people have painted their houses in brighter colours.  Possibly there might be a colour one would not immediately care for, a colour the Minister might not like, or his officials, but, after all, it is a matter of taste and a matter of opinion.  The man who owns the house might like the colour.  It is a brightening up of the country which should be encouraged and not a regimentation of colour all over the country.  We should have more respect for the intelligence of our people.</P>
      <P>I should not like, any more than the Minister, to see areas or amenities destroyed or disfigured.  Even if a man paints his house a ridiculous colour, there is more than the law of this land entering into the picture. He will have to sustain the criticism of his neighbours and that is something that it is very often very hard to live with.  The Minister wants to make sure that Georgian houses and the magnificent squares in our cities and towns are preserved.  He can do that by protecting period houses or buildings which might come in the category of ancient monuments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in these cases the people should be compelled to apply to the local authority and it will be enough of a headache for the local authority to <Col N="1222" /> have to make decisions in such cases, without having every tenant of every house all over the country having to seek permission for this, that and the other.  That will only end in chronic wrangling.  It would be all right if it were only one or two cases, but, as the Minister knows, people are improving their houses now every day and they paint them oftener, especially coming on to this time of the year. They cannot be running down to the local authorities for every fiddle-faddle. I would appeal to the Minister to insert a provision in this section with reference to the type of buildings I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am enthusiastic about the general provisions of this Bill and applaud the Minister for what he is endeavouring to do in the planning of the proper and co-ordinated development of building generally throughout the country.  However, we are wasting quite an amount of time on this amendment, although it is a serious intrusion into the rights of the ordinary individual.  I would preface my remarks by appealing to the Minister to cut out this word &ldquo;painting&rdquo; altogether.  It is a stupid suggestion. The Minister can make many arguments in favour of its inclusion and give examples of how a terrace could be ruined by a person wanting to paint his house green, yellow or some other colour.  Those are exceptions but if we were to legislate for all such exceptions, it is not a Bill of this thickness we would want but one as thick as the width of this House.</P>
      <P>It is ludicrous to suggest that people should get approval from a local authority for the colour of paint they put on their doors.  Deputy Lynch is perfectly right when he says this will mean more red tape in the approach to the local authority as to whether the paint people put on their doors or windows will be green, white, yellow, blue or whatever colour they want to put on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A valid case can be made for the inclusion of the word &ldquo;plastering&rdquo; because that is a major job and the local authority should be satisfied that the plastering is a regular type of <Col N="1223" /> plaster or, if not regular, at least is in conformity with the plaster in the terrace or in the row of houses concerned. However, when it comes to officials from the local authority deciding what colour a door is to be painted, there will not be uniformity in their opinions as to what will or will not interfere with what is described as the character of a street or of an area.  I have an example, as Deputy Desmond had the last time he spoke on this section.  It is the case of a house on the Wexford-Dublin Road which has a front door with what I regard as an atrocious colour.  I told the owner but he did not agree at all. He thinks it is a &ldquo;wow&rdquo;.  Everybody else thinks it is awful but that man is entitled to his opinion, and I do not believe the Minister, the officials in the Department of Local Government or any engineer who comes in from some other county should tell that man what sort of paint to put on his door.</P>
    <P>We are going too far in this regard. The Minister has the goodwill of the House-at least he has the goodwill of myself and my Party&mdash;but he will lose it if he legislates for these petty things which only annoy people.  It is a bit much if we are to tell the housewife&mdash;and many housewives do paint the doors of their houses, in my town anyway; not that the men are lazy but the women like to do the external and internal painting&mdash;what colours she will use.  They would certainly resent any borough engineer or county engineer telling them that it must not be purple or pink.  If they want to have purple or pink doors, they are entitled to have them and should not be interfered with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be absolutely clear.  We are not concerned with the colour people put on doors or windows in ordinary circumstances. Ordinary painting which would undoubtedly give rise to all sorts of frustration and annoyance and would clutter up the planning authorities with applications and the Department with appeals will not arise at all. It is only painting or plastering which <Col N="1224" /> is inconsistent with neighbouring structures. We are not concerned with the painting of mere doors and windows of the structure but probably with the external front of the house in such a way as to affect materially the character of that house or houses in the same terrace.</P>
      <P>The House, I think, is misinformed in another aspect.  This very control has existed where the planning code has been adopted since 1934 and there is nothing new, additional or more burdensome in the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Minister?  I agree that it has been embodied in the 1934 legislation but it was never put into operation.  Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Why put it in now when it has been a dead letter for the past 29 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the intention in the 1934 Act that it should be contained where appropriate in the scheme adopted by the local authority. Whether or not the local authority opted to use or to ignore it was a matter for their own discretion.  Also the question of painting the whole house will not arise at all in the isolated cases down the country.  It will arise in the case of terraces or squares in towns or built-up areas and only then, if the houses concerned are incorporated in the scheme of the local planning authority.  Positive action by the planning authority to apply this even to terraces and squares will be necessary before this provision in its present form would in any way affect even that which would be incongruous and out of character in a square or terrace. Its application to houses generally in regard to their total painting will not arise at all.  It will apply only in squares and terraces and not as a result of the passage of this Act, but as a result only, following this enactment, of the drawing up of a plan by the planning authority including such squares and terraces as must be preserved from the type of spoiling that could take place by painting that would be out of character <Col N="1225" /> with the building or adjoining buildings.  It is not the wide, all-embracing measure that I fear the House have taken it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be.  What we have heard is the Minister's view.  I think the Minister would approach this himself if he were the local engineer as any of us would.  Recently, in my home town, I saw a terrace of ten houses built about 30 or 40 years ago.  They were good-class houses and all had grained varnished doors which were very dull-looking.  One occupier took off the varnish and painted the front door yellow&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Good luck to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but if this section had been operated by Wexford Corporation, I guarantee the local engineer would have told him to go back to the varnish.  But this breakthrough has meant in this terrace of ten houses that one has a blue door, another a purple, another pink and another white and it has brought up the whole area and it looks very attractive.  But there is the possibility that somebody would think that the pink door among all the varnished ones has ruined the character and tone of the place and if he wanted to invoke this particular subsection, he could tell the man to go back to the old varnish again.</P>
      <P>The type of outlandish case of the kind the Minister says will never arise and does not want to have, will arise. I know local officials and local engineers and they will invoke any line, word or section, if they want to prove a point or want to get something which they themselves believe in.  It is ridiculous to leave this subsection in.  We are spoiling the ship for a ha'porth of tar in spending so much time on a ridiculous suggestion, which is in print, that the local authority should control the type of paint to be put on somebody's door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish has raised a very important matter.  The Minister has given his interpretation of the subsection, but once it is written into the Act, the local <Col N="1226" /> authority can apply it to any house, as I see it, and need not restrict it to the Minister's interpretation.  That is why I think it is dangerous.  It is all wrong that an alteration should include either plastering or painting. Suppose I have a stone-built house which looks wonderful outside but is letting in damp and is a terrible house to live in, have I not the right to decide to put on a coat of waterproof plaster on the outside of the house? Not only is this preventing the type of improvement we all want but it limits rights of ownership.  If I cannot decide to improve my own house, either by plastering or painting, the house has not to me the value it had heretofore.</P>
      <P>If I want to sell my house and believe that if its appearance is altered considerably, it will increase its value and the sale will be much better, somebody could say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Again, if I own a house, how am I to decide in advance whether some improvement I am going to make will materially alter the house or not?  Much depends on the interpretation of the words &ldquo;materially alter&rdquo;.  If this were carried out according to the Minister's interpretation, very few people would object to it but I do not think it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree completely with Deputy Corish and I appreciate the sincerity of the Minister's assurance. He does not intend the Act to go as far as Deputy Corish feels it could go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the definition section and see the definition of &ldquo;structure&rdquo;, I think a door could be a structure, and if Deputy Corish's friend in Wexford did paint his door in some colour that some local engineer did not like, the man could find himself coming within the ambit of this measure.  I appreciate the spirit in which the subsection is offered to the House but the House should be very careful.  When it comes down to matters such as the colour which a man may paint his door, we should be careful not to interfere with the rights of individuals because any of us who are, or have been, members of the local authority know that even with the truncated <Col N="1227" /> powers local authorities have at present, very capricious decisions have been taken by planning authorities and the rights of individuals have been greatly interfered with.  I know there must be a certain amount of interference for the common good but I appeal to the Minister, so far as he can, to remove objectionable features such as this from the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corish said, we all appreciate why the Bill is being introduced, but we must be terribly careful that we do not ride roughshod over the ordinary rights of ordinary people. I am afraid we are going to do it, because this is much too wide in its terms.  The definition states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;alteration&rdquo; includes any plastering or painting which materially alters the external appearance of a structure so as to render such appearance inconsistent with the character of the structure or of neighbouring structures;</P>
    <P>That is open to an interpretation which would mean that a town planning authority would be literally walking into everybody's house in order to interfere with people's rights.  I would appeal to the Minister.  I think he will agree that Deputy Corish was reasonable in his suggestions, and I want to be reasonable, too.  If the Minister will not accept the entire amendment, at least he should use some words other than &ldquo;structure&rdquo;, because &ldquo;structure&rdquo; is much too wide. According to the definition section of the Bill, it could mean anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This situation is far from being as wide open as the interpretation put on it by the Deputies who have spoken against it would suggest.  I appreciate their approach is not one of destructive criticism, and I trust we will be able to get through the Bill as a whole in that spirit, because it is necessary that we should have the most suitable Bill.  The dangers enumerated here, particularly interference with the general public, are just not possible.  I know it is possible for engineers with small minds to exist, but there are very few of them. <Col N="1228" /> The idea, however, that under this Bill such an official could ride roughshod over the public is sheer fantasy.</P>
      <P>In addition to the exemptions already enumerated in the Bill, the Minister will be empowered and intends to make regulations further enumerating the exemptions from this section.  The type of exemption that would cover painting and external plastering is intended to be covered in the regulations by a statement to the effect that anything not included specifically by the planning authority in their plan will not come under this section at all.  In other words, unless it is stated by the planning authority in their plan that this terrace or square is to come under the section, the section will not apply at all.  Assuming the planning authority go too far or make a mistake, the first thing is that the plan will be drawn up.  If certain terraces or squares are to be included, that plan must be adopted by the elected members of the local authority concerned before it becomes a legal instrument at all.</P>
      <P>Supposing, however, that, despite those safeguards, an engineer through some loophole is enabled to do what is obviously wrong&mdash;perhaps he is one of those queer fellows you meet in every walk of life&mdash;it is the function of the county manager to make the decision on any case in the first instance.  Suppose an individual is affected by what the engineer proposes to do, the local authority prepare a plan and the manager approves, it is still open to the person so wronged to appeal to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it suggested that those who prepare the plan, who would be technical people on the council's staff or people brought in in a consultant capacity, will prepare something wrong? Secondly, is it suggested that the local members will accept what is wrong? Is it suggested that if an engineer makes a wrong decision, that decision will be backed up by the manager, that it will come to the Minister for Local Government of the day and that he will back it up as well?  I do not think we can envisage that set of circumstances operating to the disadvantage or annoyance of any individual. <Col N="1229" /> I do not think it is humanly possible to envisage those five things happening in sequence in respect of any particular case.</P>
    <P>I think the fears of the House are absolutely groundless.  If I were not so satisfied, I would have long since agreed with the views of the House. However, I am satisfied as to the overall effect of this section and our approach to it.  I have not given away, not because I do not want to but because I believe there is no necessity.  By taking out that section we would be weakening the fabric of this planning code which, in the general interest, must be preserved and brought into operation.</P>
    <P>I am assuring the House that, as far as the regulations to be made under Section 4 are concerned, only those terraces and squares named by the planning authority in the proposed plan will come under this section. In other words, the regulations will say that anything not named will not come under the section or, alternatively, unless it is named in the plan of any planning authority, this section will not apply to it at all.  In view of that and the other safeguards mentioned, I am completely satisfied. Taking all things into consideration, and the regulation in particular, I am saying here and now that no damage at all can possibly follow.  I am completely satisfied about that and if I were not, I would be just as concerned as any other Deputy because of the possible consequences.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says in regard to events that will happen after the passing of the Bill, but may I take it from the Minister, in regard to the period of interim control that will follow after the passing of the Bill, that the exemptions we have been talking about will apply to the areas where the Act will not be implemented until such time as planning authorities have been set up therein?  Does the Minister intend that these exemptions will apply to such areas and that in the interim, they will have the safeguard of a development plan being drawn up by experts and submitted to the elected representatives for approval?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> That would be a great safeguard for the people within the administrative areas.  With the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, we will have then, as the Minister said earlier, a control imposed and individuals in areas where the Act will not be applicable in the first instance will find themselves with a period of time in which they will not have to apply to the local authorities for permission.  If the people in such areas had an assurance that the exemptions mentioned here would apply to such works as they would contemplate, it would go a good way towards meeting the point we have been trying to make here. Again, during the period from the date the Minister decides to apply the Act in any particular area to the date the Act can physically be brought into operation in that area because of the existence of a development plan, will the individuals within that area have the benefit of such exemptions so that they will not have to apply to a local authority which had not really prepared a development plan at that stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If exemptions are envisaged then those exemptions, and all who might be affected by them, would apply in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy, but it is not true to say that from the date of the passage of the Act until such date, up to a maximum of three years, as a proper and full plan has been prepared a sort of vacuum will exist in which there will not be any planning control at all.  That is not so, and it would be a very grave weakness in the proposed measure if it were so because much could happen in three years that could do irrevocable damage.</P>

      <P>It does not follow that during the time of preparation of a plan there will not be any controls at all or that anything and everything will be exempted during that interim period.  Subsection (7) of Section 2, which we will be coming to later on states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> The references to the provisions of the development plan shall, until that plan is made, be construed as references to the provisions which the planning authority consider will be included in that plan.</P>
    <P>In other words, they would have regard, during the interim period, to what they intend doing and what they intend doing will undoubtedly guide them in so far as their administration under the planning laws is concerned.  That will be dealt with at a later stage.</P>

I feel sure my colleagues, like me, want to see this Bill go through because we think it will bring about great improvements in our building projects and in the look of the country.  At the same time, we want to make sure that the rights of ordinary citizens are looked after.  I am under the impression that when a town plan is brought before a local authority, meaning the elected members, they are the people who will have the power to say such a thing will be done or will not be done.  However, I have seen legislation go through this House giving the Minister power to set up bodies, only to discover that later, after we have adopted legislation, we have no more authority and neither, apparently, has the Minister.  When we put down a question the Minister may say: &ldquo;I have no function&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that the citizens would have rights, that the local authority would adopt plans in the first place and that even if the engineer were a crank the matter could be brought before the manager. We have been told that even if the manager were a crank there will be the right of appeal then to the Minister. <Col N="1232" /> What I am trying to point out is that once the local authority adopt a plan <i>en bloc</i> they have finished with it; there will be no appeal open to the citizens at all.  The plan will be sent in and the expert is the judge.</P>
      <P>I want to be constructive on this. The Minister tells us that a local authority might mention certain areas when dealing with a plan.  That is the key to this whole business and it is on this point that we might meet each other.  It should be made more specific there that the particular areas&mdash;a square, a street or perhaps a terrace&mdash; scheduled for planning would be brought before the elected representatives, sitting in council.  That would take away what might be a cause of great confusion.  There could be terrible confusion if plans in respect of certain areas were adopted without these areas being specified at the time. You might have a man living in such an area who would know nothing at all about the plan and who might, say, go ahead with the painting of the front of his house.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be necessary that when planning proposals are put forward in areas such as Limerick, Cork or Waterford, the details of the areas scheduled would be mentioned.  Here in Dublin, if we intended including Fitzwilliam Square or Merrion Square, these districts should be mentioned. Otherwise a man living in one of these areas, not knowing his property was in the plan, might go ahead and disfigure his house, in the opinion of the planners.  All this man could say is: &ldquo;I did not know anything at all about it.  How was I to know anything about this?  I saw the people in such a street plastering the front of their houses and painting them the way they wanted to and why should I not be able to do the same?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's officials could easily notify these people by post and say: &ldquo;You cannot do this.&rdquo;  This is the way to go about it.  The danger I see is that we are legislating for the whole country and the Minister has actually said it, and we are as one with him, that he does not want these beautiful houses or terraces destroyed.  We agree <Col N="1233" /> that there should be some uniformity but if that is the Minister's opinion, and it is our opinion, it would be better to have it in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this subsection would apply only when the planning authority had decided it would apply to a specific street or terrace.  If the local authority decided that it should not apply to any street in their area, are they free to do so? That is the way I should like to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it another way.  They do not have to decide that it will not apply.  The obligation would be on them to decide where it will apply and if they should reach a decision that it should not apply, then it would not apply anywhere.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Lynch's point, we are getting on to common ground. The position really is that in so far as the preparation of the plan is concerned, and the inclusion in it of certain squares, terraces or houses by specific reference, the intention to make it will have to be published.  That is part of the obligation of the local authority.  If the local authority wish to give additional publicity to any particular aspect of the plan, they will be free to do so.  If they should feel that, in fairness, they should notify the residents or occupiers of any terrace or square, they will be quite free to do so, but the idea of the local authority creeping up on the people in a square or terrace will not arise and in fact I would rely on the local authority members to see that such could not be said afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that the publication of the intended plan, and in particular, of any special notice regarding a terrace or square, under this section, will invoke representations to the councils and that they will raise the objections on behalf of those who have approached them.  These could not be better set out than by local councillors. The council will make a decision to accept the plan in this way, or accept it and delete the inclusion of a terrace or square.  There is no fear whatever of what Deputy Lynch said being likely to happen because of the <Col N="1234" /> method of going about this.  I am sorry that we could not have got this whole picture across from the start because then we would not be at cross purposes but I think we are getting on to common ground now.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1) it says that &ldquo; `development' has the meaning assigned to it by Section 3 and `develop' shall be construed accordingly and `development plan' has the meaning appropriate in accordance with subsection (7) of Section 19&rdquo;.  At a later stage, we have &ldquo;developments&rdquo; defined and it is set out in Section 33.  It says that &ldquo;development&rdquo; in this Act means, save where the context otherwise requires, and so on.

      <P>The Minister appreciates, as we do, that an attempt has been made in this House to avoid in legislation as far as possible this system of cross-reference and having to refer from one Act to another.  Within the lifetime of this Dáil, a measure has been brought in to attempt to coordinate various laws and avoid this business of cross-references.  In a piece of legislation such as this, one would imagine the appropriate thing would be to define &ldquo;development&rdquo; as it is defined in Section 3.  In the definition section, the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; is defined and then there is a further definition of it in Section 3.  In recent times, this House has looked with favour on the codification of legislation <Col N="1236" /> to avoid reference back to earlier Acts.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the avoidance of reference back to earlier Acts is the wish of all of us.  I am afraid that is in a much wider context than a cross-reference within the Bill itself.  This is a local matter within the confines of the Bill itself.  It in no way conflicts with our general view of trying to consolidate our laws in order to render the present law understandable.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Draftsman considers it a desirable cross-reference within the Bill.  We do not feel we should query the matter further. Materially, it alters nothing.  He says it is useful and desirable and he knows better than I do, anyhow, in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice, again, on this is that after considerable thought <Col N="1237" /> and investigation of the actual amendment it is considered that the Bill is better as it is than if we agreed to the amendment.  Some of the exempted developments mentioned elsewhere in the Bill might be caught if we agreed to the amendment.  Some developments already exempted in the Bill could, I am advised, be caught under the amendment and instead of being exempted could be brought in again. Therefore, it would probably be better to leave the situation as it is. I am sure it was not the intention of those proposing the amendment that anything exempted should be caught.</P>

      <P>I suggest that further exemptions may be made by regulation, which are not set out.  They could be excluded if we accepted the amendment.  The amendment would restrict us to what is stated in Section 4 but there is the question of the powers given in Section 4 by way of regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, certain things may be included which are not stated in the section.  That is the very danger one envisages.  If you do not confine yourself to the section and to the exempted developments then, later, it can be said that something else is an exempted development and has the meaning of an exempted development. Furthermore, the regulations would provide for exempted developments and they would not be defined as they are here.  Perhaps the Minister might give us some examples of other exempted developments which might have to be included later but are not now included in the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of land, for instance; advertisements, farm buildings, and so on.  I understand the approach of the Deputy to this.  Those Deputies who have been at issue with <Col N="1238" /> me on some of these matters have been seeking to restrain me from controls if they can be avoided.  The idea of regulations in and under Section 4 is to enable the Minister to make further exemptions&mdash;in other words, to make more free the things that may be done under the various heads and which at the moment we do not necessarily see.  It is a freeing, an exemption of certain things under the power in Section 4 whereby the Minister may make regulations.</P>
      <P>I am advised that this amendment could, and I am afraid would, be read legally that only those things actually stated as exempted in Section 4 would be exempted in the future.  It would take from the Minister the power to make further and wider exemptions than are stated in Section 4, so, in the last analysis, it would be a contracting of the rights of the public which this House has rightfully been guarding in every respect.  I think we should leave it alone because it enables the Minister to make regulations exempting certain further developments than those stated in Section 4.  If we accepted the amendment, we would be confined to the exemptions stated in Section 4, and would be restricting the rights of the public in certain matters.</P>

Under this measure, that would be a change of the use of the land and would not in any way concern a structure as such. It is necessary that we should have some control over the change of the use of land as distinct from the structure which is normally erected on land. We want to have &ldquo;any structure and&rdquo; included in this definition so that we can divorce it and deal with it separately which, if we were to agree to this amendment, would probably not be possible, and certainly would not be easy.  We could not deal with it separately as we wish to.  It is necessary for us to have control of the change of the use of the land.

    <P>An &ldquo;obsolete area&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;an area consisting of land which, in the opinion of the planning authority, is badly laid out or the development of which has, in their opinion, become obsolete...&rdquo;  In this, we are taking a very subjective view.  There should be a more objective definition of land <Col N="1240" /> which is badly laid out than &ldquo;in the opinion of the planning authority&rdquo;. That is the opinion of an individual. An individual on a planning authority will determine if land is badly laid out.  That is leaving it to an individual to make a determination in regard to a person's land, that the land which he owns is badly laid out or, as defined in the subsection, has become obsolete.</P>
    <P>The Minister owes it to the Bill and to the rights of the individual, that there should be a far more objective approach to this matter, and that there should be a more objective determination of land which is badly laid out or has become obsolete.  The type of power which is being given in this definition is very wide and again&mdash; perhaps it is an inordinate fear of ours &mdash;we are concerned with the rights of the individual to his property.  Those rights are being invaded, I believe, in this respect.  We are leaving to an individual the right to determine that land is badly laid out or obsolete.  It is much too subjective.  It is not sufficiently objective to cover the rights of the individual.  I invite the Minister's comment on it.</P>

I hope we will have serious redevelopment in the not too distant future.</P>

    <P>As to the objection on the basis it is the view of one man, presumably, the manager, who, in the last analysis, would have the responsibility of determining what in the context of this measure, is an obsolete area, it is <Col N="1241" /> entirely wrong to suggest that in determining an area and the property or lands contiguous or adjacent to it to be obsolete, the manager decides himself. He does take responsibility for it but in such a matter he would have the best technical advice available to him. It may be said that these people are all officials and may be technicians and that what is good technically may not be good socially, and so on.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I would suggest that Section 19 is most relevant.  For the provision in regard to an obsolete area to have any effect, Section 19 will have to come into operation because in order to utilise an area described as obsolete it will be necessary to draw up a redevelopment plan to absorb that area or to utilise that area under this section.  Section 19 requires that the elected members of the council should approve of that redevelopment plan.  So, I am putting it in reverse, that if a redevelopment plan for a given area is not approved and agreed on by the elected representatives, this section might as well not exist.  The danger that Deputies might see in the section is safeguarded by the fact that these dangers could arise only consequent upon the operation of Section 19 which requires the approval of the elected members to a redevelopment plan applying to the area that would be described as obsolete and the land contiguous and adjacent to it.  So, there is no danger that an official, or officials, only, will have a say in the matter.</P>
    <P>Another safeguard is that, at the outset, in the preparation of a plan which incidentally will be, by obligation, subject to review at least every five years, it may well be that an area that we would regard for the purposes of this section as an obsolete area will in fact be determined and outlined in the original plan as prepared and approved by the locally elected members and, if not in the first initial plan, on review at any stage, the plan may include an area that the body would feel had become obsolete and needed redevelopment.  Generally speaking, between the preparation of a plan, the acceptance of the plan and its next revision the likelihood of the manager and his technical people taking effective <Col N="1242" /> action under this section that would dissolve the structures in this allegedly obsolete area is quite remote because these things take quite a long time and would be difficult.  In fact, inquiries would be necessary if there were objectors.  If there were no objectors I do not think any of the dangers mentioned by the Deputy would arise.  In view of the fact that inquiries would have to take place and revision of the plan must be carried out not less than once every five years, it is unlikely that any such obsolete area projected for redevelopment would in fact be redeveloped without its being considered either at the outset, in the preparation of the original plan, or in the revision of that plan. In that event, of course, the local authority would come into the consideration. If the other should happen, Section 19 is the safeguard in regard to the elected members and the public having their say in that it requires the approval of any redevelopment plan by the council members, without which the obsolete area provision in this section does not mean anything</P>

It says here: &ldquo;if in the opinion of the planning authority it is obsolete or is badly laid out or the development of which has in their opinion become obsolete.&rdquo; That is all right.  The local authorities would have a say in it.  With all respect to the public officials throughout the country, they are usually not natives of the place where they are operating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  It is good to talk about these things in this way.  I am sure the Minister will bear with me.  Public officials are all very good men, with good qualifications, but they have not the feel of a place in which they have not been born and reared.  They would have no regard, possibly, for some old portion of the town that could be deemed obsolete by an up-to-date young engineer.  If a proposal for redevelopment comes before the local authority, as the Minister says, and the local council is appalled and turns it down, it could happen that the officials could appeal to the Minister, as the Bill says, meaning that they could appeal to the officials in the Custom House in many of these cases and the will of the local authority and the local people might be flouted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind a place in my constituency that many people have condemned from one point of view or another but which the local people regard as beautiful and want it kept in the way it is.  For instance, if there are one or two trees that may interfere with motorists doing 80 miles an hour, perhaps it is a good thing to leave the trees there.  If this were brought before the local council under this Bill, the local council would turn the proposal down and would not consider that the area in question was an obsolete area, but, as the Minister says, it could happen that the officials concerned could say: &ldquo;All right; we will jump the gun on the local council and will go to the Minister and the <Col N="1244" /> Department.&rdquo;  They would get permission. That is one of the things that creates so much friction all over the country; the will of the individual is being flouted.  If people want to make a mistake, that is their democratic right. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this question of appeal.</P>

I want to ensure that managers do not present local authorities with a <i>fait accompli</i> by presenting them with the intention of declaring an area obsolete or badly planned in the final stages and when the aggrieved persons will have very little redress.</P>

I want to ensure, however, that public representatives have the democratic right to express their views.  Deputy T. Lynch is also a member of a local authority and I agree with him that local men are <Col N="1245" /> more experienced and more familiar with local conditions.  Even if someone does make a mistake, what about it?  Public officials and county managers have made mistakes.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that the more power and responsibility local authorities have, the more interest they will take in local affairs.  Let me say here that in Dublin city and county we get on very well with our managers and assistant managers.  Under Section 4 of the Local Government Act, we can now pass a resolution directing the manager to do certain things.  I am very anxious now to ensure that members of local authorities shall have the democratic right of an official say in these matters.</P>
      <P>It reminds me of an unfortunate man in County Dublin who had a little bit of money and who decided to give carte blanche to an architect to build a house for him.  The man happened to be earning his living in another country and when he came back, he found that the house cost four times what he had thought it would cost.  The architect went wild on it.  I am not saying he did anything wrong.  It was a beautiful house but far beyond the means of this unfortunate man to pay for it.</P>
      <P>In matters like this, we must advert to the democratic rights of the public representatives.  Even if one man in that council makes a wrong statement or sees something the wrong way, there are 20 other men who will not agree with him.  There is a democratic vote and that settles the matter.  The Minister, as chairman and member of a local authority for a long time, knows what I am speaking of and I am sure he will consider all the points that have been made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather refreshing to see democracy at work and I welcome Deputy Burke's statement here.  There is a very important point in question, the rights of the local authority, and the Minister should see to it that the local authority will have the final say in a matter such as this. <Col N="1246" /> It is they who will always have the feel of a place and the idea of the local people's attitude towards a change which might be a big change in the planning of a town or village.</P>
      <P>The Minister would want to take into consideration everything that has been said here because it is important and constructive.  Deputy Treacy referred to the importance of the county manager or the city manager coming before the local body and saying: &ldquo;It is my intention to declare such an area in this or that town obsolete,&rdquo; before any big outlay had been incurred.  The danger is that a local authority would be faced by an enormous outlay which would have to be written off.  It is all very fine to say that the manager would have the best advice technically.  The best advice technically is not the best advice.  A famous landlord at one time in Ireland had the best advice technically and economically but it only meant driving 17,000 people off the land.</P>

      <P>It hardly relates to this but it points a finger.  However, it gives me a certain amount of satisfaction that we are all approaching this debate in the right way.  The Minister is very tolerant with us.  When we have a Deputy of the standing of Deputy Burke, with his experience as a representative in the city and county of Dublin, agreeing with us over here, it is refreshing and it is something to which the Minister should pay special attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point in this discussion is that even though the local authority might decide against an area under their jurisdiction being declared obsolete, the danger is that the officials could go over their heads and, in spite of their wishes and in spite of the wishes of the local people, a whole series of planning developments could be carried out of which the local people would not be in favour and would not live with.  These are the things that make for bad relations between the officials and the elected representatives of the people and, I <Col N="1247" /> might say also, bad relations between the elected representatives of the people and the Minister's Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the discussion that has taken place, it seems this amendment is very appropriate.  In the first instance, the opinion of the planning authority will be the opinion of the expert who has prepared the plan.  Perhaps the Minister could inform us what is envisaged in this regard. Will the planners of the future prepare a plan, having looked over the area, and then submit it to the authority as the development plan for that area? This stipulation in regard to the opinion of an individual is very wide. It is not to be the opinion of the local authority employing the planner but the opinion of the individual preparing the plan.  The point made by Deputy Treacy in this regard is a very important one and perhaps the Minister would consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the House will agree that in dealing with matters such as this, the statement whether an area is obsolete or not must depend on somebody's opinion.  It is not some fact that can be stated for certain.  There could be different views as to whether or not an area is obsolete.  We are just saying straightforwardly here that, in regard to people who are locally and immediately concerned in this matter, it will be in their opinion, having regard to all the circumstances of which they will have the best knowledge as to whether or not an area was obsolete.  I do not think the change suggested would be of any material advantage because ultimately somebody's opinion would determine whether a given area is or is not an obsolete area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation is too simple.  The gist of his argument is that it must be somebody's opinion and this section says it must be the planning authority's opinion. The opinion that will be given first will be that of some local authority engineer, then his superior and then the manager will give their opinion.  It must be somebody's opinion but why <Col N="1248" /> not the opinion of the representatives of the local authority?  He says the local elected representatives will have the power to approve or disapprove of the development plans.  That may be some consolation to them but why should they not have the power to say whether or not an area is obsolete?  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Lynch and other Deputies when they say that more and more we can see the opinions and the views of the elected representatives of the local authorities being completely flouted.</P>
      <P>Section 22 to which the Minister refers shows that no matter what the public representatives might say in respect of the obsolete area or its redevelopment, in the heel of the hunt, their decisions may be overridden entirely and an area may be declared to be obsolete.  There may be a new development or redevelopment plan in which they may have no say whatsoever. We could save ourselves a great deal of trouble if the members of the local authority were the people who decided whether or not an area was to be an obsolete area.  There would be very few cases where this Minister or any other Minister will insist on redevelopment plans being engaged in.  But supposing, on the advice of engineers and architects, it is decided an area is obsolete and a redevelopment plan is prepared and put before the council who reject it, a lot of useless work has been engaged in and a lot of money has been spent.  If the elected representatives decide, in the first place, whether an area is obsolete or not, there is no development plan, no money spent and no time wasted, unless a Minister for Local Government wants to insist that an area is obsolete and that it must be rebuilt.  However, I suggest that in few cases would the Minister for Local Government act in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in relation to the Minister's statement that it must be in the opinion of someone that this change takes place that we disagree with him.  We feel that if an opinion is to be sought regarding radical changes of the kind proposed here, it should be the consensus of opinion of the majority of the people in the <Col N="1249" /> town or city, speaking through their local representatives.  The manager, as the planning authority, will be obliged to consult his local engineer or architect and it is on the basis of that individual's view this decision will be made.  It could then be determined that an area of land was obsolete or badly planned on the advice of an architect or engineer.</P>
      <P>These are very fine people, trying to do an excellent job, and we respect them in their professional capacity but sometimes they make bad mistakes. Sometimes they are prejudiced.  We have instances where the rights of the people to utilise land or property were violated, where the aesthetic feelings of the people of the town or city were completely ignored and where bulldozers were sent in to destroy places of historical interest.  Old walls, castles, monuments and beautiful buildings have been wiped out as a result of such plans.  The opinion of the man concerned would be based on a practical viewpoint.  He will not have regard to sentiment which is a very important thing in a community.</P>
      <P>My desire is that before any plan of this kind is put into operation by the manager, the views of the local authority will be ascertained at the earliest opportunity.  I said earlier that I did not wish to see a <i>fait accompli</i> presented to the local authority who would be told afterwards that by reason of the research and expenditure of money involved in determining that this area should be regarded as obsolete or badly planned and should be redeveloped in a certain manner, they must suffer the loss of x thousands of pounds, unless they agreed with the manager's recommendation.  Apart from Section 19, where it is inferred that the local authority has some positive say, we are perturbed that the manager may appeal to the Minister and we are concerned that the appeal of one official to another official may result in the manager's opinion being upheld.  That is why we support so sincerely the amendments put forward by Deputy Jones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, too many powers are vested in managers at present and the Minister would be doing a good day's <Col N="1250" /> work and would arouse more enthusiasm for participation in local affairs if he invested members of the local authority with the functions which we now desire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 6, lines 42 to 44, to delete &ldquo;or consisting of such land together with other land contiguous or adjacent thereto&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the same definition but to the portion towards the end of it.  Perhaps the Minister would say, before I proceed, what exactly this means, &ldquo;consisting of such land&rdquo;&mdash;that, I take it, is what is to be regarded as the obsolete area&mdash;&ldquo;together with other land contiguous or adjacent thereto&rdquo;.  How far do we go in this respect?  If this definition is to stand as at present, it can be very widely extended.  I can understand that a piece of land adjacent to an obsolete area may be necessary for the redevelopment of that area but it can be pushed very far by a planner under this definition.  We are back on the ground where the houses and property of individuals may be interfered with and we are not limiting the interference in any way.  Perhaps the Minister will say what is in his mind when he uses the term &ldquo;contiguous&rdquo; in relation to land, the definition of which we are dealing with, and which is to be regarded as an obsolete area?  If the Minister would enlighten us at the start, I may think again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that an obsolete area may include land contiguous or adjacent to it has no sinister implications whatever.  The House will appreciate that an obsolete area as defined and acquired may not in itself, taking everything into consideration-traffic movement, roads, utilising of the land and buildings&mdash;lend itself to <Col N="1251" /> a proper economic development plan and that a little more land on one side or the other may be absolutely necessary to make the obsolete area a worthwhile site for redevelopment. The House will appreciate that in the housing code acquisition proceedings now and in the past, the strict confining of what might be acquired, particularly in centre city and built-up areas, to narrow categories of property has had very serious implications.  It has been a major difficulty in some local authorities, particularly larger towns and cities, in proceeding with the demolition of tenements and the building of properly laid-out blocks of flats or residences.  It is from our experience of the shortcomings of the housing code in the acquisition of land as well as the fact that redevelopment, particularly in the cities and large towns, may be much more costly, that we felt we needed this extra elbow room&mdash;although it may not be used&mdash; in order to ensure orderly and, if possible, economic redevelopment and urban renewal in and around these obsolete areas.</P>
      <P>The idea of what is adjacent or contiguous stretching out into the next county might possibly be taken from the form of words used, but we must consider that in doing this, we are merely adding to redevelopment or urban renewal, because the obsolete area is probably in the centre of a city or town.  We want this breathing space, if necessary, to ensure proper planning and more economic usage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the desirability of securing additional land contiguous or adjacent to a site, especially in a restricted area, in order to implement a proper design plan, but we must have regard to the fact that we are determining an obsolete area. That conjures up in my mind a pretty extensive area.  Surely it should be possible for the engineers and architects to plan in conformity with the existing obsolete area, without having to make additions and without having to claim the right to take in land contiguous or adjacent thereto?  I am suggesting there is something fundamentally wrong with the planning of <Col N="1252" /> the obsolete area in the first instance, if we have to add or claim the right to take in land contiguous or adjacent to it.  I could understand it in a restricted area, where additional development is necessary, but not in the case of a plan taking in an obsolete area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit alarmed at this because the wording is rather vague.  That is why the amendment has been moved.  The section says: &ldquo;lands contiguous or adjacent thereto.&rdquo; I am not thinking in terms of an area in the centre of a city or large town but of places on the edges of our towns and cities.  A place might be declared an obsolete area and that would mean that all the land around it would be land &ldquo;contiguous or adjacent thereto&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This power is far too wide.  I am not trying to clip the Minister's wings but we must have regard to the rights of the people and their representatives. If we pass legislation such as this, we will find later our friends and neighbours coming to us saying they are suffering gross hardship under it and we, their elected representatives, will not be able to do anything about it. Now is the time to ensure that we shall retain those powers.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the difficulty of securing land and members of local authorities have often experienced difficulty in securing a piece of land. It is always a question of price, and we hear it said: &ldquo;He wants too much for it&rdquo; or &ldquo;He should not get it for that&rdquo;.  But the local council should get together with the manager and officials, decide to buy the land and make an offer.  Even if they have to give a little more, it is better they should do that than seek powers of compulsory acquisition under this legislation, because that always turns out to be the most expensive way of acquiring any land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities seeking to acquire land have not had sufficient flexibility. They must have the land.  It is the only cow in the fair and they want it.  If the person who owns the land is asking a price&mdash;he nearly always is, and why should he not?&mdash;more than is usually paid for land, the whole business has <Col N="1253" /> to hang fire.  The Minister's sanction is awaited.  With respect to the Minister and those who decide these matters in his Department, I do not think they are in touch with or have the feel of the people down the country in these areas.</P>
    <P>We should omit land &ldquo;contiguous or adjacent thereto&rdquo; from this legislation. The Minister should seek to give the powers to the local authority, and by that, I mean the members of the local authority as well as the manager and officials concerned.  If the Minister makes local government here true local government, he will be doing a good job for the country.</P>

      <P>We have to be practical in this.  Deputy Lynch or any other Deputy knows well enough that only about three per cent. of people will give land to local authorities voluntarily.  If you want to take five or six acres of land from John Jones in County Dublin, he will go to his local Deputies and councillors and say: &ldquo;That is the very best field I have.  What about that field down the road?&rdquo; The man who owns that field will tell you: &ldquo;If that field is taken from me, I might as well fold up.&rdquo; You then go down to Paddy Burke, who has a few acres, and ask him: &ldquo;Will you give it to us?&rdquo; He tells you: &ldquo;Oh, my grandfather had that and my father after him.  It is the very best field I have.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faced with that sort of thing, I am completely behind the Minister on this section.  Had we not got compulsory acquisition powers in the city and county of Dublin, we would have got nothing done during the years.  In fact, I would say that we did not have sufficient powers in this respect.  We must be practical.  I did support Deputy Lynch earlier when he said public representatives generally could do with more powers, but the conferring of extra powers under this section <Col N="1254" /> would be putting the clock back completely.</P>

      <P>The Minister has spoken of obsolete areas and urban renewal.  It is understandable and desirable that built-up areas should be renewed, and that land and buildings adjacent to them should be used.  However, we have here the definition of an obsolete area: &ldquo;an area of land which in the opinion of the planning authority is badly laid out&rdquo;.  But an obsolete area also means land adjacent to the badly laid out area or an area of land contiguous to it.  Here we are legislating not merely for urban areas but also for certain circumstances which may arise in the country atlarge.</P>
      <P>Here we are legislating for land on the outskirts of our built-up areas, for the newly-developing estates on the outskirts of towns.  Here we intend applying this definition of &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; to the thing generally: it is not being confined to areas in the centre of urban districts, not being confined to urban renewal, to what we might call slum areas in towns and cities.  Here we are putting in a definition and widening it so that even the most recently built areas on the outskirts of towns can be defined, in the opinion of the planning authority, as &ldquo;land adjacent&rdquo;.  It may be virgin land which, because it comes within the scope of the planning authority, will become obsolete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to the widening of this type of definition that we have serious objection. We agree, and said so at the outset, that this measure was certainly very necessary and that where we had large built-up urban areas, there was a grave necessity for this type of redeployment, but when you push this definition to its logical conclusion and take it to the outskirts and to land adjacent and contiguous, you come upon the seriousness of this matter. The land contiguous may be in depth. It may be laterally on site or on the roadway, but it may be in depth as well.  I am with the Minister when he talks about urban areas where it may be necessary and desirable to acquire a parcel of land adjacent or contiguous to an area which it is desirable to redevelop or renew, but I would <Col N="1255" /> urge on him the danger of widening the definition we have here.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jones said that the logical conclusion one could reach would be that we would go right out into the suburbs when dealing with the renewal of some built-up area, that that could be regarded, in some logical way, as contiguous or adjacent to a modern town centre.  I would say it is a misuse of the word &ldquo;logical&rdquo;; he should have used the word &ldquo;illogical&rdquo;.  When we look at the problem that redevelopment and urban renewal will create for the country as a whole, and for the cities, particularly the older cities, and if we say that by reason of the action of some mad manager, engineer or other person, we could regard this provision as providing that for the renewal of an area down by the Liffey, we would go out to Ballyfermot and define that as adjacent or contiguous, surely that is so utterly mad that it must be regarded as an illogical conclusion, even though some people might be expected to describe it as a logical conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are still on the idea of the use of the word &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; in its narrow sense as applied to an obsolete area.  What that really means by reference to the word &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; may be confusing.  We might, of course, have used &ldquo;redevelopment areas&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;obsolete areas.&rdquo; It is a technical term to cover areas which are badly laid out and which, as such, require to be renewed or rebuilt in the best interests of the community as a whole.  I think it would be wrong for us to tie ourselves too much to &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already explained, the only reason, and a very pressing one it is, we want to get these &ldquo;contiguous&rdquo; or &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; terms in is really for the purpose of doing a better job.  What I would be inclined to suggest is that between now and Report Stage, I <Col N="1256" /> would seek to find, if I can, some formula of words that will more clearly define the taking in of contiguous or adjacent land and provide that the taking in of such land would be allowed or allowable only in cases where the additional land was required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like the Minister to think that we are unreasonable or illogical about this because we have approached it as logically as we can.  It was not a case of the land stretching from the Liffey to Ballyfermot I was envisaging.  I was envisaging a smaller area, or smaller towns or centres of population, where you have, say, some narrow streets or unsightly places which eventually the local council decides are obsolete areas.  There might be some virgin land on each side of it, contiguous to it, as it says in the Bill. That is what we want to look after. Deputy Burke referred to the compulsory powers needed and I suppose that does apply to Dublin, and there have been various Acts referring to Dublin, but we are legislating for the whole country.  The local authority of which I have the honour of being a member never had much difficulty in acquiring land because our policy has been that when land was available in the green belt, we bought it, whether or not we needed it.  We were criticised about this but the land always came in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, we are not illogical about this.  We were thinking in terms of fields or farms or accommodation land from which a man might make a living&mdash;a market garden or some such land.  When legislation such as this is being considered, we have to take cognisance of these people.  They have their rights as citizens as well.  As <Col N="1257" /> I said before, if there were a better policy of agreement in setting up a machine with local authorities and managers and officials, and giving discretion about buying this land, there would be no need to look for compulsory powers to acquire the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One point which I overlooked in regard to this situation of acquiring any man's land is that there is no difference from the codes of acquisition in force at the moment. We merely apply the same system of acquisition as in other cases.  The objection and the inquiry and the ultimate appeal to the High Court would still stand in any or all of the transactions.  I should like that to be fully understood, that the acquisition proceedings and the rights and safeguards in operation under other land acquisition Acts in the past are still the same and the procedure and formalities will remain unchanged, with the ultimate and final appeal to the High Court, if in fact that which has been decided with regard to acquisition seems to be <i>ultra vires.</i> That should be borne in mind, lest we get the idea that we are bringing in something new and are short-circuiting existing acquisition proceedings.  We are not proposing to shortcircuit them or the normal procedures of which we are all fully aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other point, which may be an extreme one, I admit, that is, that this matter of lands being &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; or &ldquo;contiguous&rdquo; could arise in the opposite way.  It is conceivable and possible that a man's land, by being adjacent and contiguous to an obsolete area on which a new development or redevelopment plan was proposed, could on the completion of the plan, be lessened in value by virtue of that plan.  This is something that may not arise often but could arise.  In whatever formula we may find, we will have to ensure that we do not prevent ourselves, or the local authorities, from acquiring the land of the man who is adjacent and whose property could be injured by redevelopment, if it were not brought in to the bigger redevelopment carried out.  That is the other side of the coin and it is something that we will have to safeguard <Col N="1258" /> in whatever formula we may find.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume he would have his rights in law but I could visualise its being a rather tenuous sort of argument and perhaps a very costly type of case, and, in the ultimate analysis, he would get less in compensation than it would cost him in court.  It is just a side to this that we have to have a look at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of explanation, I should point out that the phraseology used led me to be illogical and if, as the Minister says, another term had been used, it might not have led me to be illogical in this matter and would not perhaps have led me to say some of the things I did say.  I still maintain, in view of the definition, and considering the implications of the Bill, where we envisage this type of development plan, and an area being designated as this, that or the other, and instructions being issued after the plan is made, defining what will be put in certain areas, that this is very relevant when you take the obsolete or development area and relate it to land contiguous to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I did say that I wanted to take, if you like, two views, the urban view, where you need to do so, and equally a view on the type of area which is adjacent to other land.  The authority would have a right, as we know from later sections, to do certain things in regard to lands which they have included in the plan.  It is thinking in such terms, and of the Bill as a whole, that this seems to us to be a widening of this definition to the point of being dangerous.  When the Minister says he will have a further look at this between now and the next Stage and try to find some formula by which he would confine the application <Col N="1259" /> of this definition to what is necessary and desirable in regard to urban renewal, he is going part of the way to meet us.</P>
    <P>I want to assure him that the amendments we have put down in this respect are not illogical or unreasonable. They are offered as a logical corollary to the type of definition now included in the Bill.  We want to ensure, by discussion in this House, that we shall get the Minister's mind on this matter.  We want the Minister, from his logic, to put on the records of the House how illogical we are in asserting that such things might happen. It would then be on the record that the illogical aspect was from our side but at least we would get logic from the Minister and know his mind on what is presented to the House.</P>

      <P>The only places to which the public have access as of right should surely be public places.  What exactly has the Minister in mind in his definition of &ldquo;public places&rdquo;?

      <P>Deputy Jones's point, I think, is that, wherever the public must <Col N="1260" /> get permission to enter, the place is not public.  There are many places to which the public have access but not as of right or free of charge.  Take, for instance, the Powerscourt Demesne.

To a large degree, those places are there for the accommodation and entertainment of the public &mdash;not without the players, of course. These places are there to accommodate the public but the public are not there of right or free of charge in normal circumstances.  It is to enable control within such places frequented by the public though not of right and not free of charge&mdash;to control litterbugs and noise&mdash;that it is extended to places such as these.  We can exercise these controls in places that are not in the broad sense of the word public places but are places frequented by the public and to which the public have access even though they have no right to be there free of charge but pay to get in or enter by means of a free pass, and so on.  It is desirable that we should retain this so that we may apply it to these places which the public frequent.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment and the other amendments mentioned are very much associated with it.  The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear beyond doubt that an exempted development carried out on the appointed date, that is, the day this Bill becomes an Act, is not an unauthorised development. As the Bill is drafted at the moment, without &ldquo;on or&rdquo; before &ldquo;after,&rdquo; the 24 hours of the appointed day would be a sort of no man's land, belonging neither to the past nor the future.  That day would not be caught by the old law or the new law, and it would be a free-for-all.  If someone were energetic enough to get up early on the appointed day and carry out a development, he would not be caught by the old law or the new law.  This merely closes the 24 hour gap which existed as a result of an oversight in the original drafting.  That idea is carried right through the Bill.  There is no other change.</P>

The Deputy will probably notice that amendment No. 71 mentions the word &ldquo;commence&rdquo; rather than the two words &ldquo;on or&rdquo; but that is again in conformity with the whole idea right through of commencing at a given point of time and not just any time during the day appointed.

    <P>This amendment is really to preserve certain exemptions which certain statutory undertakers, such as CIE, enjoyed under the present laws and the laws <Col N="1266" /> in the past.  It is not conferring on them anything exceptional by way of new exemptions but is preserving rights they have.  I think it is fair that we should preserve rights they had been granted under earlier laws and which they have enjoyed up to the present. It is merely continuing these into the future.  The purpose of the amendment is to preserve that which is already in existence in so far as exemptions for statutory bodies is concerned, not giving anything in addition.</P>

      <P>This is one of the powers, again, that these people had, that were given to them.  It is a case of doctors differing again.  Here is the Minister with his Planning Bill.  We are endeavouring to preserve period houses, Georgian houses and so on, and we see bodies like the ESB and CIE or other semi-State companies being exempted by this section.  They put up buildings that the proud citizens of Dublin did not like.  I think they should not be exempted.  They have as great, and greater responsibility sometimes, as the ordinary citizen and even though they have been excepted in the past, there is no use in setting them up as sacred cows or sacred bulls, as if they could do no wrong, whereas the citizens can do wrong.  In the past, legislation was enacted which compelled somebody in some of the fine squares in Dublin or in any town or city to conform to certain standards but we cannot so compel these, our servants, the ESB, or CIE or Bord na MÓna or any of our public and State companies who may want to put up blocks of offices or buildings.  We should consider this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always taken the line that this House should be jealous of our powers; that we should be jealous of the powers of the elected representatives on local authorities.  We should be jealous of giving unlimited power to public companies, State companies. I would say to the Minister that this power should not be continued and <Col N="1267" /> that it should be provided in the Bill that these State companies should submit their plans and specifications to the local authority just the same as any ordinary citizen or company or industrialist would have to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we get any further off the line, may I say I entirely agree with Deputy Lynch on that matter?  The Deputy has a slightly erroneous conception.  I wondered did I do this; was I responsible for it.  In fact, these bodies in so far as the future is concerned, are being taken under the Bill but the amendment is merely to rectify a situation that exists as a result of the exemptions they have enjoyed over certain years. Under various enactments, certain structures of these statutory undertakers are already in existence.  If I did not put down this amendment or did not provide for it in regulations-which is what I had intended to do at first, but decided to put it in by specific amendment-these structures which were allowed to be built because of the exemption gained from past legislation, would on the passage of this Bill become unauthorised buildings.  In other words, they would be subject to being removed, although they were built because of exemptions granted under past laws.  Anybody would agree that that would be wrong.</P>
      <P>If they were allowed by exemption to do this in the past, we cannot come along now and say that as and from a certain date, the buildings are unauthorised and they may be asked to remove them.  This amendment applies only in so far as the structures they have built as a result of exemptions gained in past legislation and in preserving that exemption in regard to existing structures but it is not proposed to continue exemptions for similar structures in the future under the Bill, so that they will be subject to the new Bill.  This is to keep us from declaring unauthorised buildings which they have already erected because of exemptions under previous laws.</P>

      <P>I welcome this, and I welcome the Minister's attitude in <Col N="1268" /> relation to this matter.  This is the right way.  I always hoped that I would be here in Dáil Éireann when such things as this would happen, when a Minister would be tolerant enough to see eye to eye with members of the Opposition who would bring in amendments as the Minister has done in respect of amendments of this Party today.</P>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister agrees with me as far as public companies are concerned.  I can see the Minister's point and would not like to embarrass public companies that would have to take down buildings or alter buildings already in existence and which they legally put up and were legally entitled to put up.  But it is a good thing that this Bill sees to it that for the future, even though they are State companies, they will have to abide by the law of the land and will have to go to the local authority, the same as anybody else.  That is a very good idea and it will make for very good law.</P>

      <P>Supposing it is just a small change in structure, what will be the position?  Converting a house into a shop generally means just putting in a big window.  That is all that is required and it is a simple matter to change from a shop again back into a private house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be solely based on structural change.  That is not what we are trying to come at here at all; it is the use to which the structure <Col N="1270" /> is put.  A change of use, for instance, without any change in structure might have serious repercussions on neighbouring properties.  This provision is designed to control that.</P>
      <P>There is, too, another sad aspect.  In the city of Dublin, and in other cities, where housing is scarce, and has been scarce for a number of years, it is hard on the Minister and the local authority to see perfectly good dwellings being changed in their use because of the increase in commercial growth, while, at the same time, they are hard put to it to provide houses.  Large private dwellings coming on the market are changed into offices or showrooms at a time when there are still not enough private houses for our people.  At the moment that cannot be controlled.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In subsection (7), page 8, line 37, and lines 41 and 42, to delete &ldquo;consider will be included&rdquo; and substitute in each case &ldquo;have decided to include&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the section is drafted, it provides:</P>
      <P>(a)  the references to the provisions of the development plan shall, until that plan is made, be construed as references to the provisions which the planning authority consider will be included in that plan;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the references to the provisions of any special amenity area order relating to the area of the planning authority shall be construed as including references to any provisions which the planning authority consider will be <Col N="1271" /> included in a special amenity area order relating to their area.</P>
    <P>I think there should be a more positive approach here.  We were speaking earlier of the kind of liaison we hope will operate as between the elected representatives and the official responsible for the drawing up of development plans or the creation of amenity areas.  As the subsection is drafted, the approach here is not a positive one. It says &ldquo;will be included&rdquo;.  Surely when the planning authority gets down to considering the area which falls for administration under the local authority, they will at that stage have considered all these matters and have had discussions with the members of the local authority in question on the final determination.</P>
    <P>According to the provision here, until the plan is made, we will continue the approach by stipulating that it may be considered as one that &ldquo;will be included&rdquo; in a development plan or a special amenity area.  The public will be placed in the position that, until the plan is completed, things may happen of which they will not be aware but which will be in the mind of the planner for inclusion at some future stage.  There ought to be a more positive approach and we suggest the deletion of &ldquo;will be included&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of &ldquo;have decided to include&rdquo;.  In that way, the reference to the development plan has reference to what the planning authority decide to include.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I find rather out of line in this amendment is that there was mention earlier of what would happen between the appointed day, the coming into operation of this piece of legislation, and the date of a plan coming into operation in a particular planning area, that since three years are being allowed to do this, there would be a sort of vacuum.  If this amendment were accepted, then, until a plan had been decided, nothing whatever could be done in regard to a planning application or, should I say what is more likely, nothing need be done and a planning application may be lying there and no decision <Col N="1272" /> need be given until, in conformity with this amendment, a decision had been taken to include this, that or the other in the plan.  That would be stagnation at its worst, apart altogether from the annoyance and frustration it would cause to any person or group who wanted to do any particular things that required permission.</P>
      <P>The idea is that the planning authority should be enabled to make decisions on applications before and during the interim while their plan is being prepared on the basis of and having regard to what they intend will be included in the plan rather than that they would have to go through, as they would be required to do, the formality of getting a decision which would include the council saying: &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and the whole paraphernalia.</P>
      <P>It is in order to make it more flexible for the administration but more particularly for the convenience of the public that we put this in, that the local authority or planning authority should take into consideration what will be included in the plan and not as the amendment says, what has been decided should go into the plan, which would leave everything up in the air for considerably longer than if the section is left as we propose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that a development plan or an amenity area is something which, having been created by the planners, will have been adopted by the local authority?  Is that the accepted sense of the amenity area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says, power is given to somebody to deal with an interim period.  Do I take it that, if applications are made prior to the implementation of a development plan, some official-in this case it would be the county manager or his advisers-would  give permission to an individual to carry out certain developments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, they would have decided at that stage what was going to be in the development plan prior to the acceptance of it by <Col N="1273" /> the elected representatives of the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a right point there but he cannot have it both ways.  Undoubtedly, in this interim, whatever length it may be, from six months to three years, the adviser to the manager on planning appeals will no doubt be the person responsible for the preparation from a technical point of view of the plan which will ultimately go before the council for their approval or disapproval.  If he is engaged on the preparation of a plan, all wisdom will point to his being consulted on these interim applications because of the implications they may have as against what he will propose as a technical adviser.</P>
      <P>That being so, it seems much more reasonable that rather than have the individual applicant for permission held up, we should take that little chance of allowing them to be dealt with in the normal way by the manager, advised as he would be, by his advisers and, in this case, probably advised by the man preparing the ultimate plan for the area.  That man in giving his advice and the manager in turn in accepting that advice would be enabled to consider what they intended to put before the council&mdash;in other words, what they as technical people would put up to the council as their recommendations. Under the terms of this subsection, they would be able to determine an application for permission on the basis of what they, from their examination of the situation, had decided they were going to recommend to their council. The elected council would ultimately determine what the plan was going to be in all its aspects.  They could ensure during this interim that applications coming along for their determination should be notified to them so that they could have steps taken that would bring up an appeal to the Minister lest something is done with which they disagree later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage we must consider, more than the rights of the elected representatives, the rights of applicants for permission who, if they are to wait the taking of formal decisions, may be frustrated, annoyed and held up in <Col N="1274" /> their business.  It is a question of one or the other and if there is any appearance of taking something from the council it is because the public whom the council represent are entitled to that little leeway rather than have to stand around until decisions are taken.  There is the right of appeal from the decision and the process can go on but the other way would be imposing on the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>While seeing the point the Minister has made, I think he will agree that where there is a development plan and an amenity area and where there is an interim period, there may be people making applications to do certain things.  For instance, under the development plan we may locate industries in certain areas or define certain areas as residential areas or areas that should be reserved for the public or should be reserved as green open spaces.  Therefore, before the elected representatives or, indeed, the public would have the opportunity of considering this, we would find ourselves in the dangerous situation that it could be opposed.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would examine the implications contained in the wording of this provision?  He agrees there is a danger that we are by-passing public representatives of this kind and, in fact, by-passing the rights of the individuals in the area because some official may give permission for something to be done in an area ahead of the development plan, or may give permission which may result in creating or even destroying an amenity.  From that point of view, we feel this definition is much too wide and that it should be much more positive. The planning authority ought to have the decision to include it or not.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the Deputy's concern and I also want to safeguard the situation, but I think that the idea of the council asking the manager&mdash;I think they would need to requisition him&mdash;to ensure that during this interim period any decisions he may have to take or certain specific types of decisions should be brought to the notice of the council lest such <Col N="1275" /> a decision might restrict or frustrate the council's ultimate plan is unnecessary. What I suggest, particularly where an amenity order may be under consideration, is that the council might proceed to get those amenity areas defined beforehand, in fact as the first step, before the adoption of an overall plan.  They are entitled to do that with the co-operation of the manager and his staff, which I have no doubt they will get, and so avoid the spoiling of that area or part of it.</P>
      <P>There is also the amenity area or partial plan for a particular part of the town or countryside.  The council could require the manager to bring to their notice any application that he might be called on to determine during the interim.  Even where there is no special amenity area the situation could be safeguarded by co-operation between the officials and the council concerned.  These safeguards should be adequate for any normal council and I have no fear whatever that any decision taken, because of the way this matter is dealt with in the Bill, will restrict or frustrate the intentions of the local authority in the future.</P>

      <P>I think that will be a matter for the council themselves. Where I can avoid it I am loath to intervene where the council are quite capable of doing it and should do it themselves by requiring the manager to do these things.  Since the 1934 legislation was brought into operation all the decisions reached have been arrived at on the basis of what the local authority consider will be the plan for the future.  We have been doing that for almost 30 years in effect. The safeguards in the interim will be even better than what we had in the past 30 years.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not consider that quarrying can be a very serious disturbance in an area?  I had hoped that quarrying would be covered in this section.  We have a proposal at the moment to carry on quarrying in a big way in a residential area.  Quarrying means the setting up of crushing plants.  There may be good reasons for doing it, but under town planning, we <Col N="1278" /> should be in a position to control that sort of activity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, I should have elaborated further.  We were talking in the context of working in or under the ground when I said quarrying, as such, was exempted.  I should have qualified that by saying that the work of quarrying should be carried on in such a manner as not to injure amenities and to conform with any orders made under Parts IV and V of the Bill.  If crushing plants were erected, they would be caught by the term &ldquo;structure&rdquo; already in the Bill. If the quarrying operations were such as seriously to injure the amenities of the people living around, that would have to be considered.  The exemption would be conditional on the operations not seriously injuring anybody's amenities.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the amenities of an area being ruined by quarrying, not only by the dust from the stone crushers but also by the noise of these machines thumping away all day.  We dealt with noise in another part of the Bill, when the Minister gave us the welcome news that he was aware of the nuisance of transistor sets with Elvis Presley singing against our traditional singers, while somebody else listens to a soccer match.</P>
      <P>We should see to it that the amenities of our country areas are preserved. Most of these quarries are being set up in country areas.  Whether it is a local authority or private enterprise is doing the quarrying, it is important that the quarries be fenced off.  The fencing should take place when the quarrying is about to commence.  Deputies have seen what happens.  They move into the place where they are going to quarry and knock down the existing fences.</P>

      <P>It arises on development. <Col N="1280" /> Though it may not be completely appropriate, I think if a Deputy wants to point out to the Minister something that is a public nuisance, he should be allowed do so.  I would ask you to bear with me in this, Sir.  It is very important that these quarries should not be left open to children or anybody else.  They are incentives to itinerants to settle in an area.  It is as well to mention these points when legislation such as this is going through.  I am directing attention to the noise, the dust created by the quarrying and, lastly, to the nuisance caused by local authorities or public enterprise who knock down the fences and start quarrying, leaving the whole place open for trespass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that the question of quarries could be included as appropriately as could derelict or obsolete sites?  Surely a derelict site is very dangerous and should be considered in legislation of this sort?  While I agree we should not bring into the discussion recent quarry tragedies, at the same time, this is the first Bill introduced which makes it possible to refer to them since they occurred.  I know the Minister is as anxious as anybody else to do something about dangerous quarries and he should, therefore, take the opportunity presented here.</P>

      <P>I want to get back to amendment No. 25 again &mdash; to the words &ldquo;, in, or under&rdquo;.  I was very pleased to see that amendment because I felt here we had something that gave us power to control quarries. Quarrying is a job which is done under land and it is very desirable we should be in a position to control it.  At the moment we are not in a position seriously to oppose somebody coming into a residential area, opening a quarry, setting up a crushing plant which need not necessarily be a structure as the Minister said.  Such operations can cause a great deal of trouble to ordinary people in residential areas.  Many of them feel seriously aggrieved about such activities.  At the moment apparently there is inadequate power to deal with it.  The value of property adjacent to such operations can be seriously <Col N="1281" /> diminished overnight and this seems to me to be the ideal opportunity to introduce control.</P>

      <P>The section as it stands would prevent a person from keeping a caravan on his land over the winter, even though the land might be his own.  Nowadays many people go on caravan holidays during the summer and bring their caravans home to park it on their lands during the winter.  Under this section as it stands that would be an offence.  If a man wanted to keep his caravan on his land during the winter he would have to get permission from the local authority.  Even if he kept the caravan there overnight he might be committing an offence.  I suggest that the section as it stands would inordinately interfere with the rights of individuals in that respect.</P>

    <P>Caravanning has become very popular in the past few years.  A great many families nowadays take their own caravans and move to the seaside <Col N="1283" /> during the summer.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The short-haul jet aircraft are required because Aer Lingus find themselves in an increasingly uncompetitive position as almost all their competitors on the Continental routes are operating jets.  The European services cover 25 per cent of the traffic excluding the transatlantic services. The total cost of aircraft at present on order for Aer Lingus and Aerlínte, including supporting equipment and development expenses, is about £7½ million, of which £2 million will be provided in the form of equity capital by the Exchequer.  The Exchequer contribution will be spread over a number of years starting in 1964-65.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes do not provide for grants specifically described as resettlement grants.  They provide for retired pay, pensions and gratuities for officers, non-commissioned officers and privates, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>An officer eligible for retired pay who was in receipt of pay as a married officer for two years prior to retirement is also eligible for a married officer's gratuity but not for a married pension. A married non-commissioned officer or private in receipt of a pension is also eligible for a married pension, but not for a gratuity.</P>
      <P>An officer, non-commissioned officer or private who has insufficient service to qualify for retired pay or pension is eligible for a gratuity based on length of service, provided he has certain minimum service.  The normal qualifying period for a gratuity is five years for an officer and three years for a non-commissioned officer or private.</P>
      <P>An officer retiring on age grounds is eligible for twenty-eight days' preretirement leave with pay and allowances and a non-commissioned officer or private is eligible for pre-discharge leave with pay and allowances up to a maximum of ninety-one days in the case of those with twenty-one years' service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Defence Force Regulations governing promotion in the Reserve of Officers (First Line) provide for promotion, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions, from the rank of second-lieutenant to lieutenant and lieutenant to captain.  For promotion from lieutenant to captain, the conditions include a minimum period of full-time service during the Emergency. Once the conditions are fulfilled, promotion is effected and no question of seniority arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the case of at least one officer who served in a commissioned rank in the Army during the Emergency and who then applied for admission to the Regular Army where he served as an officer for six years?  He was then posted, at his request and by agreement with the Army authorities, to the Reserve of Officers.  He still holds the rank of the lieutenant, although he served six years in the Regular Army <Col N="1295" /> and has a substantially longer period of service in the Regular Army than many of those who were promoted over him and who did not serve in the Regular Army at all.  Is the Minister aware that this officer was initially informed in July of last year that it was anticipated that promotion proposals which were then before the Department of Finance would, when sanctioned, result in his promotion.  He has since heard nothing about the matter.</P>

      <P>The matter of improving the promotion arrangements in the Reserve is under consideration.  No final result has yet been achieved.  I cannot give, by way of supplementary answer, a satisfactory reply to the Deputy.  I would refer him to paragraph 6 of Rialacháin Óglaigh na hÉireann R.1., which he will get in the Library.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>This officer was informed on 3rd July, 1962, by the Department&mdash;I assume the regulations were issued before then&mdash;in the following terms: &ldquo;I tell you that officers with your service qualify immediately under this scheme.&rdquo;&mdash;that is, qualify for promotion immediately under the scheme.  That was a promise made in July, 1962, apparently on the authority of the Chief of Staff.  I take it the Department of Defence will honour this, particularly as this officer has emergency service for more than three years and Regular Army service for six years which is service which is not held by others who are on the Reserve of Officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was talking about the automatic telephone system, and particularly the one in Kildare.  There has been quite an amount of improvement in the past two weeks, and I believe the Minister took the matter up with his Department.  When we are buying very expensive machinery, sufficient care should be taken to ensure that it will be trouble-free.  When we are buying a new car, we like to know that we will be able to drive it without trouble.  The engineers of the Department should examine the machinery thoroughly before it is put into public use.  It is grand to have an automatic system, but it is rather irritating when one tries to get a number and cannot do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Naas, there is a bone of contention. Naas is only a couple of miles outside the limit for local calls to Dublin.  Sixty or 70 per cent of the business in Naas is with Dublin, and <Col N="1298" /> it would be considered an honour if Naas were included in the Dublin area.  So far as I know, it extends to Johnstown, which is just a couple of miles away, and since so much business is done with Dublin and as calls are much dearer now, it would facilitate the business people and the general public if Naas could be included in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Postmen's uniforms have been the same and made from the same type of material, for as long as I remember. Since the Army are getting new uniforms for the proposed visit of the President of the United States, perhaps something could be done to provide better material with a better cut for the postmen's uniforms. That would make them look smarter.  As it is, after one heavy shower of rain, the uniform goes completely out of shape and becomes baggy.  Postmen would like to have distinctive and smart uniforms.</P>
    <P>More important is the provision of a pension scheme for auxiliary and unestablished postmen.  Most good employers now have superannuation or pension schemes in operation.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs should consider providing some such scheme.  Those men have worked for 20, 30 or 40 years delivering the post, and it is hard on them that when they reach the age of 70 years, they have no pension or superannuation scheme to cover them.  Such schemes are in operation in every State body.</P>
    <P>Those men are paid by the hour, and in quite a number of cases, they get a very low wage per week.  Would the Minister look into the possibility of getting them a decent weekly wage for the very important work they do delivering the post around the countryside? They are paid on an hourly basis and they have a rather tight schedule.  I know it is the duty of the Department to see that the post is delivered as early as possible, but something could be done to give those men a good week's wages.  I know of some cases where men deliver the post in the mornings, are let off for three or four hours, and have to come back in the evening.  That breaks up the whole day, and they are paid only for the actual time they are working.  That <Col N="1299" /> leaves them with a rather small wage packet at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>If more use were made of heavy cables, I believe there would be less trouble from storms and high winds and fewer phones out of order.  There would not be so much danger of the wind breaking a heavy cable.  Where there are ten to 14 telephone wires on a post, swaying in the wind, it is natural that in a storm or snowfall, they will break and there will be trouble in repairing them.  A small twig falling on a wire can put the telephone out of order.</P>
    <P>In 1957, a new cable was laid between Dublin and Sligo.  In the past few days, I have noticed repairs or extensions being made to the cable between Leixlip and Maynooth.  There should be sufficient foresight in planning and laying cables to ensure they will have the capacity to cater for anticipated needs for ten or 20 years ahead.  I understand a new cable is being laid.  I notice excavations on the road every couple of hundred yards and I have seen the roll of heavy cable lying there waiting to be put down.  It is rather strange that in the short space of three years, the need to lay another cable should arise.  I should like to see better planning which would obviate such necessity.</P>
    <P>This country must be a joy to philatelists, having regard to the variety and number of new stamps issued.  The pages of stamp albums devoted to specimens of Irish origin must be completely taken up.  Stamp collecting is becoming very popular with children. That is a good thing because usually the stamp conveys some idea of the country or some important aspect of its history.  Sales of Irish stamps to philatelists must be pretty substantial.  I understand a new stamp will be issued in September.  I should like to see brighter colours used in our stamps.  The present issue of the 4d. stamp features freedom from hunger.  That is a subject that we do not like to dwell on in 1963.  In future issues dealing with brighter topics, I should like to see brighter and livelier colours used.  I used to collect stamps when I was a boy and it is my experience <Col N="1300" /> that other countries produce stamps of great variety and bright colour.  I recommend that idea to the authorities to be borne in mind in respect of future issues.</P>
    <P>The 2d. stamp has been the same as long as I can remember.  I would suggest that it be given a new look.</P>
    <P>May I return to the subject of postmen, with which I have already dealt? It is very difficult for a postman to get permission from the Department to use his motor bike or autocycle on his rounds.  The use of a motor bicycle would mean that the post would be delivered more expeditiously.  If a man has a motor bicycle he should be allowed to use it.</P>
    <P>The Authority is to be complimented on the TV programmes for the past year.  The range has been wide and the programmes have been very suitable. Parents have told me that they are quite happy to allow their children to view programmes produced by Telefís Éireann.  The programmes are well selected and of a high quality.  The amount of advertising time they are able to sell shows that the programmes presented are popular.  It would be too much to expect that there would be no criticism.  However, having regard to the comparative expenditure on programmes, the quality of the programmes presented by Telefís Éireann compares very favourably with that of the programmes presented by UTV or BBC.  The majority of Irish people consider that the Telefís Éireann programmes are superior to UTV and BBC programmes.  A certain proportion of the programmes presented by Telefís Éireann are canned programmes but the live programmes are exceptionally good.  It was a surprise to some people that the variety shows and dramas presented by Telefís Éireann are of such high quality.  It does not surprise me.  Having regard to the wonderful work performed by the Abbey Theatre over the years, I would expect good plays from them.</P>
    <P>Amateur dramatic productions have become very popular.  There was an audience of roughly about 10,000 for plays produced during the recent drama festival.  It is good to see such public support for amateur dramatics. <Col N="1301" /> I would suggest that some of the plays produced for the festival should be televised.  Perhaps so much time per week might be devoted to such programmes. It may not be considered worth while equipping a local hall for the purpose of a television programme lasting a quarter of an hour or half an hour but it would be great encouragement to local societies to have plays produced by them televised.  The local communities would benefit and the programmes would be enhanced.</P>
    <P>The plays and concerts I have attended have been very enjoyable. The artistes taking part in them have spent months preparing for the productions. It would provide a great incentive to these people if they felt that at some stage they might be selected for television, particularly if the production took place in the local background.</P>
    <P>To recapitulate the items I have raised, I should like the Minister to bear in mind a greater use of heavy cables for telephones, new uniforms for postmen, a pension scheme and an examination of the automatic system equipment before it is put into use generally.</P>

      <P>The Minister, as far as I heard him correctly, said at Question Time today that I was in the habit of making unfounded insinuations in relation to his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say now that no single insinuation I have made in relation to the Minister's Department has ever been found wrong when it has been examined in my presence or when I have been offered the opportunity of verifying the examination. The Minister has a habit of arranging in his Department examinations of complaints that are made, without giving the other party any opportunity of being present or submitting evidence in support of the complaint.  That is not the way to do <Col N="1302" /> things.  There was a case the other day &mdash;I repeat the charge I made&mdash;in which an inspector of the Minister's Department pushed into a house and, if the Minister likes to accept his report instead of my allegation, I am prepared to have the matter dealt with by means of a sworn inquiry.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I want to repeat that in Kildare there is a Newbridge number, which I will give the Minister any time he wants it, in relation to which there were complaints of bad service.  An inspector of the Department came out and, in the presence of the subscriber, dialled 25 times.  In eight of the 25 dials, a correct answer was produced, whether it was engaged or whether it was the right number; 17 produced the wrong number or failed to get any dialling tone at all.  That could well be, but what infuriates the people in Kildare is that this is considered to be a normal practice and the Minister is not the least put out about it.  In fact, this particular inspector said he thought he had got a good average; other people were in a worse condition.  If others are in a worse condition than eight out of 25, then it means that the telephone system is completely chaotic and has completely broken down.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Newbridge-Curragh Camp installation, I have made every excuse because it was a new automatic installation, but the Naas installation is not new.  Ask any number you like in Naas and you will be told that, on automatic dialling, they never succeed in getting the right contact in better than one out of three.  That is a wretched average and it is one which will make business utterly impossible if it continues.  As far as I am concerned, I am not in Naas dialling in the daytime; I am there only in the evening.  But I know the situation.  I know it on the odd occasions on which I am there during the day.  If you get one right out of three&mdash;by &ldquo;right&rdquo; I do not mean succeeding in getting a reply from the number; I mean getting the right tone after you have done your dialling showing whether it is engaged or getting an answer&mdash;you are lucky.  That is a regular thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> I have been sitting by my own telephone and people have told me they have dialled and could get no response. My phone has not rung. Officials have come out and told me, and I accept their word without question, that there is nothing wrong with the ringing end of my apparatus.  It must therefore be something wrong with the automatic working of the system.  When a person dials a number from Dublin, it does not ring the right number in Naas.  I know myself that on my own direct dialling, I consider I have got a good result if I get one out of three correct.  That is my personal experience.  Any system that works in that fashion is a hindrance to business and not the asset the telephone should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice from the Minister's statement which he made prior to the Budget that he records again a fall in telegraph traffic and indicates that during 1962/63 the decline was over five per cent as compared with a one per cent decline last year.  The Minister stated, however, that the decline occurred mostly in traffic with Great Britain and, to a lesser extent, in internal traffic.  I wonder if the Minister could give any idea as to what the percentage fall in traffic is in respect of traffic originating internally as compared with traffic originating externally.  We cannot, of course, control the external traffic and we must put up with whatever recession there is from that source, but I should like to ascertain from the Minister whether even the home traffic is holding up or whether the decline is jointly over the internal traffic and the external traffic. If the Minister has any figures on the subject.  I should like to get them from him when he is replying.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said in the course of his statement that certain progress has been made in respect of the erection of the new sorting and central delivery office in Dublin.  He said :</P>
      <P>The foundation and steel erection works were somewhat delayed by unexpected water level difficulties and by bad weather but the work is now progressing satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> While I know that the building operations are in their infancy could the Minister, now that we have started to erect the building, give any idea, even approximately, when is it likely to be available for the purpose for which it is being erected.  I take it some targets in point of time have already been set and, while not being bound to these targets because of the magnitude of the task, perhaps the Minister could, nevertheless, give us a picture as to when the new office is likely to be available.</P>
    <P>The Minister took pride in the fact that the Post Office, as one of the largest employers of labour in the country, was keenly conscious of the vital need for keeping abreast of developments in modern management techniques and that various members of the staff had done courses during the past year in management.  The Minister is quite justified in taking pride in the excellent work which the Post Office have done in the field of management techniques and I personally would like to be associated with the congratulations to the Post Office on these developments.  It took a long time to get the Post Office into the 20th century but now that they have come into it, they appear to enjoy the environment and the salubrious air and to realise that the Post Office is not run by one small section but that it takes the man in the field and on the bog road as well as the gentlemen in high administrative offices to make a service of that kind possible.  I appreciate it.</P>
    <P>However, I make one criticism, that this good idea is being distributed in a rather meagre fashion.  There is still plenty of scope for the further development of these management techniques down through the staffs.  I should like to see the ordinary staff of the offices brought within the ambit of these management techniques, with the idea that the co-operation between the administrative staff would be more widely spread and that the general idea should be imparted to the staff of all grades that this is a great public service, a great common co-operative endeavour to give the whole community the benefit of whatever service the Post Office can provide for them <Col N="1305" /> The aim should be to give the most efficient possible service and to make available to the staff the best possible conditions in return for administering an efficient and helpful service of that kind.  I hope that, emboldened by the success of what has already been done, the Post Office will proceed further in the extension of these management techniques, which are not only good for the Post Office but could be spread through the public service generally because of the manifold advantages to be gained by promoting that kind of co-operation and goodwill.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have to complain again this year about the Post Office uniform.  The Post Office uniform is distinctive in this respect, that it is probably the worst kind of uniform used in the entire public service.  It is a shoddy and dust-gathering type of material.  It is a raggy-looking uniform when worn for a short time.  You cannot press it or crease it and if by the exercise of a lot of muscularity with the iron, you manage to get a temporary crease, then the first shower of rain disturbs completely the whole shape of the uniform.</P>
    <P>I should imagine the Post Office would be more pleased and that rational people generally in any clime would be more pleased to see their staff clad in a proper uniform.  The result of Post Office staff wearing this shoddy uniform is that the postman <i>vis-á-vis</i> the public is not presenting the tidy appearance he would present if he got a decent class of uniform.  I am not referring to the design of the uniform.  It cannot be said as an argument that the staff organisation accepted this uniform.  They accepted the design.  They have been complaining for years about the inferior quality of the cloth used, and the Post Office ought to make a serious effort to provide a much better cloth than is being used at the moment.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in respect of caps.  I understand it is not possible to get a supply of postmen's caps from the manufacturers and I understand the reason is that no cap manufacturer would make this cap for the Post Office at the very low price which the <Col N="1306" /> Post Office offer.  The result is that the cap manufacturer who will take these orders for caps is a manufacturer who wants to keep his machinery going during a valley period, but if there is any other order in sight, he will take the other order and by-pass the Post Office order for caps because he regards the price he is given as altogether unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Post Office ought to face up to the necessity for providing decent caps and providing them regularly for their staffs, instead of trying to induce manufacturers to accept orders for caps at a price which they do not regard as economically rewarding, with the result that the only cap that is available is a poor one and even that cannot be got with any regularity. The Post Office ought to get away from this miserly approach to the whole question of uniform, especially when so many members of the staff have to appear in public and would naturally like to take a pride in their appearance, the same as any other servant of the community.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Post Office buildings. The Board of Works circulates each year a list of the proposed works which it intends to carry out for the various Departments.  The Post Office has the usual quota of building construction on its programme.  What strikes one is that the amount of money spent in facing up to the problem of providing adequate accommodation for the ever-expanding Post Office is not nearly sufficient to undertake the work and that the small amounts allocated and the relatively small amount of work done each year results in the Post Office having to carry on their important public services in buildings which are inadequate, where there is insufficient staff accommodation and where the public endeavour to transact business under conditions far from congenial.</P>
    <P>In his statement, the Minister referred to the fact that more administrative power would be given to the Post Office and that they would be entitled to exercise autonomy in fields where they were previously denied it. The Post Office should make a <Col N="1307" /> serious effort to get more authority than they have for their building programme.  Even when the Post Office can be convinced&mdash;which is not easy without very cogent arguments&mdash;that there is need for very substantial extension of a post office premises they in turn must go to the Board of Works which, they find, are inadequately staffed for the job they have to do of looking after the affairs of all the Departments of State.  The result is that the Post Office, although dealing virtually every hour of the day with the public&mdash;it is probably used by the public more than any other State building&mdash;have to fight their way to get their repairs and extensions carried out in competition with other Departments of State.</P>
    <P>The Post Office should endeavour to secure more authority for building offices, repairing existing offices and carrying out painting and decoration when due instead of the present position of being absolutely dependent on the Board of Works.  Everybody with experience of public life knows that if you rely on the Board of Works you will not get fire brigade service. Therefore, the Minister should try, in this case where it is so important to the Post Office organisation and development, to persuade the Department of Finance that the Post Office should be able to accelerate their building, their repair and renovation programme much more than at present.  The process of going through the Board of Works, whatever may be said for it in theory, results in practice in much foot-dragging and the postponement of building and reconstruction jobs that could be done much quicker if the methods used were less circumlocutory.</P>
    <P>Some head offices and salaried suboffices have residences attached.  When a vacancy is advertised, the successful applicant is duly informed that he is being appointed to the vacant position. In most cases he does not belong to the town where the vacancy exists but his time for promotion has arrived and he may be selected for promotion to an office in a place of which he is <Col N="1308" /> not a native and where he has no roots.  He sets out to find a house only to discover that he cannot get one or if there is one available the price is so outrageously high that he cannot think of buying it.  Neither can he think of renting because of local competition which does not make it a proposition.  He cannot buy it out of anything he would accumulate from his service in the Post Office.  The result, in a number of cases, is that the person promoted to postmastership is compelled to decline the promotion even though he keenly desires it because there is no residence attached to the office.</P>
    <P>A large number of offices have residences but some have none and where a person is appointed to an office of the latter kind unless he is miraculously lucky in getting a residence locally he must decline the appointment. He must then apply all over again when another vacancy arises.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government have in a praiseworthy manner set up on organisation known as the Housing Agency and through it it is possible to have houses built for key employees in industries, for Gardai and other important persons of that kind.  Surely the Post Office should take advantage of this housing agency by having residences erected in each town where there is no official Post Office residence at present so that when an officer is appointed on promotion to such a town it could be done in the knowledge that he could move into a residence there provided for him by the Post Office?</P>
    <P>Being promoted to an office with a residence is a common feature of Post Office employment since the commencement of the Post Office as a State agency.  In some cases, for one cause or another, residences were not provided but it seems to me that if the Post Office rightly promote people from one part of the country to another they should at least ensure that there is a residence available for the promoted officer.  The Gardaí and private industries avail of this agency and seeing that the Post Office already know that people have been compelled to refuse promotion because of the <Col N="1309" /> lack of a residence, they ought to consider asking the agency to provide houses where necessary.</P>
    <P>May I suggest that some effort should be made to accelerate the payments to retiring officers?  The Post Office has records to tell them the day every officer reaches 65 years of age and in 98 per cent of the cases the man retires automatically on reaching that age.  Therefore, there is no reason why his pension and lump sum could not be dealt with by the Post Office.  On the day the officer retires, he could get his weekly pension and his lump sum automatically without having the case sent to the Department of Finance where it is one case in a number of others affecting other Government Departments.  The person who retires does not emigrate.  He is here in the country.  He can always be sent for if there is any short payment of his pension and lump sum.  If he is overpaid, it can be explained to him that there was an overpayment.  But you can be sure that the prospects of fallibility on that side, as far as the administrative machine is concerned, are exceedingly small.</P>
    <P>The Post Office ought to get authority to pay the pension and lump sum and then tell the Department of Finance: &ldquo;Here is what we have paid&rdquo; and get Finance to OK it subsequently. Instead of that, the pensioner has to wait or make an application for a payment on account, which may take a couple of weeks.  In any case, people feel if they have served the State for 40 or 45 years, that they ought to get the pension on the day or the week after they go out, instead of being put in the position of applying for a payment on account of the lump sum due to them.</P>
    <P>In some cases, the delay has been quite unjustified.  You may even discover that when it came to Finance, the officers dealing with it were on sick leave or something else.  The person still has to wait for his pension.  The Post Office do all the calculation about the pension.  It is merely checked by the Department of Finance.  The checking does not reveal the most microscopic proportion of irregularity. <Col N="1310" /> Why cannot the Post Office get the authority to make the calculation, which they make at present, and, instead of sending the case to Finance for approval, pay themselves and let Finance give approval afterwards whenever they get time to do so?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is the position in the Carlow post office.  For many years, representations have been made to have a new building provided in Carlow.  I do not know whether there are any difficulties between the local authority and the Post Office over a site, but certainly this is one of the smallest offices in Ireland for the volume of business transacted in it.  It is located in the worst possible place.  Although the Post Office have been hearing this complaint for years, all the inconveniences associated with the present office continue.  I should like the Minister to say, first, when he hopes the building of the automatic exchange in Carlow will be completed; secondly, when he hopes the building of the new post office will commence; and thirdly, what is the approximate target date for completing the building.  Certainly the matter ought to be taken in hands speedily, because everybody who has any experience of the present office knows it is absolutely unsuitable for the transaction of the volume of business which has to be dealt with there.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to this question of telephone operating.  I want to say at the outset it is the experience of everybody who has any experience whatever of telephone operating that the situation in the telephone exchanges today is more chaotic than it has ever been in their experience.  If the Minister went to see retired officers in the telephone exchange and goes in with them to any of the exchanges in Dublin, they would tell him in their service they never saw anything like what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>I do not know what sort of reports the Minister gets, but the viewpoint of everybody, whether they use the telephone from outside or operate it from inside, is that the Post Office telephone service is in a parlous condition.  I want to give some evidence in support <Col N="1311" /> of this.  I invite the Minister to accept a few challenges on this.  Go in with somebody who knows what is happening. If a stranger goes into a post office, he might as well go into a nuclear station unless he knows what the meaning of the building is and what the significance of certain things are.</P>
    <P>I shall start off by giving my own experience recently.  I wanted to get a number in Kildare.  I dialled the number.  I could not get any answer from the number, although I knew there were people in the house at the time.  I then dialled &ldquo;10&rdquo; and it pipped away 80 times, that is, 160 pips. When you remember that ten pips are supposed to be the normal speed for an answer, you can get a picture of the type of service run when I was trying to use the telephone&mdash;180 times, each pip twice.  At the end of all this, I had not got any answer at all.  I then dialled &ldquo;31&rdquo; to get the supervisor. I dialled and it called 20 times, but I got no answer from the supervisor.  I thought perhaps I would be more lucky if I went back to &ldquo;10&rdquo;.  I went back to &ldquo;10&rdquo; and I called again&mdash;40 times it called&mdash;but there was no answer.  I put it down.  I waited for a while, took it up again and dialled &ldquo;10&rdquo;.  It pipped away for 32 times, 64 pips in all, and then I got an answer.</P>
    <P>That is what you get in war conditions. It represents complete and absolute chaos.  I do not know whether the Minister would attempt to give an answer to this kind of thing.  You remember the Post Office say that normally you should get an answer after five calls, that is, ten pips.  My marathon performance did not yield a single answer whatever.  What is the reason for that?  No soft talk from officials or smooth answers from the Minister in the House is going to explain what the situation is.  There is chaos there.  The whole objective in some cases seems to have been to put in more and more telephones, which meant, as the man said, a &ldquo;worser&rdquo; service for those who had telephones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed that out in a <Col N="1312" /> reply last year, that the addition of telephones <i>ad lib.</i> meant a worsening of the service until the whole business was cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is more than that wrong.  I do not think the telephone administration or equipment was at all prepared for the introduction of subscriber trunk dialling.  However, STD was introduced and it has been responsible for bringing more chaos into the telephone administration than any one single act.  The position now is that because of the chaos on the STD lines, the ordinary subscriber trying to get the telephonist is complaining about delay.  Whatever way the thing has been arranged mechanically, the subscribers now share the &ldquo;10&rdquo; lines with the telephonist. You may find that the subscribers have all the &ldquo;10&rdquo; lines and the telephonist has none of them.</P>
      <P>This ought to be said, and the Minister ought say it on behalf of his staff: the chaos is not due to the staff; it is due to an insufficiency of equipment and to a shortage of junctions and circuits. To some extent, it could be remedied by an increase in staff, but the basic problem is: too many installations on a service not at present capable of giving a good and efficient service.  The second factor is the introduction of the STD at a time when the telephone service was not prepared to cater for it because of a deficiency in cables, a deficiency in equipment, in junctions and in circuits.  These are the two main problems and the Post Office do not seem to have made the public aware of these difficulties.  In fact, my complaint is that though the Post Office know they are giving a bad service, they are trying to conceal the fact from the public and I will prove that in a few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is an example of the experiment the Post Office are subjecting the people of Newbridge to at the moment. It was decided to introduce there subscriber trunk dialling.  That was the greatest blister ever inflicted on the subscribers in that area.  It has caused absolute chaos.  A responsible man from Newbridge writes to me: <Col N="1313" /> No doubt you are aware of the extreme difficulty experienced with the new automatic telephone system which I believe to be Swedish and which has never before been put into operation anywhere in the world.  It is unfortunate that we in Ireland have to be the dogs on which this system is being tried out.</P>
    <P>This man goes on to say that no incoming call can be received at all and only on occasions can an outgoing call be made.  More often than not, there are four subscribers on the line at once and nothing can be heard.  This man's letter goes on:</P>
    <P>It is most frustrating and costly and I hope something can be done to correct it.</P>
    <P>Another gentleman was much more methodical in his complaint inasmuch as he took times and dates of the service, or lack of service, he got from the Post Office.  He says he dialled Dublin on such and such a date and he got Letterkenny.  From approximately 11.30 a.m. to 2 p.m., the engaged tone is heard when the receiver is lifted.  No telephone calls can be made from this man's telephone and no calls can be received.</P>
    <P>He tells of dialling Kildare to transact business and hearing two people discussing who stole timber from them. He dialled Kildare seven times between 2.7 o'clock and 2.44 p.m. and got the engaged tone.  Later, he found out that the line was not engaged on any of these occasions.  He then lists complaints of all sorts.  On another occasion, he dialled Dublin and got Blessington; he dialled Dublin and got the Curragh Camp; and while talking, a caller from Galway came on the line and said he was looking for the Curragh.  He dialled another Dublin number and got Sligo; he dialled Naas and got Clane.</P>
    <P>If some saboteur had been dropped out of the skies to make war on the telephone system and had succeeded in installing this kind of a telephone system around the Curragh Camp, our chief military establishment, and reported this result, when he went back to his own country, he would be <Col N="1314" /> decorated.  That is the kind of thing these people in Newbridge are suffering. There is chaos and dislocation of business in every possible way.  If an unfortunate linesman made the slightest mistake in fixing up a telephone, he would be writing explanations for a week, but when the top brass get to doing things and make this mess, everybody expresses regret but nothing is done.</P>
    <P>I have another instance of a lady who wrote to the Minister saying that night after night for the past six weeks her hotel guests have been trying to make cross-Channel calls between 7 p.m. and 11.30 p.m.  It takes them half an hour even to get through to the exchange.  Dialling 10 is useless.  This lady complained that the coin box of the telephone had become blocked by a coin.  Nothing was done during all that day.  She writes:</P>
    <P>Last night 16 persons from England, staying in the hotel, wanted to make telephone calls but could not use the box because a coin was stuck in it.</P>
    <P>A complaint was made to the Minister's office on 28th March.  Now, well over a month has gone by and nothing has transpired except that the matter is being inquired into.</P>
    <P>I said earlier I was afraid the Minister did not know about these complaints.  When a number of people made application to the Post Office for new telephones, they were told that there was no hope of getting telephones for at least 12 to 18 months and that there was no purpose in annoying the Post Office with applications. The Post Office added that when the period mentioned had elapsed, everything would be all right.  That is understandable if somebody, during the 12 to 18 months, is doing something to provide the conditions which would make it possible to instal telephones at the end of the period, but in fact nothing was done during the 18 months.  What happened was that the Post Office lumped out to the applicants a bundle of agreements to sign and the applicants signed them thinking that once they did so, they <Col N="1315" /> would have telephones in next to no time.  This happens despite the fact that the Post Office had not laid cables and therefore knew very well they could not provide the people with the service they had promised.</P>
    <P>Another instance was quoted to me where the Post Office were engaged in taking lines into the exchange of a head office from a number of sub-exchanges. The trouble was that the head office was not able to dispose of the calls they were already getting. What you need in that area is one other line to Dublin from that head office.  I said earlier the Post Office were even concealing their own shortcomings, so ashamed of them were they.</P>
    <P>Here is an instance which can be verified.  Recently, the Cork telephone exchange was unobtainable from 9 o'clock in the morning until 10.30.  There were no outlets to Cork.  You can get outlets to Cork, apart from the direct line.  You can through other places, but all the direct or indirect lines were out of order.  Notwithstanding that, instead of putting up the red flag and letting subscribers know that there was a substantial delay on calls to Cork, the post office merrily went on booking calls and never once disclosed that there was any abnormal delay on the Cork lines.  This went on and the staff urged that they should post delays on Cork so that subscribers would not be coming back every 15 or 20 minutes to know &ldquo;what about my call&rdquo;.  All this was causing confusion. This went on the whole day. The result was that every subscriber who had booked a call complained half a dozen times and these long delay dockets, which are issued when a person comes back a second time to ask about a delay, caused such confusion that there was nothing but chaos on the Cork line that day.</P>
    <P>The result was that calls booked at 10 o'clock in the morning to Cork on the particular day had not been put through at 5.30 in the evening.  Of course, at that stage, practically all of them would have been cancelled <Col N="1316" /> by subscribers who had to go home from their business, but never once did the post office say that there was a delay.  Why not tell the subscriber that he has no chance of getting a call through?  What is the purpose of concealing it?  Surely the first thing a subscriber should be told is that there is a delay and the length of the delay so that, if necessary, he can make other plans.  But if he books a call to Cork, in the expectation that he can talk with a friend inside half an hour or an hour and then seven or eight hours afterwards, he has not been able to get in touch with Cork, what can one think of an administration of that kind which conceals the vital facts from the subscribers?</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to remedy the position in the telephone exchange, he should take his courage in his hands and say frankly: &ldquo;With our present equipment, we are not able to give a satisfactory service.&rdquo;  He should take his courage in his hands, too, and stop the STD until such time as the equipment is able to take it, and by every means that he can, he should try to get sufficient trunk lines and junctions to take the traffic which is offering to-day. There are not sufficient trunk lines and there are not sufficient junctions to operate an efficient telephone service.  There should be more trunk lines and more junctions.</P>
    <P>Somebody should take the whole staff position into hands because it is being run on a panic basis.  Staff are being taken off day duties and switched to night duties, as if that is a remedy for anything.  The exchange is understaffed during the day because people are taken from day duties and put on to night duties.  There may be some master strategy attached to that but if there is, it is not obvious to me.  While the business community wants to work by day, it should have sufficient staff at its disposal.  What is the purpose of taking staff off day duties and putting them on night duty?  I cannot see it. Those who operate the telephone system do not appear to understand it either.  Within the office, staff are pulled from one position and sent to another and then sent chasing back and are moved around in this sort of fire brigade fashion to stop the worst <Col N="1317" /> attacks in the place.  That is not smooth administration at all and I do not think we are going to get results from that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>The staff feel that because of the silence of the Post Office in not being willing to say what is the basic trouble &mdash;shortage of trunks, shortage of circuits, or shortage of junctions, or inadequate equipment generally&mdash;that people are inclined to blame the staff of the Post Office.  They ought not get behind the staff.  They ought to say: &ldquo;We are responsible.  Responsibility is ours at top level.  We have not got the equipment.  We cannot blame those whom we expect to operate the telephone service.&rdquo;  If that were done, some effort would be made to enable the public to understand.  If they are told the facts, they will understand, as they have to understand with the buses and everything else, unfortunately.  But to give the impression that there was nothing wrong with the equipment or administration, when in fact there was a state of affairs in the exchange that has not been there for many years, is wrong and very senior operators will tell you that the present situation bewilders them.  Obviously if you have got that state of affairs the staff must be harassed.</P>
    <P>The Post Office appear to have no remedy.  I know it is not a palatable thing to have to do but you never get into trouble for being honest.  It may be a matter of just being temporarily unpopular to be honest but it might be better for the Minister to say that the position of the telephone equipment is such that the introduction of additional lines may not be possible, except at the price of worsening the existing system.  Some emergency arrangement should be made with some other country to get the equipment which is badly needed.  Even with the supplies of equipment they will get, it will be a considerable time before it can be installed and brought to the most advantageous use, but it should be done.  It should also be stated that the staff are in no way responsible for the chaotic conditions in the exchange, which can be verified by a visit to the exchange by anybody who knows anything about the operation of an exchange.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to refer to a speech made by Deputy Crotty on 4th April, 1963, in volume 201, No. 8, at column 1103 and the following columns.  In order to elucidate what I am going to talk about, I will quote something of what he said, as follows:</P>
      <P>I had a case in my own county not so far outside the town where a man was appointed as auxiliary postman. Apparently he was the only one in the exchange recommended by a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  I did not recommend him but apparently it was discovered after his appointment that his father or somebody in his family was a Fine Gael supporter.  The result was that although this man had been measured for a uniform, he was told he should re-apply for the position.</P>
      <P>Further on, he said:</P>
      <P>The result was that this married man who had been appointed and had carried on the job for two or three months was told to re-apply.  He did so, but inevitably&mdash;</P>
      <P>he says,</P>
      <P>some single boy in the area was appointed and the married man told he was no longer required.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crotty expanded on that further and if it were true, as the poet said, it were a grievous fault.  He paints a picture of a married man, presumably a poor man, since for applicants for this job the Department takes into consideration their economic status. Deputy Crotty's picture is of this poor unfortunate man whose politics, having being discovered, was unceremoniously bundled out of the job he had legitimately got.  As I say, if that were true, it were a grievous fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing Deputy Crotty and everybody else should consider is the economic position of the various applicants suitable for such a job.  I must inform the House of the facts, although I am reluctant to discuss the private affairs of ordinary people in this House. When Deputy Crotty dragged their private affairs across the floor of this House some weeks ago, he made them the object of ridicule and scorn and, <Col N="1319" /> by inference, too, he attacked the personal integrity of the man who eventually did get the job.</P>
    <P>The father of the man who was originally appointed has a farm valued at £131 12s.  He has since spent over £3,000 buying an extra farm in the area where the post office is located, presumably for his son.  We must admit that the economic circumstances of that applicant are by no means bad.  I can speak with absolute certainty because the area is in my native parish.  This man not only owns a very valuable farm but is also a very wealthy man because he always farms the land well and has always been able to produce a great lot of livestock and make a good deal of money. It is not so long since I saw some of his bullocks in Kilkenny making £100 apiece.</P>
    <P>The other person in question is one of a family of seven who comes from a seven-acre farm.  Of this family of seven, two are invalids and they are recipients of social welfare benefits. Deputy Crotty also suggested the man was married all the time and left a vague suggestion that as normally in such cases, there would be a family. He was first appointed on the 1st March, 1961, and he married on 25th April, 1961.  It is interesting to note that the person he married was the local postmistress who is a farmer of some substance in her own right.  It is an idyllic situation that while the postmistress's swain would be out delivering the letters, she would look after the old age pensions and that any competition from genuinely unemployed people in the area should be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I am very glad it was discovered that the appointment was incorrect. It would be a scandalous thing if the original appointment had been allowed to stand and I must be forgiven for the strong suspicion that his appointment in the first place smacked very dangerously of a ready-up because I have had complaints from unemployed men in the locality that at no time was any indication given in the locality <Col N="1320" /> by the Post Office that such a vacancy would ever arise.</P>
    <P>Another consideration that would be of relevance is that Deputy Crotty's aggrieved person came from nearly five miles away, from a parish in a different locality altogether and while he was registered at the employment exchange he was, in fact, employed all day every day with his father on the farm.  I think the House is quite well aware that it was never intended that employment of this kind should be reserved for people of such considerable substance and wealth, even in the romantic circumstances of this case. It is quite a charming little story of boy meets postmistress and becomes postman but, since the issue was justice, since there was some emigration from the locality and since there was some genuine unemployment in the area, the Minister or whatever officer of his Department caused the reappointment to be made acted very wisely and very justly and a serious scandal was prevented.</P>
    <P>I would not have raised this matter at all in the Dáil, were it not for the intense local publicity this affair got in our local Press.  The heading in one of the local papers in Kilkenny was: &ldquo;Deputy Exposes Post Office Scandal&rdquo;. That was blazoned across the front page of that paper.  Inadvertently, he did expose a scandal and the scandal has been undone, I am glad to say. If this appointment had been allowed to stand, it would have been a veritable scandal.  There is another little bit of Deputy Crotty's speech I want to mention before I finish.  He says at column 1104, Volume 201, of the Official Report of the 4th April, 1963:</P>
    <P>How can the ordinary person have respect for Ministers, whatever Government are in office, when he hears of these things happening?  It lowers the status of Ministers to have that sort of thing going on.  I do not believe it will affect the election one way or another...</P>
    <P>Then he advises one and all to grow up and have sense.  It would be a very salutary thing if Deputy Crotty in his old age would take his own advice and have a bit of sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the unnecessary delay in providing telephones in my constituency.  I was very pleased to read the Minister's statement that installations would be carried out no matter how recently the applications had been made.  The Minister knows what has happened in Glendalough. There were complaints that some people were not getting facilities, while others were, because they used influence.  I would have no objection to that if other residents of the area got equal treatment.  I sent a letter to an applicant drawing attention to the Minister's statement.  I said that while the Department were working in the district, I was sure he would be supplied with a telephone.  He wrote to me to thank me for sending the good news from the Minister, but he pointed out that they had erected wires two and a half miles long, and had passed by his door and left him without a phone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one area in Wicklow with a population of 700, there is no kiosk. About 18 months ago, the urban council sent a resolution to the Department urging the erection of a kiosk for the benefit of the population, in the event of sick calls or an emergency at night. After some time, they received a letter promising that two kiosks would be erected, but suggesting putting one in an unsuitable place.  The council pointed out that the site was not suitable, and would not meet the requirements of the people, but the Department adhered to their original decision.  I am satisfied they had not the equipment and were only making <Col N="1323" /> Civil Service excuse by suggesting a place which was not suitable for a kiosk.</P>
    <P>I wrote the Department and pointed out that the kiosk would be about a minute's walk from the post office, and about 15 minutes' walk from the place where we wanted it.  I pointed out that if they erected a kiosk there without the authority of the council, it would be of no benefit to the people. There are also six private telephones beside the place where they wanted to erect the kiosk, but the Department still adhered to their original decision. Would the Minister give a direction to the Department to meet the officials of the urban council and have a site selected?</P>
    <P>A statement was made that there are over 10,000 applications for telephones. I agree with Deputy Norton that it is best to tell the people straight and fair that we have not got the equipment.  I read an article in an English paper in which the writer alleged that the reason for the demand for telephones in Ireland was that the Murphys want to keep up with the Joneses.  That is not the case in Ireland.  In rural Ireland, a farmer may require a telephone because if he needs parts of machinery, he does not want to lose a day going into town to get them.  If he had a telephone, he would not have to do so.</P>
    <P>We hear complaints about delays of up to five hours.  There were complaints about the wires between Wicklow and Dublin, and the excuse given to Deputy O'Higgins by the Minister was the storm and the snow. We had snow in the west and in the south, but the roads are clear from Wicklow to Bray and I believe many of the wires are still not in working order.  We have been promised an automatic service, but I wonder when we will get it, and I wonder will we have less trouble with it, and will the Minister have fewer headaches.  If there are detectors along the line, the engineers should easily be able to find out where the fault is.</P>
    <P>There are 300 extra employees in the Post Office.  We are proud of that fact but I should like to know <Col N="1324" /> is there a youth training scheme in operation.  We want to provide plenty of employment for the youth of the country.  We have very competent and experienced men in the engineering section but if they are very busy, surely a local man could connect the wires?</P>
    <P>There are about 20 telephonists with 10 or 15 years' service who are not yet established.  They have given good and loyal service, and they should be given the same facilities as the 160 who were established by interview within the past couple of years.  It is very embarrassing for them to be still juniors after 15 years' service and training the young girls who passed the interview.  Would the Department of Finance not agree that they should be given the same rights as the 160 girls who have been taken on in the past couple of years?</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the Department in connection with unnecessary delays. One may get a letter from the Department after 12 months that the matter is receiving attention.  One letter I received was fairly true.  It said they had not the equipment.  That was sufficient to satisfy a person for the time being.  I am satisfied that they are taking very old equipment out of places in Dublin, for use in the country. The people in the country do not want anything special.  They merely want the same facility as is being given in Dublin.  Various big concerns in cities get privileges that are denied to the people in rural areas.  The people in the rural areas want similar facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take his courage in his hands and get in the necessary machinery and equipment.  I realise that it is difficult at times to procure the equipment but if we spent over £1 million last year and £1 this year on the provision of extra equipment, we should be in a position, with the staff we have, to carry out the Minister's idea of clearing all the arrears in each district.  If there are 10,000 applications, I quite appreciate that it will take a considerable time to provide a telephone in all cases.  If the announcement is made that it will be a year or two, as the case may be, before other demands can be satisfied, the people <Col N="1325" /> will know where they stand.  I should not like anybody to have the impression that people want a telephone merely to keep up with their neighbours when in fact they want a telephone as a matter of necessity.  The majority of the people in rural areas want a phone for business purposes.</P>
    <P>We are glad to see the development of the telephone service.  I would ask the Minister to consider the points I have made.  May I express the hope that as a result of the meeting between officials of the Department and officials of the urban council, the kiosk to which I have already referred will be erected in the position most convenient to the 700 people in the district and will not be erected on a site within one minute's walk of the new post office?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very frank with the public and with this House in regard to the telephone service ever since I became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I do not think that in any of my public statements in the House or outside it, I have tried to mislead the public in relation to the inadequacy of the telephone service to meet the demands made upon it from the time I came to have an examination made of the situation for myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first year I came to this office the Engineering Branch had succeeded in creating a record of telephone installations. I was not too long in this office, as I explained last year, when I came to realise that we could not in any circumstances attempt to continue the installation of new telephone lines at that rate until we arrived at a time when we had caught up, to some extent at least, on the backlog of essential engineering work that had been left on the long finger for a number of years. I explained in the House last year the steps I was taking to deal with the situation as I and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs found it.  That situation was not of their making.  I want to make that clear.  As I develop my reply to the very vigorous criticism offered here by Deputy Norton and by others in relation to the telephone service, I hope to convince the House that the Engineering Branch and the <Col N="1326" /> Department of Posts and Telegraphs, generally, are doing everything they possibly can within the resources available to them to have a telephone service in the country equal to the demand put upon it.</P>
    <P>Let me say at this stage that whatever difficulties we are facing now and whatever difficulties people have in making calls or getting speedy answers, whatever difficulties we have in relation to the general traffic of telephone calls throughout the country, generally speaking, these difficulties cannot be attributed to the operating staff, to the telephonists or people engaged in this business.  They are dealing with a situation that is very troublesome for them to deal with because of the difficulties that have arisen in relation to the telephone service.</P>
    <P>I want to say, as I have said last year, that I am well aware that there has been a huge increase in recent years in the rate of demand for new telephones and in the traffic requirements of existing subscribers.  Let me point out that there is no magic wand available to me that would enable me as Minister to meet these increased demands at short notice.  Every line requires an independent circuit from the subscriber's premises, not merely to the nearest pole or cable route, but all the way to the exchange from which service will be given.  In addition, each line requires individual apparatus at the exchange, as well as the general exchange equipment, and for traffic between exchanges telephone outlets in adequate numbers have to be provided.  Expansion of the telephone network involves the building and extension of exchanges and the provision of new underground, overhead and radio routes.</P>
    <P>The effective planning and completion of these development works is necessarily a very lengthy business.  If capital is available as needed, there is no great difficulty about keeping ahead of the requirements, but if it is unduly restricted the amount available is necessarily devoted to shortterm needs and adequate provision of spare capacity necessary to meet even normal growth is impracticable.  As <Col N="1327" /> everyone knows, the capital available up to quite recently has not been unlimited, but there has been a notable increase in recent years, and expenditure in the current financial year is planned on a basis of £4½ million as against £3½ million and £2½ million in the two preceding years.  For the reasons already given the impact of much of this increased expenditure has not yet been felt but it may be accepted that large scale improvements to the telephone system are in course of provision and there is practically no area in the country in which extensive new works have not been commenced or contracted for, or at least approved in principle.</P>
    <P>Aside from obstacles created by restriction of capital in the past, it has also been necessary to contend with various other serious difficulties arising from such matters as the recruitment and training of additional skilled personnel.  Staff experienced in telephone work are not freely available; consequently it is necessary to spend a comparatively long time on the training of new recruits before they become really effective.</P>
    <P>One of the major schemes designed to afford relief to the telephone system and an improved standard of service to subscribers, is the conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working. A programme of large scale automatisation was put in hand some time ago, but as many Deputies are aware it has suffered a set back caused by unexpected technical difficulties which have not yet been fully resolved. Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Norton made reference to the difficulties experienced in relation to the system in the constituency of Kildare.  While I am not at this moment in a position to give a firm forecast in the matter, I am satisfied that we are nearing a solution to the troubles that have been experienced in this regard, and that it will be possible to resume without much delay the programme for the conversion to automatic working of a substantial additional number of exchanges.</P>
    <P>In my opening statement I mentioned <Col N="1328" /> the progress that has been recorded in recent years in the extension and modernisation of the telephone system and I think that Deputies should not lose sight of this when speaking of the current difficulties which the service is meeting.  As I said in my opening speech the number of exchange lines has been doubled in the past ten years and quadrupled since the end of the war, the mileage of trunk circuits has been greatly increased and the automatic system has been extended to 75 per cent of all subscribers in the country.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies mentioned the delay in connection of new telephones.  I have previously pointed out that the addition of large numbers of new subscribers to a system not yet fully geared to give them a satisfactory service would not serve any useful purpose. The rate of connection of new lines planned for the current year, however, is well in excess of the expected rate of demand, and I am reasonably confident therefore that a reduction of the waiting list will be achieved before very long.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan referred to inequality of charges for telephone calls in certain cases.  I think that it will be accepted that any group charging scheme will include some apparent anomalies and I can confidently claim that the general level of charges in the scheme that has been introduced represents very good value indeed to the telephone user.  A feature of the scheme was a substantial increase in the number of places within local call range of each exchange.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the need for additional public telephones and kiosks.  The position is that a public telephone is provided in every area in which there is a Post Office. In arranging this, frequently at a loss to the service as a whole, my Department has gone a fair distance towards providing public telephone facilities throughout the country.  Concerning kiosks, the general rule is that they are provided in places where it is estimated that they will pay their way but it is the case that nearly all towns and villages with a population of 200 <Col N="1329" /> or more have at least one kiosk, and some smaller centres are now being supplied.  Altogether over 1,000 kiosks have been erected, including 600 in the Provinces.  The Finglas area, which was specifically mentioned in this connection, already has twelve kiosks and the early provision of two more is planned.</P>
    <P>I must, of course, balance the needs of all areas, particularly when considering the provision of facilities that are not really remunerative.  The Post Office may not be quite as well off as many appear to think: Deputy Crotty mentioned £1,880,000 as the surplus earned by the telephone service last year, but in fact the figure quoted relates to the surplus earned in the past five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of providing additional services such as the reverse charge arrangement that was suggested by Deputy Mullen is kept under review but I feel that there should be no hesitation about accepting generally that the staff and capital resources available should not be diverted to provision of extras of this sort until the fundamental needs of the community have been more nearly fully supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the several references that have been made to the unsatisfactory standard of service on existing lines, I think it only fair to the operating staffs to mention that in the very recent past, a period that is now fresh in the minds of Deputies, the telephone system has been working under a very severe strain caused by the nationwide bus strike.  This strike has increased enormously the public demand on the telephone service and fairly serious congestion of the automatic equipment has resulted.  People who would ordinarily have little occasion to use the telephone have now become substantial telephone users and the overloading of the automatic exchanges and other equipment has turned the traffic towards the operating staff as a <Col N="1330" /> result of which there has been at times fairly extensive jamming of the system. Everything possible is being done to minimise the inconvenience being caused by these temporary difficulties, but some degree of upset is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>The bus strike was not, of course, the only thing that occurred to make matters difficult for the telephone service in the recent past.  Early in the year the network generally was affected by widespread storm damage.  Permanent repairs took a considerable time and involved the diversion of engineering staff from their normal duties in various areas throughout the country.  Furthermore, there was a number of breaks in the cross-Channel cables and in the internal coaxial cables which could not have been foreseen or prevented in advance.  All these factors entailed great difficulties for the service and threw heavy burdens on the operating staffs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to delays in answering at the Dublin Exchanges and it cannot be denied that the attention obtainable from the manual position has at times been far less prompt than I would like it to be.  I wish to say, however, that the great majority of calls to the exchange were answered promptly and, although I much regret the inconvenience experienced by some callers who were abnormally delayed, it would be unfair to the service and to the staff concerned to infer that these experiences were typical and related to anything more than a small proportion of calls made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect Deputy Norton's opinion on matters of this kind because of his long experience with Post Office workers and I will be prepared to examine any suggestions he may wish to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that the Minister should not get the return of speed of answering based upon a meter which is not allowed to operate normally. <Col N="1331" /> The Minister gets a lopsided view because he is told things are right when they are not right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate, however, the inconvenience and frustration occasioned to individual callers who are left without attention for undue periods and no effort will be spared to reduce waiting time to the minimum possible.  Unfortunately, no satisfactory system has been devised of queuing calls to ensure that they will be answered in strict order and it is not possible to eliminate the occasional &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; call which suffers disproportionate delay.</P>
      <P>In so far as the accuracy and significance of the records taken of the speed of answer obtainable from the exchanges is concerned, I wish to say, however, that these records are based on tests made scientifically by electric meters which give the average speed of answer on a sampling basis on calls made to the exchange through various inlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You can make the meter operate any way you want it to operate.  What about a demonstration? My point is that the operators know the meter is wrong but the supervisor does not know it.</P>

      <P>I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the returns taken by methods used and approved by other administrations as well as ourselves and which are supported and endorsed by independent observations made directly by supervisory staff.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton referred to the difficulty in regard to calls to Cork.  On a recent occasion delay was caused by a succession of breaks in the main cable.  Traffic was diverted to alternative routes which were inadequate for a no-delay service.  I am told that callers were advised by the operators that there was liable to be heavy delay on their calls.</P>

      <P>I shall inquire into that.</P>

      <Col N="1332" /> Deputy Sweetman referred to the unsatisfactory operation of Naas telephone exchange.  The bulk of complaint received related to service given during the hours when Naas exchange is switched to Dublin.  I arranged just before Easter to extend the hours of service at Naas so that the period during which the exchange is switched to Dublin is confined to the hours of minimum traffic.  This should improve matters considerably.  Furthermore, the exchange equipment is being extended at present and the new apparatus will be in operation shortly</P>
    <P>In so far as the telegraph traffic is concerned, Deputy Norton asked me to give the percentage of decline in relation to the internal traffic as against the external traffic.  Roughly speaking, there was a decline of just over five per cent in the internal traffic as compared with a decrease of nearly eight per cent in traffic with Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, originating in Great Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Going to Great Britain. I come now to the question of the Carlow exchange.  The question of the long delay in the erection of the Carlow exchange was raised here by Deputy Governey and by Deputy Norton.  We have experienced delay in relation to the site.  A site in Burrin Street, Carlow, was acquired in 1948 for the erection of a new post office and telephone exchange.  Progress was bedevilled by a county council scheme to run a road through part of our site. This involved a complicated exchange of properties and completion of the legal formalities has taken an extraordinarily long time.  The Department is not to blame for the delay.</P>
      <P>In November, 1962, the Department approved a sketch plan providing for a new post office, an automatic telephone exchange and an area engineering headquarters.  The Office of Public Works, however, intends to utilise the site to provide not alone for our requirements but also for those of other Government Departments &mdash; an employment exchange and office accommodation for the Revenue Commissioners and for the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> It is intended to build the automatic telephone exchange in advance of the remainder of the scheme and tenders for the exchange have been invited.  I cannot give a firm forecast for progress on the balance of the scheme but it is hoped that the Office of Public Works may be in a position to put the work out to tender about the end of this financial year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully, Deputy Crinion and other Deputies raised the question of pensions for auxiliary postmen.  This would require legislation.  It is a matter which concerns the Civil Service as a whole.  Furthermore it is a matter entirely for the Minister for Finance but, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and as a member of the Government, I would not wish to shelve my share of the responsibility in that way.  There are difficulties in formulating such a scheme for auxiliary postmen especially when you take into consideration the manner in which auxiliary postmen are recruited into the Civil Service; the ages at which they are recruited and the classes of the community from which they come.</P>
    <P>The question of the appointment of auxiliary postmen was raised during the debate.  It is a fact that the Minister appoints the auxiliary postman. That is the system as it stands.  I accept responsibility for every appointment I make to this office of auxiliary postman.  We do not hear of the great majority of the cases in which appointments are made.  Everybody seems to be satisfied&mdash;the persons concerned, the people in the locality and members of this House.</P>
    <P>There are parts of this country where no representations are made by Deputies or anybody else in relation to the appointment of an auxiliary postman. There are areas in which we find it difficult to find people to accept the post of auxiliary postman.  The employment position is so good in those areas that men are not interested in accepting the job of auxiliary postman. There are other areas where the representation made does not amount to much.  The applicants for the post go to the local Deputy.  The local Deputy just writes in about it.  They have no real interest in the matter at all.  They <Col N="1334" /> accept whoever the Minister appoints from the list supplied from the employment exchange.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where the competition is very keen and where people go to extremes to make representations to the Minister.  They get to know the members of his family. They get to know his relatives to the third and fourth degree.  They go to Deputies on every side of the House. We have allegations bandied across the floor of this House that appointments are made on a political basis in some of these cases.  If Deputies had the job of reading the confidential information supplied to me in some cases by the applicant himself when he makes his claim to the employment exchange they would realise the full position.  When you go into this question of making the appointment you have to take into consideration something more than the general Government direction in relation to the social status of the candidates concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that smallholders in this country are auxiliary postmen.  I appoint them regularly.  The job of auxiliary postman fits into the life of the rural community in that way.  The hours of work are not a full week's work in some cases.  It has been pointed out by some Deputies that the rate of pay is per hour.  In some of the posts, the number of hours worked per week may be 18, 26, and so on. In others of them, the auxiliary postman earns a fair week's wages in comparison with what agricultural labourers earn in the locality in which he lives because the post has sufficient hours to bring up the pay to that standard.</P>
    <P>We hear Deputies making reference to farmers being appointed auxiliary postmen.  However, the farms they occupy are of such a low valuation that the wages they earn as auxiliary postmen are in addition to the family income and help to keep these men and their families on the land in rural Ireland.  That is something that is creditable in this regard. I would not wish in any circumstances to appoint as auxiliary postman a person who <Col N="1335" /> was too well off, unless I had to do it and there are cases in which there is only one applicant and sometimes he is very well off.  Deputy Crotty raised this question and said he wrote to me. He wrote to the Department and I did not see his letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan has given notice that he wishes to raise the subject matter of Question No. 16 on the Order Paper of Tuesday, 7th May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I propose to deal with now was originally put down to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whose presence here now I am very glad to see, but for some reason unknown to me, the question ended up with the Department of Agriculture and was answered on Tuesday by the Minister for Finance, acting for the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The question was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture what schemes there are for payment of grants to bacon factories and if he will give details of such schemes and of the grants which have been approved and made in each of the past three years.</P>
      <P>The reply given by the Minister for Agriculture and read by the Minister for Finance was:</P>
      <P>My Department operates a scheme of grants for certain works of modernisation in layout and plant at bacon factories.  The grants are now at the rate of 50 per cent of the approved cost of the works covered by the scheme.</P>
      <P>The grants paid in each of the past three years were as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Year ended 31st March, 1961: None.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> Year ended 31st March, 1962: 14 grants totalling £26,383.2.7.</P>
    <P>Year ended 31st March, 1963: 9 grants totalling £22,812.0.2.</P>
    <P>When I asked what schemes there were for payment of grants to bacon factories, I innocently presumed such a question would disclose what the position was in regard to payment of grants to bacon factories.  I regret to say that the full facts of the grants payable and given and approved to bacon factories have not been disclosed either in that reply or in the current Budget Tables on which the question was based.  Table VI of the current Budget Tables is headed &ldquo;Table Showing State Aid to Agriculture.&rdquo;  In that Table, there is a sum of £37 million which, it is alleged, is being given for the improvement of agriculture and there is a list of items with which I shall not bore the House and the sources of the various grants to Agriculture are marked.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce, the Board of Works, the Land Commission and the Department of Local Government are involved. One of the items mentioned in that list is bacon factory grants.  The Tables purport to give a true picture to the House and the public of what the grants to the bacon factories are and these grants as disclosed in the current Budget Tables are exactly as I was informed in the reply to the Dáil Question.  I want the Minister to explain how an important document of that nature, the current Budget Tables, did not disclose the full facts when in the year ending 31st March, 1962, it is revealed in the statutory report and accounts of Bord Foras Tionscal that a certain bacon factory in Dublin city was approved for a grant to the extent of £200,000 for pre-packaged pig products. In that year, a sum of £17,500 was paid out of the £200,000 approved. If we are to have accuracy, the tables of grants to agriculture should disclose for 1961-62 that not a sum of £26,000 but of £26,000, plus £17,500, totalling £43,500, was paid in that year to bacon factories.</P>
    <P>Why was there this failure?  The public are entitled to ask that because <Col N="1338" /> the most important thing here is accuracy in the figures given to the House, especially when we have a Budget which is a blister on the backs of the public, and when the public are told that this money must be raised and that there is no question of squandermania, that the money which the Budget imposition is designed to produce is essential for the development of the State.</P>
    <P>I must admit that if a Deputy wished to get the information I have got, he could go down to the Library and find on page 10 of the Report of Foras Tionscal for 1962 a statement that Donnellys (Dublin) Limited were approved for a grant of £200,000 for their bacon factory.  But why should it be necessary to go down to the Library to get information of that nature which should have been disclosed in the current Budget Tables?  Why did the current Budget Tables give figures for bacon factory grants for certain bacon factories?  Why was that information not disclosed, as far as Foras Tionscal were concerned, for Donnelly's bacon factory here in Dublin?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce should also tell the House why he or his Department refused to accept this Dáil Question of mine, because either the Minister personally or his Departmental advisers said it was not their responsibility.  The question was shelved by the Department of Industry and Commerce and it went to Agriculture. The Minister for Agriculture answered me and it was disclosed in his reply that a number of grants were given.  When I asked him what the total position was, I presumed the information given in the reply to that question was accurate.  I asked a supplementary question as follows:</P>
    <P>Would the Minister clarify the position further?  Do those figures he has given take into account the grants given by An Foras Tionscal under the Industrial Grants Acts for bacon factories?</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan: I do not think so.  I am doubtful if there would be grants from Foras Tionscal, though I cannot say definitely.</P>
    <P>We know he is the old dog for the <Col N="1339" /> hard road.  He covers himself at the end by saying: &ldquo;I cannot say definitely.&rdquo; But he, as Minister for Finance, was doubtful that there would be grants from Foras Tionscal for bacon factories, seeing that grants were already made available by the Department of Agriculture.  I questioned him further as follows:</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister for Agriculture to give full information.  Is it a fact that the Minister is not in possession of the facts?</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan: I have given all the information the Minister for Agriculture gave me.</P>
    <P>Mr. McQuillan: But the information the Minister for Agriculture has given does not show the full position with regard to the giving out of grants to bacon factories.</P>
    <P>It does not.  That is the reason I had to raise this matter on the Adjournment. It is not a question of a mistake of £1 or 2/6d.  I do not know whether it is wrong presentation that is involved, but the sum involved&mdash;although it has not all been paid out yet&mdash;is of such a size as to make the public pause and think.  It is something that should be made public on this basis: Is that the best possible use that can be made of a sum of money of that nature for the development of agriculture, which, according to the Government, is getting £37 million to £39 million this year?  I do not accept at all that agriculture is going to reap the benefit of expenditure of this nature.  I do not propose to pursue that line further, except to say that, to my mind, it is a disgraceful misuse of public funds to give a grant of £200,000 to a private firm in the city of Dublin on the grounds, moryah, that it is going to help agricultural production in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If the Government were anxious to spend £200,000 to help the bacon industry, the place to spend it is down in rural Ireland, by helping to increase the grants for piggeries and by helping small farmers to set up co-operatives so that they could improve their position. Instead, this grant is given in the city of Dublin under the title of Foras <Col N="1340" /> Tionscal, under the Undeveloped Areas Act, to help a firm which, in my opinion, needs very little financial help.</P>
    <P>Why are there two schemes of grants for bacon factories?  Why should one scheme be administered by Foras Tionscal for one single factory, and why is there another scheme for other factories administered by the Department of Agriculture?  Is there any significance in the fact that only one grant has been made available by Foras Tionscal and that grant is for £200,000 to a firm based here in Dublin?  I want to give the Minister plenty of time for his reply.  I want to ask him is it a coincidence that this unique grant of £200,000 of public money is being made to a private firm, the managing director of which is one of the strong backroom men of the the Fianna Fáil Party?  He is one of their key men. He is such a key man, in fact, that they put him into Telefís Éireann as a key man as well.  Is there more than a coincidence in the fact that this is the only firm which has got a grant of £200,000 in connection with pre-packaged bacon products?</P>
    <P>We know that 10 years ago the Fianna Fáil Party set up a special agricultural committee, which made recommendations on how to expand pig production.  They produced a report, which was made available to the national executive of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I happen to have this document with me.  I have kept it for 10 years.  This is what they have to say about the bacon factories:</P>
    <P>The bacon factories, especially Donnellys, dominate the situation and are able to manipulate prices and exploit the small producer. That firm was enjoying the protection of the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is the statement made by the Fianna Fáil Party ten or 11 years ago when they were examining the position of the bacon factory.  The wheel has turned a full circle and that very same factory to-day has been given a grant of £200,000 of public money. In part, the Budget was put on the public for the purpose of paying that grant.  The Minister and the Government <Col N="1341" /> owe the country an explanation of why they expended their hardearned money in this fashion.</P>

      <P>Nobody will object to Deputy McQuillan raising his storm in his teacup, but he could not avoid throwing up some mud at the tail end of his storm.  There is nothing sinister whatever about the reply, the manner in which it was given and the Minister by whom it was given on this occasion.  There are, as the Deputy well knows, industrial grants, apart altogether from whatever agricultural grants are available from the Department of Agriculture.  Under the Undeveloped Areas Act and the Industrial Grants Acts, Foras Tionscal were set up to examine applications for grants for new industries or for extensions of existing industries.  They are an autonomous body to decide when the grant, and what amount, may be given.  There is a separate scheme in the Department of Agriculture whereby grants amounting to a certain percentage of the total amount expended are made available to bacon factories in order to modernise their plants.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question asked what schemes there were for payment of grants to bacon factories.  There is only the one scheme, and the Minister for Agriculture took the question.  He was not available himself to answer it and the Minister for Finance answered it on his behalf.</P>

      <P>I did not intervene when the Deputy was speaking.  He has <Col N="1342" /> had 20 minutes and I have only ten minutes in which to reply.  I shall give the Deputy the true answer, without blemish in any way and without exaggeration. The Department of Agriculture have this scheme in existence for the making available of grants for bacon factories to modernise plant.  It was introduced following the 1958 Programme for Economic Expansion, and the scheme envisaged the making available of grants, up to one third the cost, for modernisation work carried out by bacon factories in the interests of agriculture generally.</P>
      <P>The response from the bacon factories at that time was not a very good one and the Irish Bacon Curers Association made application to extend the scope of the scheme which had been limited to specific modernisation programmes. It was extended to cover extended modernisation plans but the percentage remained the same.  Still the extent to which the scheme was availed of by the curers was not very significant, as the figures given to the Deputy disclose&mdash;£26,000 odd in the year ending 31st March, 1962, and £22,000 odd for the year ending 31st March, 1963. However, it was subsequently extended and an announcement in that respect was made in November, 1962, in which it was stated that the amount of the grants would now be extended to 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>That is purely a Department of Agriculture scheme, available to traditional bacon factories.  It is anticipated that as a result of the extension much greater use will be made of the scheme. Side by side with it, but completely separate, there is an industrial grant code under the Undeveloped Areas Act and the Industrial Grants Act.  In 1960 a grant was made available to Donnelly's bacon factory of £200,000 by Foras Tionscal.  The purpose of the grant was to enable Donnellys to embark on a new line altogether.  Donnellys had earlier on carried out a market survey in Britain as a result of which they concluded that marketing trends there were changing from the traditional bacon to pre-packaged bacon.</P>

      <P>In order to enter that market, Donnellys had to embark on a new type of bacon curing altogether, which was a departure from the traditional. The cost exceeded £1 million. Of that, a grant was made available of £200,000 and of that Donnellys had to provide out of their own resources well in excess of £800,000 in order to meet these new market trends.  Any other bacon factory or consortium of bacon factories who wanted to apply for a grant in similar circumstances would, of course, have received favourable consideration from Foras Tionscal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that this £200,000 did not appear in the financial accounts, as mentioned by Deputy McQuillan, again has no sinister aspect at all.  As I have said, the £200,000 grant approved for Donnellys was approved under the Industrial Grants Act for a new industry. The £20,000 odd given as being the Government subvention to agriculture and which has appeared in the financial accounts was part of the Department of Agriculture scheme for modernisation of bacon factories.  The amount available to Donnellys is to be found in a public document, the annual statutory report and accounts of the Board of Foras Tionscal which mentions the name of the firm, its location, the type of industry involved, <Col N="1344" /> the amount of the grant approved and the total amount paid out in respect of new works in the course of the financial year ended 31st March, 1962.</P>
    <P>So there is nothing sinister at all about it, no attempt at non-disclosure, because it is there for everybody to see.  The essential difference is that the Department of Agriculture scheme is one applicable to the modernisation of traditional bacon factories in order to improve their competitiveness, reduce their costs and, therefore, be of assistance to the agricultural industry generally and the pig industry in particular. The grant made available to Donnellys was an industrial grant in the strict use of the term and was given only after Donnellys carried out a market survey in Britain, established to the satisfaction of Foras Tionscal that it was a completely new type of industry, that it was meeting a new demand in the English market and that Donnellys themselves were dipping into their pockets to the extent of more than £800,000.  These are all the facts and I do not think Deputy McQuillan's storm in his little teacup can dispute them.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 14th May, 1963.</P>
