      <P>Last night, I was speaking on this Budget but I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking this morning.  One of the misfortunes of Dublin Deputies is that when they speak here, they are really speaking to the people and not to the Dáil. Dublin Deputies just get a few lines in the newspapers, whereas the country Deputy can cut out his whole speech and get it all printed in his local newspaper. I am not complaining.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I am glad to say a few words in the morning, because I hope to get the ear of some of my constituents.  The majority of Dublin constituents do not read morning newspapers; they buy evening newspapers.  I am being candid about it.  There are lots of people who get in <Col N="820" /> here early every Thursday for the same reason.  I am supporting this Budget, as I already stated.  I did not take long to make up my mind.  I think I was one of the first to support it because I saw through the proposal immediately and I saw that here was an opportunity for a Government in debt.  The Budget was not balanced. The Government are responsible for the Budget and we were in debt, not through any fault of the Government. If the Coalition had been in power, they would have been in debt and I do not know how they would have remedied the position.</P>
      <P>I saw this as an opportunity whereby the Government could not only balance the Budget this year but next year and probably every year, and not only that, but they would be able to meet their many demands especially from people who receive social benefits.  One of the most trying things a Government have to do is to try to provide money for the hundreds of thousands of claims for social benefits.  It is easy to criticise the giving of a couple of shillings but when you consider the hundreds of thousands of people who have to get that couple of shillings, then it amounts to a huge sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Budget, the couple of shillings will cost £4½ million.  If the Government were to give increases only to the old age pensioners this year, they could have given them 12/- or thereabouts, but if they had done that, they would have given nothing to the people with families, nothing to blind people and nothing to the disabled people.  At least it can be said of this Government that when they give increases, they spread them around.  Without this turnover tax, how could these increases be given? They could not be given.  I understand that the Government need £6½ million to balance the Budget.  The greatest moan now is coming from the business people and the politicians who are opposed to the Government. Obviously if the business people were not losing by the turnover tax, they would not moan.  If they could pass it on, why would they moan?  The fact is most of them know they will not be able to pass it on.  For instance, as <Col N="821" /> far as the corporation profits tax is concerned and the betting houses, lots of those people will not be able to pass it on because they will lose business if they pass it on and they will have to pay most of it themselves.  That is why they are moaning.  Nobody moans who is going to gain.</P>
    <P>Last week, I heard a Deputy say that the shopkeepers were going to rob the public.  If so, why should the shopkeepers moan about it?  There is a lot of untruth in what is said here. One speaker disputing the Budget contradicts another.  You have those who say the shopkeepers will charge twice as much and you have other Deputies moaning for the poor shopkeepers. You have the papers this morning&mdash;I have a handful of cuttings here&mdash;saying that big business is moaning.  If that is so, it should be a good thing and the Labour Party should cheer.  Over the years, the House was told: Do not put anything on the workers; put it on the people with the money.  Quite a lot of this tax is going on those with money.  It is extraordinary to have Labour and big business moaning at the same time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe big business has cause to moan and that the money that will be got from big business will be channelled into increased social benefits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to increase assistance for the farming community and so on.  That must happen.  Why are we looking for money?  It is not to have a good &ldquo;hooley&rdquo; here but so as to share it out.  What other reason is there?  Again, what point is there in asking for increases for everybody without mentioning where the money is to come from?  Why moan now when this effort is being made to get the money to give to the people?  The biggest moans are coming from the business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told the working classes are <Col N="822" /> going to lose and if you coolly analyse the Budget, not in terms of this year but in terms of next year, you will see the working classes will benefit from the turnover tax.  Lies are being told and things distorted.  I heard Deputy Mullen speak of a man earning only £8 a week.  We know the average city worker has about £10 a week but that is the type of arguments used.  He said that if he had £8 a week he would only get 3/- of an increase if he had three children while he would have to pay 4/- extra in tax and he would lose 1/-.  Let us assume the man earns £8 a week.  He will get 2/6d. for the first child, no increase for the second but he will get 1/1½d. for the next. That is 3/7½d.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not get 2/6 a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me deal with the matter.  Let us be honest with figures anyway.  The average worker is now a corporation tenant in Dublin and I am satisfied that if his rent is 27/6d. that is all he will pay, that there will be nothing extra.  I am sure there will be nothing extra on his union fee or insurance or any of those things.  It can be worked out that he will have to pay only on about 70 per cent of his money, if he has to pay anything. Therefore, it will work out, not at 1/- in the £ but about 4d. in the £ and the truth would be that it would only cost him 3/- or 2/6d. and he will get 3/7½d. and he is not losing.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any man with a family losing.  A man with no children may lose between 2/6d. and 4/- but who will moan about that?  That happens so that the man with the children will get it.  There is nothing wrong in that. If a man is not married and has £10 a week why should Labour kick up a row on his behalf ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he is already paying income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. This is not money for the Government; but money that is going into the pockets of the unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall prove it.  An unemployed man with four children will get 2/6d. for himself and 2/6d. for his wife.  That is 5/-.  He will get increased children's allowances, 4/6d. a week extra if he has four children, plus 5/-, which is 9/6d.  If he is unemployed, he will have £3 or £3 10s.  He will pay out about 2/- extra and get 9/6d. extra.  You do not need any brains to see that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You would need to have no brains to see it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the 9/6d. will come from big business and from the man who has no children.</P>
      <P>Old age pensioners will get an extra 2/6d.  They will pay about 4d. in the £ and as they have only £1 15s. a week or so what more can they pay than 6d. or 7d.?  They are getting that increase in a year when there is a Budget deficit, when the Government had to make up £6 million.  Is it not quite obvious that if they get it in a bad year they will get it next year and that they will benefit by, perhaps, a complete 2/6d.  I expect a good Budget next year and I expect all the people on social benefits to get another increase.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Anybody who studies history and the causes of revolution and unrest realises only too well that it is because of the niggardly attitude of people with money that revolution and unrest come about.  I was reading a history of the French Revolution the other day and there is a paragraph which aptly applies to this situation. It so happened that in the first year of the Revolution in France, there was a moderate Party in control.  The bloody business had not begun.  The Finance Minister, Necker, asked the people with money to sacrifice onefourth of all their profits but they refused to do so.  The result was they lost all the money, all their property and their heads as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not think that will happen here ?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a sort of parallel in that to the present position here.  Let me quote:</P>
      <P>Necker was ever bewailing the increase of the deficit; and when the Assembly jealously refused to strengthen the executive for the collection of taxes, he proposed (Sept.) that a &ldquo;patriotic contribution&rdquo; should be made by every citizen of one-fourth of his income to rescue the State from bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>We are not that bad but there is a parallel situation here.  I continue the quotation:</P>
      <P>The Assembly was wavering, when Mirabeau's eloquent support carried the measure: &ldquo;Bankruptcy, hideous bankruptcy is there: it threatens to consume you, your honour, your fortunes&mdash;and you deliberate!&rdquo; Even after this appeal, the patriotic contribution was a dismal failure ; and the first year of the revolution was to close with a deficit of over £7,000,000.</P>
      <P>That would be equal to probably £100 million in present-day money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the Assembly and the populace were less concerned about the <Col N="825" /> payment of taxes than the correct phrasing of the Rights of Man.</P>
    <P>Like here&mdash;talking shop ; writing shop.</P>
    <P>After long deliberation these were accepted; but a proposal that the duties of the citizen should also be defined was lost by a small majority. To insist on rights, and shirk disagreeable duties, was the radical defect of the new civic life, fatal to the solvency, order, and stability of the State.</P>
    <P>You might as well state that that applies to this House in relation to the Budget.</P>

      <P>It could be said that the cause of so much unrest in France was that certain sections refused to pay their just contribution by way of taxes to help the less well-off people.  That is the reason why there is a dictatorship in France today.  The cause of Communism everywhere is that people with the money begrudge and refuse to make a just contribution.  It is those in need and in want who rebel.  We have reached the situation here where employment is uncertain by reason of international and economic conditions.</P>

      <P>It is not the fault of any Government.  Here is an attempt by the Government here to create the wherewithal, the kitty, whereby the demands from those who are in need can be met.  Of course, I can understand the Opposition opposing this measure.  This is politics and politics is a game.  Although it is supposed to be the art of the possible, instead, it becomes, in so far as many politicians are concerned, the art of looking all ways.</P>

They could not agree and it would result in a general election and there would be nothing but election brawls instead of progress.  I certainly claim that I made that much contribution.</P>

      <P>I have made the point that I contributed to stable Government in the country for the past 15 or 16 months.  I said that there would have been two general elections in the interim had I done otherwise.  I believe people do not want election brawls by individuals aspiring to power, and nothing else.  That is really all that politics amounts to.  In regard to my politics, I should like the House and I should like the Opposition to bear in mind that only ten months ago it was my vote that made a Fine Gael Deputy Lord Mayor of Dublin.  That is my answer to those who think that I am this or that.  I made Deputy <Col N="827" /> O'Keeffe Lord Mayor of Dublin by my one vote.  He got 19 votes as against 18 votes for a Fianna Fáil candidate.  That is evidence that I am not a Party man of any nature.  I believe in doing the right thing.  I voted for Deputy O'Keeffe because the other candidate had been Lord Mayor. I voted for him because I considered him to be a decent fellow and had been always pretty straight with me.  I will vote for Fine Gael men when I find they are right.  I voted for this Government because I found there was no alternative and the country would face calamity, in the circumstances, if the Government were not helped to carry on.  The Government have lost money by reason of reductions in tariffs on imported goods, and must lose again in January.  The State must carry on. The State has no way of getting money except from those who can afford it.</P>
      <P>It is my firm belief that this Budget hits nobody but the people with the money.  Deputies can moan if they like.  The people who will be paying will be those who can afford to pay. The workers with families will not pay, because there has been an increase in children's allowances which, alone, is costing £3 million.  I believe more could not be done this year because the Government have to face up to a deficit in the Budget, have to make up £6 million.  When the Taoiseach mentioned moving to the left, I believe he meant that and that is why big business is moaning.  I believe next year there will be further increases.  If that is so, it satisfies me because I am in this House not alone as a worker but as a fellow resident amongst the old age pensioners and all the rest.  I live in the midst of them and would certainly not support any policy here but a policy of stability, on the one hand, and a policy of spreading out the available resources and giving to those in need.  That is my policy and my only policy in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many arguments, without any truth, were used.  Deputy Mullen mentioned differential rents and said that if old age pensioners get 5/- they will pay 10d. of it in increased differential rents. That is true but the fact remains that in respect of the last four increases in <Col N="828" /> social welfare benefits the City Manager, on my proposal, decided not to take those contributions into account. So, DR did not take one farthing out of the last four increases in social welfare benefits, on my proposal, because I always look upon this DR business in this way&mdash;I approach it in a small way, make demands that I know the City Manager will concede. The politicians approach matters in a big way.  They speak in terms of pounds.  I went about the matter in a small way and I succeeded.  I only mention that because Deputy Mullen suggested that an extra 10d. would be taken out of their 5/-.  I succeeded in getting the City Manager not to take the last four increases into account and I am quite certain that he will not take this increase into account either.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased in many ways about this Budget because it has allowed the Government to give not merely increased children's allowances to the amount of £3 million but increases also to widows, orphans, the blind, the disabled and those suffering from infectious diseases.  It has increased unemployment assistance.  It has even given increases to State pensioners.  It is spreading the available money all round.  In regard to one small group, I may say that I am very pleased that disabled persons are getting 2/6d.  They got an extra 2/6d. last year and they are getting another 2/6d. this year. Again, I claim that it was my agitation that secured that increase because the increase to disabled persons does not come into the Social Welfare Estimate. That is why for six or seven years disabled persons did not get any increase in benefits.  They were forgotten. I brought that home to the Minister for Health and he admits it was due to my agitation.  I make that claim.  I am pleased that those people will get something.  It is possible to give them something because of the anticipated income which will come from this turnover tax.  If you kill this turnover tax proposal, you will kill the social benefits and those people will get nothing next year.</P>
    <P>This is a revolutionary proposal. Some people would need to have dictatorial powers to try it; otherwise, they <Col N="829" /> would not dare.  The Government are bold enough to dare it and they are right to do so.  The way to overcome a crisis is by daring and not by hedging.  I am certain the Government are capable of meeting an adverse situation and I know they will succeed.  It has been proved that a number of Parties and individuals cannot succeed because the individual thinks of himself first, his Party second, and perhaps the country third.</P>
    <P>I have no special regard for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I take this stand because I think they are right.  I am pretty sure that if St. Peter came in here, he would be abused as I am if he voted for Fianna Fáil.  As I said, I voted for Deputy O'Keeffe as Lord Mayor.  I will do the same next year if I think it is right, and not because I hope to gain by it.  I am speaking under difficulty because I have a bad throat, but I had to say what I had to say.  All this passion is being worked up because of the by-election.  As I said, everyone thinks of himself and all the lies in the calendar will be used.</P>
    <P>I read an amusing article in a magazine a few weeks ago in which a man decided he would not tell a lie for a month.  In that month, he made enemies at home, at work and in his neighbourhood, and he decided that in future he would tell lies like everyone else.  Politicians tell lies and I am not blaming them, but if I told little lies&mdash; and I do not&mdash;I would do considerably less harm than a Party man who tells lies.  If an Independent tells little lies, he is doing it on his own behalf, but a Party man has to tell enormous lies for himself and his Party.</P>

      <P>No one likes taxation, but there is no other way of getting money except by taxation.  It is wrong for the Opposition to appeal to the selfish side of man's nature.  We are all a bit selfish and do not like giving anything away, but there is such a thing as patriotism.  The people who went out in 1916 and 1921 were patriotic.  They did not think in terms of money.  They were not mercenary.</P>

      <Col N="830" /> As I have said, there is no way of getting money except by taxation.  We know what happened in the French Revolution.  We have seen how people in France, Spain and elsewhere, in more modern days, begrudged making a contribution to help those in need. That type of thing leads to communism and revolution.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the people who need social benefits will benefit by these proposals, and I believe they will benefit threefold next year.  I believe that people with children will also benefit next year.  The full effect of this plan will not be seen for a year or two.  The only people who are asked to pay anything are big business people, and people who are employed and have no responsibilities, like a single man or a married man who has no children.  A short while ago, I met a young man of about 22 years of age in Capel Street.  He was &ldquo;elephants&rdquo; drunk and he told me he would vote against the Government.  He is in a position to drink 25/- worth of beer and he does not want to give one pint to the unemployed man.  That is the type of person to whom the Opposition are appealing.</P>

      <P>Had I known the line Deputy Sherwin would take, I would have brought in my copy of <i>The Decline and Fall</i> and given some excerpts to the House.  One of the most outstanding aspects of this Budget is the utter callousness of the Minister's approach to the ordinary man in the street.  The Minister knows that this Budget will cause great difficulties to the small man on whose behalf Deputy Sherwin should speak.  The Minister has said, in effect, that he does not care what happens to the small man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked him, for instance, about the difficulties which would arise for the small boy who sells newspapers at the corner of the street.  The Minister admits that boy must pay turnover tax the same as anyone else, but it does not concern him, he says, how he will collect it.  The problems of the newspaper boy selling papers at the street corner will be repeated all over the country in various degrees.  There are the small huckster shops.  Again, those people in Deputy Sherwin's constituency <Col N="831" /> are the people for whom he, in his anxiety to ensure that there is no general election, cannot spare a thought.  There are hundreds of them in his constituency; there are thousands of them in the city; and there are tens of thousands of them in the country.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Sherwin took the trouble to investigate the problems in his own constituency behind the counters of little shops, he would find exactly what is to be found everywhere.  Everywhere you go there is nothing but the greatest apprehension.  Men and women who scarcely ever kept books before are now wondering how they will collect this tax, how they will pay it, and what the effect will be on their business.  Many people do not realise something the Minister said very honestly the day we were voting on the Resolution dealing with this turnover tax.  My colleague, Deputy Barry from Cork, asked what will happen in the case of a man who collects £1,250 in a year by way of turnover tax.  He asked if he would have to pay income tax on that?  The Minister said: &ldquo;Yes, he has to.&rdquo;  We find then the shopkeeper in this very extraordinary situation that not alone does he collect a tax for the Government but, if the Minister is correct in his answer, he has to pay income tax on the tax he has collected for the Government.  That is the measure of this Government's complete disregard for the ordinary citizen of this country. It shows the complete lack of interest by the Government in the ordinary citizen of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin, who has just left the House, very neatly synthesised the situation in which the country finds itself when he said big business is moaning and, in the same breath, that labour is moaning.  Whichever way the Government may be turning, whether they be turning left or whether they be turning right, I would ask the Minister to reflect on this: it is not a happy situation for any Government to find themselves in when an Independent Fianna Fáil Deputy admits in this House that, on the one hand, big business is moaning at one end of the social and economic scale and, on the <Col N="832" /> other hand, that labour is moaning at the other end of the social and economic scale.  The Minister can be quite certain that what are known as the middle-classes are also moaning, because there is no relief for anybody in this Budget.  The Minister was more than sincere, I think, when he said that his job at the moment is to collect the money and get it in.  He will do that, come what may.</P>
    <P>This Budget is a measure not alone of the necessities and the gravity of the moment but also of the Government's complete failure to grapple with the economic and financial situation of the country.  It is all very well for the Minister to describe, as he did when we were discussing the Resolutions here, any criticism emanating from this side of the House as &ldquo;bunk&rdquo;.  The country will not accept that attitude from the Government. It is very easy for the Minister to say that he will answer any intelligent criticism but he will not answer any criticism from the main Opposition Party or the second Opposition Party because it does not suit him and because any opposition which does not suit him is not, in his view, intelligent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;opposition described in this House as &ldquo;damn bunk&rdquo;.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Taoiseach said that it was not the individual proposals in the Budget that mattered but the overall purpose it was intended to achieve.  This might be an effort by the Taoiseach to distract attention from some of the more unsavoury aspects of the Budget, of the biggest and most amazing Budget in the history of this House. If one is to take what the Taoiseach has been saying for some time now, and particularly his last speech on this Budget, at its face value, Fianna Fáil of the late 1962 and the early 1963 is a completely changed animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the father of protection, has become the prophet of free trade.  Now, I am not saying that we should regret the fact that Irish industry cannot any longer <Col N="833" /> shelter behind tariff walls and will have to stand on its own feet.  What I am saying is that it is about time Fianna Fáil realised the necessity for free trade and realised also that Irish industry can be pardoned now if it does not know exactly where it stands. The Irish industrialist finds himself in a most difficult situation.  He has been warned by the Taoiseach, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and any other Minister who happens to attend chamber of commerce dinners, for some time past that he really must get away from the idea that he will continue to be pampered. He has been warned in this Budget that he will be further mulcted in corporation profits tax and in various other ways.</P>
    <P>There are some other aspects of this Budget to which I should like to refer. When the Taoiseach spoke, in the course of his discussion on his turn to the left, about the necessity for further Government intervention, I hope that he meant the direct intervention of this House and I trust that in any measures it may be found necessary to introduce further to control Irish industry, this House will not be asked to give <i>carte blanche</i> to any Minister, or to any Minister's Department, to deal as it will by regulation or by order with Irish industrialists.</P>
    <P>This House has gone more than far enough already in surrendering its rights to anonymous individuals whom nobody in the country can recognise. It is absolutely vital that, if the Government's swing to the left portends further Government interference with the rights of the ordinary businessman to deal with his business in his own way, the elected representatives of the people should decide these matters openly here and that such matters should be enshrined in a statute under which the ordinary citizen, the ordinary businessman, will know exactly the extent of his rights, the extent of his abilities, the extent of his disabilities, so that he will not find himself in the situation that overnight, by regulation, he can be told to do something of which he could not possibly have been aware prior to the making of a regulation.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a lawyer, I deprecate <Col N="834" /> any effort to increase further the intervention of the State at this stage in business.  I am not a businessman, but I have, since the Taoiseach's speech, heard businessman after businessman expressing the gravest apprehension as to the lines this State intervention might take.  It is true that Mr. MacCarthy, the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, in an address which he delivered recently in public complained that many of the incentives held out to Irish industry by way of adaptation and improvement grants were not being availed of.  I regret that as much as anybody else.  I am quite sure there are many businesses in this country which could make very good use of the very generous grants introduced by the Government, but I can well sympathise with the businessman who refuses to take a grant from the Government, believing that, if he takes the grant, it will be followed by six or seven different varieties of civil servant descending upon him from six or seven different directions to find out exactly what he is doing with the grant.</P>
    <P>Now that the Taoiseach has announced that Irish businessmen are to be open to further Government intervention, I can see a further and more pronounced reluctance on the part of Irish businessmen to submit themselves to such danger.  The great tragedy is that Irish business was never more in need of infusions of capital.  The great tragedy is that there are not better relations between the State and business, that there is not less suspicion haunting the mind of the businessman who looks for Government grants.</P>
    <P>I suggest earnestly to the Minister that there may be some other way of making available to Irish business these necessary infusions of capital.  I always feel we are not making sufficient use of private capital in this country, that the man who has his money invested in IMPS and BATS across the Channel is not getting sufficient incentive to bring it back and invest it in Irish industry.  It is not for me to tell the Minister how that could be done but we should make some attempt to repatriate our private capital and put it <Col N="835" /> to use here, for two reasons; one, that it would make the money available to Irish business and, two, that it would reduce the amount of Government interference in a number of semi-State bodies operating in this country.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that some of the finest semi-State bodies in Ireland are gravely disturbed by the interference of the Minister's nominees on their boards.  I think the Minister is aware of that himself and he must be struck by the fact that that is so.  People who have no political axe to grind, people whose standing in the commercial and industrial spheres is second to none have expressed, if not publicly, certainly semi-publicly, their anxiety about the manner in which the hand of the Minister is making itself felt in the running of a business, the success of which is entirely due to the personal qualifications of the person in question.</P>
    <P>I want to express my regret that newspapers which are traditionally bracketed with the Government should descend to the devices to which they did descend the day after the introduction of the Budget, misleading the people into believing that there had been no increase in the prices of various commodities and showing pictures to indicate there had been no increase in cigarettes, drink and so on. Everybody knows now, if they did not know the day after the introduction of the Budget, that this Budget is not just the first cousin but the blood brother of the Budget of 1952.  This Budget will mean an increase in the price of every necessary that every man and woman, whatever their circumstances, must purchase in order to feed their families.  If the Taoiseach is swinging to the left, it is an extraordinary way of doing it.  I do not think the Taoiseach really means that he is swinging to the left in that sense.  It would be illogical for one thing because, while he talks about swinging to the left, we cannot forget that not so long ago he attempted a pay pause on a Friday and disengaged it on the following Monday.</P>

      <P>Postponed it.  I would appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to consider the plight of the small people to whom I have referred, or at least to give them some indication as to what they will pay.  Take the man or woman in the small shop. How is he or she to pass on 2½ per cent on the price of a box of matches ? The Minister has suggested that they can put it on one commodity and not on another.  That is all very well for the supermarkets and the large combines who can put on the 2½ per cent on the larger items and not put it on the smaller items at all.  If they do that, they will wipe out the huckster shop and the shop which is a little bigger than the huckster shop and which deals only in these small items.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister want us to look upon these times as the dying days of the small shopkeeper, the decent man who makes his living on small items and brings up his family in the fear and love of God and feeds and clothes them on the proceeds of such shops ? There is no Government assistance entailed here.  These shops have been passed on from generation to generation and these men who own them now were living in the hope that they, in turn, could pass on their shops to their families without any Government assistance.  However, because of the active interference of the Minister, the present generation of small shopkeepers is threatened with complete extinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Human nature is human nature and the Minister should remember that this will resolve itself into a question of decent shopkeepers being wiped out or the Minister being wiped out, and that the public are not as inarticulate as he might think.  Due to an act of God, the average citizen will have an opportunity to tell the Minister in the coming by-election what they think of his proposals.  These people will have their revenge before very long unless the Minister sees fit at this stage to abandon the attitude which he adopted in this House when I asked him how the little newspaper boy was to put 2½ per cent on the price of the newspapers. The Minister in the most callous way possible, at column 193, <Col N="837" /> volume 202, of the Official Report of the 23rd April, 1963, replied: &ldquo;That does not concern us.&rdquo;  The difficulties of the continued existence of the least citizen should concern the Minister and the Minister will very shortly be told by the ordinary Irish citizen that if he is not concerned, they will find somebody who will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us likes taxes being imposed but they are necessary for the wellbeing of a country.  In this Budget, the tax which is being imposed is a very small one spread over a very wide field.  The Minister let it be known a few months ago that he had something like this in mind and there was not very much objection to it until he brought it into this House. Deputies on the opposite side of the House are building castles in the air rather than facing reality.  Notwithstanding this Budget, there will still be in the shops the 6/11d., 7/11d., 8/11d. and 19/11d. goods.  There is no question of the tax being put on a box of matches.  The shopkeeper is a businessman and he knows the commodities on which he can make an increase if he feels like it.  He knows that in the last year there was a seven per cent increase in the turnover of the retail trade and that there was an increase the year before.  One thing the shopkeeper wants to see is the turnover increasing each year.  He has a mortal dread of a recession, in which the turnover goes down, and there is less money in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a young nation.  We are expanding.  We are building up.  If we are to maintain that progress, we shall have to have the money to do so. Look at the other side of the picture. If we do not continue to build up, it means cutting down on essential services, on our expansion, on our grants <Col N="838" /> towards new factories, on our help to the poorer section of our people, on our grants to farmers.  It would mean that we would have to cut down on the reduction of 25 per cent in rates which we gave to farmers last year.  If we did anything like that, every shopkeeper would feel it.  There would be a reduction in his turnover.  There would be a recession.  No country could stand the like of that.</P>
    <P>About seven or eight years ago we had a recession.  Everywhere one went throughout the country one heard: &ldquo;Ireland is finished.  There is no future in it.&rdquo;  However, once we started on our five-year plan things began to change.  There is confidence in the country and it is to be noted no matter where one may go.  It was a sight for sore eyes, coming into Dublin last evening along the Naas Road, to see so many big cranes and buildings dotted around the countryside.  That is practical proof that the country is progressing. By giving grants for factories, we are ensuring that the factories will give us the employment we need.</P>
    <P>How many people are coming back from England for some years past? Dublin Deputies say they have a serious housing problem due to so many people coming back from Britain.  In my constituency a great number have come back from Britain.  They know the wages here are every bit as good as those on the other side of the water and naturally they like to be among their own.</P>
    <P>The turnover tax is very small and none of us will notice it.  Much mention has been made of the way it will be collected.  Some Opposition Deputies say the shopkeeper will be driven out of business.  It is alleged that he will have to keep extra books.  We must remember that 90 per cent of the shopkeepers in Ireland are paying income tax at present.  That means they have an auditor.  Their books are audited and they are paying income tax.  It will mean nothing much to them when the purchase tax comes into operation on 1st November next.  It will make no difference whatsoever except possibly that at the end of each month they will have to pay the two and a half per cent.  There will be no <Col N="839" /> extra book-keeping or anything like that because they are already doing it.</P>
    <P>Only ten per cent of shopkeepers are not paying income tax.  The Minister has given very careful consideration to the position of small shopkeepers.  He has mentioned that where a person with under £50 he will be paying only 5/- and if necessary he can pay in the form of stamps on a card.  If it is £100, it is 17/-.  Therefore, the small shopkeeper will not be penalised to the same extent as the bigger shopkeeper and his bigger competitors.</P>
    <P>There was some talk about the commodities on which the tax would be imposed.  An increase in the price of cigarettes did not bring in the Minister any extra money last year.  I cannot see a shopkeeper who sells cigarettes putting money on them when he knows it will bring his turnover down.  There will be competition.  I can see quite a number of advertisements next October which will read: &ldquo;No purchase tax here.  No purchase tax there.&rdquo;  Therefore, I should like people to think in terms of what will happen.</P>
    <P>I can well believe that the Minister has been considering this new type of tax for a long time.  It was recommended by the Income Tax Commission set up a few years ago.  They see that it is a form of tax that will bring in quite an amount of money without creating any great hardship on anybody. I cannot see it imposed on tea, butter or sugar but, rather, spread over items that can carry this tax.  I feel this is a tax which has come to stay and no reference to its removal later has been made from the opposite side.</P>
    <P>We all know that in plenty of shops there are many commodities carrying a very high profit and some of them can take this tax.  The same applies to the liquor trade.  Some items there can carry this tax.  I note that a body representing the publicans of Ireland complimented the Minister on the introduction of this Budget.  They realise that the more money in circulation in Ireland the better it is for them.  If there is more spending power, more people will go into public houses. They realise the advantage of having <Col N="840" /> Ireland on the move and having Ireland building.</P>
    <P>I listened to much of this debate.  I have not heard any Deputy speak against the increases under this Budget for the old age pensioners or the unemployed although it is expected they will cost about £4,000,000.  With a rising cost of living, who will deny those people something to cover the increased cost in the standard of living in the past year?  There is a sum of 2/6d. on the old age pensions and there will be an increase for the contributory pensions.  It is the same in regard to unemployment assistance.  This is the year 1963.  There is a Freedom from Hunger campaign in operation at the moment.  We shall not neglect our unfortunate ones such as the unemployed who, very often through no fault of their own, are out of a position. Naturally, with their families, we should like to be able to keep them in food, if nothing more.  We do not want to have people hungry in this age.</P>
    <P>Any person who considers the matter will realise that the Minister is not imposing this purchase tax on capital goods or buildings because they are essentials.  We want to encourage building.  If we put a purchase tax on housing, the price will go up still further.  We shall make our income from capital goods.  The Minister has designed this Budget to help our improvement growth which has steadily been increasing over the years.  His desire is to help us to keep moving forward which is what I am sure all of us would like and which every one of us is striving his best to accomplish.</P>
    <P>It used to be said that some of our exporters were not keen enough on expanding, but we hear little of that now because four or five years ago there was a reduction in income tax in respect of profits on exports.  We have a population of only 2¾ million and, therefore, a couple of good factories are able to supply the home market.  We have to encourage industries to look for trade abroad.  Great countries have been built up through their export trade.  It is only in that way we can look forward to the expansion of our industries.  We must, therefore, get new firms to set their sights on markets in <Col N="841" /> England, Europe, America and all over the world.  That has been happening. Unless that is done, we cannot expect industries to give the employment we need.</P>
    <P>Some firms may complain about the five per cent increase in the corporation profits tax.  This is in respect of an income over £2,500.  This tax is still well below the corporation profits tax in the Common Market countries and in America.  There will still be an incentive to firms in those countries to come here because our tax is well below theirs.  The incentive to engage in the export trade is not being interfered with, either.</P>
    <P>If you read down the figures in the Minister's Budget speech, you will see what he is trying to do.  Subsidies of one form or another, amounting to £40 million, are being given to agriculture. That is a big slice of the Budget. Few Deputies will object to paying that to farmers, because things have not been going that well with the farmers for the past three or four years. They have had a good deal of trouble in the eradication of bovine TB.  They deserve great praise for eradicating bovine TB in 20 of the 26 counties in such a short time.  It was a wonderful effort on their part.</P>
    <P>In the field of social welfare, £34 million will be spent in the coming year for the benefit of pensioners and the unemployed.  Despite anybody saying that the figure should be lower, it is our duty to help the less fortunate in our community as best we can.</P>
    <P>There has been a big increase in the provision for education, on which £21 million will be spent in the coming year.  We like to see the members of every family being put in a position to make a living and improve themselves. We have seen boys get their group certificates from the vocational schools, become apprentices and eventually fitters, electricians and members of various other trades.  Those boys are now earning a good living.  If this idea of building up industry had not been encouraged, those boys would have been in unskilled jobs like their fathers. Now they have a skilled trade and are able to better themselves.  With increased educational opportunities, <Col N="842" /> they will be able to better themselves still further.  As more secondary schools are built, they will be able to go into the professions.  Secondary schools are being built and extended in many towns.  In my own constituency, one has been started in Kilcock and the secondary school attached to the national school in Maynooth is being further extended this year.  This will enable more people to obtain better positions.  Nobody will say we should prevent that development.</P>
    <P>In order to pay for these services, we have to have a tax.  Nobody likes it. When next November comes, the public will not realise this tax is going on.  It will slide in.  You will not notice it.  Every shopkeeper is a business man.  His turnover has been increasing for the past few years, and he wants it to keep on increasing.  He will put it across gradually.</P>
    <P>I had forgotten to mention that some weeks before the Budget an extra 1d per gallon on milk was given. Very little increase was granted to the dairy farmers over the past few years and the Minister has now seen his way to grant an extra penny on the gallon of milk which will cost £1,200,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>He must be a very simple man in regard to other things. One of his points was that the Minister by putting on this turnover tax was going to give money to people who were not doing too well.  Did he read the Taoiseach's speech in the Great Southern Hotel, Galway, when he said that only those people who modernise <Col N="843" /> their factories would get consideration from the Government?  I wonder are people who are not doing too well able to modernise their factories and will they get the money Deputy Crinion promised?</P>
      <P>Everybody was confused when this Budget was announced and they did not know what to think.  I have discussed it with many people and they thought the turnover tax was merely a tax on shopkeepers and that it would not have any effect on them or on normal life at all.  They thought the corporation profits tax was a tax on companies, that it would come out of profits distributed to shareholders or put to reserve, and that instead of putting so much to reserve, these companies would pay so much more to corporation profits tax.  They thought that, after all, that did not affect normal people.  That was the outlook most people had but now they are beginning to realise the impact of the Budget.</P>
      <P>The ordinary shopkeeper did not realise at first that from now on he will have to employ an auditor and that he may be requested by the income tax inspector to employ an auditor.  Up to this, the income tax inspectors were prepared to accept auditor's figures for the accounts of companies or shopkeepers or any other industry, but that does not obtain any longer, and now the income tax inspector, if he wishes, may decide not to accept the figures of a genuine and accredited auditor and can send down his own inspector to the shop to check the records and the daily sales.  As I say, up to this, the income tax inspector accepted the auditor's figures, and of course rightly so.  The auditor had to be correct to the best of his ability, or else his firm went out of business, but as long as his firm was in business, his figures were accepted by the income tax people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has shown very poor confidence in a profession, the accountant's profession, which over the years has proved its worth.  These accountants have done justice and have played fair between the shareholders and directors of companies and between <Col N="844" /> companies and the Government, or the income tax inspector.  The Minister should have shown more confidence in them than to say that in future they will send in inspectors.  When the Minister was returned to office in 1958, one of the first things he said was that he was going to examine the Civil Service and make as many reductions as he could by not taking on extra hands and not filling vacancies when people retired.  This new measure is going to increase the number of civil servants very substantially.  That would be accepted in war time but this idea of increasing civil servants for the purpose of checking accounts where auditors have already been employed is not to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sherwin said, the Government must get the money.  They are short of money, but why are they short?  Were things not buoyant last year and if they had held their hand and been reasonable, there would be no need for this taxation.  It is only because of their wasteful expenditure that it is required.  They talk in millions and spend in millions.  When the Taoiseach was speaking about the trade balance, he mentioned the figure of £100,000 and when he was reminded by Deputy Dillon that it was £100 million, he asked what was the difference?  What is the difference between £100,000 and £100 million?</P>
    <P>The public service debt has increased from £24½ million in 1958-59 to £34½ million for 1962-63, an increase of £10 million.  There would be something to be said for that if we could see genuine results from the expenditure of that money which created the public debt which has to be serviced and which in five years has increased by £10 million. What do we see?  What are the results of this increase?  Emigration is still continuing and the number of young people between the ages of 18 and 30 who are emigrating is just as high as ever.  The Minister for Finance spent some time explaining that the emigration figures had gone down.  I remember the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach explaining that it was very difficult to get the emigration figures between each census and that it was only when we had the full five-year <Col N="845" /> period that we get them accurately. But now we can get them every year. If we think they are improving, we can produce figures&mdash;where they come from I do not know.</P>
    <P>As I say, there would be some reason for the increase in the public debt if emigration had stopped and if there were increased employment, but there are 30,000 fewer employed now than when the Government took office. On top of that, unemployment returns were much higher than in the past year.  The figure for the week ending 20th April was 58,549.  In 1962, it was 52,650 and in 1951, 51,484, an increase of 7,365 and that is along with our increased public debt and increased capital charges.</P>
    <P>Have the capital investments given the return which they should give? Are the ordinary people getting the benefit of that capital investment?  I do not think it is being spent to the best advantage. Last January and February, the number of unemployed was 10,000 higher than in the previous year.  The Taoiseach said it was because of the snow and the hard weather.  That was true.  The building trade was closed down.  Meath County Council closed down although others did not.  Certain employment could not continue in that weather. But everybody felt that the 10,000 would come down to a normal figure, or even show a reduction on the figure for the previous year, when the weather improved.  Instead, there was an increase of 7,365 as compared with 1961.  Does that show that capital investment has proved its worth?</P>
    <P>What confidence can the people have in the new economic plan which Deputy Crinion told us the Taoiseach had produced, when the same man, when out of office and with more time to think, produced a blueprint that was to give 100,000 new jobs, spaced at the rate of 20,000 per year?  Even after all the capital expenditure and increased capital charges, we find now we have 30,000 fewer employed.  What confidence can we have that the next economic plan will not work out in the same way as the 1957 plan?  I remember that we found it hard going <Col N="846" /> when we saw the posters saying: &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands back to work by voting Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  People believed that but now, after six years of Fianna Fáil Government, we have fewer employed.  This Government have always made out that they are the working-man's party and represent the worker and that there is no need for a Labour Party.  This talk of a &ldquo;movement to the left&rdquo; is part of it. Of course, Fine Gael do not represent the worker; they do not represent anybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but if Fianna Fáil feel sympathy for the people and want to try to remedy the ills of the people, do they think it will improve the health of the people to reduce food subsidies as they did in 1952 and to put up the cost of ordinary foodstuffs, as they did then?  They had a good excuse.  They said it was because of the mess left by the inter-Party Government.  In 1958, when they got back to office, they used the same excuse.  They said the country was in a terrible mess and that they had to remove the subsidies altogether, despite the fact that the then Taoiseach had said that it was suggested that Fianna Fáil would put up the price of food and had asked would anybody think of Fianna Fáil doing such a thing?  But they did it in 1952 and in 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, they must have money flowing in.  When the flow dried up, they brought in PAYE.  That brought people into the income tax paying bracket who had not paid it before. Apparently that inflow is now drying up and they come along with the turnover tax.  No doubt, if the inter-Party Government had been in office we would have been told that the turnover tax had to be introduced because of the mess they had made.  But it has been a Fianna Fáil Government not for one term of office but for portion of a second term and the necessity for a turnover tax arises.  They must have increased money every day and it is the workingman, the man with the large family who must suffer.  Since last August, the cost of living has gone up three points.  What will be the effect of <Col N="847" /> the turnover tax?  Deputies opposite are saying that it will not affect this and that but it will be put on to every item.  Only next November, December and January will we realise that.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, said the House was aware that the Government were considering a purchase, sales or turnover tax.  I do not think that was ever announced in the House but it was announced at various dinners and Fianna Fáil cumann meetings and the suggestion was that it would affect only luxuries. There was no question of anything else.  I should like to put on record, and I think every Deputy should state, the effects of that tax.  It will have very little effect on luxuries because those who can buy luxuries can afford the 2½ per cent. but it will hurt the person buying a lb. of tea to the extent of a 1½d., the person buying cigarettes to the extent of ld., the person buying a small whiskey to the same extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Only to a certain section and it will not go very far. You might say that there is already a tax on food because the removal of subsidies in 1952 and 1958 increased the price of food.  But this is a direct tax on the food of the ordinary people. The Government are searching so hard for revenue that even the person with £50 turnover must now keep records and pay tax.  Imagine a shop selling less than £2 worth per day having to keep records.  Is that not a terrible state of affairs?</P>

      <P>Yes, but is this not going to make tax-dodgers of ordinary, decent people who had no intention of breaking the law?  They merely wanted to live quietly until called to their reward but now they will be wondering when will they be caught. You might say they will become thieves of a kind.  Is that not a terrible thing?</P>
      <P>The Government are hoping, and are going a good way about making it come true, that the day of the small man is gone, together with the small farmer and small shopkeeper.  Many Government Deputies make a point about this tax that it will not be noticed and that with present day competition, the supermarket will cover it up.  Is that the hope of the Government, that the small shopkeepers will be wiped out by the supermarket?  As a result of the Government's agricultural policy, a tremendous number of small farmers have been wiped out and now I feel the small shopkeeper will be taxed out of existence.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice last night said the prosperity in the country is so wonderful that the turnover tax and the corporation profits tax will be absorbed.  I wonder what effect this Budget will have on the tourist industry? The tourist industry has been boosted.  Bord Fáilte and other organisations are trying to promote and expand tourism.  This Budget means that after 1st November a person who stays at an hotel will get his hotel bill plus 10 per cent service charge, plus 2½ per cent turnover tax&mdash;two pluses on his hotel bill.  Will that help to develop the tourist industry or can the supporters of Fianna Fáil say that the tax will be absorbed in the profits of the hotel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw recently figures showing profits of some hotel companies in Dublin.  In one company running two of the principal hotels in the country, the profits in 1961 were £13,000 and in 1962, had gone down to £7,029. That shows the prosperity in the tourist industry at present.  These are figures produced by the hotels, which must make certified returns.  In the <Col N="849" /> case of another very prominent restaurant and hotel in this city, the profit in 1961 was £5,019 and in 1962, £452&mdash;less than £500.  These hoteliers will be called upon to pay the corporation profits tax so that the Government may be able to give subsidies and grants to luxury hotels to compete with them.  They will be pilloried. Out of the small profits they make, they will have to pay corporation profits tax, so that the Government may get the money to enable them to build luxury hotels and luxury Parliament buildings.</P>
    <P>The corporation profits tax has been increased by five per cent and that is to cover even the first £2,500. Even the small hotelier will now be called upon to pay corporation profits tax&mdash;not the person with the small hotel&mdash;but the person with the hotel with small profits, which is by no means a small hotel.  It is estimated that this will yield an extra £3 million and the tax is being made retrospective to January.  It is a terrible thing that this tax should be made retrospective.  Every industry and firm has its accounts made up for the previous year and will now have to make extra provision for this retrospective tax.</P>
    <P>Take an industry earning £10,000 a year.  The income tax and corporation profits tax will be £4,541. That might be the entire liquid resources of the firm.  Any progressive firm that made £10,000 would use some of the profit to increase stock or to make small additions to the premises.  The Government say to that firm: &ldquo;We want all the liquid money you have.  Hand it over.&rdquo;  If the firm have an overdraft in the bank, it will have no hope of reducing the overdraft after the Government deduct this £4,541.  This tax is to yield an extra £3 million and the Government will get out of these firms alone in the coming year £7 million.</P>
    <P>Will there be any hope that such firms could pay out cash for a new lorry costing £3,000?  The Government should appreciate the difficulties facing such firms when they are called upon to make such a big contribution in <Col N="850" /> taxes.  It is a cruel hardship on small firms.  The firm that makes £10,000 a year need not be too small.  The Government are taking practically half of that profit from them.</P>
    <P>I did not mind the Taoiseach speaking about agriculture because I do not think the man has any idea of agriculture and does not intend to acquire knowledge of the subject.  He was talking about the price of milk and said that any increase in the price of milk would mean an increase of 1/- in the price of butter.  That shows the Taoiseach's knowledge of farming. The Taoiseach said that a lot of money was being spent on agriculture, in the eradication of TB and otherwise. I wonder if the Government are spending this money in the right direction?</P>
    <P>I thought that if any extra money were to be given to agriculture, it would be given for the restoration of Section B of the Land Project.  That is the most essential section.  Only wealthy persons can reclaim land under Section A.  Money has to be put down in a lump sum under that section.  It is only a man who can put down from £1,000 down to £100 who can get his land reclaimed.  Under Section B, the cost can be included in the annuities.  That is a sensible provision that I thought would be made in this Budget.  As a result of the discontinuance of Section B, contractors have given up working for the Land Commission.  There is no demand for them.  People cannot afford to pay the lump sum.  The result is more unemployment.</P>
    <P>We got a note yesterday showing the number of acres done in each county and the number of schemes carried out in each county.  How much finer a report would we have if Section B had been continued?  I thought the least the Government would have done would be to derate the first £20 in the valuation of agricultural land. That is fundamental if they want to encourage small farmers but that was not done.  There has been no mention of it.</P>
    <P>There is at present 60 per cent foreign wheat and 40 per cent Irish wheat in flour grist.  There is no reason <Col N="851" /> why the ratio should not be reversed to 60 per cent Irish and 40 per cent foreign.  Apparently, the policy of the Government is to kill and cut down wheatgrowing, in the belief that it is costing the people too much.  Is that the only thing that is costing the people too much?  Without any trouble, there could be 60 per cent Irish wheat and 40 per cent foreign wheat in the flour grist but, due to the policy of the Government, the ratio is 60 per cent foreign and 40 per cent Irish.</P>
    <P>The increases in social welfare benefits are very modest, although, of course, they would be welcome at any time.  I should like to know if there is any relief for persons on fixed incomes, the persons who have been affected by this Government all along. The incomes of such persons were reduced immediately the Government reduced the food subsidies in 1962, again reduced when they removed the food subsidies in 1958 and are now being further reduced by the turnover tax.  Is any compensation to be given to the people on fixed incomes?</P>
    <P>On Sunday, I took the <i>Sunday Press</i> in the hope that I would see some good point in the Budget brought out.  I thought there would be a feature giving our views, and that there would be other articles and comments, but to my amazement, there was not one line in the <i>Sunday Press</i> about the most extraordinary Budget ever introduced. The fact that there was not one line of comment shows that there must be no silver lining to the Budget, if the <i>Sunday Press</i> could not find it.  They realised what a frightful Budget it was, and they decided it was best to leave it alone.</P>
    <P>Will this Budget encourage our young people to stay in the country? Will further taxation encourage them to stay at home?  I have known men who became redundant when the stations at which they worked on the Portlaoise-Kilkenny main line were closed.  They were offered employment in Waterford and other places, but rather than go to other parts of the country, they considered going to England, the idea being that they could keep their roots at home and send money from England to support their <Col N="852" /> families, rather than try to run two houses at home.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Budget will encourage the tourist industry.  Those are the two questions I ask.  Will it encourage young people to stay at home and will it encourage the tourist industry? When a person gets his hotel bill, there will be a ten per cent service charge on it, and there will be a 2½ per cent turnover tax on the hotel bill, plus the 10 per cent service charge. A Minister has asked: &ldquo;What would you have done to deal with this terrible catastrophe?&rdquo; We would not have done this because we would not be in that position.</P>

      <P>The speech to which we have just listened exemplifies the policy of the Fine Gael Party.  One thing which inevitably arouses their antagonism is any endeavour to develop the natural resources of the country, and to provide the people with a better standard of living.  I do not want to hark back to what happened in 1948, when the transatlantic air service was sabotaged, and when several industrial projects were shut down.  Rather do I wish to emphasise the contrast between the policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party when in office, and that which has been advocated, even in this debate, by the Parties in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Wednesday last, after he had listened to Deputy Dillon and, on the preceding day, to his chief lieutenant, Deputy Sweetman, the Taoiseach, in the opening passages of his speech, said three things which it is essential to seize upon and note, if we are to understand the importance of the part <Col N="853" /> which this year's Budget will play in the development of the national economy.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat them because it is imperative to impress these three things firmly and clearly on our minds.  The first is:</P>
    <P>This Budget rests on the proposition that economic and social progress require increased Government spending.</P>
    <P>The second is:</P>
    <P>We can cut down on Government spending only by cutting back on economic and social improvement.</P>
    <P>The third is:</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael approach&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to national problems&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;as disclosed in Deputy Dillon's speech this afternoon and in speeches made by him and his colleagues yesterday, is negative, deflationary, timorous, political in the extreme. The Fianna Fáil attitude is, and I hope will always remain, positive, constructive and national.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's dynamic, forthright exposition of the principles and policy embodied in this year's Budget should be contrasted with the performance on Wednesday of Deputy Dillon when, wailing like a lost banshee, he went meandering from dreary prognostication to dreary prognostication, with no more support for them than his debilitated imagination.  What the Taoiseach said should be contrasted also with the barren ineptitudes of Deputy Sweetman, the flippant inconsequences of Deputy Norton, and the attempt to have it both ways of Deputy Corish.</P>
    <P>If the comparison is made, there will be no doubt in the mind of any sane man or woman that the direction of this country's affairs should remain where it now lies.  Indeed, anyone who is concerned for the country's wellbeing must be appalled to read the speeches of the Opposition Leaders, so absolutely empty they are of any constructive suggestion, of any attempt to find a solution for the country's problems.</P>
    <P>Take Deputy Dillon's speech as an <Col N="854" /> example.  In his more expansive moments, Deputy Dillon talks like the master-mind of the universe.  When he is in that mood, his arms open to fold in his embrace the whole democratic world.  His big heart yearns not merely for friendship, brotherhood and union with Western Europe, but he wants to include the Americas as well. That is, of course, when he is in that mood.  But on Wednesday, alas, he was not in that mood.  Instead, he spoke like an atavistic throwback. His reference to the citizens of other European States was an anachronism in this day and age.</P>
    <P>At the very moment that the Sovereign Pontiff himself is striving to bring all men together, Deputy Dillon spits, figuratively of course, on any European who aspires to make his home here, who would wish to bring up his children in a Christian environment, or to invest his fortune and his technical knowledge and skill in our rapidly expanding economy&mdash;rapidly expanding, that is, so long as it is directed by the men and the Party who, in face of Fine Gael opposition, launched every industrial development of the many of which Irishmen are proud today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is a man who wanted us to enter into the war so that we might help to save Europe; the man who would have us join NATO; and who urges us to seek an economic <i>entente</i> with Great Britain.  I can understand and appreciate those points of view.  There is nothing dishonourable in holding them, but there is much that is dishonourable, when the Leader of a Party which has written these causes on its banners, stoops as Deputy Dillon did in his speech on Wednesday last, to the most rabid xenophobia.</P>
    <P>Those who have listened on other occasions to Deputy Dillon perorating <i>ad nauseam</i> on the great principles of liberalism, on the free flow of men, money and materials, must have thought on Wednesday that it was not Deputy Dillon at all that was in it, but a changeling who was with us. However, we all know the fable of the basket of apples and how one bad one corrupted and made rotten the others.  Here it was exemplified before <Col N="855" /> us on Wednesday last, when we heard Deputy Dillon, the son of John Dillon, and the grandson of John Blake Dillon, speaking with the authentic tones and accent of Deputy Oliver James Flanagan.</P>
    <P>I wish to be unfair to no man, least of all to Deputy Dillon, but there was one passage in his speech to which I would particularly refer.  I must do so, because the point he made was relevant to the critical problem in the knowledge of which this Budget has been framed. It is the fact, to which he called attention, that the Agreement of Association between Greece and the European Economic Community is not proving the boon to the farmer that it was expected to be.  I am sure I shall do the Deputy no injustice if I say that the plain implication of his reference to Greece is that as strongly as ever he would support the entrance of this State into the European Community.</P>
    <P>Let us consider that for a moment. Deputy Dillon is anxious that we should become members of the Community. So are the Government.  So, I believe, is the vast majority of our people.  Yet, apart from the fact that it was recognised that we could not be admitted unless Great Britain were admitted also, what was the special objection which was raised against the acceptance of our application?  It was that by European standards ours is an underdeveloped economy.</P>
    <P>This Budget, as was every Fianna Fáil Budget that preceded it, is designed to reduce that objection to a nullity.  This Budget is, as they were, a Budget for national development. Every figure in it, every figure in the Estimates for the Supply Services, and every figure in the Capital Budget proclaims that fact.</P>
    <P>The Government have embarked on this programme of economic expansion, not with any desire to spend the national capital on grandiose schemes or to provide employment at any cost, but because we are convinced that, if it is to survive, this nation must expand and greatly expand economically. There is no cure for our social problems, for emigration, for late marriages, for unemployment, for <Col N="856" /> derelict farms and deserted countrysides and decaying towns, except in economic expansion.  If the Government were to fail to face up to that fact, were to fail to accept the fiscal and financial consequences of it, then this nation would inevitably stagnate and decay. Nothing within the foresight of man is surer than that.  Our ability to cope with the ills I have mentioned depends on our ability to do business with the rest of the world, over a much more extended range of territory, with a greater variety of commodities, and on much more even terms, than we have been able to do business heretofore.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon rejoiced that we still have what he described as &ldquo;a viable and invaluable market in Great Britain for our livestock and for a large proportion of our industrial output.&rdquo;  I shall not quarrel with Deputy Dillon's description of our right of entry into the British market.  It is a right which rests on the Irish Agreement which the Fianna Fáil Government of the day made with the British Government in 1938.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, however, the folly of the first Coalition in 1948, when it repealed the External Relations Act, has left our place in the British Market less assured, less viable, and, because less assured, less valuable, than it was under the 1933 Agreement.  When Deputy Dillon, let me recall, at the behest of Deputy Dr. Browne, on whom today he vents his sarcasm and his chagrin, doffed the Union Jack and sported the Tricolour as his personal adornment, he set in train the erosive influences which are eating into the highly favoured position, which from 1938 until 1948, we had enjoyed in the British Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If our external relations with Great Britain had been left undisturbed&mdash;and there was no necessity to disturb them for the Republic of Ireland Act added nothing to our independence and did nothing to enhance our stature as a nation&mdash;the British Government would not have yielded in 1960 to Danish pressure, neither would they have ventured to enforce their anti-dumping laws against our butter, nor to visit on our dairy farmers the consequences <Col N="857" /> of Deputy Dillon's folly in 1948.  But that is by the way.</P>
    <P>My sole purpose in directing attention to what happened in 1961, is to show that Deputy Dillon, and those who share his views, are much too complacent about our market in Great Britain.  We may be able to hold our place there in the coming years.  I hope we shall but, if we do, it will be in the face of the keenest competition, even perhaps in the face of pressure brought to bear on Great Britain herself to exclude us.  Certainly it will not be on the same basis as it was before the External Relations Act was repealed.  The fact is that unless far-reaching measures are taken to develop our production and to make it more efficient, the nation will be hard put to maintain even its present population on our present standard of living.</P>
    <P>Since 1958, by which year our Minister for Finance had rescued our public finances from the chaotic confusion into which, for a second time, a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition had thrown them, every Fianna Fáil Budget has been an expansionist Budget&mdash;expansionist but not inflationary, because the increase in public investment was matched by an increase in productivity, in industrial and agricultural expansion, and in employment.  Admittedly our public debt is high, the highest in our history.  So is our credit, and our credit is high because it is recognised that expansion is vital to the nation.</P>

      <P>The public has outgrown the old out-worn Fine Gael dogma that we can exist on the basis of a predominantly agricultural economy.  It realises now that everything possible must be done to raise the efficiency of our agriculture to the limit of our achievement and that manufacturing industries must be established to absorb not only the natural increase in the population but those who may be displaced by the increasing mechanisation of our farming. <Col N="858" /> They have shown that, in our endeavour to accomplish this, they are prepared to back us not only with their votes but with their savings.</P>
      <P>May I say now how glad I am to note that we are not without backing for that policy even on the benches opposite.  On Thursday, in the course of a lucid, thoughtful and constructive speech&mdash;one, indeed, which merits the consideration of every member of this House&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;I quote from Volume 202, column 496 of the Official Report&mdash;said :</P>
      <P>This country has operated for many decades a successful combination of private enterprise and State endeavour.  I believe that it is a sound and progressive programme which has returned the best dividends to the country.  It might be described as a pragmatic approach to the matter but it is the way in which it works and how it works that matters.</P>
      <P>Two sentences later Deputy Cosgrave declared:</P>
      <P>What we want to see here is a progressive programme of development initiated and continued.</P>
      <P>Still later in relation to the State's expenditure on our education services, he recalled that in 1930-31, the total sum provided for this purpose was £4,697,000 and in 1961/62 £19,500,000. From this he went on to point out, as reported in Column 497:</P>
      <P>We find that 30 years ago, we spent 21 per cent of the total Supply Estimates on education and last year we spent only 35.4 per cent of the total for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I wonder how much would be spent if Deputy Sweetman, who wanted us to slow down on Government expenditure, or Deputy Crotty, were in office and determining the policy of the nation in relation to education?  However, to continue with the speech of Deputy Cosgrave:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to avail of our investments in the promotion of industry and exploit them to the full, we must depend for that exploitation on the <Col N="859" /> competence and skill of the people who run these industries.  We must ensure that we can exploit that to the full and the only way it can be done is to increase the expenditure on education.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting how this speech of Deputy Cosgrave's differs in its tone and tenor from those delivered by the Leader of the Opposition and by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman.  What person, if he did not hear those three speeches for himself, if he had no more than a reading of them to guide him, would believe that they were delivered from the same Front Bench.</P>
    <P>In the same speech, moreover, Deputy Cosgrave adverted to a matter, to which I have already referred, the maintenance of our position in the British Market and it is manifest from the terms in which he discussed it, that he does not share Deputy Dillon's complacency in regard to it.  Quite the contrary, I should say.  He realises how vulnerable and insecure our position in that market may become.  For Deputy Cosgrave quoted at column 492, and I think made his own, the view which was expressed in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> for March in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it must be noted that Denmark, in particular, is pressing for wider exports to the United Kingdom.  British Government spokesmen have already indicated that it might be possible to give additional concessions to Denmark without conflicting with the Commonwealth position in the British agricultural market.</P>
    <P>From this Deputy Cosgrave went on to say something with which I am in full agreement, and which, for those who may not have heard him, I must quote.  It is reported at Columns 492 and 493 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>That, I believe, poses very serious problems for this country.  A recent announcement of the revised British quota for butter indicated that the Danish quota is about eight times our quota.  From recollection, the <Col N="860" /> figures are that Denmark will be entitled to 96,000 tons this year compared with a quota for this country of 12,000 tons.  There is little use in establishing bodies like Bord Bainne or any other State organisation unless we secure either from their direct intervention or from bilateral or, if possible, wider multilateral trading arrangements, a market for the commodities we have to sell.</P>
    <P>This balanced appreciation of our true position in regard to our largest and oldest market is in striking contrast to the euphoric trance into which Deputy Dillon passes when the words &ldquo;British Market&rdquo; fall from his lips.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have quoted that Deputy Cosgrave, unlike Deputy Dillon, has given serious thought to our present relationship with the power which controls that market.  Until the repeal of the External Relations Act in 1948, that relationship, expressed on its economic side by the Trade Agreement of ten years earlier, was on the whole quite a satisfactory one. At any rate it worked, even during World War II, and it was acceptable to both parties.  So far as this portion of Ireland was concerned, we had all the privileges of the Commonwealth and all the rights of independence, uncompromised and unreserved.  This special position was not only one of great consequence to us, but was one of great delicacy as well.  For under it we had, what is seldom if ever secured in `real politik', the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>However, that happy position, as must now be apparent to everyone who is not complacent and who has been in contact with later developments, and as the passage of time will make clearer still, was balanced on the knife-edge of the External Relations Act; and that Act being gone, it is highly improbable that we shall ever be able to regain our favoured position in the British market.  Certainly not, I fear, in my time.  However, thanks to Mr. MacBride and his fellow-travellers of Clann na Poblachta, we are where we are in this and other markets and we must make the best of it.</P>
    <P>How shall we do that?  First, by <Col N="861" /> doing everything we can to raise even higher, and even higher again the efficiency of our agriculture, until we rival the Danes in the British Market. That should be our first objective and we must not be deterred from pursuing it by the fact that the change which it will bring about may not be to everybody's liking.</P>
    <P>How vigorously the present Government has been pursuing this objective is shown by the continuously increasing provision which has been made for the aiding and development of the agricultural industry in every Budget since 1959.  In this year's Budget, the amount is £22.9 million; in that for 1959/60 it was £10.13 million.  I have unfortunately not been able to obtain comparable figures for the last Budgets of the first and second Coalitions.  I am sure the provision was substantially less, a mere fraction of what is in our Budget today.</P>
    <P>If we take into consideration assistance from other sources in addition to that provided in the current Budget, we can institute a comparison between our attitude towards agriculture and the attitude manifested by the Coalition. The total aid provided by the State and State bodies towards the development of agriculture was £10.9 millions in 1950/51; £17.1 million in 1956/57; and £37.3 millions last year. This year, it is expected to exceed £40 millions.  In fact, one would be justified in saying that since 1956/57 the community, through the State alone, has invested, or at the end of this year will have provided, the better part of £120 million for the improvement of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>This has been supplemented by an investment, possibly on an even larger scale, by private sources.  This, relatively speaking, huge investment on the part of the State and of certain sections of our community in agricultural industry has produced far-reaching changes in every sector of it.</P>
    <P>The horse has virtually disappeared and its place taken by the tractor. Much that was formerly done slowly and laboriously by manual labour is now done by machinery.  These changes were inevitable.  They have had their <Col N="862" /> impact on the industry in a way about which several Opposition speakers have tried to make heavy weather in this debate.  Among other things, they have changed not only the amount of agricultural employment available but its pattern as well.  This, as I have said, was an inevitable change, a change which we can no more keep back than King Canute could keep back the waves.</P>
    <P>All other things being constant, increasing efficiency means increasing economy in the use of manual labour and, for a time at least, a decrease in the number of persons employed on the land.  But that downward trend in agricultural employment need not necessarily continue.  As our productivity per unit of labour employed increases, as our capacity to compete abroad improves, so, too, will our share of external markets increase and so, too, will the demand for labour increase.  So, too, will the standard of living of all those engaged in agricultural production rise.  But another and not less important consequence will flow from an increasing efficiency in our agriculture.  Some part of the benefits of that efficiency will be passed on to our industrial workers. The cost of living for them will tend to fall making it easier for our manufacturing industries to export and making it easier for those engaged in them to improve still further their conditions and circumstances.</P>
    <P>We must not assume, however, that agriculture can go it alone.  We must make industry more efficient also.  We must put into this purpose the same drive and vigour as we have been putting into agriculture.  Indeed, we may have to put even more because heretofore Irish manufacturing industry has been too limited in its ambitions, too circumscribed in its objectives.  Hitherto the greater part of it has been content with a snug existence at home.  Henceforward, it must be driven out to make a living in the world.  The Government, as the Taoiseach has so often said, is bent on making it do that.  Only by this method can we compel it to re-organise itself, to cut out the deadwood and to expand, so that it will <Col N="863" /> take care not only of the natural increase in our urban population but of those hands whom the increasing efficiency of our agriculture will have made redundant.  It is doing that to some extent already but it must be made to do it on a very much larger scale in future.</P>
    <P>However, it is not only on the immediate objective of holding our own in the British market that we must focus our minds.</P>
    <P>We must anticipate events.  We must prepare for the day, which will surely come, and perhaps sooner than later, when Great Britain is received into the European Community and our application to be received likewise will become once again a living issue.  I have never been one of those who believed that when Great Britain applied for the privilege of admission to the European Community the doors would be flung open at her &ldquo;Open Sesame&rdquo; and the red carpet laid down for her.  Speaking at Wexford on 24th January, 1962, I said:</P>
    <P>Even as late as six months ago some people seemed to be under the delusion that continental Europe was waiting to welcome Great Britain, Denmark and ourselves into it with open arms.  It stands to reason that nothing could be less realistic than such a conception of the position.  The six States, members of the Community, having combined together to establish the Market, are naturally concerned to reserve it as completely as possible for themselves. Not unreasonably, they are asking those who seek to join now, what have they to offer Europe.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I was not unduly depressed when events transpired at the end of last year as they did.  On the contrary, I regarded them as affording us a respite, as prolonging our opportunity to befit ourselves to take and hold our place with the others in the European Community.  Thanks to President de Gaulle, we have that opportunity and we must use every moment of it to equip ourselves for the test before us.  Therefore I, like Deputy Cosgrave, but unlike Deputies <Col N="864" /> Dillon and Sweetman, want to continue the &ldquo;progressive programme of development&rdquo; to paraphrase Deputy Cosgrave's words, which Fianna Fáil has initiated and is carrying through.</P>
    <P>As one cannot make bricks without straw, neither can the State and the community re-organise and improve and expand the total of its productive equipment without spending money&mdash; and spending a great deal of it.  The Leader of the Opposition, in his speech yesterday week, appeared to jib at that fact.  He referred to the sum of the State's gross capital liabilities and committed himself to a statement of such carping irrationality that he himself must have shivered when he read it in the newspapers the following morning.  The National Debt this year, he said, has established a record&mdash;as if that were something to be ashamed of. What else did he expect the National Debt would do?  After all, the national investment last year was greater than that of the year before and that of that year before, in turn, was greater than that of the year which preceded it.  If you have a State with a policy of progressive development, what can you expect but that in every year the National Debt will reach a record figure?  What did Deputy Dillon really think it would do?  Did he expect it would dwindle and disappear?</P>
    <P>The national Debt at 31st March last did stand at a record figure&mdash;and so also did the assets against it.  If they did not, we should not be continuing&mdash; if both these sides had not shown an enlargement &mdash; that progressive programme of development which Deputy Cosgrave, unlike his leader, is convinced is essential for survival.  That the Government and its supporters, and with them Deputy Cosgrave and every intelligent and right-thinking man in this House, no matter where he may sit, are right in this view is proven by the highly satisfactory state of the economy.  If the gross capital liabilities of the State have increased, so also, as I have said, have the State's assets.  So also has the gross national product increased and the national income, as well as our trade, our agricultural production, our manufacturing production, our industrial earnings, <Col N="865" /> the profits from our agriculture, the turnover of our goods and our domestic physical capital formation. All of these things increased in the year 1962-63.</P>
    <P>In this year every favourable economic indicator has reached a new high.  This year we have more habitable houses than ever before; more schools with more pupils; more industries and more people employed in them.  We have greater generating capacity in our electricity stations, selling from them more electricity and supplying more houses, farmsteads and workshops than ever before.  This year also we are able to afford and are, in fact, providing far more for social welfare, education and health than ever before. Yet the share taken from the national product to finance all these manifold and expanding activities has remained virtually unchanged over the past six years.</P>
    <P>Some may ask how the Government have been able to expand the whole economy and to provide so much more satisfactory public facilities and yet have left the rate of taxation imposed practically unchanged.  We have done this by wise investment in the skill and intelligence of our people, by encouraging our producers to make themselves more efficient and by refusing to be deterred from attempting new enterprises simply because no one ever attempted them before.  This is the sort of progressive policy of initiative and courage of which Deputy Cosgrave spoke.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that today we have more schools and more pupils attending them than ever before.  I know nothing that more accurately reflects the degree of prosperity and comfort existing in the homes of our people than the extent to which our children avail of the educational facilities available at secondary schools or higher levels.  In this respect the contrast between the position as it was in 1961-62 and as it was in 1955-56 is highly gratifying.  For example, in 1955-56 the number of children attending secondary schools as whole-time pupils was 59,300; whereas in 1961-62 it was 80,400, an increase <Col N="866" /> of 21,000.  In the earlier year, the number of pupils attending whole-time in continuation and technical schools was 21,300; and in 1961-62, it was 28,300&mdash;an increase of 7,000. In 1955-56, we had about 7,300 university or equivalent students; it is estimated that in 1960-61 it was about 12,500.  In other whole-time educational institutions under various auspices, there were in 1961-62, 1,085 pupils as compared with 1,442 in 1955-56, representing a decrease over the period of 337.</P>
    <P>Why was there a decrease? Because the parents of so many farmers' children, children who formerly would have gone for short-term courses at agricultural colleges and similar institutions, were able to afford to send them to universities, secondary, vocational and technical schools on a whole-time basis for a considerable term of years.  Therefore, since 1955-56 the number of persons attending whole-time in secondary schools, vocational and technical schools, universities and other institutions above primary grade was approximately 113,500 or an increase of 33,000 over 1955-56.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may have heard Deputy Crotty speak.  He was referring to the fact that apparently the rate of increase in employment in industry and agriculture was not as great as he anticipated it would be.  He discounted entirely that 20,000 more are employed in industry than there were when he was in office as Parliamentary Secretary. Does not Deputy Crotty appreciate the significance of the fact that 33,000 more people, children over the age of 14, are at secondary schools than there were when he was in office? When the second Coalition were in office what was happening?  The circumstances of the working class and the small farmers were such that their children were driven out to try to seek employment the moment they reached the age of 14.  Today the parents of those children are able to give them the opportunity of secondary and, even in some case, of a higher education.</P>
    <P>In his speech Deputy Corish made great play with what he described as the loss of employment in agriculture. <Col N="867" /> But does the position to which he referred indicate a deterioration in the conditions of agriculture or of those employed in the industry? In my opinion, it does not.  It would be theoretically possible to have heavy employment on the land provided one adhered to the methods of old-time husbandry.  We will always have the obscurantists, the do-nothings and the what-nots bewailing the fact that men are being replaced by machines.  But if men are being replaced by machines, so is the servile toil which used to mark agricultural employment in the past. If we had adhered to these methods of old-time husbandry, we should not have efficient farming, nor would farmers and their labourers have anything but a low standard of living.</P>
    <P>The decline in the labour force on the land of this country is due not to any decline in the wealth or resources of our farming community, but to their increasing capacity to mechanise their farms and raise the efficiency of their farming.  Naturally, this does lead to some displacement of labour; and the question which calls for investigation is where have these workers gone.  Despite what Deputy Corish would suggest, I doubt if many have emigrated or have remained in the ranks of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The figures for attendance at secondary schools and other educational institutions above primary school level may throw some light on the problem. The total of males in all three categories of the classification &ldquo;engaged in farmwork&rdquo; was 360.8 thousand last year, as against 409.3 thousand in 1956. Thus there was a decrease of 48.5 thousand in the number so engaged. By far the largest of the three categories of farmworkers is that entitled as &ldquo;members of family engaged on the farm.&rdquo;  In 1956, 313.9 thousand males were so classified, but in 1962 there were only 285.0 thousand, or a decrease of 28.9 thousand.  A proportionately heavier fall was experienced among permanent employees on the land, who numbered 55.9 thousand in 1956 and only 44.7 thousand in 1962, and in the number of temporary employees, which had fallen to 31.1 <Col N="868" /> thousand in 1962 as against 39.5 thousand in 1956.</P>
    <P>It is a recognised social phenomenon that no class of society strives harder to give an adequate education to its children than do those who live by the land.  When we see that the number of members of families engaged in farm work fell, within the period 1956 to 1962, by 28,900, surely the question must arise as to what proportion of those were diverted from farm work to study, what proportion of them had gone to swell the number of those who were in attendance at secondary schools and other higher educational establishments in 1961/62.  This attendance, may I remind the House, increased by 33,000 over the period from 1956.  I do not suggest that the whole decrease of 28,900 in the number of family farm workers was absorbed by the educational system but I do suggest that a notably large proportion of it was.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to a consideration of the position in some other occupations than the transportable goods industries.  That there has been an increase in the latter sector is not questioned.  Deputy Corish on Wednesday week conceded a figure of 20,000 but there are other occupations in which there has been a marked increase in personnel since 1956.  These are the professions, for instance, including not only the law, medicine, dentistry, architecture and engineering, and veterinary, but all the ancillary professions such as radiography, physiotherapy, etc., etc. Then we have the teaching profession and the nursing profession, in particular that of mental nursing, a large proportion of whose members are recruited from rural families.  Statistics for the growth in these professions are not yet available; but when they are published, the fallacy in Deputy Corish's argument will be more clearly revealed.</P>
    <P>Another fallacious argument which Deputy Corish applied to the Budget is that the proportion of tax revenue applied to meet expenditure on social security was less than when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  This emphatically is not the case.  When the present Leader of the Labour Party <Col N="869" /> was Minister for Social Welfare, the expenditure on social security, that is, on social insurance, social assistance and the administration of these services, defrayed from taxation, was £29 million or 31.9 per cent of expenditure on Supply Services.  Last year, the amount provided under the same heading was £39.340 million or 33.3 per cent of expenditure on supply defrayed from taxation.</P>
    <P>Thus, absolutely and relatively, the amount provided by Fianna Fáil to meet social security needs is substantially higher than when Deputy Corish had responsibility for it.  In fact last year it was approximately £10 million or over 33? per cent higher.  I may have misunderstood the drift of the Deputy's argument but it is one which he has made on several occasions here. It seemed to me that the Leader of the Labour Party was advancing the proposition that every time more money was provided for other services, there ought be an extension of the social security services also.  In my opinion, that proposition is so patently absurd that I take it it is not seriously intended by any person who hopes at one time or another to have responsibility for any Government Department; but if it be intended seriously, just think of what it means.</P>
    <P>I take it to mean, and nothing in the Official Report of Deputy Corish's speech suggests otherwise, that every time an increased amount is provided for agriculture, or for housing, health, the Army, the Guards, or education, a proportionate amount or an equal amount&mdash;Deputy Corish did not make it clear which&mdash;is to be raised for further social security benefits.  Perhaps Deputy Corish, when he has had the opportunity of reading this speech, will tell the House why it should be. By what argument does he justify his proposal, on what principle does he base it?  This plan of his, if given effect to, would have three consequences: it would make the supply Budget unmanageable; it would soak the producers and make their position intolerable; and it would make life a bed of roses for the workshy.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party also seemed aggrieved that taxation is not heavier.  He complained indeed that <Col N="870" /> we are among the more lightly taxed countries in Europe.  Well, we are certainly not among the more heavily taxed.  Nevertheless there is a feeling abroad, and it is very widespread among workers, even among those who vote in Dublin North-East, that we are sufficiently taxed as it is.  However, it is perhaps as well that the workers should know in time that if ever the Labour Party formed a Government and Deputy Corish became Taoiseach, one of his primary objectives would be to jack up taxation here to British and German levels.</P>
    <P>This will be cheering news for all income tax payers, who are now approaching 300,000 in number, and a vast majority of whom are industrial wage earners or white collar workers, striving to bring up their families and keep up a decent appearance on meagre salaries.  I hope the Labour Party candidate, Mr. Larkin, in the course of his peregrinations throughout the constituency, when he is addressing white collar workers, and particularly the lower paid civil servants, will tell them of the Labour Party's policy of jacking up taxation here to the British and German levels.  Of course, Deputy Corish may disclaim any intention of soaking the mere income taxpayer and claim that his real quarry is the person who pays surtax.  There are 4,000 such people with salaries of £2,501 and upwards.  They are already paying in income tax and surtax anything up to 15/- in the £, depending on their income.  Over and above what they paid in income tax last year, in 1961-62, they paid £2,226,000 in sur-tax.  We all heard the fable about the man with the goose which laid the golden eggs and who was not contented with what he had.  Deputy Corish is possibly in the position of that man.</P>
    <P>Many of these people have been attracted here by the fact that our existing rates of tax are in some sections of the income scale lower than in Great Britain.  Such people provide, relatively speaking, a great deal of employment, domestic and otherwise, and contribute substantially to our loans. And if they go, shall we not lose, not only the employment arising here from what they spend, but the tax which they <Col N="871" /> pay to our Exchequer, and the contribution which their capital &mdash;and it is very important&mdash;makes to our economic development as well?</P>
    <P>But while Deputy Corish grumbles because taxation is not heavy enough, Deputy Dillon is dissatisfied because he contends that it is the heaviest ever. I think I have shown how shallow and unthinking is the Labour Party's approach to the problem of taxation. Mercifully, I am not called upon to give equal consideration to Deputy Dillon's assertion, for one fact in itself and the conclusion to be drawn from it, confutes him.  And the fact is that the total amount collected in taxation in 1962/63 represented 22.6 per cent of the gross national product, and this Deputy Corish says is too little.  Deputy Dillon says it is too much.</P>
    <P>For the year 1956/57, which the House will recall was the last Budget year of the second Coalition Government, of which Deputy Corish was a member, the percentage of the gross national product taken in taxation was 22.6, that is to say, was exactly the same.</P>
    <P>But in relation to Budgetary problems, 1956/57 is of peculiar interest. In that year, Deputy Corish was not to be heard calling for an increase in direct taxation.  Nor was Deputy Sweetman.</P>
    <P>Instead these two Deputies, then colleagues in the last Coalition Government, combined on two occasions to impose the most oppressive blanket of indirect taxation that they could devise. It covered virtually every sort of article or commodity, in domestic, business or industrial use.  Food&mdash;the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party are very voluble about food now&mdash;clothing, fruit, furniture, domestic appliances, clocks, plastics, haberdashery, household sewing machines, office equipment, toys, typewriters, pens, all were taxed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And they were taxed not at the nominal rate of 2½ <Col N="872" /> per cent, but at rates ranging from 3 3/5 pence per lb. on unprocessed fruit, and 4 4/5 per lb. on certain tinned fruits, up to 60 per cent on a wide range of articles, with an almost equally wide range taxed at 37½ per cent, with a comparatively limited range taxed at 15 per cent.  I suppose when they came to consider articles taxed at only 15 per cent Deputy Sweetman was amazed at his own moderation.</P>
      <P>Need I tell the House that, despite the burning repugnance to indirect taxation which he expressed here last week, Deputy Corish did not resign from the Government.  Nor did Deputy Sweetman, despite his speech of last Tuesday, increase the income tax. Moreover he did not come within millions of balancing that year's Budget, despite all these exactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, one word about the turnover tax in the present Budget.  Unlike Deputy Sweetman's oppressive levies, the proposed new tax is not a tax on commodities, nor is it a tax on sales, as such.  It is a tax on retail turnover, a tax which falls in the first instance on the retailer, but which the retailer is free to pass on like any other expense to his customers to the extent that market conditions will allow.  But he is not called upon to pass it on in the form of a surcharge on every article he sells.  That disposes of the ridiculous speech made by Deputy Crotty, a speech which is only matched by that delivered by his leader last Wednesday week.  The retailer may impose a surcharge on everything he sells; or on only a selection of the things he sells; or, if it suits his business best, he may make no surcharge at all.  All this is at his own discretion.</P>
      <P>Thus, all the talk there has been in this House, about taxing a reel of thread and a box of pins or an ounce of knitting yarn, such as Deputy Dillon indulged in, was unadulterated dithering.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>So also was the fanciful picture of the expense and inconvenience to which traders would be put in computing and paying their share of the tax.  In that regard, there is only one simple fact to be determined; one simple calculation to be made; and one simple operation to be performed.</P>
      <P>The simple fact to be determined is what was the turnover for the month of the business concerned, and that should not give the proprietor any trouble at all; the simple calculation to be made is to ascertain what does 2½ per cent of the ascertained turnover amount to, and that should not give the proprietor any trouble; and, finally, the simple operation is to fill in on the Revenue form provided the figures for the turnover for the month concerned, to write out a cheque for 2½ per cent of the turnover, and to put cheque and form in the Revenue envelope provided, post it to the Revenue Commissioners, and the whole thing is done.</P>
      <P>I note, however, that despite the extreme simplicity of the whole process, there is a tendency in some quarters to exaggerate its complexity and to try to make a mountain out of a molehill.</P>
      <P>In another quarter, a gentleman, professing to speak for a business which its customers believe has been unduly sedulous in looking after its interests to their disadvantage, is already looking on the tax as presenting the trade in question with an opportunity to profiteer, and to collect more from the public than would in any circumstances be warranted.</P>
      <P>It is to be hoped that his proposal will not be pursued, for if it should be, it will prove ultimately not to be to the advantage of the business concerned.</P>
      <P>I have kept the House too long I am sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am here now.  Is that not where you would like to be? I want to refer to, and repeat, what the Taoiseach said in the House on Wednesday last when he made these three points about this Budget and our policy.  The first is:</P>
      <P>This Budget rests on the proposition that economic and social progress require increased Government spending ...  We can cut down on Government spending only by cutting back on economic and social improvement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, of course, was the policy which Deputy Sweetman committed himself to on Tuesday week last when he said that he was going to have a freezing of all the provisions made for the Supply Services, no matter for what purpose. Having regard to the fact that these are mounting and that people are naturally anxious to improve their position and their share of the national loaf, that would only mean that somebody would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have all this talk about economic development, what they would do if they were in office, how taxation would be lighter <Col N="875" /> with no necessity to borrow, the National Debt not increasing and therefore provision of additional taxation to meet increases in National Debt would not arise either.  Now will some of them get up and boldly say what one of the services does he propose to cut?  There has been a considerable increase in the amount provided for education, in the amount provided for health, in the amount provided for social welfare, in the amount provided for industrial development, in the amount provided for agriculture.  Which of these would Deputy Sweetman cut back in order that he might establish the expenditure-freeze  of which he spoke on Tuesday last?</P>

We are not securing any greater part of the national product in revenue but the flow is evener; it is coming in a much more even flow now than when Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance and when I was Minister for Finance and, fortunately for Dr. Ryan, he is able to take advantage of that fact and is able to give to the taxpayer in this year the benefit of the surplus which has accrued in the Exchequer account.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that Deputy Sweetman does not like hearing what the Taoiseach said.  So I repeat it for the third time&mdash;this time, I hope, without interruption.  The first thing the Taoiseach said is that this Budget rests on the proposition that economic and social progress require increased Government spending.  That cannot be gainsaid because, as the Taoiseach said, we can cut down on Government spending only by cutting back on economic and social improvement. Finally, the third thing he said is this&mdash;and this is, of course, what annoyed Deputy Sweetman and the others opposite:</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael approach, as disclosed in Deputy Dillon's speech this afternoon and in speeches made by him and his colleagues yesterday, is negative, deflationary, timorous, political in the extreme.  The Fianna Fáil attitude is, and I hope will always remain, positive, constructive and national.</P>

      <P>It is amazing that the Tánaiste could say so much about so little and say nothing upon the subject that is under discussion. We are discussing the Budget of 1963. He has dealt with external relations, <Col N="877" /> with what the inter-Party Government did, with what they did not do.  He commented on their sins of omission and sins of commission and as far as he was able, he, like the Minister for Finance, has tried to cloud the whole issue, to conceal the actual position.</P>
      <P>This Budget faces three ways.  I should not like to describe it as the three-card trick but it is very close to it and resembles it very much.  The Tánaiste says two things.  First, he says that the trader, the merchant, may pay the whole of the 2½ per cent tax or, he says, on the other hand, he may put portion of the tax on some items and, of course, that it would be impossible for him to put it on the box of matches or the packet of cigarettes. When Fianna Fáil will be talking to the trader they will be quite clear and definite in saying: &ldquo;You can recoup yourself in full for the amount of the 2½ per cent tax&rdquo; and when they are talking to the consumer they can say: &ldquo;You will not have to pay it at all. The trader will have to pay that.&rdquo; Then we find a third picture being painted.  The Government say that it is easily paid.  The Tánaiste described the simple method by which 2½ per cent would be collected upon the gross turnover of goods and services, which has been calculated at various figures but which, it is agreed, is greater than £600 million.  He suggested that it is a very simple matter to extract 2½ per cent on the turnover of £600 million and that, of course, they have to do it only once a month.  Therefore, there is this exercise that the small and the large trader will have to undertake. This exercise will be imposed upon them.  If anybody thinks that the traders like it, they must also think they are great patriots because I cannot see the traders or the big combines or the big concerns doing all this for the sake of Kathleen Ní Houlihán. Yet, that is what the Tánaiste would have us believe, that it is so simple that they will really like the operation and will pay the 2½ per cent without question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed at the picture which Fianna Fáil can paint of every Budget that they have introduced since they came into this House.  Every Budget <Col N="878" /> they have brought in has been in the interests of the people&mdash;national effort &mdash;national endeavour.  When the Tánaiste was speaking I felt I should like to look at the speech the Taoiseach made on 15th October, 1947 when Fianna Fáil were introducing their Supplementary Budget.  I quote from the Taoiseach as reported at column 392 of the Official Report of 15th October, 1947:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will give you, in much greater detail, the picture of our economic conditions in relation to general world conditions. At this stage, I shall merely sum up by saying that our position is serious and calls for grave thought and well considered action, not by the Government only, but by all sections of the community.  There is good reason, however, for confidence that, with goodwill and hard work, we will overcome our difficulties, which are far less grave than those being encountered at present by other countries.</P>
    <P>As I say, the position is a serious one.  In some respects, the dangers and difficulties are greater than they were at any time during the war. There is no ready-made solution, no rule-of-thumb method of preventing hardship.  Our immediate task is, as it was during the war.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;It was right to wave the old flag&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to reduce to a minimum the burden which the community as a whole must bear and to distribute it as equitably as may be humanly possible among the different sections of our people.  The long-term task is to increase our production, our output of food and manufactured goods, and to make all our services efficient to the maximum extent.  This can only be accomplished by hard work and willing acceptance of the sacrifices which, in the present circumstances, are inevitable.</P>
    <P>Cheers! That was the head of the Government speaking in October, 1947, of the hardship and difficulty of extracting £5½ million more from the people. He told us it was essential to do that Of course, what annoys the Tánaiste and the Fianna Fáil Government is <Col N="879" /> that they have an uneasy conscience because when we took over the following year, we removed that burden.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat here for the past half- hour listening to the venerable Tánaiste dealing with the evils, and the sins of omission and commission, of the two inter-Party Governments during the years 1948 to 1951 and 1955 to 1957.  I am simply replying to his comments and saying that because we took over and relieved the people of the imposition of that burden, Fianna Fáil will never forgive us.  We eliminated the hardships that were to take place but did not take place.  Today the Government are imposing not £4½ million but £12½ million in a full year of new taxation, at a time when they admit the deficit they require to cover is not more than £4 million when the Exchequer balance is taken into account.  With a buoyant revenue last year from PAYE, they should have been able to maintain and increase the services without difficulty.</P>
      <P>How do we intend to compete with other countries in the world markets? By imposing a further burden of taxation on our people.  The President of the United States, speaking last week, declared that unless Congress carried through the tax reliefs and concessions he proposed, there would be greater unemployment in the United States than there is at the moment. One of the points he made was that taxation must be reduced by hundreds of billions of dollars.  For what purpose? To enable production to take place, and to leave more money in the hands of those who earn it, thereby creating a buoyant economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain budgeted for a deficit and he followed the same line of thought. He declared that purchasing power must be left in the hands of the people. A very short time after the British Budget we find that 90,000 more people are employed than were employed prior to the Budget.  Unemployment <Col N="880" /> has fallen by 90,000.  It has been argued that that is mostly seasonal employment.  That may be the reason for portion of the drop in unemployment, but still it is a very striking figure.</P>
    <P>We were asked what we would cut. That is an old trick.  Deputy Burke, speaking for the Fianna Fáil Party, I suppose, bled for the Old IRA.  I am glad the Minister for Defence has come into the House because Deputy Burke said they would gladly pay for everything that was necessary but they had not the money.  That was not the defence of the Minister for Defence in refusing my motion and calling upon Deputy Burke and the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party to vote against it. What was his defence?&mdash;that they were well and generously treated, not that there was not enough money. Deputy Burke is the other side of the coin.  He will speak to the people of Dublin and he will be able to repeat what he said here on that matter, and he will say that now the IRA are bound to get what they are entitled to, and what the Minister and Deputy Burke would gladly have given them, if they had the money.  They will have an excess of about £8 million now. Will the Old IRA be dealt with now? Let us hope so, but I do not believe they will.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the 1d. a gallon that was given on milk, I wonder what do the Government think the dairy farmers feel about the turnover tax.  With the increase in the cost of living, the increase on the rates, the 2½ per cent. increase they will have to pay on the price of fertilisers, and the increase on everything they have to purchase, not only will one penny be eaten up but twopence will be eaten up, and they will be worse off&mdash;50 per cent. worse off&mdash;than they were before they got the 1d. on the gallon of milk, out of a Budget in which it is admitted that there will be a surplus of £5 million to £7 million next year.</P>
    <P>In my view, the turnover tax will eliminate the small trader.  It appears to be the policy of Fianna Fáil to eliminate the small trader and the small farmer.  The day that happens <Col N="881" /> will be the worst day in this country's history, because, remember, it was the small trader and the small farmer who bought for us whatever bit of freedom we now enjoy.  A very prominent Fianna Fáil spokesman said to me quite recently that the Civil War was bound to occur because, he said, the revolutionary of the 1916 to 1921 period was the shopboy, the shop assistant, the carpenter, the tailor and the blacksmith; they eliminated the upper middle-class, who had been the leaders of Irish thought prior to that and, he said, they themselves, in turn, had to be eliminated.</P>
    <P>Now the Government set up by the shopboy, by the carpenter and the blacksmith are to extinguish the class that put them into office.  It is an extraordinary turn of the wheel and when to-day I heard the Tánaiste referring to our repeal of the External Relations Act, and the bad day that was for our trade with Britain, I vowed to myself one solemn vow that I would have his speech photostatted, when it is printed in the Official Debates of this House and send a copy to every person who was in the Four Courts in 1922 and who is alive to-day.</P>
    <P>I will send it to the Minister for External Affairs, too; it was he who, in my presence in Athlone, declared that the British market was no longer available, and that it would be a great blessing if every British ship were at the bottom of the sea; and, when opposition was voiced and it was pointed out we would face hard times, he said: &ldquo;Not at all.  We will have the best times ever.  Instead of having to tighten our belts we will be able to loosen them.&rdquo;  I will send him now a copy of the Tánaiste's speech this morning.  I should like to say to him, too, and to the Tánaiste that, if there was any inconsistency, which there is not, but which he tried to pretend there was, in the Front Bench here, the inconsistency is much greater over there where collective responsibility now rests.  The collective responsibility is vested and now lies in that Front Bench there as the Government, not with the Front Bench here, or with the Labour Front <Col N="882" /> Bench.  The Front Bench over there should take good care that, when they say something, they are in harmony and unison and there is no contradiction in policy.</P>
    <P>We get the Taoiseach then, when speaking on this Budget, asserting that the swing is now to the left.  What exactly does he mean?  I should like to ask you, Sir, and everybody in this House, to consider what that phrase means.  It has a well-known interpretation in international parlance.  If you were to see a newspaper tomorrow stating that the Italian Government are swinging to the left, what interpretation would you take from that?  If you saw a declaration by the Premier of Italy that he was swinging to the left, what interpretation would you take from it?  The phrase has only one meaning.  It is a phrase that should never have been used.  You may say, if you want to, that you want to build up an affluent society.  You may say that you want to have, if you want to, christian socialism.  You may say that there are steps you would like to take, more extreme steps, for the education of our people.  But &ldquo;swing to the left&rdquo;! I do not want to labour it, but when we are attacked here by a veteran like the Tánaiste, whom some would take seriously, we are compelled to reply.  Indeed, I saw a young Deputy sitting behind him, smiling with the greatest of pleasure and delighting in the old warrior's attack upon my colleagues here.</P>
    <P>There are many more things I should like to say but I do not know that it would be any advantage to say them. I must, however, go on record as protesting against the corporation profits tax being made retrospective.  I have some small association with a few firms, firms that are just surviving.  In my opinion, this imposition will send them to the wall.  Is that what the Government want?  If it is not what they want, then it is even worse because they are doing something they do not properly understand and the implications of which they have not properly examined.</P>
    <P>The imposition of tax upon the co-operative societies is a retrograde step. These societies have been of great <Col N="883" /> assistance to Governments of this country.  They have done much to assist the agricultural community, the dairy farmers and others, to get sale for their produce.  Mark you, they have acted as bankers for the farmers when it was difficult for them to get credit. Now there is to be a further burden on the farmers by this imposition on them in their co-operative capacity.  It is true that the Minister has said that it is only upon the non-agricultural things they sell that the turnover tax will be imposed.  The profit made by the co-operative societies helps them to pay better prices to the suppliers of milk to their creameries and to give long-term credits for seeds and the other things in which the co-operative societies engage.</P>
    <P>Recently I saw an article in <i>The Kerryman</i>.  It was a statement from the Vice-President of the National Farmers' Association in Cork.  He said they were disappointed with the Budget because it did not give credit for the first £20 valuation on agricultural land.  He went on to say :</P>
    <P>Local government expenditure will be increased as a result of this Budget.  It will increase beyond the estimate recently provided for the services in county council estimates. County councils will have to pay more for their raw materials of various kinds, cement, food, clothing, equipment, machinery, and many other items.  The effect of this will be felt in the local rates next year as a result of the supplementary estimates that the council may bring in.  This will all add up, I am afraid, to a heavier load on the already overburdened farmer as a taxpayer.</P>
    <P>That is a well thought-out analysis of what will be the results of the Budget proposals.</P>
    <P>The Government have reverted to their old philosophy.  I said&mdash;and I do not intend to go into it again&mdash;in 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1947 that Fianna Fáil had adopted the landlord philosophy: the higher the rent on the tenant, the heavier the load, the kinder he will draw.  That continues to be their philosophy.  I hope when the <Col N="884" /> people realise the nature and the extent of this Budget, they will call on the Government in no uncertain fashion to resign and take the consequences and let a Government in who will carry out their programme and their promises.</P>
    <P>In Fine Gael, we have a programme and a policy which when put into operation will, for the first time, in my opinion, give the Irish people an opportunity of earning a livelihood at home.  We go so far as to say that we can substantially reduce the rates in both town and country.  Finally, that programme will bring about increased production, national prosperity and the realisation that the Irish man or woman working at home in Ireland has the first claim upon his or her own earnings.  I assert that there is no person better entitled to spend my money than I am who earned it.</P>
    <P>In the forge long ago, the more I worked, the more I earned.  If it was going to be taken from me in income tax, I would have stopped short.  If I could get for ten sets of shoes only the same amount as I could get for four, I would stop at the four.  When I knew that every set I put on meant greater compensation, then the result was increased production, greater output. Until the Government gives the worker and the industrialist compensation for their labour and effort, production will not increase.</P>
    <P>The lip service now being paid by this Government to the Irish agriculturist is a deathbed repentance.  The one ambition of the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce in previous Governments was to set up industry at any cost and at any height of protection.  The farmer was of no great import.  Of course, he was right to a certain extent because when in 1948 the skin of a calf realised 10/-, what use was it to do anything on the land?  What was the use in fertilising or draining land?  We reversed all that, notwithstanding the Tánaiste's declaration that the 1948 Trade Agreement did not meet the situation.  It may not perhaps have met it from the industrial point of view but it was a positive improvement which proved of great advantage to the agricultural <Col N="885" /> community if it did nothing but change the price of the calf from 10/- for his skin to £12 per head.</P>
    <P>This Budget has been ill-conceived. It is badly thought out.  There are other methods which could be utilised such as a purchase tax.  The one they have adopted is the one that will impose the greatest hardship and bring in what I thought was dead for ever as far as Fianna Fáil were concerned, that is, the full of the ditch of inspectors.  The Minister for Finance in his speech has said they reserve to themselves the right to inspect and investigate.  I wonder how many new jobs there are in that.  I only hope it will not be necessary to be a member of a Fianna Fáil cumann to get one of these jobs because it will be a smasher.  Not even in the palmiest days of the Boston Circle could they have thought out a plan under which there would be as much trickery and tax evasion as there will be under this type of administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryPDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.P. Dockrell Mr. H.P. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to speak at very great length on this Budget.  The overall taxation picture is that the Minister cannot make up his mind whether to have in this country a continental system or to continue with the old income tax code which we had up to this. The implementation of this turnover tax gave the Minister a golden opportunity to abolish Schedule A tax and so release some of his Department to work on the new tax.  The Schedule A tax, as I understand it, brings in only something over £1 million and I would ask the Minister to consider abolishing this tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the cost of collection of the new turnover tax would be only one per cent.  I heard the Minister for Justice tell the House that the reason the cost would be so low was the new computer the Department proposes to have in operation, I think, some time in June.  While I bow to the Minister for Justice in his knowledge of what a computer can do, I do not think a computer will be able to call in on all the small shopkeepers and harry them into making the necessary returns.  If the computer can do that, it must indeed be a very wonderful machine.  These froms when they <Col N="886" /> have been completed, must be checked. While the computer, I am sure, would be very good at checking the forms, somebody has to send them off again to the business people and shopkeepers and they also have to collect the tax.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, in changing the assessment of non-business premises from Schedule A, as it has been hitherto, to Schedule D will hit widows and also retired people.  I should like to make a strong plea to the Minister to go back to the old system and to leave them under Schedule A.</P>
    <P>Up to this, when a wife had lost her support, she was able, if lucky enough to have a house, to let portion of it in order to make up her income.  Furthermore, numbers of people, in contemplation of their retirement, bought property, expecting to receive the rent. They will be hit very hard by this new tax.</P>
    <P>All the speakers on the Fianna Fáil side of the House stressed that the new turnover tax need not be imposed by the shopkeepers.  I overheard a Dublin business man speaking to a friend.  He said his company were considering an all-round increase of between six and seven per cent to cover the 2½ per cent. turnover tax, to cover the cost of collection and also the cost of the additional book-keeping.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil speakers say that business poeple and shopkeepers need not pass on the tax, they are hiding their heads in the sand.  I am quite certain that when Black Friday, 1st November next, dawns and when the people look into the shop windows they will then see that they&mdash;the public&mdash;will have to pay this tax and that all items&mdash;tea, sugar, bread, butter and everything else&mdash;have been increased by considerably more than 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has considered the effect of this tax on rates? As a member of the Dublin Health Authority, I have been wondering what effect it will have on that body. I do not know whether the Minister has finally decided that this tax will apply to medicines but, assuming it does, the increased amount for health charges alone in respect of Dublin city, Dublin county and Dún Laoghaire, will be £100,000: that £100,000 gives <Col N="887" /> credit for the same amount being paid by the Minister in his 50 per cent grant.  That, I feel, will be a very heavy burden.  However, the ratepayers of these three authorities will also have to meet a tax on the other items.  When one considers all these matters, one wonders how the Taoiseach, when speaking in this debate, could say that the cost of living would go up only two per cent.  I certainly feel it will be at least four per cent.</P>
    <P>I wonder how this new turnover tax will affect people such as architects, auctioneers and stockbrokers.  An architect, when he designs a house, does not see any of the purchase price of that house and I assume that the tax will apply only to his fees&mdash;but that is not at all clear.  An auctioneer is in a slightly different position in that, if he sells premises by public auction, he receives the deposit, that is, one quarter of the purchase price.  That is the last he sees of the purchase money.  In only a very rare auction will he see the rest of the purchase money.  A stockbroker is in a different category because he receives the purchase money.  Whether it be buying or selling shares, the total purchase price of the shares passes through his hands.  Will he be subject to the tax only in respect of his commission or will it be on the total purchase price of the stocks and shares he has dealt with?</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister in this Budget proposes to reduce the stamp duty on certain transfers as from, I think, 1st of August.  That, I take it, is an effort by the Minister to keep the Dublin Stock Exchange on a par with the London Stock Exchange.  If this new turnover tax is to apply to stockbrokers in respect of the full purchase price of the shares in which they deal, then the Minister in one part of the Budget is endeavouring to price the Dublin Stock Exchange into the market but in another part, he is pricing them out again.  It may be that I am wrong &mdash;I hope I am&mdash;and that in respect of the three categories I mentioned&mdash; architects, stockbrokers and auctioneers&mdash;if the tax will apply to them at all, it will apply only to their commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> There is one other matter I should like to raise with the Minister.  In the second paragraph of the second White Paper on Direct Taxation, there is a proposal that the system of collection of surtax be changed and that surtax be payable on 1st of January in the year of assessment instead of 1st of January of the following year.  Does that mean it is proposed to skip a year, or is it proposed to collect two years at one fell swoop?  I would ask the Minister to consider that.  It is a matter that will arise certainly on the Finance Bill, and possibly when we see the Finance Bill, we will be better able to deal with it.  Meanwhile, perhaps the Minister would look into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody listening to the violent attacks which have been made upon the Budget can only be driven to the conclusion that they were prepared and premeditated before the Minister even entered the House.  It was inevitable that the terms of the Budget would include some form of taxation, and criticism of it was to be expected.  But the attacks make one suspect the Opposition are cynical and are concerned not so much with the alleged burden placed on the people but rather with their own anger and disappointment that some exorbitant and startling tax had not been introduced.</P>
      <P>The turnover tax is neither startling nor exorbitant.  By no stretch of the imagination can it be described as a tax which the people will be unable to bear.  It is a fair and equitable tax, so evenly spread over the whole community that it can be met without any intolerable strain on the individual purse.  The tax has the added virtue that it can ensure for the Exchequer a steady share of the increasing national wealth.  Real national wealth is increasing, and it bids fair to continue increasing, despite the attempt of Opposition Deputies to prove otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increased national wealth, in which every section have been able to share, has come about as a direct result of the Fianna Fáil policy of industrial expansion, in spite of cynical criticism from the Opposition.  It would be <Col N="889" /> amusing, if it were not tragic, to hear the Budget described as a brake on industry, as if the Government would be responsible for deliberately obstructing the forward march of an industrial movement for which the Government alone are responsible.  There is a mass of legislation on the Statute Book offering to industry inducements of all kinds &mdash;grants, loans and incentives.  All of this legislation bears witness to the sincerity of Fianna Fáil in their avowed aim to provide remunerative employment for the maximum number of people.</P>
    <P>Speaking of employment, one is led to the inevitable comparison between conditions as they now are and those which obtained in 1956-57 when, under a Fine Gael dominated coalition, unemployment rose to the staggering total of 97,000.  As a result, a blanket of gloom and depression descended upon the country.  Only the intervention of a sane, intelligent, progressive Fianna Fáil policy saved the country from disaster at that time.  The country was saved not alone by the policy of the Government but by the extent of the co-operation of the people, workers, management and trade unions alike.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House believe we can depend on the people to realise that the moneys raised from taxation will be returned to them by way of increased employment, higher wages, better social benefits and a higher standard of living.  There is no easy road to national economic and social success. Nothing good, sound or lasting can be achieved without effort and some sacrifice.  Any attempt by Fine Gael to imply that an easy living can be achieved by waving some magic wand merely demonstrates that Party's lack of faith in the intelligence of the Irish people.</P>

Jessop, Professor of Social Medicine, Trinity College, Dublin at the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland in Dublin on 26th April with regard to the lack of teaching equipment in the training hospitals in this country; whether he will investigate the situation whereby the medical schools are responsible for providing teaching equipment for medical students, whether in the universities or in the hospitals, while the Hospitals Trust Fund may not be used for any educational work of this type, and the medical schools have no rights over property installed in the hospitals; and <Col N="891" /> whether he will take steps towards co-ordinating the various aspects of medical training within the hospitals with a view to reducing the number of authorities involved and enabling Hospitals Trust funds to be used for improving hospital facilities for training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a copy of the paper read by Senator Professor Jessop recently at a meeting of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the course of that paper the speaker did not refer to any need to investigate, or otherwise deal with, the situation in which the medical schools are responsible for the provision of facilities or equipment in those schools for such portion of the course for medical students as is appropriate to be conducted in those schools.  As far as I am aware, there is no complaint on this score but, in any event, if there were such complaint it would be inappropriate that I should investigate it, as is suggested by the Deputy, since the statutory functions in regard to this matter rest with the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The speaker mentioned difficulties which arise in the financing by the medical teaching bodies of the provision of accommodation and equipment for the teaching of medical students in hospitals.  It is clear from his remarks that he had the voluntary teaching hospitals particularly in mind.</P>
      <P>The Deputy does not appear to appreciate that the facilities provided for the treatment of patients in the teaching hospitals are adequate for the major portion of the clinical training of medical students in those hospitals. In fact, the complaint of the speaker at the recent meeting appears to have been limited to the narrow field of laboratory facilities in the hospitals in excess of those needed for the treatment of the hospital patients and to lecture halls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear as to what the Deputy has in mind when he asks in the last part of the question whether &ldquo;I will take steps towards co-ordinating the various aspects of medical training within the hospitals with a view to <Col N="892" /> reducing the number of authorities involved.&rdquo;  If the Deputy will put down a more specific question, I shall endeavour to deal with it; but at this stage I feel that I should point out that, as I understand the situation, only two kinds of authority are concerned, the medical schools and the hospitals, both of which are very jealous of their autonomy and independence, and I feel that neither would welcome an incursion by a Minister for Health, even as a co-ordinating agency.</P>

      <P>We are making considerable strides in that direction.  I think I could say that for next year 80 per cent of the boars to be distributed to the county committees of agriculture will be Large Whites from attested stock, and roughly about 35 to 40 per cent will be Landrace.  That is a considerable advance.  I am prepared to concede that when you make an effort to improve standards by as good a grading process as you can devise, these changes are bound to have results here and there which will prove unsatisfactory and perhaps in some cases irritating.  As I explained on previous occasions, the attempt has been made in three stages and if they create some inconvenience or some loss here and there, well, nothing worthwhile is achieved in a matter of this nature without such.  I am prepared to concede it may have arisen in this case but certainly every action that could be taken by us to avoid such a happening has been taken.</P>

      <P>The scheme of severance pay for ex-GNR workers was designed to mitigate hardship arising from redundancy in the transitional period between the dissolution of the old GNR Board and the establishment on a commercial basis of the Industrial Engineering Company and associated companies at Dundalk. When the scheme had served its purpose it was terminated on 31st November, 1961.  It was made clear at that time that the workers to whom employment was afforded in the newly established companies would be employed on terms and conditions similar to those of workers in comparable employment in other companies and that no further severance payments would thereafter be made in the event of loss of employment.</P>

      <P>I am aware that delays are occurring on trunk calls between Drogheda and Dublin because of a shortage of trunk circuits.  The equipment  <Col N="904" /> necessary to increase the number of circuits has recently been delivered and on completion of installation over the next few months it is expected that the delays now occurring will be eliminated.  In the meantime adequate staffing to assist subscribers who encounter difficulties will be maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to understand the attitude of Fine Gael because that Party is becoming known as the representative of the extreme Right.  It is difficult, however, to understand the line taken by the Labour Party.  As far as one can judge, the policy of that Party, presuming it has a policy, calls for more State intervention and State control. This policy of intervention and control by the State must inevitably lead to higher taxation, much of which would undoubtedly be beneficial in the long <Col N="905" /> run.  So it is very difficult to understand Labour Deputies' criticism of the Budget.</P>
      <P>The turnover tax can be met without undue hardship on the workers. The money collected will be ploughed back to produce the sound economy from which every worker must benefit. The Budget provides for increased social welfare benefits of all kinds&mdash; children's allowances, old age pensions. All of these, I would imagine, would be welcome as good Labour legislation.  One wonders if the Labour Party is representative of any interest.</P>
      <P>I would ask the members of the Labour Party are they satisfied to follow the Fine Gael line and condemn every measure proposed by Fianna Fáil, irrespective of whether that measure confers benefits on the people or not?  Every Budget introduced by this Government has been condemned &mdash;always in similar terms.  Disaster and depression have been forecast by Opposition Deputies year after year. Yet, one has only to look around the city of Dublin to see how these prophets of doom have been confounded. New factories, new office blocks, all bear witness to the confidence inspired by Fianna Fáil legislation.</P>
      <P>I must crave the indulgence of the Chair to allow me to refer briefly to the building industry which is now booming and towards which Dublin Corporation is making such tremendous contribution.  As quickly as new ground and property can be acquired, flats and houses are being erected. The whole face of the city is being transformed, a testimony, I submit, to the healthy state of the economy. What is happening in Dublin is happening all over the country.  This Budget is designed to ensure that the national economy remains healthy and, therefore, must be approved by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No amount of skirting around issues and no amount of recapitulation of allegations of successes in the past will alter the fact that this is, plainly and simply, a bad Budget.  No matter what effort is made to cloud the issues, the fact is inescapable <Col N="906" /> that this Budget will have a direct impact on every section of the community and its heaviest impact will be on the section of the community least equipped to bear it.</P>
      <P>I take it that the concept of a Budget is the indication of Government policy and that it is to act as the directive and the stimulant towards development, local and national.  When considering this Budget, one has to analyse it in the light of a suggested pay pause to the worker, the catastrophic failure to get into the European Economic Community and present economic trends.</P>
      <P>One has to ask oneself simply what contribution, other than the expression of pious and pietistic hopes, does this Budget make to the economy in a period when the Government are saying that we must have reorganisation and improvement of productive methods, a gearing and a stimulation of effort in industry if we are to meet free competition in a widening market. Can one find any answer that will be encouraging to the industrialists, that will stimulate agriculture?  Despite Fianna Fáil thinking and, I am beginning to suspect, Civil Service thinking, agriculture still remains the basis on which any real expansion of production can be hoped for.  We have to analyse this Budget in the light of the answers to these questions.</P>
      <P>This Budget is typical of the inept, ageing Government, a Government bankrupt of new thinking.  We can certainly say that the dead hand of Fianna Fáil is now stretched into every possible facet of economic life.  If the Government had used this new taxation to alleviate substantially the lot of the people who need alleviation, and if in their approach to a breakdown of this iniquitous taxation, they had shown any forward thinking, then one could properly say that there was a new idea abroad, but what Fianna Fáil have achieved in this Budget is another milestone in their capacity to plunder the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget may well be described, as it was described by Deputy Norton in an interjection, as a Dick Turpin <Col N="907" /> Budget, a highwayman's budget, because in this piece of financial wizardry, the Minister is stretching his hand further and further into the wider field of economic endeavour.  He is endeavouring to create a wide and far-flung voluntary type of tax collector.  I did not expect that we would get anything startling or revolutionary from this Government, but in the light of the preaching about the necessity for expansion, the necessity for replacement and improvement of equipment, and the necessity for the worker having to face a time lag between the gearing up of production and getting a more remunerative reward for his labour, I thought we would get a forward thinking Budget. This Budget can be described only as a further atrophying of the economy and a further stultification of initiative.</P>
    <P>The Government have the gross cheek to suggest to the worker that he should accept a pay pause in circumstances in which they are stretching out their hungry paw to grab more and more of the people's money and, as I hope to demonstrate before I finish, give less and less for it.  I have always subscribed to the belief that the worker must inevitably, each time there is a direct impact on his cost of living, have recourse to a demand for a wage increase to compensate for it.  There is no doubt&mdash;and no amount of shilly-shallying or loose thinking will alter the fact&mdash;that this Budget will have a direct and crippling impact on the cost of living of the worker, because no essential to human life is excluded from the Minister's hatchet this time.  The Minister may try to suggest, in every way he likes, that he is not putting a tax on certain commodities, but the facts remain&mdash;and I hope they will be repeated not only in this House but everywhere people gather&mdash;that when this new turnover tax comes into operation, every item in the household budget will be hit.  I am prepared to subscribe fully to the suggestion made by Deputy Norton that the impact on the worker, and on his wife buying small-priced commodities, will inevitably be in excess of the suggested 6d. in the £.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> This Budget&mdash;the instrument which is meant to be the economic green light for the stimulation and encouragement of effort&mdash;starts off by saying to the worker: &ldquo;We want you to accept a pay pause and, at the same time, accept a body blow to every home in the country.&rdquo;  The more one considers the realities of the situation, the more one can find fault with the Budget.  It is not only the new taxation, but also the direction of Government thinking that appals me.  They have found a new and more ready manner of plundering the people.  The Minister quite candidly boasted that it will be a most inexpensive tax to collect.  That causes me to have the grave misgivings which I shall mention during the course of my speech.</P>
    <P>This is only the start of a new pattern in which Fianna Fáil will preserve the full impact of the old taxes, and use the ever-increasing spiral of this tax to plunder more and more of the people's money.  Quite candidly, I do not believe the Minister was as frank with the House as he might have been when dealing with the likely returns of this tax.  I suggest to him&mdash;to put it no further&mdash;that he has given us a gross underestimation of what it will yield for four months.  I can see him coming in here like a fairy godmother, having found the buoyancy of that taxation such that he will be able to plunder the people's money more and more and give less and less in real benefits to anyone.</P>
    <P>This Budget cannot be described as anything but a retrograde Budget.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer of our much criticised neighbour brought in a Budget which gave certain tax remissions and concessions to stimulate industry into greater effort, and which gave relief and very substantial help in areas where unemployment was developing and where there was a serious danger of depression spreading. What have we in this Budget to encourage anyone to greater effort or greater hope for the future?  What have we in this Budget that will stimulate the effort which everyone seems to agree is necessary to modernise, expand and improve the production methods of our industry?</P>
    <P>We are told by the Taoiseach that <Col N="909" /> we have a further breathing space in which to overhaul our industry, to improve our methods and re-equip our industry.  Can the Minister tell me in plain language what stimulus this Budget gives that effort, remembering that he is hitting them with what he euphemistically calls a &ldquo;turnover tax&rdquo; and, at the same time, condemning the worker, irrespective of the incidence of taxation on him, to some kind of wage restraint.  Call it a &ldquo;pay pause&rdquo;&mdash;call it anything you like&mdash;it is merely another apparition of the spectre we saw here before, the spectre which played a mighty part before in putting Fianna Fáil out of office.</P>
    <P>We are told we are to continue to gear ourselves for the wider market of the European Community.  I remember when the Taoiseach came in here and, with assertive truculence, told us we were in and that, even if Britain did not get in, we would go it alone.  I remember when some of us here sincerely and honestly questioned that, we were castigated as people who had not the national interest at heart.  We were cool and deliberate enough to examine the background of the European Community, to analyse and assess Britain's position at the time of the Rome Treaty, to know a little bit about the continental temperament to realise that, in the light of the difficulties that arose at the initiation of the European Economic Community, there could be no question that the most stringent and rigid terms would apply to Britain's entry, terms so rigid that, as the rational thinking person appreciated, they would be unacceptable to both the group and Britain.</P>
    <P>We are still being told it did not happen in 1962 and now the target is apparently 1970.  We are getting, as the Minister for Health described it today, a breathing space in which to reorganise, to improve standards, to develop techniques and sales.  To me, that is all so much hooev.  We are refusing to face the realities.  Our industry has not got the type of raw material intake that will enable it to become a competitor in a free market. The proposition is crystal-clear.  If you have to import raw materials from a competitor country, process them here, and re-distribute them, how can you <Col N="910" /> ever get yourself into the economic situation to compete with the manufacturer in the country of origin with the raw material at hand?  I am getting absolutely sick and tired of spurious experts and economists who indulge in high-falutin language and esoteric statistics in order to keep away from the basic step of breaking down the cost of the raw material and the cost of production and then explaining how they hope that industry here can compete with industry in the countries of origin of the raw material our industry uses.</P>
    <P>For too long have we refrained from considering industry here realistically in relation to our general economy.  It is patently clear that the only successful industry here is industry based on the raw materials we ourselves have.  It must inevitably be based on our agriculture.  The so-called assembly industry is not real from the point of view of a free and competitive market. Too many industries here have been built behind protective tariff walls.  I think it is now generally accepted that many of those who benefited behind the tariff wall may have succeeded in making money for themselves but have never succeeded in making any real contribution to our economy because they were never able to bring their industry to the level of efficiency and production which would constitute a real asset.  With quantitative restrictions and protection, they were able to get away with a far from top-class article at a top-class price.</P>
    <P>Rational thinkers appreciate now that it is virtually inevitable that in freer trading conditions, that type of industry must go to the wall.  Fortunately for us, the employment content in such industry can be re-distributed with a reasonable effort. What I am anxious to see is industry developing on the raw materials available to us.  With our forests now maturing, I want to see industry so geared here that the figures for immense quantities of imported timber and timber products that appear every year in the financial returns will be eliminated.  I want to see the so-called industries which re-assemble goods here based in future on the raw <Col N="911" /> materials to hand, improving their productive methods, improving quality, improving to the extent of making the cost of production competitive in the wider markets of the future.  For some strange reason, while help can be got from the Government in quantitative restrictions or in tariff protection in relation to a mass of these assembly industries, no effort seems to be made to nurse along into a healthy condition the type of industry that can get its raw materials at home.</P>
    <P>I have heard year after year the bleat about difficulties in relation to milk.  When one surveys the economy of the world and looks at the shortage of milk and milk production in vast parts of the world, it is obvious that a processing industry in relation to dried milk and the by-products of milk, if it had been developed, would not only have found a big but a lucrative market in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>There are in this country very considerable by-products of our dairying industry.  Milk, with certain chemical additives, could have become in powder form most readily saleable and valuable products for underdeveloped areas, for areas where there is a chronic shortage of milk and its by-products. However, all the emphasis has been on separating industry from agriculture instead of entwining the two as brothers in the economy. Undoubtedly, industry must always remain the smaller child of the economy because no matter how exports may twist reality, any break down of the export figures will show that it is agriculture that carries the real burden of our economy.</P>
    <P>As I said in opening, the Budget is meant to be the instrument of economic thinking and on that basis this Budget is negative.  What encouragement is there in this Budget for the person who wants to expand or develop his business?  Not only is he running himself into the position of having to pay this iniquitous tax but of having to collect it and pay it over and he will not be able to write it off even as a deductible charge against the earning capacity of his business. <Col N="912" /> To my mind, this is the very antithesis of stimulation but it is wider than that.  This turnover tax goes into the fastnesses and farflung recesses of the retail trade and everybody from the huckster shop to the multiple store will face the impact.</P>
    <P>One of the problems to be faced in the case of many of the smaller retail outlets is book-keeping.  Any process other than the cash payment for goods and the general use of the till for the purposes of the living of the family and for the replenishment of stock does not exist.  These people will be faced with the task of trying to collect a tax they do not understand and to do it by non-existent methods of assessing the turnover.</P>
    <P>It goes further than that.  It shows a new trend of thought, a new method of grinding.  I listened on former occasions to the previous Taoiseach telling us that we had reached saturation point in regard to taxation.  I heard the present Taoiseach assert that the burden of taxation had reached its zenith.  When they get themselves into that cleft stick, the Government impose a turnover tax and suggest it is not taxation at all, even though it is an imposition not only on essential goods and other types of goods but also on services.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that this idea adopted by the Government was based on the recommendation of the Income Taxation Commission, but that Commission recommended the alleviation of certain iniquitous types of tax, as they considered them, by putting on a purchase tax on a wide range of goods other than the essentials.  But no; the backroom boys got to work.  They felt this was a good idea, but, they said: &ldquo;Let us go further.  Let us make it all embracing.  Let it cover everything.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What administrative difficulties would have arisen from excluding essential goods from this tax?  I do not believe any would have existed. I do not believe the Minister would have had any shortfall in his estimation of revenue, if he had excluded the essential items of living: tea, bread, butter, sugar, milk and fuel, from this iniquitous turnover tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> I hear talk about increases in social welfare benefits.  I have never, since the day I entered this House, ceased to press on all Governments that this section of the community, above all other sections, the old age pensioner, the widow, the orphan, the unemployed, are the people to whom the State must give as much as possible as quickly as possible.  The current rate of payment to any of these people in the circumstances of the present cost of living is unreal.  I would not have cavilled if the Minister had brought in this type of purchase tax that gave him considerably more revenue and imposed it immediately, if it were to mean greater benefits for the social welfare classes.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister, instead of postponing his taxation to next November, could have been infinitely more honest with the people of Ireland. He could have carried out the principle embodied in the tax suggested by the Income Tax Commission.  He could have excluded essential goods from the range of impost.  He could even have an increased rate of tax, commencing immediately, on the other wide range of goods that may be described as luxury or semi-luxury in type.</P>
    <P>The 2/6d.&mdash;delayed until the beginning of the year&mdash;and the increase in children's allowances will in no way offset the simple impact in the home on the cost of the essentials&mdash;tea, bread, butter, sugar and milk.  It is certainly a ridiculous optimism to expect the worker who has to meet these charges to sit down and not to seek some way of compensating himself for that loss.</P>
    <P>I approach this Budget completely impersonally and dispassionately on its merits.  I say quite openly to the Minister that I am not the type of person who gets scared by increasing national debt or by glib talk of balance of payments.  I feel that whatever our national debt may rise to, there have been substantial developments under all Governments in this State that have improved our national assets to the extent that while we may keep our eye on the rising figure of national debt <Col N="914" /> we cannot rush into any sense of panic over it.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that a dead hand, woolly thinking and lack of cohesion and progress underline this Budget.  That appals me.  There is no doubt but that in the modern type of democracy there is a growing tendency for more and more State direction and more and more State help and more and more State investment in the development of our economy.  However, one wants to see that type of effort directed towards an ever-increasing build-up of progress.</P>
    <P>I feel quite sincerely that this is a most retrograde Budget.  I never have subscribed and I never shall subscribe to the belief that Fianna Fáil did not do in the course of their administration a lot of worthwhile things in this country no more than I shall fail to praise the Cumann na nGaedheal Government for their initiative in sugar factories and electricity.  Can we fail to give credit for very large projects that have had a favourable employment and economic impact on our general economy which were initiated and ultimately brought to fruition under Fianna Fáil Government? However, it is in the light of exhortation to improvement, the light of exhortation to everybody to try to get that little bit of extra know how, to try to make that little bit of extra effort, that one has to judge the present Budget.</P>
    <P>What encouragement is in this Budget for the person who may be prepared to give fully and generously of the effort asked?  In what way will this arouse enthusiasm for expansion in employment, for the widening of marketing, or for the deepening of research&mdash;and that is taking the philosophy behind the Budget without, as I shall have to cover, its direct deterrent effects on many aspects of our national life?</P>
    <P>No amount of talk, no amount of economic claptrap, no amount of statistical codology will alter the fact that it is now established that the cream of our young people have left this country in their hundreds of thousands in the past 10 years.  Possibly I am naive in my economic thinking <Col N="915" /> when I consider that the loss of young Irish boys and girls in their late teens and early 20's is an irreplaceable facet in economic development, if we have to have it.</P>
    <P>It does seem amazing that these young people leaving this country can readily find themselves in the finest of industrial employment and in a very short period of time find themselves among the very highly paid, efficient, skilled operatives of industry in Britain.  It does seem amazing that, with all the vast amounts of money that have been spent, with all the vast conglomeration of organisations that were meant to be stimulating to the development of industry, we have not been able to keep these people at home or to find the type of employment at home in industry that would encourage them to stay.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I laugh heartily when I hear boasts about efforts to get markets for Irish goods in some far-flung part of the world.  I realise, and everybody is beginning to realise, that there never has been proper market research in the immediate vicinity of our shores in relation to agricultural produce. There never has been a proper expansion in that industry to take up the lacuna in British agricultural imports. I often wondered why, with all this alleged progressive thinking, money has not been spent and research carried out in relation to many of the by-products of agriculture causing difficulty in our economy.</P>
    <P>We have farmers pressing for an increase in the price of milk.  We have the problem of a surplus of butter and, apparently, an inability to dispose of it.  Anybody who analyses the costings cannot gainsay the fact that the farmer is entitled to a better price for his milk at the creamery.  I am convinced that if any real effort had been made over the past 10 or 15 years&mdash;I am not putting the blame entirely on the present Government&mdash;a ready outlet could have been found for either fresh milk, powdered milk or cream to offset the subsidy we have to pay to get Britain to eat our butter.</P>
    <P>It appals me that we do not see in this economic instrument any realistic <Col N="916" /> approach to ensuring increased production in agriculture in an expanding market, where the farmer is assured of a reasonable profit return for his labour on the land.  I can assure the Minister&mdash;and I do not think anybody will disagree with me&mdash;that if the Irish farmer has a reasonable profit incentive, a reasonable scope for markets and the assurance that his produce, properly processed, would be readily saleable, that is the only stimulus he would want to give you, as he has always done in the past, the increased production to bridge the gap.</P>
    <P>This is an unpleasant Budget.  It is iniquitous because of the method it uses to collect its revenue and because it creates more and more voluntary unpaid tax collectors.  It is iniquitous in so far as anybody buying the necessities of life cannot escape its impact.  Furthermore, the iniquity goes to the extent that the impact will be felt by the various institutions ministering to the sick and less fortunate brethren in the community because of the increased cost that will have to be borne by these institutions.  I want to urge on the Minister to take another look at the picture and use his right of exemption to ameliorate the impact on those institutions.</P>
    <P>The impact of rates is already alarming. This turnover tax in relation to all these institutions is nothing less than a further direct impact on the rates.  The money to pay the increased cost of food, fuel and other essentials will have to be found somewhere.  The only place the local authorities can find it is in the pockets of the ratepayers. Outside the cut and thrust of politics, I feel the Minister should have another look at the impact of this turnover tax on these institutions.  I feel his natural inclination would be to preserve that section of the community from this impact.</P>
    <P>I was amused on the evening after the Budget by the incredible stupidity of the Irish journalists reflected in the flamboyant inaccuracies and stupid streamer headlines of the national press.  They announced in glaring headlines that A, B and C had escaped. It was incredible that people who hitherto had shown such a critical <Col N="917" /> analysis of all the Government's financial efforts should be misled by the easy way in which the Minister makes his Financial Statement into missing the import of this turnover tax.  If the caption had been &ldquo;Nobody Escapes&rdquo;, it would have been more realistic because that is the reaction of the people to the Budget.  The farflung tentacles of the octopus of Finance have stretched into every nook and cranny to find heretofore undiscovered gold. I wonder has the Minister, or have his advisers, considered the immediate reaction that took place in relation to large deposits all over the country? Is the Minister aware of the withdrawals of deposits that have been set off by this Budget?</P>

I have appealed to many Ministers for Finance to create a kind of moratorium in respect of all moneys in canisters or stockings hidden away in houses so that they could be put on deposit without fear of paying taxes.  It has always been my ambition to see Irish money in Irish banks and being used for the country's development but when I see the Minister, by a deliberate act and by fossilised thinking, getting these people upset, I feel it is my duty to tell him that this Budget can have that effect and it is up to him to assure the Irish people that their money will be exempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of paying tax.  This turnover tax has created suspicions and difficulties to which the Minister had not yet awakened. The Minister must realise, as any thinking person realises, that it is the extent of the deposits which have made available much of the credit and much of the money which has helped in the progress of the State and if a reassurance is not given and if a brake is not put on withdrawals, it may be difficult to recapture the confidence and trust of the people.  That is why I am talking about the type of financial chicanery which is in this Budget. We are preserving the complete tax code and introducing a new and, as the Minister described it, a virtually inexpensive type of tax collection.  We are not trying to cut down or replace but we are putting another prong in the fork.  The Irish people are not the fools some people think they are.  They <Col N="919" /> feel that this is only the first blow and they will get the next blow next year because the Minister very fairly said that he was not giving out any palliatives in the Budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take another look at this all-embracing tax and see if he cannot exclude from it some of the vital elements in the cost of living. If he does so, he will make the Budget more palatable to a section of the community which deserves our best consideration.  I am a firm believer in the fact that the real way to right our economy is through agriculture.  Let Government speakers try to whitewash it as they like, the fact is that the expansion and developments in agriculture are not what they should be.</P>
      <P>One of my hobbyhorses has always been that we are going all over the world looking for markets, or alternative markets, and we have never got down in a practical way to market research and development in respect of part of a huge market which has to be filled by agricultural products that have to come thousands of miles to England.  I should have liked to have seen this Budget provide funds for personnel to conduct research into the quality and nature of the agricultural products required and the zones of concentration for the sale of such products because I am convinced, and I know the Minister is convinced, that with the growth of advisory services and soil testing and the correlated effort at proper fertilisation, improved seeds and better strains of cattle and pigs, the prime product can be produced in greater quantities, but what we want to find is an expanding market at remunerative prices.  If we sit down and rationally analyse the fact that we have so many of our own people as well as first and second generation Irish people in England, it will readily appear as the place where investigation and research is most necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that between people who have emigrated in this generation and in the past generation, there are 12 million people who can claim to be substantially or wholly Irish.  If the <Col N="920" /> Minister is in earnest about his hopes for progress and development we must sometime find a Government that will face up to the reality of the nearness of the market and its availability and get down to the task of establishing it on a permanent and expanding basis so that the Irish farmer, when he increases production, will be assured that his goods will be absorbed and that not only will our economy generally benefit but his own personal industry will have the normal profit reward for effort.</P>
    <P>One must ask, apart from the alleged benefit in the social welfare group, what benefit there is for anybody in this Budget.  The answer is none.  There is no help for the worker who stands under the shadow of the Minister's paws&mdash;whether pay pause or otherwise. There is a gross indirect imposition by way of labour and tax on the retail community.  There is a gross imposition by way of collecting on all hoteliers and all the people who will give service not only to our own people but to those who come to partake of our hospitality.  For the struggling family business, there is not only the tax and the collection imposition but a further blow in the variation of the corporation profits tax.  This all comes at a time when initiative and expansion should be shown by the Government because we are told there is a tremendous amount to be done to gear us for a free trade situation.</P>
    <P>Can even the most ardent Government supporter, even the most blindfolded Deputy behind the Government, show me where in this Budget there is any stimulation for that kind of effort? Many conscientious people in industry here who are trying to improve their plants, their methods of production and increase the training and skill of employees are shocked and appalled by the peculiar twisted thinking of people who, on one hand, ask for increased effort while plunging the other deeper into the till to take more by a new method.</P>
    <P>I heard the Tánaiste making the case that we must be infinitely better off because more people are attending technical and secondary schools and universities.  To me, that certainly indicates <Col N="921" /> that at last we may be improving in our appraisal of the need for this type of training but I can assure the Minister that there are still vast fields open and vast numbers of improvements necessary to acquire the requisite technical training and skill for industry, agriculture or more scientific pursuits.  An extraordinary thing is that no matter what the Minister may say about these improvements, a vast effort by the Government is still necessary to ensure that all those who live on the land are readily indoctrinated and trained in the husbandry and science of the proper development of that land and the womenfolk properly trained in relation to raising fowl and other industries subsidiary to the main farm working.</P>
    <P>If iniquitous taxation has to come, as it has come in this Budget, there would be at least some solace and relief if we felt that the technical training, experimentation and demonstration in matters of good husbandry were getting closer to the people who work the land.  As I said in my speech on the Vote on Account, no amount of sound and fury can alter the fact that production depends on the work of the farmer and his son and his man on the land.  Whether it be in the growing of cereals or the production of sheep, cattle or pigs for the market, it is there that the knowledge and improved techniques must be made available so that the optimum return can be secured.</P>
    <P>I do not like statements to the effect that there is something wrong with the Irish farmer.  I do not believe there is anything wrong with him that certainty of market and a reasonable return for his effort cannot cure.  Over the years, we have seen the ups and downs of the mixed economy of the Irish farmer.  For instance, there has been tremendous stimulation of bacon production, followed by a fall in price as a result of over-production.  On the other hand, there have been occasions when the person who was lucky enough to hold his pigs while others were getting out of pig production reaped a rich harvest in a period of scarcity. That is a fundamental problem in agriculture.  Until such time as supply and demand can be stabilised or a <Col N="922" /> reasonable floor put under the price of farm produce, it will not be possible to get farmers to increase production at the rate that is possible and, in my opinion, the rate at which farmers should produce in order to ensure the health of our economy.</P>
    <P>The last speaker from the Fianna Fáil benches spoke about prophets of doom and gloom.  I do not believe in either type.  We are a hardy and resilient people.  We would not have preserved our desire for freedom and ultimately achieved it, were it not for the fact that there is a tenacity and strength in the Irish people that is praiseworthy.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that there will be an objective appraisal of the position in order to see where our failures lay in the past 40 years and I want to see an energetic, stimulating effort made to resolve them.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to go so far as to say that up to the very recent past matters distracting to clear economic thinking have impinged on the Irish political scene.  Those who differ have become sufficiently adult and mellow to take an objective view of the situation. The younger people entering this House should be facing the problems of the economic future of the country. Our economic future is completely dependent on the stimulation of agriculture to a pitch of production that will have the capacity to carry virtually 90 per cent of the whole economy.</P>
    <P>There have been failures in relation to agriculture.  We should by now have reached the stage where we can face objectively and dispassionately the problem of expanding production so as to eliminate the spiral of bludgeoning taxation.  Taxation, <i>per se</i> is a deterrent to effort.  The human nature in us makes us resentful of the fact that if we make greater effort and earn more, we have to pay more.  I shall not say that the Minister is not entitled to the money&mdash;he has to get the money.  I say that after all the years of pious prayers and Government hopes that there would be expansion and progress in certain directions, there has not been the progress or expansion there should have been. Therefore, it becomes absolutely incumbent <Col N="923" /> upon the Government, if they are going to seize this ever-increasing incidence of taxation, to find in our own development, and in our own expansion, the buoyancy to keep the State going, and at the same time, reverse the trend.  In my opinion, what Irish people want to stimulate them is some kind of hope that the political euphemisms about the limit of taxation having been reached will have some meaning, and that they will see themselves getting more value for what they have to spend.  This Budget will give them a decreased value and a decreased return in goods for what they will spend.</P>
    <P>Our economy sadly needs an injection that will show that effort and strength of purpose are to be recognised, and that a trend will start, even if only gradually, in the opposite direction, because the difficulty that has been created in recent times is that prices are chasing wages and wages are chasing prices.  The real value of the goods is never equated.  When a man gets an increase in wages of 10/- a week, he never gets an increase of 10/- in goods value.  As soon as he gets the 10/-, up goes the price of a number of essentials, and the worth of the money to him is dissipated with amazing rapidity.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to be able to give the Minister some magic formula that will suddenly arrest that type of disequilibrium between the two, but some kind of control on essential articles is required to keep them in a reasonable balance.  That is why I urge&mdash;not in a purely political Party way but in a very earnest way&mdash;a review of the incidence of this taxation where it relates to the vital essentials, even if limited to vital household essentials and fuel.</P>
    <P>There was much speculation before this Budget was introduced as to whether cigarettes, petrol, tobacco and beer would go up in price.  That speculation is dead now because every single one of them has gone up in price.  It may be postponed until November but every single item has gone up in price. This tax will not be 1d. on this or 1d. on that.  It will be an arbitrary figure which will be ultimately arranged to recoup the retailer for his 6d. in the £, <Col N="924" /> and for whatever else is incidental to its collection.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the pint, which is so often referred to as the working-man's pint&mdash;and he is entitled to it&mdash; the incidence will not be 6d. in the £, but at least 1d. on the pint.  There is no other way of dealing with it.  We will find that the tax on cigarettes will leave the increase against the purchaser and not in his favour.  No matter what way you look at it, 6d. in the £ on Grade 1 petrol is 1½d. on the gallon. There is a difference in the price of Grade 1 and Grade 3 petrol, but I assure the Minister that the difference in the 6d. is not divisible and, whether the Minister appreciates it or not, there will be 1½d. on the gallon of petrol from next November.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that the incidence of a higher rate of taxation in the field the Minister has gone into, excluding the range of goods suggested in the report of the Income Tax Commission, would have been far more acceptable, even to the people who would feel the big impact of that increased taxation, than this far reaching, overall, esoteric concept of plunder.  A tax on the essentials of life is always a shabby tax, and in this instance it is all the more shabby because the Minister has not the courage to allow the people to feel its impact until the hustling and bustling of the by-election are over.  If this iniquitous tax had to come, I would be happier if it had come in immediately, and if greater reliefs had been given to the people who cannot carry the burden.</P>
    <P>I would have far less to say about the iniquity of this Budget if the Minister had the courage to look for his £10½ million this year, and give proper and adequate increases to old age pensioners, widows and orphans, and persons drawing children's allowances. That would be less unfair than this postponement, this dangling of the carrot, which has become a feature of Fianna Fáil philosophy.  Not only is this Budget iniquitous but it is pernicious as well.  It is all-enveloping in its effect.  It creates a new departure in what I describe as distorted financial thinking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> If taxation is to be justified at all, it can be justified only on the basis that it is distributed in accordance with the capacity of people to carry the load.  How can anybody sustain the proposition that there is equality in capacity to carry the load where this turnover tax is concerned?  Looking at the incidence of taxation, it is abundantly clear to all right thinking people that it is the small purchaser, the person who has to scrimp and scrape to get together the price of the half-pound of butter towards the end of the week, the price of the pound of sausages, or even the price of the pot of jam, who will suffer the biggest burden.  The minimum surcharge on these small items will be ½d.  The farthing is no longer a common coin in circulation.  So far as essentials are concerned, therefore, the impact will fall directly and relentlessly on those least able to bear the burden.</P>
    <P>Various forms of purchase tax are operated in many countries.  I have not been able to find any parallel anywhere for this particular type of all-embracing iniquitous taxation.  When the Minister was replying on an earlier occasion, I interjected that this was the sixpenny Budget.  I was not being fair &mdash;it is a great deal shabbier than that. I have no doubt, in the light of the haphazard explanation and the haphazard suggestions made by the Minister as to collection, that the Minister is relying on some artificial means&mdash;he suggests competition&mdash;to ensure the incidence of this tax will not be more than sixpence.  He said: &ldquo;Ah, sure, they won't be fool enough to charge it on the small things.&rdquo;  I will have a little wager with the Minister that, when assessment of this tax is ultimately reached, he will find that the small purchases will have carried an inordinate and disproportionate share of the tax.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister intends to review the incidence of this tax between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill, but I am interested in one particular aspect.  Tremendous strides have been made in Irish racing and the sale of Irish bloodstock because of the levy imposed, administered <Col N="926" /> and distributed through the Racing Board.  Does the Minister not consider that this tax will be a very heavy impost on a very worthwhile industry?  Would the Minister not think it more desirable to allow such moneys to go back into racing to improve breeding and the other amenities and ultimately lead to an even bigger export of Irish bloodstock? That has become a very real and valuable part of our economy.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to Bord na gCon, I suggest that any taxation as a result of this impost should go back again into the development of the greyhound industry.  Development has been a very marked feature of the work of Bord na gCon.  Despite my earlier scepticism, it does appear now that this body has been successful in stimulating the export of Irish greyhounds.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take another look at the picture and see if he does not find substance in the suggestions I make.  During the Hospitals Sweep Derby last year, I was proud of the tremendous contribution made to Irish racing as a result of the levy, the high standard of comfort and the excellent amenities provided and, in particular, the high standard and quality of our bloodstock throughout the length and breadth of our State. That achievement is shown in the ever-increasing sales of our yearlings and two-year olds all over the world.  The Minister might, perhaps unwittingly, cause a set-back to progress as a result of this impost, a set-back which would not be justified, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>Whether the Minister believes it or not, this Budget has given rise to very substantial apprehension and serious and growing displeasure.  What appeared to be and, indeed, was initially swallowed as a sweet pill has turned very bitter on analysis.  Reiterate I must that, broken down to its components, this pill is an increase in the price of bread, butter, tea, sugar, milk, beer, tobacco, cigarettes, petrol and every other article within the retail list of the country's economy.</P>
    <P>We used one time say when Fianna Fáil were going through their period of black Budgets and supplementary <Col N="927" /> Budgets that they were hitting only bread, butter, tea and sugar; they were hitting only articles that were then subsidised. Now they are evolving a new technique, making the incidence seem less but widening the range.  That is exactly what this Budget has done.  It has excluded nobody from the bludgeon. It has created anomalies and duplication that will redound to the improvement of the revenue but act to the detriment of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It has also created another wide range of unpaid tax collectors.  Has the Minister and his advisers any conception of the dilemma of the unfortunate employer, already subscribing by way of the cost of a man, his time and his books, to the collection of PAYE, when he will have to extract this 2½ per cent, euphemistically called turnover tax? Have the Government any plan to have the tax operated by a stamp taxation method, where the issue of sub-particles of the farthing would be possible? Will the incidence of this tax be a haphazard affair as seems to be the case from what the Minister said when he was pilloried with questions? Has any method of collection been planned?</P>
    <P>Again, in the light of the exhortations of the Taoiseach about re-equipment, about the improvement of technique, is he satisfied that this increase of corporation profits tax is of any financial benefit to compensate for the stultifying effect it will have? The 2½ per cent turnover tax read beautifully.  It sounded immensely reasonable when one said it was only 6d. in the £ but when it is 6d. in every £ for every retail commodity bought as well as for every service paid for, is the true estimate of the worth of this 6d. in the £ not very far in excess of the £10½ million which the Minister suggested it was worth in a full year?</P>
    <P>I have not at my hand the figures that may be at the Minister's hand but I would hazard a guess that £13 million a year would be a nearer estimation than £10½ million.  I say the Minister has his tongue in his cheek in his estimate of what he will get for the four months because undoubtedly he will get the tax at the time of <Col N="928" /> greatest spending in the year.  I suppose if the Irish people can be forced to accept this blister, then it will not be Old Mother Hubbard finding her cupboard bare but it will be a suddenly benevolent Minister ploughing the ground for the election harvest.</P>
    <P>I believe and always have believed that there is considerable merit in direct taxation by way of substantial imposts on luxury and semi-luxury goods.  I believe that not only is it a fair method of taxation but that it is a very fair instrument to control inflationary tendencies and to arrest overbuying. I felt the time was overdue, long before the Income Tax Commission report came out, for the consideration of that type of taxation where you could control the incidence of the taxation burden yourself by control of non-essential purchases. However, I never conceived that a Government would be as shabby and as mean as to embrace in such a tax conception the very essentials of life of the very poorest of our community.</P>
    <P>I had always conceived, in economic rectitude, that the incidence of this type of taxation would be used to eliminate gradually some of the worst in Victorian taxation methods we already have.  In relation to the income tax group, I felt in particular that the simplification of that code and the removal of a lot of families with the consequent loss of revenue that might accrue therefrom could fairly have been taken up in this purchase tax on non-essential luxury or semi-luxury goods.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the biggest impetus to spending in that range would come from the same people who were being relieved in the income tax group but I never conceived the idea of the two running side by side.  My imagination fails me as to what will be conceived when saturation point is reached in the incidence of turnover tax.  I reiterate again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It means an increased price for every class of society, in every range of society.  It means an increased cost for the food of the various institutions throughout the country&mdash;hospitals, <Col N="930" /> homes for the old and infirm, and so on.  It means an increase in the price of the ordinary accessories of the house&mdash;soap, boot polish, every conceivable item.  The sooner the Irish people realise that it means an increase in the price of every single conceivable item, the better.</P>
      <P>This Budget also shows a departure in that the Minister is going after the co-operative creamery for the first time. A new tax falls again on the section of the community whose co-operative effort and unified attempt to improve their area has heretofore escaped the voracious and hungry hand of the Minister. No justification has been made for this change.  No basis has been laid for the change.  Is it some queer caprice or is it the constant Fianna Fáil lack of appreciation of the farmer that is behind this tax?</P>
      <P>Remember, where these co-operatives are most effective are in areas not blessed with the best of land or the biggest of farmers.  They are most effective in areas where their combination together have enabled them to give improvements in the area by way of mutual help in machinery and effort.  The work of these creameries has been a vital part in the financing and helping of many farmer subscribers into better, more up-to-date and more improved production methods.</P>
      <P>Many of these co-operatives have, of their own initiative, given to their community benefits by way of technical advice, and instructor skill that would not otherwise have been available. Their contribution to development in these areas was substantial. The immunity they got was recognised as something that was just, in the circumstances of their effort.  I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to tell me why this sudden change has arisen and why these people have to bear the incidence of tax now.</P>
