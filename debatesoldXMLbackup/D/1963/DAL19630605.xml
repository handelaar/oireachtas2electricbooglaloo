    <Title>Death of His Holiness Pope John XXIII.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, as a tribute of respect to the memory of His Holiness Pope John XXIII, Dáil Éireann do now adjourn, and that an expression of its profound sorrow on the death of The Holy Father be sent to His Eminence the Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church.</P>
      <P>Unity among Christians was a major aim of the pontificate of Pope John XXIII, and some extent of his success, after a short reign of less than five years, may be gauged from the very deep and sincere concern shown by people all over the world during his final illness.  That he brought Christians of all denominations closer together is universally acknowledged. Indeed, he won the hearts of people of all nations and creeds by his sincerity and benevolence.</P>
      <P>He gave us, in his personal life, an example of selfless dedication to duty, enlightened by a love for humanity. His zeal for his work, even in the last months of his life, when he suffered sickness and pain, is a continuing inspiration to us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His Holiness has provided, not only for Catholics, but for the world at large, the great exhortation to peace set out in the Encyclical <i>Pacem in Terris.</i> In clear and simple language, he has pointed the way towards the peaceful resolution of world problems without compromise of principle.  The issue of that Encyclical, his last testament, has been universally acclaimed <Col N="636" /> as one of the most significant and important events of our time.</P>
    <P>His other great Encyclical, <i>Mater et Magistra</i>, develops, in the light of modern conditions, the famous Encyclicals <i>Rerum Novarum</i> and <i>Quadragesimo Anno.</i> It defines the social problems facing all national communities and sets out the directive principles by reference to which they should be solved.  It draws special attention to the position of those who derive their livelihood from the land and asserts the importance and dignity of agriculture in inspiring words which, I have ventured to suggest, might with advantage be framed in every Irish farmhouse.</P>
    <P>Pope John XXIII spent a devoted life, as priest and teacher in the seminary, as Papal diplomatic representative and, above all, as Bishop.  He reached the supremacy of the Pontificate without losing the warmth, the tolerance and the humility which endeared him to all whom he met in these varied endeavours.</P>
    <P>And, finally, he crowned his life's achievement by a heroic and patently happy acceptance of a painful death by which he entered his eternal reward. The world is immeasurably the poorer by the passing of this truly great and kindly figure.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I wish to be associated with the motion proposed by the Taoiseach expressing condolence on the death of the Holy Father.  His pontificate has been marked by great events, the great Encyclicals <i>Mater et Magistra</i> and <i>Pacem in Terris</i>, but when these Encyclicals have merged with the long series of great pastorals of his predecessors, it is by some words which he borrowed from the Scriptures, <i>Ut omnes unum sint</i>, that he will be especially remembered, and for words which he himself chose his memory will be especially revered for with these he summarised for all of us his fundamental thought when he said: &ldquo;In things essential, unity; in things <Col N="637" /> doubtful, liberty; in all things, charity.&rdquo;<i>Requiescat in pace.</i></P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish to be associated with this motion.  Much has been said, much can be said, and yet it is so difficult to say anything appropriate enough about the wonderful life and death of our beloved Pope John.  His very greatness stemmed from his humility, his love and charity towards all mankind, based on the Christian teaching of the brotherhood of all mankind.  His detestation of snobbery and selfishness was in contrast to many of the attitudes in the world today.</P>
      <P>We may fail to realise or understand that we have been witnesses to the life and death of one who, please God, may yet be one of the Saints of the Catholic Church.  By the grace of God, may his soul, in the glory of heaven, teach us to live as he lived, by loving all men.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan and I join in expressing deep regret on the <Col N="638" /> death of Pope John.  In his too short reign, he became one of the tiny handful among men throughout recorded history who in their own lifetime and, largely, simply by the example of their own magnanimity, charity and humility have changed the pattern of men's relations with one another throughout all the nations of the world.  He, exceptionally, among either churchmen or statesmen, not only advocated&mdash;that is common enough&mdash;but practised the great, fundamental commandment of the Christian faith, that all mankind, irrespective of race, religious belief, or political ideologies, should learn to love one another.  It would be our greatest tribute to his memory were we to follow his example and honour his teaching in our own lives.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to unanimously.</P>
      <P>

      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 3.15 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 11th June, 1963.</P>
