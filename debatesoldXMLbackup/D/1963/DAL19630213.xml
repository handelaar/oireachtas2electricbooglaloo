      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if an official protest will be made to the United Nations Secretariat against the report of the working group in which this country was described as underdeveloped.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5 together.</P>
      <P>The recent press reports that Ireland was described in a United Nations document as an underdeveloped country were incorrect.  The document in question is the report of a technical working group of the Commission on International Commodity Trade of the United Nations which was set up to study &ldquo;Compensatory Financing for Export Shortfalls&rdquo;. In a footnote to Paragraph 7 of this Report, there is a classification of countries into industrial countries, on the one hand, and primary exporting countries, on the other, the latter category including what are described as &ldquo;economically less developed countries&rdquo;, amongst which Ireland is listed.  The Report gives no criteria for the designation of &ldquo;economically less developed countries&rdquo;, which is, of course, an elastic designation.  In all the circumstances, I do not consider that any formal action is called for, particularly having regard to the statement made in this connection by a United Nations spokesman and since published in our newspapers.</P>

      <P>Is the source of this observation to which exception is taken not the Taoiseach himself in a statement in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 13th November, 1957?  This is what he said then:</P>
      <P>We are glad that Ireland's Ambassador in Paris, Mr. William Patrick Fay, is chairman of the special working party which is examining under what conditions economically less developed nations such as Greece, Turkey, Iceland and Ireland may join the Free Trade Area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Taoiseach confirmed this definition of Ireland in the White Paper introduced here when we announced our intention of joining the EEC? Secondly, is the same definition not implied in the White Paper published on Saturday last which further supports the fact that Ireland is an economically depressed and underdeveloped country, and thirdly, is it not a fact that the CIO report on Irish industry has borne out the fundamental fact that we are an underdeveloped country and that therefore, if we are looking for membership of the Common Market at all, it should be as an associate member?</P>

      <P>The total number of persons on the Live Register at 2 February, 1963 was 70,030.  The percentage unemployed is calculated by relating the number of currently insured persons on the Live Register, excluding those in agriculture, fishing and private domestic service, to the estimated corresponding currently insured population.  The data from which the percentage figures are calculated are collected only for a midmonth date and the provisional figure for 19 January 1963, the latest available date, was 7.7 per cent.  It will be appreciated that on that date the level of unemployment was affected by adverse weather and by seasonal factors.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that a country which has an unemployment record of 7.7 per cent., with approximately 23,000 people emigrating, is a country which could reasonably be described as an underdeveloped country?  The Taoiseach has frequently stated that the record of the Government should be judged by the employment created.  If that is so, his record is deplorably bad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Report of the Royal College of Physicians did not establish as a fact that there is a connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.  The report was mainly a re-statement of the earlier evidence which went to show that there appeared to be a cause and effect relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> Special new publicity material was not prepared in this country as a result of the issue of this report, but considerable publicity was given to its findings and several references were made to the matter in this House&mdash; in particular, my reference to it in my speech introducing the current year's Estimate for my Department.</P>
    <P>Here I may be pardoned if I remind the Deputy of what I said on that occasion, to wit:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the trouble about smoking is that the decision to smoke or not to smoke is a personal one, to be taken by the individual.  No nation has yet found an unfailing method of influencing the generality of its people to do what common sense dictates in the interest of personal health.  Smoking is not a disease. It does not inevitably give rise to disease, and where it does, the disease is not communicable.  It does not endanger the public safety; there is no turpitude attaching to it ; and it cannot be held to be contrary to public morality....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, on that occasion, I said :&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In educating the people as to the risks which smoking involves lies our best hope of reducing the incidence of lung cancer.  But the educational programme must be framed with judgment and psychological discernment.  Nothing would be more likely to evoke an adverse reaction than bellowing propaganda.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We address our propaganda quietly to those principally exposed to the risks associated with smoking.  Copies of one leaflet, aimed at the growing generation, have been sent to every school in the country &mdash; primary, secondary, and vocational&mdash;and to youth clubs, boy scout organisations, the Junior Red Cross, and similar bodies.  Copies of another, addressed to adults, are sent out, as a regular feature, to young parents.  While I do not believe in cluttering up the Library with publications which are not calculated to assist Deputies in their functions as legislators and public representatives, in deference to <Col N="1277" /> the Deputy's insistence I am causing to be placed therein a sample of the leaflets in question.</P>

      <P>Could I now ask the Minister if it is not quite clear that the programme which he has initiated has been a failure in so far as it is not nearly as general as the programme undertaken by the tobacco manufacturers on the radio, television and in the newspapers?  In view of this propaganda, the Minister's programme has become largely ineffective.  He has a responsiblity to the public to tell them in a more effective way that the smoking of cigarettes is a great danger as a precursor to cancer and to warn them against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the cost of a choice of doctor in the General Medical Service, at present provided by district medical officers.  The amount of the extra annual cost of providing for a choice of doctor in this service would depend on assumptions as to how the scheme with choice of doctor would be arranged.  On one such assumption, viz. that the new scheme would be organised on a panel basis, an estimate has been made by my Department for the purpose of the work of the Select Committee on the Health Services.  The estimate thus calculated would indicate that, on this assumption, the extra cost (including provision for the supply of drugs, medicines and appliances) would be of the order of £1 million a year, or perhaps as high as £1.6 million a year for a somewhat different scheme.  The cost in the early years of such a scheme could be expected to be further augmented by reason of special superannuation liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a scheme with choice of doctor were to be organised by payment of doctors on a fee-per-item-of-service basis, experience abroad would indicate that the extra cost would be considerably <Col N="1280" /> higher.  No estimate of the cost of such a service for the lower income group in this country has been made.</P>

      <P>As the answer includes a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the answer:</P>
      <P>Exact figures of receipts of duty are available in respect of imported cigarettes but the receipts from home-made cigarettes must be given on an estimated basis.  The bulk of the tobacco revenue is derived from the duty on the imported leaf and it is not possible to apportion this revenue accurately as between leaf for cigarette-making and leaf for use in the manufacture of other tobacco products.  The estimated figures given in the following table are based on the proportion of total home production of tobacco products represented by the output of home-made cigarettes.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company that the publicity campaign to which the question refers was designed to provide information to persons interested in the employment prospects at the Industrial Estate. Approximately 500 vacancies existed or were expected to arise during 1963. During the month of January, 96 additional persons&mdash;16 males and 80 females&mdash;obtained employment in the Estate but I could not say to what extent these persons were employed as a result of the advertisement.  The opportunities for male employment in <Col N="1287" /> the Estate are expected to increase progressively during the year.  At 31st January a total of 766 males and 680 females were employed.</P>
      <P>About 500 persons called to the information centres during the campaign and the applications have been classified and passed to the factory managements. The specific information sought by the Deputy in regard to the kinds of vacancies and wage rates relates to the private affairs of the individual firms and it is not the practice to disclose such information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Norton</b> asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether, in view of the fact that the present time limit of July 1963, fixed by the Transport Act, 1958 for the compensation provisions for redundant CIE workers, was so fixed in the anticipation that CIE would be financially solvent by that date, and in view of the likelihood that CIE will not have achieved solvency by that date and that further redundancy may occur, he will now take steps to have these compensation provisions extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions in the Transport Act, 1958 were designed to facilitate the reorganisation of the CIE undertaking over a five year period.  As it is expected that further redundancy may arise out of such reorganisation in the period between the 15th July, 1963 (on which date the provisions for redundancy compensation expire) and 31st March, 1964 the extension of the compensation provisions until the latter date is under consideration.</P>
      <P>The position after 31st March, 1964 will fall to be considered later in connection with comprehensive transport legislation to replace the Transport Act, 1958.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, <Col N="1295" /> to take Questions Nos. 38, 39 and 40 together.  I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I made on 7th instant to previous questions on this subject. The proposals for the establishment of the industry are at a preliminary stage only.  The detailed proposals which the Industrial Development Authority are at present awaiting will cover all aspects of the matter, including those to which the Deputy has referred.  In the event of an application for a grant being made by the promoters to An Foras Tionscal, the Board of An Foras Tionscal must be satisfied before making a grant that financial assistance is necessary for the establishment of the industry.  The Board would take into account also all other relevant considerations.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to previous Parliamentary Questions on this subject, the industry, if established, will be exclusively engaged in the export trade.  It is the practice of An Foras Tionscal to make it a condition in appropriate cases that industries which receive grants carry on an export trade only and it would be possible for An Foras Tionscal to impose a similar condition in the particular case in question in the event of an application for a grant being made to and approved by the Board.</P>

I should add that imports of these commodities are only marginal, amounting to six per cent. of home production in the case of underwear, and four per cent. of home production in the case of socks.

      <P>The existing rates of contributions, namely, 5 per cent. for officers and 4.1/6 per cent. for servants, are considered reasonable in view of the benefits provided and the cost of these benefits to local authorities. In lieu of lump sum payments the pensions of servants are calculated on a higher basis than those of officers. In view of the differences in conditions of service between officers and servants and the existing concessions to servants in regard to reckoning discontinuous periods of employment for pension purposes etc., the adding of years in lieu of service lost through illness is not considered appropriate. In the circumstances it is not proposed to review the Local Government Superannuation Acts as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that No Parking signs have been erected outside the church on the south side of Terenure Road East, Dublin; and if he will examine the possibility of permitting parking to allow persons attending weddings, funerals and other such church functions to use the main entrance to the church, to facilitate parents collecting their children from the national school which is situated beside the church, and to facilitate traders in the immediate vicinity.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Parking Bye-laws, 1962, which will come into operation shortly, will not materially <Col N="1301" /> alter the parking restrictions applying to this road.  While there are restrictions, unlimited as to time, on short sections of the road adjoining the traffic lights and the road junctions, and at the bus stop, parking will be permitted on the remainder of the south side of the road where the church and school are situated but on week days it will be limited to one hour between the hours of 8.30 a.m. and 6.30 p.m.  The bye-laws will not prohibit the stopping of vehicles to take up or set down passengers or to load or unload goods, except within 30 feet of the road junctions.  I understand that &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo; signs were put in error on the signposts outside the church and that the matter has now been rectified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state in relation to the proposed new parking bye-laws (1) whether, when parking is permitted on one side only, all cars must face in the direction of the traffic; (2) whether cars for sale, at present parked on the roadway during the day, will have to be parked elsewhere; (3) whether existing mobile shops approved by the Dublin Corporation will have to be moved, and, if so, whether there is any provision for compensation; and (4) whether a car which has broken down cannot be pushed into the kerb in order to allow a mechanic to put it in working order; and, if not, what the driver should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the question relates to the Dublin Parking Bye-laws, 1962.  As regards (1) the bye-laws provide that, during lighting-up <Col N="1302" /> hours, a mechanically propelled vehicle parked parallel to the kerb must face in the direction in which traffic on the side of the street on which the vehicle is parked is required to proceed.  Regarding (2), the bye-laws provide that, in a parking place specified as such in the bye-laws, a vehicle shall not be offered or displayed for sale.  The bye-laws do not apply such a prohibition outside parking places, but of course the general law prohibiting obstruction applies. As regards (3), the bye-laws make no change in the existing provisions relating to mobile shops.  With regard to (4), the bye-laws permit repairs to be carried out to a parked vehicle where it has been damaged or suffered a breakdown and it is necessary to carry out the repairs in order to remove the vehicle from the public road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Parking Bye-laws, 1962, will come into operation when the prescribed public notice under Section 6 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, is given by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  This notice will be given as soon as the Dublin Corporation and the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire have completed the erection of the necessary traffic signs.

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe wishes to make a personal explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last during my absence from the Dáil, as reported in column 1174 of the Dáil Debates, No. 9, Vol. 199, Deputy McQuillan, intervening on the Industrial Grants Bill, made an attack on me and the industry in which I have a personal interest.  I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to make a personal statement.</P>
      <P>The allegations made by Deputy McQuillan were that the firm (1) was employing over 300 people and that it had now reduced its number of employees by 35/40 per cent.  within the last three months; (2)  was promised a grant of £50,000 for re-adaptation; (3)  within the past fortnight had begun to lay off a number of their workers and within the next six months would be laying them off at the rate of five or ten a week and so get rid of the workers as quietly as possible over the longest possible period; and (4) that it had industrial manufacturing centres in a number of big cities and had decided to come to Ireland because labour in Ireland was so cheap and so plentiful and that it was now reducing the number of workers, at the same time getting a State grant.</P>
      <P>I wish to state the facts.  The factory concerned provided employment for more people, at a higher rate of intake, than was envisaged when it was set up. In recent months, due to the seasonal drop in demand for its products, together with the necessity of the installation of new machinery a temporary lay-off of a number of the workers was unavoidable.  A further difficulty, quite unforeseen, arose due to a new Agreement between the Irish and British Sugar Boards with regard to prices of sugar for sale in Britain and the most unprecedented rise in world sugar prices.  At no time has it been contemplated that the lay-off of staff would be permanent and, as discussed between the company and the union involved, it is hoped to have gradual re-employment of the affected workers until we again will have our maximum number of 200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> The factory is not seeking any grant for re-adaptation, as alleged.  A grant in connection with a new extension has been negotiated.</P>
    <P>The parent Company of this undertaking is in the USA and outside of Ireland has no other factory and came to Ireland as a result of my personal endeavours.</P>
    <P>The allegations made by Deputy McQuillan, which reflected on me personally, are therefore without foundation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Order of Business, may I suggest to <Col N="1323" /> the Taoiseach that, in the ordinary course of events, it is unreasonable to order a Bill sooner than ten days after it is circulated.  In the ordinary course of events, when a Bill is received by the Opposition, they want an opportunity to read it, first of all, and they then want an opportunity to consider its provisions when they meet again during the following week to deal with the Bill.  The circulation of the Coast Protection Bill, and its being ordered for today, does not allow of that normal period to elapse.  So far as this particular Bill is concerned, it does not actually inconvenience us in the slightest because the Bill is merely a rehash of something introduced here seven years ago and forgotten by the Government ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal way, notwithstanding the Deputy's derogatory remark, I would be anxious to meet him and accommodate him in this matter, but it will be appreciated that there is a desire now to bring forward legislation fairly rapidly because we will be moving into Financial Business in the course of a few weeks.  For example, the Electoral Bill, which is a very large Bill, will be available to Deputies tomorrow and I am hoping we will have a Second Reading of that Bill next week because it is primarily a Committee Stage Bill, based on the agreed recommendations of the Joint Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are now suffering from the fact that they did not get the work done in the period in which it should have been done&mdash;before the Christmas Recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure the Taoiseach will agree with me that it is unreasonable to send out to Deputies a Bill on Friday morning and, without any consultation or discussion with the members of the different Parties, to ask us to come in here on the following Tuesday or Wednesday and consider those Bills.  That is to reduce our procedure to a farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, a great deal depends on the character of the Bills which come along.  Many of the <Col N="1324" /> Bills coming along now are not likely to be contested in principle.  If a Bill were likely to be controversial on Second Reading, then the opportunity for full consideration of it would be given to Deputies between the time of its introduction and its Second Reading.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment to paragraph (c) of Section 1 is to remedy the existing position.  The wording &ldquo;belonging to the State&rdquo; may not cover certain properties and in order that the Board of Governors may not be precluded from granting loans of works of art for display in properties such as St. Stephen's Green which are held in trust for the public but which may not be legally regarded as belonging to the State, this amendment is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the original intention when the Municipal Gallery was established, and certainly the intention of Sir Hugh Lane, was that the Gallery was to be regarded as a gallery of modern art. By any standards, this is a small country and the present National Gallery has available a great many pictures which have never been exhibited, while, at the same time, having on display some modern paintings.  I wonder whether the Minister, in conjunction with the authorities of the National Gallery, would co-operate with the Municipal Art Gallery to arrange a system under which modern pictures would be shown in one Gallery and then a reasonable time allowed during which these pictures would be hung.  A regular period of alternation between one group of pictures and another would enable the many pictures that have <Col N="1326" /> never been displayed in the National Gallery to be displayed.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the announcement the Minister made recently that an up-to-date and complete catalogue of the pictures in the National Gallery is being compiled and will shortly be published could enable a rotation of pictures to take place on a reasonable basis.  I would suggest that arrangements should be made so that exhibitions of modern art would be confined to the Municipal Gallery and that a regular rotation over reasonable periods would exist in the National Gallery so that the very large collection of pictures would be shown at regular periods, so enabling the people to see pictures that have not been displayed for a considerable time.  The proposal in the Bill will undoubtedly enable pictures to be displayed elsewhere than in the National Gallery. That might be considered, but one of the drawbacks is that a great many pictures there remain in the same position from one year to another.  I am suggesting that there should be periods of rotation which would ensure regular displays of all the pictures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill and of any Bill dealing with works of art and their display should be to have them displayed for the people generally and for that reason I cannot understand the reason for paragraph (a)  of this section which provides for the lending of works of art for display in the official residence of the President.  That is a place very infrequently visited by members of the public of this State.  In fact, it is very infrequently visited by members of either House of the Oireachtas for the simple reason that they are never invited.  I do not think that is one of the places where these works should be exhibited.  Some visitors from abroad, unless they are very distinguished visitors and unless they are invited to the residence, will never have an opportunity of seeing works of art on display there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in full agreement with paragraph (c) which provides for the display of works of art in other premises or property of the State in Ireland or <Col N="1327" /> abroad and in that connection I suggest that advantage be taken of the spacious rooms of the RDS for exhibitions of our works of art.  It is a place very frequently visited by our people and also by visitors from abroad who would probably have little or no access to any other institutions or places of a semi-public nature. During the Spring Show and the Horse Show, if space could be made available in the RDS premises for exhibitions of these works of art, we would do a considerable lot to publicise them.</P>
    <P>I certainly cannot see why they should be exhibited in the official residence of the President of Ireland. I do not want to object to the decorating of the President's residence but we vote considerable sums of money, upwards of £50,000 annually, for that purpose.  If we are to bury some of our works of art there, they will be on view only to a very small number of official visitors to the President.  Of course, some of the undesirables, such as the Maximoes, may get to see them, but only a very small minority of visitors to this country will get an opportunity.  The President's residence is not an ideal place to exhibit our works of art.  I think the Minister, under subsection (7) should make some arrangement with the RDS to put on display there bi-annually pictures which have too long been buried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with either of my colleagues in this matter. I think some of these pictures should be hung in Áras an Uachtaráin.  I am not sure if it would be wise to devote the National Gallery altogether to a display of the classic works of art and to take away from it the modern works.  If we do that, we will run into trouble.  The accepted definition of modern works of art would be the works of the impressionists from the middle of the 19th century onwards. It would make the National Gallery much less interesting to visitors if the Renoirs and other such works were removed from it.  That would detract from the generality of representation there and would be undesirable.  If the two Renoirs were removed from the National Gallery, it would not <Col N="1328" /> encourage me to go there as often as I do.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister has given any consideration to the points I raised during the Second Reading debate.  Under this Bill, the Gallery authorities will not accept responsibility for the insurance of pictures when sent to other centres for exhibition. If that insurance bears any relation to the value of the pictures, it would be impossible for any local group to shoulder the burden.  Sometimes I wonder if it is wise to continue showing these pictures at all.</P>
      <P>I should also like to make the point that the recent windfall received by the Gallery has saved the Government what could be quite considerable expenditure in the future.  A rearrangement of the Gallery and of the rooms might involve the country in considerable expense and that will be saved by the Shaw Bequest.  The Government might also consider assisting the smaller galleries in the country to make occasional purchases so that they would have a small stock of pictures of their own.  I have in mind some thousands of pounds for each such gallery.  That would cover Limerick, Galway, Waterford and other such cities.</P>

      <P>This is an <i>ad hoc</i> Bill to deal with the need for powers for the lending of pictures which the Board have not got at present.  The wider question of dealing with the arts <Col N="1329" /> generally is being considered by an inter-departmental Committee, as has already been announced by the Taoiseach. All these questions are being considered by the committee and will be considered by the Government in due time.  This Bill gives power to the Governors of the National Gallery to lend pictures.  They have a large number of works of art there and I do not agree that some of these should not be lent to the official residence of the President.  I think they should be there and in other places such as those of important representation abroad. Subsection (e) gives fairly wide powers to the Governors and the Guardians to lend to other places not specifically named in the Bill.  There were a number of points raised by Deputies concerning particular interests of their own which are not covered in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Since 1931, there has been no general investigation of the extent to which our coasts are being damaged by erosion.  In that year an interdepartmental committee reported to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that there was no conclusive evidence of any really grave erosive action and that much of the erosion was of little practical importance; there were, however, six cases in which erosion was taking place with so much damage or danger to property as to assume what may be termed public importance.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the Commissioners of Public Works have received complaints regarding erosion at many points on the coast.  As the Commissioners are not generally empowered to deal with coast protection, few of these cases have been investigated and it is not possible to say if all the complaints refer to true cases of coast erosion and, if they do, whether protection work is merited.  Some of the complaints may relate to storm damage which is a separate problem. Some of them may cover genuine cases of erosion but the cost of protection works may be disproportionate to the value of the property endangered.  The fact that the complaints have been made is not an indication that there has been any worsening of the position since 1931.  It is probably true to say that the conclusions reached by the committee more than 30 years ago still hold good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were three cases in which it was known that the danger to valuable property was imminent and State assistance was made available for protection <Col N="1331" /> works&mdash;at Bray sea wall, Wicklow town and Rosslare.  In each case it was possible to put the work in hands without administrative difficulty.  The work was sited on the foreshore and any difficulties of access or interference with privately-owned property were readily overcome.</P>
    <P>Rosslare Strand, County Wexford was the most important.  As is well known, erosion there has been a serious problem for many years.  In 1937, an English expert made an investigation and recommended that groynes and extensive retaining walls, etc.  should be erected at a cost then estimated at £340,000, the equivalent of about £1,000,000 at present; but in face of this estimate, no action was taken. However, the Wexford County Council continued to press for Exchequer aid, and in 1957, the Government decided that a programme consisting of a survey and some experimental and direct protection works should be proceeded with.  The works were then commenced by the Commissioners of Public Works, they are still continuing, and will probably be completed in 1964.  Proceeding from the experimental stage a system of groynes and protection works has been evolved which it is hoped with proper maintenance will give reasonable long-term protection. The Wexford County Council have made a substantial contribution to the cost which will be about £120,000.</P>
    <P>The need for some statutory machinery to deal with coast erosion has been recognised by Deputies in all parts of the House.  In 1956, a Bill was introduced by our predecessors and was being discussed in Committee when the Dáil was dissolved and the Bill lapsed. This Bill is on the same general lines. There are, however, some important differences.  Under the earlier Bill, it was envisaged that the Commissioners of Public Works would carry out only the more difficult schemes leaving the smaller ones to the local authorities but now it is proposed that all the construction works as well as all the maintenance work will be done by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The major change is in regard to the financial arrangements.  In the 1956 <Col N="1332" /> Bill, State grants for coast protection works were limited to half the cost. Under this Bill, State grants up to 80 per cent. of the cost may be made.  In the 1956 Bill, county councils were required to pay the full amount of the costs and expenses incurred by the Commissioners of Public Works on schemes which did not proceed.  Under this Bill, they will pay only half such costs.  These new provisions are generous and I hope they will make the Bill acceptable to all Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that where the council of a county or a county borough are satisfied that land within their area is being progressively damaged by the continuing encroachment of the sea, and that the encroachment is liable to endanger valuable property, the council may promote a coast protection scheme.  If the encroachment affects land in two or more counties, the councils are required to name one council as the authority to promote the scheme.  The council or councils shall cause a report on the encroachment to be prepared before a council as a promoting authority under the Bill requests a preliminary examination to be made by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The purpose of this provision is to arrange for a form of screening of applications before the Commissioners of Public Works are approached for assistance and to place the responsibility for initiating action towards a protection scheme on a local authority which would be expected to reject applications unworthy of serious consideration.  It would be quite impracticable for the Commissioners to deal initially with every request for a scheme from private individuals, commercial concerns and others.  If, following the preliminary examination, the Commissioners report that a coast protection scheme is feasible, they may at the further request of the promoting authority and subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance prepare a scheme.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;feasible&rdquo; used in the Bill is intended to mean practicable within economic limits of cost.  The scheme, which will show the percentage grant available, will be exhibited by the promoting authority.  They will <Col N="1333" /> notify any persons affected and consider any observations received and report to the Commissioners on the observations and any alterations which they propose should be made in the scheme.  On consideration of that report the Commissioners will submit the scheme to the Minister for Finance with their recommendation.  At any stage prior to the submission to the Minister the promoting authority will be at liberty to decide that the scheme should not go ahead and they would then be liable for half the cost incurred up to that stage.  The Minister may refuse to confirm a scheme, or may confirm it with or without alterations.  His confirmation of a scheme will empower the Commissioners to carry out the works.  The difference between the cost of a scheme and the State grant will be payable by the promoting authority subject to such contributions by other local authorities, harbour authorities or other beneficiaries as may be arranged.</P>
    <P>In the Bill, powers are provided for entry on lands, etc.; for compulsory acquisition or interference with lands or other rights; for payment of compensation; and for the holding of a public inquiry in relation to proposals for a scheme.</P>
    <P>Maintenance of completed works is so important that it is proposed to make it the responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Costs and expenses incurred by the Commissioners on maintenance will be refunded by the authority who promoted the scheme.</P>
    <P>Certain necessary provisions of a miscellaneous nature are made, e.g., to make bye-laws, to abandon protection works no longer capable of being maintained at reasonable cost and to employ contractors.</P>
    <P>So little is known of the extent of the coast protection work needed and so much is left to county councils by the Bill that it is not possible to give any estimate of the expenditure which will fall to be met from the Exchequer if the Bill is enacted.  In planning coast protection works, the aim of the Commissioners will be to <Col N="1334" /> secure reasonably effective protection at the lowest possible cost.</P>
    <P>Taking the Bill section by section, Section 1 does not need any comment.</P>
    <P>Section 2 enables a county council or the corporation of a county borough to investigate and to have a report prepared on any proposal for coast protection works.  If they are satisfied that land within their area is being progressively damaged by the continuing encroachment of the sea, as distinct from an occasional storm, and that valuable property is being threatened, they can promote a coast protection scheme and ask the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out a preliminary examination.  Where the encroachment affects land in two or more counties a single report will be prepared and one council will be named as the promoting authority. Necessary powers for entry on lands, etc., are provided for the purposes of the preparation of a report.  The consideration of a report and the making of a declaration shall be reserved functions.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that on receipt of a request from a promoting authority under Section 2, the Commissioners of Public Works may undertake a preliminary examination.  Before making this examination the Commissioners will, in addition, require an undertaking that the promoting authority will pay one half of the cost of the examination if a scheme is not executed later.  Powers of entry on lands, etc., are provided for the purpose of the preliminary examination. The intention of the preliminary examination is to avoid the expenditure of time and money on unnecessary detailed investigations by eliminating at an early stage cases which would have no prospect of being dealt with at a reasonable cost or are not in fact true cases of coast erosion.</P>

      <P>Under Section 4 the Commissioners after the preliminary examination may determine that the circumstances are such that a coast protection scheme is not warranted or <Col N="1335" /> the circumstances are such that a scheme is feasible in all respects. In each case they will report their determination to the promoting authority.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides that where the Commissioners report that a scheme is feasible the promoting authority shall make a declaration that a scheme is not to be proceeded with or that the Commissioners should be asked to prepare and execute a coast protection scheme.  In the latter case, the promoting authority will undertake to pay the appropriate contribution towards the capital cost of a scheme that is executed, and the entire costs of maintenance or abandonment of a completed scheme.  If a scheme does not proceed, they will be liable for half the costs of preparation.  The consideration of a report and the making of a declaration shall be a reserved function.</P>
      <P>Section 6 provides that where the promoting authority resolves that the Commissioners should be asked to prepare and execute a coast protection scheme the Commissioners may, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance and to any conditions stipulated by him, prepare a scheme and shall send a copy of it to the promoting authority and to any other council who named the promoting authority.  Powers of entry on lands, etc. are provided for the purposes of the preparation of a scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 7 outlines the matters to be shown in a coast protection scheme prepared by the Commissioners including the estimated cost and the percentage thereof&mdash;not exceeding 80&mdash; which the Minister for Finance is prepared to contribute.</P>
      <P>Section 8 lays down the procedure to be followed by the promoting authority on receipt of a coast protection scheme sent to them by the Commissioners. In the first place, the authority shall declare whether or not the scheme is to be proceeded with. Where the declaration is in favour of proceeding with the scheme, the promoting authority will give public notice and exhibit the scheme.  The making of a declaration under this section is to be a reserved function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> Section 9 requires the promoting authority to serve on every interested party a notice stating that a scheme has been prepared specifying where the scheme can be inspected and describing any proposed interference with his land, rights or other property. A person who receives a notice is allowed two months for sending his observations, if any, to the promoting authority.</P>
    <P>Under Section 10 the promoting authority will consider the observations received and submit a report to the Commissioners.  If the authority want the scheme altered, they will say so in the report.  The Commissioners will examine the report and determine what alterations, if any, are to be made.  They will give notice of their determination to the promoting authority, who will make a further declaration that the scheme is, or is not to be proceeded with.  If the promoting authority decide to go ahead with the scheme, the Commissioners will submit it to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister, after any necessary consultation with other Ministers, may make an order refusing to confirm the scheme or confirming it either with or without alterations. Copies of a confirmation order will be sent to the Commissioners and to the promoting authority who will notify all interested parties.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that a confirmation order will give the Commissioners of Public Works power to do all things necessary for the carrying out of a coast protection scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 12 covers interferences with public roads and bridges.  Where there are substantial advantages from new or improved roads or bridges, the local authorities shall contribute such part of the cost as the Minister for Local Government shall certify.</P>
    <P>Under Section 13 the Commissioners may acquire compulsorily lands, rights, etc. as shown in a coast protection scheme.  Compensation will be payable for land or rights acquired.  In default of agreement the amount of compensation will be fixed by arbitration.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for compensation for interferences with land, etc. other than interferences which have <Col N="1337" /> been the subject of a formal notice under the scheme.  Again in default of agreement compensation will be fixed by arbitration.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that in assessing compensation an arbitrator will take into account any benefit which a claimant will get from a coast protection scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 16 relates to the financing of schemes.  The Minister for Finance will contribute out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas the percentage of cost shown in the confirmed scheme. The balance will be contributed by the promoting authority.</P>
    <P>Section 17 enables the promoting authority to obtain contributions towards the amount payable by them from other local authorities, harbour authorities and owners or occupiers of protected lands.  The section empowers the promoting authority to enter into and carry out agreements in that regard.  Harbour authorities may borrow from the Local Loans Fund for the purposes of such contributions.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that where the Commissioners of Public Works are satisfied that a coast protection scheme has been completed the Minister for Finance will issue a certificate of completion.</P>
    <P>Section 19 covers the disposal of Trust Funds for the maintenance of existing embankments, which are rendered unnecessary by a completed coast protection scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for the maintenance of completed works by the Commissioners of Public Works.  Minor improvements will be regarded as maintenance.</P>
    <P>Section 21 prohibits interference with the works of any coast protection scheme or action hindering their efficient operation.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides powers for the making of bye-laws for the protection of completed works.</P>
    <P>Under Section 23 powers are taken for the abandonment of coast protection works which are no longer maintainable at a reasonable cost.  The <Col N="1338" /> Minister for Finance may direct the Commissioners to take steps to prevent abandoned works from becoming dangerous or a nuisance.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for any necessary apportionment of land annuities, etc. in respect of land acquired for a coast protection scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that debts due to a Government Department, for example, the Revenue Commissioners or the Irish Land Commission may be discharged out of compensation payable under this Bill.  This is a customary provision.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides that a promoting authority will pay to the Commissioners half the costs and expenses incurred in connection with a scheme which does not proceed, the full amount of the costs and expenses incurred on the maintenance of a completed scheme, and the full amount of the costs and expenses incurred on works which become necessary in the event of abandonment.  Provision is made for contributions by other local authorities and harbour authorities towards the amounts payable by promoting authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides that before making an Order refusing to confirm or confirming a coast protection scheme the Minister for Finance may cause a public inquiry to be held by a person appointed by him.  The section deals with the procedure and powers for the holding of such inquiries.</P>
    <P>Section 28 is the usual expenses section and Section 29 is the citation.</P>

      <P>We should be glad that this Bill has been introduced at last.  I have here a copy of the 1956 Bill, from which this Bill is taken, with a few amendments.  I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on its introduction.  His predecessor had the 1956 Bill in 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1960 and nothing was done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very interesting feature of this Bill is that the Commissioners will make inspections and the intention of the preliminary examination is &ldquo;to <Col N="1339" /> avoid the expenditure of time and money on unnecessary detailed investigation by eliminating at an early stage cases which would have no prospect of being dealt with at a reasonable cost or are not in fact cases of coast erosion&rdquo;.  I quote from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement.  That is a very important matter, especially in this country where people in various counties have no conscience about putting up dud schemes for which they could get a big subvention from the State and a small subvention from the county council.  The amount of money that can be given by the county council, according to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, is up to 80 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that is by the State&mdash;up to 80 per cent. by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>By the State, yes, under Section 7.  It does not say how a county council qualifies for the 80 per cent.  Is there any way in which a county council can qualify or is it confined to certain localities?  Is it a special &ldquo;Gaeltacht grant&rdquo;, as the saying is?  Would it be possible for an unfortunate constituency such as mine to qualify for the 80 per cent.?</P>
      <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary to be a man of his word.  He has been to me.  I would point out to him that schemes such as are envisaged in the Bill are a temptation to county councils and to county councillors on the basis that they will get so much money and will have to strike a certain rate. It is piling up the rates.  I want to put it on record that I was informed by the Minister for Local Government that the people of Waterford county paid the highest per capita rates in the country.  I have an idea that genuine schemes will be put up from the county of Waterford to the Parliamentary Secretary's office and I would ask him to contribute up to the 80 per cent. for those schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One such scheme would be in connection with Tramore where in 1912 the banks were broken down.  No real attempt was ever made by the State to reclaim that very valuable land on the <Col N="1340" /> Tramore foreshore.  A few half-hearted attempts were made.  I have heard it suggested that modern engineers considered it an impossibility to reclaim the land.  I am not an engineer but I would discount that suggestion.  At one time, the land was reclaimed by men who were equipped only with shovels and baskets and races were held there.  I am old enough to have been there.  There was a magnificent racecourse on portion of these lands. That land has been under water all that time.  I would submit that if a scheme is put up for the reclamation of that land, the Parliamentary Secretary should be merciful to the Waterford ratepayers, considering that they are paying the highest per capita rates in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They have the lowest valuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the highest valuations also.  We were revalued in 1926 when the Deputy's constituency was getting away with it.  We are reasonably generous in respect of health services as, I am sure, a Labour Deputy would like us to be.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has taken power of compulsory acquisition. That is important.  I should not like to see State money spent on the reclamation of land that is practically worthless.  I have been shown places outside my constituency as examples of coast erosion but, in my opinion, the land in question was worthless and useless for any purpose. The people who owned the land wanted the State to spend money on it and make it good for them.  Some of them were interested in the work being undertaken so as to provide employment for themselves, their horses and lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing to have this Bill under which it will be possible to protect good farm land from erosion.  The farmers concerned, some of whom own small portions and some of whom own large portions of land which is subject to encroachment of the sea, have managed to maintain banks and have farmed their acres well.  These lands <Col N="1341" /> are regarded as useful only for grazing but I have seen wonderful crops of corn and roots taken out of them.</P>
    <P>I remember the Parliamentary Secretary being under fire from members of his Party when he had banks repaired on the Shannon in the Foynes area.  The suggestion was made that that was done because it was his constitutency that was involved.  I commend the Parliamentary Secretary for it.  The land which was reclaimed was good land and the expenditure of State money on reclaiming it was a good investment.  Members on all sides of the House would commend the Parliamentary Secretary for such action.</P>
    <P>I have often protested against the frightful waste of money involved in reclaiming enormous tracts of land which is of no practical use, 60 acres of which would not keep a cow. Millions of pounds have been spent on that kind of thing.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary has the right idea. When he went to build banks and to carry out drainage, he looked for places where the land was good.  The Dungarvan and Tramore areas are subject to inundation and I am sure schemes will be put up by the local authority.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which can be dealt with in greater detail on Committee Stage.  We are glad that it has been introduced and we wish the Parliamentary Secretary success with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy <Col N="1342" /> Lynch in welcoming this Bill, which is a big improvement on the previous Bill, so far as the contributions to be paid by the State are concerned. However, I do not think we have gone far enough, particularly in regard to the urban areas.  Anyone who knows the east coast will have to agree that since 1931 the sea has made terrific inroads into it, and not all of that was within the urban areas.  My seaside resort is in County Wexford, close to where Deputy Esmonde lives.  I am sure he will agree with me when I say that within the past 25 years, the sea has encroached from 50 to 100 yards in that area.  The same applies all along the east coast.  While no property as such is being affected, the sea is taking over from the land.</P>
      <P>The big problem we have in Wicklow is in the urban areas, particularly Bray and Wicklow town.  Very substantial grants have been made available to both these local authorities in the past.  Quite recently, there was a grant of £14,000 to Wicklow town with a local contribution of 20 per cent. Nevertheless, the Government might consider the urban areas as a separate problem.  Asking an urban area to contribute 20 per cent. is perhaps asking a bit too much.  In a place such as Wicklow, where a penny is worth about £40, you cannot expect the local authority to put up £3,000 or £5,000 as a local contribution, thus imposing a heavy burden on the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>This problem is likely to continue in Wicklow for many years and it must be faced up to.  The ratepayers are not in a position to meet such a burden. Even though the Government have given a bigger grant than previously&mdash; this year, it is 80 per cent. as against 75 per cent.&mdash;the demands on a small urban authority such as Wicklow are great.  The same is true to a lesser extent in regard to Bray.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at the matter to see if it is not possible for him to come to the assistance of the small urban authorities in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area between Wicklow and Bray has been protected in recent years because of the fact that the <Col N="1343" /> railway runs along the coast there. It has cost CIE a considerable sum to maintain.  Every year, the railway is affected, particularly during storms. This year for weeks on end, the railway was washed away night after night.  I have no doubt that, but for the railway, Greystones and other areas would have been affected by coast erosion.</P>
    <P>The State is contributing 80 per cent. of the estimated cost of any scheme designed by the Commissioners of Public Works.  It is quite possible, however, that because of the time-lag and increases in costs of materials, wages and so on, the final figure may be far higher than that originally estimated.  I should like to know whether the 80 per cent. will be based on the final figure rather than the estimated cost.  If it is not based on the final figure, then I should like to know who will be expected to pay the difference.  This can happen. During the course of construction, you may have further damage caused to the work and in that way you may considerably increase the cost above the original estimate.  I do not think a local authority should be asked to carry that burden.  The burden of 20 per cent. will be sufficiently heavy.</P>
    <P>Again, I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary.  He deserves the congratulations of the House on bringing forward this Bill, particularly in view of the fact that it is a big improvement on the Bill introduced in 1956.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I wish to congratulate the Government on, shall I say, the reintroduction of this Bill.  From my brief look at it, it appears there is very little difference between it and the Bill introduced in 1956, except the substantial difference in the cost.  The Government are putting up an extra 20 per cent. which can be a very substantial amount of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected.  I hope <Col N="1344" /> the Bill will result in having work carried out in areas where, because of the lack of finance, such schemes tended to die out very quickly.</P>
      <P>The procedure for preparing to do the work seems to be very cumbersome. It would appear that the matter has to go backwards and forwards between the county council, the Board of Works and the local authority before finally coming to the Minister for Local Government.  That could mean that a very long period might elapse before the work was done.  I do not think we want a Bill such as that because it will be merely promising something which will be offered to the people <i>manana.</i> We have had too much of that in the past.</P>
      <P>I notice a couple of changes in this Bill as compared with that of 1956. Section 20 of the Bill is being substituted for Section 24 of the earlier Bill.  According to the Minister's speech, this section provides that the maintenance to be carried out is to be the responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Under the other Bill, it was the responsibility of the county council.  I do not think the new suggestion is the best one. It would be much better if local authorities were left to see after their work rather than have it carried out by the Board of Works who will bill the local authority with the cost.</P>
      <P>We have had examples of that where arterial drainage is concerned. While everybody clamours for arterial drainage to be carried out, people complain because the cost of maintenance has to be borne by the local authority and because the Office of Public Works is entitled to say what it will cost.  Provision must be made in the rates, irrespective of whether the money will be spent and irrespective of whether it is the correct amount.  I suggest the section be amended by reverting to the original arrangement whereby the local authority carried out the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 enables the promoting authority to levy a contribution on the owners and occupiers of protected lands.  Two problems arise here.  One is the problem of the contrary fellow. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1345" /> has had a good deal of experience in that regard in connection with rural improvement schemes.  This contrary fellow is the man who knows the job should be done and yet, because the work will benefit his neighbour, objects to its being carried out, the more so if he has to pay something towards the work himself; he may be asked to pay if his lands are going to be improved.  We know there are people who do not care whether or not the land is improved; they are only too anxious to be awkward and to hold up the work.</P>
    <P>The second problem is connected with people who have land along the coast; they may be asked to pay while those further inland, who may benefit more, may go free.  Sometimes the tide comes inland for a considerable distance up a river and, in doing so, may flood land further inland.  The person living nearer the sea would have to pay, while the man living inland would not have to pay at all.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will have to have another look at this to ensure that everything will be done properly when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>There is a reference to a public inquiry.  I am not quite clear what is intended.  The section provides that, before making an order or confirming a scheme, the Minister for Finance may cause a public inquiry to be held. Does that mean that, if somebody objects, the whole matter can be held up pending an inquiry, despite any evidence produced to the Minister prior to the making of the Order? Someone out of cussedness may decide to delay the scheme.  What exactly is the intention in Section 27?</P>
    <P>In Meath, we have approximately seven miles of coastline and we have been losing land to the sea for a very long time.  I have no idea how much land has disappeared over the centuries, but I do know that in the last 20 years the coast between Delvin Bridge and the Boyne at Mornington has suffered pretty severely.  South of the River Nanny at Laytown a privately-owned house is threatened by every high tide.  The owner has <Col N="1346" /> done everything possible to combat the situation, without any assistance from any outside body.  He has put up railway sleepers, concrete posts and barrels of sand.  He has succeeded in holding on to his home.  His people have lived in this house for generations. According to the Griffith Valuation, his great-grandfather lived there in 1857; only the Lord knows how long his family occupied the house before 1857.  Provision should be made for cases such as his.  The onus should be on the local authority to do the work.  It may be suggested that he should move elsewhere.  The fact is he has no land.  He has no property except the house he lives in and a little bit along the sea.  Every assistance should be given to people like him to enable them to hold on to their homes.</P>
    <P>It is only a matter of time before the Laytown water scheme is affected by erosion.  This Bill cannot be put into operation too quickly to deal with the two problems I mention.  From Laytown to Bettystown the sea is breaking down the walls erected by the local authority.  Money spent on the things I have suggested would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>The possibility is that a big number of schemes will be presented when this Bill becomes law.  The Minister for Local Government said here today that, because some engineer is sick, all his schemes are held up until he recovers. Adequate technical staff must be supplied to enable works to be carried out as quickly as possible. Finance may cause another headache. It will have a big bearing.  There is the possibility that the Department will be inundated with applications from interested local authorities and the result might well be that the excuse would be made of a temporary shortage of money.  Adequate financial provision must be made to ensure no worthwhile scheme is held up.  The fact that local authorities will be doing the work will mean pressure from a large number of applicants.  Adequate staff and adequate provision will be the answer to that.</P>
    <P>Whether or not something further <Col N="1347" /> than the protection of existing fore-shores is envisaged, I do not know, but if the people responsible for it would have a look at the way problems are tackled in Holland, they would see that the people there have the right idea.  There they are interested not alone in protection from the sea but in the reclamation of land on which crops can be grown within a year or so and on which towns and cities can be built in an area below sea level.  Of course, we have not got the same situation here but I cannot see any reason why land now covered during high tide should not be protected and made available for cropping, grazing and for building and other industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Brennan about the cost of such projects is a very important one.  Definite arrangements should be made to ensure that at the end of any job, somebody in the Parliamentary Secretary's Office will not come across with the story that although the estimate at the start was so much, the local authority must bear a very heavy cost because of extra expenditure on material and labour in the interval.  The re-wording of the particular section might remedy that problem which certainly deserves careful consideration.  We welcome the Bill and hope the Parliamentary Secretary will get it through and have it in operation very quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Representing a maritime constituency, I naturally welcome this Bill.  The only thing about it is that one cannot help asking why the previous Bill, introduced in 1956, could not have been continued by the Government instead of waiting for seven years to introduce a further Bill.  Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary is not responsible for that, since he was not in office throughout that period, but I feel he will accept the assertion that the question of erosion is something that is troubling many constituencies.  I must confess I am somewhat disappointed because I thought we would have something more revolutionary in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is probably the result of <Col N="1348" /> Deputies, both in Opposition and on the Government side, from time to time tabling questions on particular difficulties in their constituencies and it must have been quite obvious to the Government and to others concerned in the introduction of the Bill that there are cases of emergency in this country.  I cannot see anything in the Bill that will deal with an emergency, if it suddenly arises.  In case the Parliamentary Secretary doubts what I am saying, I would draw his attention to the portion of his opening speech in which he refers to three places&mdash;Rosslare Strand, where there is serious erosion and has been over the years, Wicklow and Bray.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another place in my constituency which is in a state of complete emergency at the moment, so much so that it was the subject of an article in an Irish newspaper, either the <i>Sunday Independent</i> or the <i>Evening Herald</i>, some time back, that is Cahore, a small village in Wexford which is very seriously threatened by the inroads of the sea.  So badly was it threatened that the bank protecting the road that runs along the coast was breached and had the sea gone two or three yards further, it would have gone over the road and into a huge catchment area beyond it, destroying a large drainage scheme being carried out by the county council.  I fail to see what earthly use a Bill of this type is in an emergency such as that.  Such cases may not arise in all areas, but emergencies do arise and this Bill makes no attempt to provide for them. I therefore suggest that during the consideration of this Bill the Parliamentary Secretary should introduce a section under which it would be possible to deal with emergencies caused by erosion.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of what the Parliamentary Secretary considers will be the estimated delays in the implementation of schemes. The procedure laid down for the administering of this Bill is admittedly very much the same as that in the previous Bill.  First of all, application is made by the local authority and that application must be transmitted to the Commissioners of Public Works.  That in itself is a good thing because while <Col N="1349" /> it places responsibility on the local authorities concerned to do something, it also imposes responsibility on the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The local authority submit their bill to the Commissioners of Public Works but does the Parliamentary Secretary consider he has adequate staff in his Office to deal with the many applications that will pour in?  People have been been waiting since 1921&mdash;indeed many have been waiting for legislation of this type since the British days &mdash;for legislation to deal with erosion of which there must be many cases in many parts of the country with which the Board of Works may not be conversant.  All these applications will pour in on the Parliamentary Secretary's Department, and I must say I have the deepest sympathy for the Board of Works.  They appear to have inadequate technical staff, engineering staff, maritime staff, to deal with the many problems they will find themselves faced with.  Applications from probably every maritime area in Ireland will pour in for benefits under this Bill and my main worry is that the Parliamentary Secretary may not have adequate staff to deal with them. Will he have staff with the particular skills necessary to send out to examine all these schemes?</P>
    <P>It is quite safe to assume that there will be at least a dozen applications in the very near future.  That is a very conservative estimate.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary got a dozen different experts whom he can send out to deal with the problems as they come in, or will it be a question of one application being dealt with at a time and the others being compelled to wait?  If such is the case in so far as Cahore is concerned, the people there stand in grave danger of losing that huge catchment area to the sea.  If that happens, they will lose thousands of pounds' worth of land and property.</P>
    <P>It is easy to introduce legislation: this Government are particularly good in this Dáil and in the previous Dáil at introducing legislation wholesale.  You can always introduce legislation but you must be absolutely certain you can implement it.  I should very much like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us if the necessary staff are available <Col N="1350" /> and if they possess the necessary experience to deal with the particular problems they will have to face.  I should also like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House if, in the drafting and framing of this Bill, he has taken expert advice from other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully cited the case of Holland.  However, the problems of Holland are somewhat different from those with which we are faced here. This Bill deals with coast protection and erosion.  Holland has a terribly difficult problem in that her dykes are being continuously breached and she has had to spend millions of pounds on them.  There the problems arise because portion of their land is below the sea.  As I have said, this Bill is designed for coast protection.  A country which has up-to-date knowledge of coast protection, having made a thorough study of it, and which has spent large sums of money and achieved considerable success is the United States of America. I wonder if the officials concerned and the advisers to the Parliamentary Secretary have sought advice from them so that in presenting this Bill, they would have some cut and dried plan to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that maintenance is to be a matter for the Board of Works, although Deputy Tully does not seem to agree with that.  It is not so much a matter of the cost but if the central Government are carrying out any particular scheme, if the Department of Finance is responsible for its maintenance, then they will ensure that the scheme will be as effective as possible so that its maintenance will cost as little as possible. If schemes are carried out by the Board of Works and if they are not responsible for their maintenance, there is the possibility that they may not ensure that the conditions which existed before the scheme was carried out will not recur.  For that reason, I think it is better that the central Government should be responsible for the maintenance of all these schemes. Then they will ensure that they are effective, durable and lasting.</P>
    <P>It is the drifting sands that are responsible <Col N="1351" /> for all this erosion and for that reason, I would suggest that the Board of Works should consult with the Department of Lands to ensure that the requisite planting is done to make certain that there is no recurrance of erosion.  There are several types of long, hardy grasses which can be sown so as to bind the sands together in a network which would be much more effective than the putting down of large blocks of concrete.  In that regard, the closest and most up-to-date consultation should take place between the two Departments.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has any general plan in mind, he should tell the House what it is when he is replying.</P>

      <P>I fully accept what the Parliamentary Secretary says but some attempt must be made to see that these schemes are durable.  There is no use in doing a scheme, creating a lot of sand and having the whole lot washed away in the next gale.  We want to ensure that we will pass legislation which will be beneficial for future generations.</P>
      <P>There is another matter in the Bill which puzzles me.  It says that the promoting authority, which is the county council, promulgates the scheme and the Board of Works carries out the survey.  When the Commissioners of Public Works have done that, they may report back to the local authority.  In the event of their reporting that the scheme is feasible, the local authority may decide not to go on with it or may decide to go on with it, as the case may be.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify that position.  I do not see the point in the local authority asking the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out a survey, the Commissioners carrying out the survey and saying it is a feasible scheme and then its not being mandatory on the local authority to go ahead with the work.</P>

      <P>It is a let-out clause for the local authority.  It may be that the Commissioners of Public Works would report that the scheme was feasible and would cost £400,000.  The members of the local authority would calculate that their contribution, which would be 20 per cent., would be £80,000.  They might be quite appalled at that figure.  When they sent the scheme up for consideration, they wanted to know what the final situation would be and there might be many members of the authority who, when they knew the cost, would not be prepared to go further.</P>

We fell on it, partly because of the promises contained in the electoral addresses of my friends opposite, and the Bill was allowed to lapse.</P>

      <P>It is seven years since the former Government produced a coast protection Bill in this House and Fianna Fáil have done <Col N="1353" /> nothing about it since then.  I would not put the matter so forcibly, were it not that Deputy Corry interrupted me.  It is a hard fact that it is seven years since this Bill was first produced here and the Government have done nothing about it since.  Why had we to wait seven years?  I am not speaking as a member of the inter-Party Government; I was only an ordinary Deputy supporting that Government then.  I am speaking as a Wexford Deputy.  We waited seven years for a coast erosion Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With one proviso, if the Deputy will allow me.  The Deputy should be a little more generous. When he says that they waited seven years, he should bear in mind the very generous subventions from the Exchequer to his constituency in that period made by the present Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because representations were made to him by myself and other Deputies in the county that if he did not do something about Rosslare strand, it would be washed away.  One of the reasons for the introduction of the 1956 Bill was that I pressed for it here in the Dáil as a Wexford Deputy because Rosslare strand was in danger.  If Fianna Fáil feel they can make any capital out of the latest intervention of the Parliamentary Secretary, I hand it to them.</P>
      <P>Does this Bill cover the protection of railways also?  I think this was mentioned by Deputy Brennan of Wicklow but I have a particular interest in this question, as have the people I represent. In my part of the country in the recent storms, considerable damage was done to our railway.  In fact, it was washed away&mdash;which comes under the heading of erosion&mdash;along by the coast nearly every day over a period of a week or ten days and was hurriedly repaired.  It is quite obvious that a very dangerous situation exists in which the railway may be permanently and completely destroyed there.  The reconstruction is only a temporary job and a train may only go over it very slowly.  I should like to know if this Bill would cover that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the question of <Col N="1354" /> emergency.  If a situation disimproves, if the weather disimproves&mdash;that is hardly possible in the light of what we have had&mdash;and the gales continue as they are, there is emergency work to be done at present there.  Have we to wait and risk the railway being swept away, an important railway such as this which is vital not only to the people of this country but also to the tourist organisation?  Would the Minister embody in this Bill&mdash;with Deputy Corry's permission&mdash;a provision whereby immediate action can be taken to deal with such problems? Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would clarify the matter but I cannot see any of these schemes taking less than at least six months to get going. Knowing the inadequacy of the staff in the Board of Works and that they continually have a backlog of work, I want to say publicly that my sympathies are with them.  They have been given inadequate staff to deal with the many problems that confront them, particularly technical staff.  As the position is, we would expect all these schemes to take a prolonged period.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, I am glad to welcome the Bill although I have one or two reservations.  One of these is the escape clause for the local authority. Is the promotion of a scheme the function of the elected representatives or&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>I suppose whatever criticism is to be made of this Bill, we had it from Deputy Esmonde but I should like to put a few questions to whomsoever will follow him on that <Col N="1355" /> side.  The Bill of 1956 was being discussed on Committee Stage and surely it would have taken only another couple of weeks to have it put through. Why did the Government clear out of office without finishing the job?  What pressure was on them to leave?  They had been in office only a little over three years.  Why did they leave without finishing this most important job, according to Deputy Esmonde?  I should like somebody in Fine Gael to tell us about that.  I can assure Deputy Esmonde that it took nearly the seven years he speaks of to repair the financial damage done to this country by the three-and-half years of messing around of Deputy Esmonde's Government.</P>

      <P>It took the seven years to build the country up again to the position in which we are able to go ahead with the Coast Protection Bill. As I had to state last week, the inter-Party Government cleared out leaving the country in such a position that the local bodies could not get hundreds of thousands of pounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing why we had to wait seven years for the introduction of this Bill and I am giving the reasons.  I am endeavouring to answer Deputy Esmonde.  That was the position.  The unfortunate civil servants, and even Deputy Esmonde himself, were wondering, when the 30th of the month came, whether the cheques they got would be honoured. The Government cleared out at that stage with the Committee Stage of the Coast Erosion Bill before the House and they could not take time to finish it because there was no money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and anyone who had the experience I have had for the past few years of travelling today to the Board of Works, tomorrow to the Land Commission and the following day to the Department of Local Government and having them refusing responsibility for my worries and <Col N="1356" /> troubles, will realise that somebody had to fill the gap.  I am very glad the Parliamentary Secretary is filling the gap in this case.</P>
    <P>It is a very big problem.  This is more than a coast protection Bill. There is a very great problem in respect of embankments which the Land Commission are bound to maintain but for which you find when you inquire they have neither the necessary machinery nor the finance.  That was the condition of affairs in my constituency where land was purchased from a landlord and the sum of money set aside for the maintenance of embankments was such that if you offered the whole amount to one man for a week's work today, he would almost kick you out or at least he would go on strike.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Esmonde realises there is a difference also in this Bill. The financial part of the 1956 Bill set out that if a scheme was not proceeded with, the full cost had to be paid by the local authority.  In this Bill, that has gone down to 50 per cent.  That is one of the changes, and a rather welcome change from the point of view of the ratepayers.  Another change is that instead of stating that the State may contribute 50 per cent. to the scheme, in this Bill it is stated that the State may contribute 80 per cent.  I am sure if we amend the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and make it &ldquo;shall&rdquo; on Committee Stage, it will be a help to all.  I am glad Deputy Esmonde drew my attention to that point.  We will make it &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will.  I am sure he will. When I speak of coast protection, I visualise what has happened in my constituency from Ballymacoda to Youghal and around from Garryvoe to Ballycotton where unfortunate landholders are paying annuities on land that has been buried under the sea for 20 years.  Surely they are entitled to some protection even at this late stage. There is a beautiful strand in Garryvoe and attempts costing thousands of pounds have been made to protect it <Col N="1357" /> but all the work was wiped out in one storm.  The tide came in in Dunkettle and followed its old course right to Little Island and down to Glounthane. The total area of land covered by the tide was some 350 acres.  That land carried a poor law valuation of 35/- an acre.  The county council stepped in and relieved those people of rates on the flooded land and in doing so they dropped £1,800 in rates.  That money would go far to meet the 20 per cent. cost of this scheme.</P>
      <P>In the village of Glounthane, there are two national schools, the parish priest's house, a pub and about 25 houses.  If other people knew of the terror in that village this time 12 months ago when the people had to clear out in the middle of the night because of the tidal waves, they would realise the absolute necessity for some protection against that type of thing happening again.</P>
      <P>If we succeed in this scheme, we will save the 350 acres that are flooded periodically and we may also succeed in reclaiming from the sea some 800 acres.  In my opinion at any rate as a layman &mdash; although I did get some engineers to see it&mdash;the job will not cost a large amount of money because of the fact that the Land Commission have had to come down every couple of years to repair bridges and so on. There is one farmer in Little Island&mdash; he is the chairman of Macra na Feirme in the county&mdash;and the tide wiped out 45 acres of land on which he had spent £4,000 odd on reclamation and bringing the land up to a proper state of fertility in the previous three years.  That was wiped out in one night and the flood remained at his door for nearly eight months before the Land Commission were able to give some protection against the tide coming in again.  In those conditions, I certainly welcome anything that can be done in a Bill such as this.  There are some matters which could be dealt with by way of amendment here to make the Bill as perfect as possible before it leaves the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the urban areas, the Parliamentary Secretary had the advantage of seeing the condition of affairs there when he was in Youghal opening <Col N="1358" /> the bridge.  He could see the results of the erosion and tidal waves.  As a matter of fact, in one place the strand has gone and there is nothing left but the sods of turf which were there 300 or 400 years ago.  During the emergency, we might have chanced cutting and drying them to see if they would burn, but I do not think they would because of the salt.  However, the strand has gone and unless some protection is given immediately, the finest seaside resort in Cork county will be wiped out.  A few months ago, we had the job of endeavouring to keep the railway there so that the people could get down there from the city on Sundays.  Immediate steps must be taken to protect that strand. There is the advantage that the county council have already prepared a scheme and I am sure they will heartily welcome the 80 per cent. grant that will be given towards it. Those are the difficulties we have to surmount and those are the reasons why I heartily welcome the Bill.  I am sorry that we were not able to bring it in earlier but I have given the reasons as to why that was impossible. I have not got that poor opinion of the brains and skill turned out by our universities that Deputy Esmonde seems to have.  In my opinion, our universities turn out engineers whose abilities are greater than those of anybody you will get from Holland, America or anywhere else, to work out these schemes.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Garda Pensioners' Rent Allowances: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion in the names of members of the Fine Gael Party:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that members of the Garda Síochána who retired prior to 21st December 1960, should have the rent allowances which were paid to them treated as a pensionable emolument just as members serving since December 1960, enjoy that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was tempted last week to dovetatil this motion into the preceding Private Members' Motion which dealt with the <Col N="1359" /> Common Market.  The relevancy of that might not be readily apparent but I am nevertheless moved to succumb to the temptation once again, in this way: It is common case, I think, that one of the requirements in the Common Market is that all countries that are members shall adopt similar economic and social patterns, including a pattern of wages and of pension schemes.  While we do not wish to have this motion treated as part of an all-embracing pension scheme because of certain objections which the Minister for Finance might have, I should like to point out that in several of the member countries of the European Economic Community already pensions are tied to existing salaries and wages, instead of, as we have here, pensions being tied to what people earned while they were employed.  In several countries on the continent, pensions at any particular time are related entirely to the wages and salaries paid to people of a similar rank who are still serving.  I would list, for instance, that in France, Belgium, West Germany, Italy, Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Spain, retired pay goes up automatically, that is to say, pensions go up automatically, when current pay and salaries go up. That is in relation to what might be called the fighting services, but so far as even the Civil Service is concerned, in France, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and New Zealand, pensions automatically follow the same trend as wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>The relevancy of all that to our motion is that, since December, 1960, serving members of the Garda Síochána have had their rent allowance constituted as part of their pay and because of that any person who retired from the Garda Síochána since 21st December, 1960, has had a higher pension than anybody who retired prior to that date because the pension is based upon a percentage of pay and where the rent allowance is included as pay, then the pension is automatically increased.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance is here today to defend his refusal to accede to representations which have come to him on this matter from all <Col N="1360" /> quarters of the country, from all Parties in this House and from his colleague, the Minister for Justice, in particular, who is in the most embarrassing position of realising that it is unjust to refuse the claim and who is passing the buck and blaming the Minister for Finance entirely.  One wonders where the theory of collective responsibility comes in where you have one Minister blaming another, where you have one Minister accepting, and going on record as accepting, that an application is just but stating that it will not be granted because his colleague cannot see his way to do it. That is rather shabby, rather unfortunate and grossly unfair to the small number of persons involved.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that this has nothing to do with the general pattern of pension schemes, no matter what attempt the Minister for Finance may make to suggest that this must be considered together with pensions of all other grades and of all other branches of the public service.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with that. This is purely and simply a case of giving to members of the Garda Síochána who retired prior to a particular date the same rights as their colleagues enjoy who did not reach retiring age until after 21st December, 1960.</P>
    <P>Why should this be conceded and why should it not be conceded?  The one reason why it should not be conceded is a lengthy one and the only one that I know of that has yet been advanced by the Department of Finance is that you cannot touch one pension without having claims from pensioners in several other fields.  But, this claim is one related entirely to what members of the Garda Síochána had while they were members of the Force, that is, a rent allowance.  We all must live in houses; we all must have accommodation.  Nobody knows that better than the Gardaí.  If a Garda finds a person homeless, loitering in a public place, he will have him charged with an offence and brought before the courts and he will be given an abode at the expense of the State. Anybody who is earning a wage is receiving in that wage a certain percentage to provide him with the <Col N="1361" /> means of maintaining a roof over his head.</P>
    <P>For some years until 1960, in fact, throughout the whole history of the Force, Gardaí were in the peculiar position that they did not have one wage which included rent but received a basic wage and the rent was paid to them as though it were a separate thing.  That is why the Department of Finance for several years resisted the application of the Garda to have the rent made part of their complete wage structure.  As soon as the Garda were given a scheme of conciliation and arbitration, they renewed their application to have the rent allowance included in their wage and no sooner was the application made than it was granted.  If ever there was proof needed that there was justice in the case, it was surely provided when, on arbitration for the first time, it was given to them as soon as they applied for it.</P>
    <P>Another interesting thing is that throughout the history of the Force, the Revenue Commissioners who, after all, are one arm of the Department of Finance, have insisted that the rent allowance was part of the wage paid to members of the Garda Síochána and, in fact, this case was tried out in court. There is the case of Garda White against the Inspector of Taxes in 1948. Judge McCarthy, in his judgment on 30th July, 1948, dismissed Garda White's claim on the ground that rent allowance was part of his salary and emoluments.</P>
    <P>So, we have the very unfair situation in which the Department of Finance, in which the State, is insisting on the one hand that the rent allowance is part and parcel of the wages because the law so provides and making the Garda pay income tax in respect of that rent allowance and, on the other, when the men reach their retiring age, saying: &ldquo;No, it was not part of your wages; it was not part of your emoluments and we are not going to take it into consideration for your pension purposes, even though you have been paying income tax on it as part of your wages during your 30 or 40 years' membership of the Force.&rdquo;  I do not think there is any Deputy who would <Col N="1362" /> maintain for a moment that that is justice.</P>
    <P>Another interesting side aspect of the Garda Síochána pay and pensions scheme is this.  The Garda are the one branch of the public service who are compelled by law to contribute a certain percentage of their pay for their pensions.  Other branches of the public service receive pensions, although they contribute nothing towards them.  But, year in, year out, the Guards must pay two and half per cent., or 6d. in every £, towards their pension scheme.  Here you have a double injustice.  The one branch of the public service who make a definite contribution towards their pension scheme, and thereby save the State the cost of financing the pension scheme to that extent, is the one branch denied for pension purposes that section of income which we all get to meet the cost of housing ourselves and our families.</P>
    <P>A very appropriate question is: how much will this cost?  Some time ago, I gave a figure in this House which I have since been able to check and I find that I erred on the side of generosity. I said it would cost about £80,000 per annum.  Checking the matter more carefully, it seems in this year, were this to be acceded to, it would cost the State about £60,000.  Thereafter, year after year, that amount would reduce and not increase.  Any men now in the Force or who retired since December, 1960, will get the rent allowance included as a pensionable emolument in any event.  The State have accepted that and are paying that; but for the small and contracting band of men who retired prior to 1960 that emolument for pension purposes is denied.  But, in time, that number is going to reduce.  Nothing is more certain.  As we are born, so must we die.  These men, who have given of the best years of their lives to the State, will be reduced in numbers as the years pass.  Even if the State were to strain itself this year to give it, the State could give it, with the certain knowledge that, unlike most commitments the State undertake, it will not increase as the years go on but rather will it diminish.</P>
    <P>Those are the fundamentals which <Col N="1363" /> justify the 34 members of the Fine Gael Party in putting down this motion, but there are certain side aspects of it which this House is obliged to consider.  I have given the arguments, which simply ask for fair play and no more.  There are other reasons why the men who would benefit by the acceptance of this motion are deserving of special consideration. Most, if not all, of them are founder members of the Garda Síochána.  No matter what view one might have taken in the civil dispute here 30 or 40 years ago, it can now be accepted by all sides of the House that the setting up of the Garda Síochána as an unarmed force was one of the principal contributing factors in restoring peace to this land.</P>
    <P>The men who would benefit to the tune of about £35 a year if this motion is accepted are the men who, when times were difficult and dangerous, put on the blue uniform of the Garda Síochána, now respected and accepted by all sections of the people.  It is rather shabby of us to deny to them what we have accepted as being the bare minimum of justice for any men who were lucky enough still to be serving on 21st of December, 1960. Surely justice is not something which begins on one day and should not exist before that?</P>
    <P>On that account, I am asking the Minister very earnestly to consider this motion.  I know the Minister has been kind enough to receive a deputation from the Garda Síochána Pensioners' Association.  He did so last year at a time when he was increasing all State pensions.  He indicated, however, he could not see his way at that time to accede to their representations in relation to the rent allowance.  Unfortunately, I do not think there is any more money in the till this year. I think it is quite the reverse.  I am sure the Minister is regretting he did not do it last year when there was a little more money available.</P>
    <P>Strictly, I think the question of the availability of money does not apply in this.  The £60,000 is only a tiny drop in the vast ocean of State finances. If the Minister were to give it in <Col N="1364" /> this instance, he would not be creating a precedent for any other section of the public service to come looking to have some particular thing included as a pensionable emolument.  I am not certain about this&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;but I think there are some other branches of the public service, where civil servants and others are away from their homes for a short period, civil servants who are on duties which necessitate their boarding out, if I may use the word.  In some such cases where rent allowances are paid, they are included on occasions as salary.  They are brought into a calculation in subsequent years in relation to the pensions to be paid.  I may be wrong in that. If I am, it is a stick for the Minister to beat me.  If I am right, it is certainly another very strong argument in favour of the adoption of this motion.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to discuss the adequacy or inadequacy of the rent allowance.  I do not think it is strictly relevant to this motion.  As a particular reason, however, why we should be a little more generous with these men, I should like to remind the House that most of us are aware that the rent allowance paid&mdash;certainly in the city of Dublin&mdash;is grossly inadequate and certainly would not provide them even with a Dublin Corporation house, much less any privately-owned house.  The rent allowance has not kept pace with the increased costs of rents of houses.  It is an indication that the State has been mean to these men, but it should not continue to be mean to them at a time when all the members of the Force who were serving in December, 1960, and since are enjoying the right for which we are now looking for these people.</P>
    <P>Our colleagues in the Labour Party have tabled an amendment which, one feels, is mainly for the purpose of going one better than Fine Gael.  They ask that, in addition to having the rent allowance treated as a pensionable emolument, as we ask, that right be granted as and from the date on which it was granted to serving members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to make that remark but, as always, Deputy Byrne was on the ball.  Unfortunately, they are not here to move it.  We would certainly like to have it.  It is an amendment of another amendment put down originally.  We know there is no use asking the Minister for Finance, or the Department of Finance, to create a precedent like paying a pension increase for a period back over two or three years.  That might be done for judges for six, eight, nine or ten months, but they certainly will not do it for members of the Garda Síochána, and we do not ask them to do it.  Were the Minister to do it, however, it would cost in this year anything up to £200,000 or £250,000 and knowing what we know about the Department of Finance, I know that would not be done.  It is better, therefore, to ask for something reasonable, something which a reasonable Minister for Finance might give, rather than ask for something there is no hope of getting.  If you ask for something unreasonable, the Minister for Finance will appear to be quite reasonable in refusing it.  We have put down our motion in what we think are reasonable and fair terms and it would be most unreasonable of the Minister for Finance to refuse it.</P>
      <P>Since I have made reference to the conflicting attitudes of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice, it is desirable that I should put on the records of the House a letter sent on 15th January of this year by the Minister for Justice to the Secretary of the Garda Pensioners Association.</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. O'Leary,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to your letter regarding the question of including rent allowance in calculating the pensions of Gardaí who retired prior to December, 1960, I should like to let you know that I have discussed the matter on a number of occasions with the Minister for Finance.  I am sorry to say that my representations in this matter have not had the desired result; I am aware that Dr. Ryan has examined the matter very fully, and am satisfied that in all the circumstances there is no alternative to accepting <Col N="1366" /> Dr. Ryan's decision that it is not possible to accede to your request at this stage.</P>
    <P>As you are probably aware, the position is that the 1962 pensions increases provided that persons who retired before 1st November, 1955 will be brought up to the level of a colleague with similar service and rank who retired on that date.  In addition a further 6 per cent. was granted on top of the revised pension. Further, a 6 per cent. increase in pension has also been given to pensioners who retired between 1st November, 1955 and 29th February, 1960.  As rent allowances were not consolidated with the pay of the Garda Síochána until 21st December, 1960, the question of giving the pensioners concerned the benefit of the Garda pay revision of that date does not arise under the present method of pensions increase.  The matter will, however, come up for review if and when there is a general revision of pensions bringing them up to the level of pensions awarded after December, 1960.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure you that the present unfavourable decision was taken only after all aspects of the matter had been examined in full.  I am grateful for your appreciation of my efforts on behalf of the Gardaí.  While not in a position to accede to your present request, I will ask you to believe that my interest in the welfare of serving members is no greater than that in the welfare of Garda pensioners.</P>
    <P>To that letter the Secretary of the Garda Pensioners Association, following the annual general meeting of the association, replied as follows: the letter is addressed to &ldquo;C. J. Haughey, T.D. Minister for Justice:</P>
    <P>A dhuine Uasal,</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15/1/63 and to inform you the letter was discussed by the Central Committee and at the Annual General Meeting of this Association on the 5th inst., when branch delegates from all over the country were present.</P>
    <P>The following resolution was proposed <Col N="1367" /> by Denis McCarthy Cork and seconded by P. N. O'Neill Galway and unanimously agreed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the considered opinion of this meeting that the letter from the Minister dated 15/1/63 treats our claim as an ordinary claim for an increase in pension.  This is not in accordance with the facts.  Our claim for rents allowance to count for pension purposes was formulated many years ago before the question of pension increases was ever mooted.  We call on the Minister for Finance to reconsider his decision and we instruct the new Committee to prepare a fresh memorandum to be sent to the Minister setting out the views of the Association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The feeling of the meeting was one of keen disappointment that the Minister did not succeed in convincing the Department of Finance of the justice of our claim.  We would hope that the Minister would make one more effort as there is a very strong feeling both among serving members and our own members that the Garda are always discriminated against.</P>
    <P>The settlement of this comparatively minor claim would we believe help considerably in minimising this feeling of victimisation.</P>
    <P>We thank the Minister sincerely for his efforts to date and trust that we are not imposing unduly on his known good will.</P>
    <P>There is the issue.  It is knit, I think, in these two letters.  The Minister for Finance now has to explain why he will not do justice to these men, when the State has acknowledged all down the years, by reason of the laws interpreted by the courts, that rent allowance represents pay; and the State has acknowledged since 1960 that rent allowance should be included as pay. As a consequence of that, men retiring since that date enjoy a higher pension because, week in and week out, they receive a percentage of that rent allowance, a rent allowance which the men who went before them also enjoyed but which formed no part of their pensions.  This has nothing whatsoever <Col N="1368" /> to do with any increase in the cost of living, with any effort to balance what is being received now, or what pensions are being paid to men retiring now compared with those who retired earlier because of differences in salary.  It is purely and simply the question of whether or not the rent allowance was part of wages. If so, it should be a pensionable emolument.  In the light of that, I ask the Minister to accept the motion.</P>

      <P>In seconding this motion, I add my voice to that of Deputy Ryan.  It is unfortunate that a motion such as this should have to be moved in the rather frigid atmosphere of wage freeze talks emanating from the Government.  So far as I am concerned, I do not regard this as an appeal to either the charity or generosity of the Minister for Finance or the Government.  I regard it simply as a matter of justice which should be settled by the Government.  It is quite clear that this motion has the support of the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, and a section at least&mdash;an influential section&mdash;of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is clear from the letter read out from the Minister for Justice, a letter written only last month, that so far as he is concerned he recognises the merit of this claim.  He did not go to any great trouble to conceal the fact that he, as Minister for Justice, a colleague of the Minister for Finance in the Government, was disappointed at the manner in which this claim and his representations had been dealt with by the Minister for Finance.  I do not want to be repetitious, but I think it is worth while referring once more to the final paragraph of the letter written by the Minister for Justice to the Honorary Secretary of the Garda Pensioners Association on 15th January last:</P>
      <P>With reference to your letter regarding the question of including rent allowance in calculating the pensions of Gardaí who retired prior to December, 1960, I should like to let you know that I have discussed this matter on a number of occasions with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> Apparently he was not satisfied with simply mentioning it to the Minister for Finance.  He was not satisfied to accept one brush with the Minister for Finance.  He insisted on discussing the matter &ldquo;on a number of occasions with the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He continues:</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that my representations in this matter have not had the desired results.  I am aware that Dr. Ryan has examined the matter very fully and I am satisfied that in all the circumstances there is no alternative to accepting Dr. Ryan's decision that it is not possible to accede to the request at this stage.</P>
    <P>What I want to point out and to emphasise is that the Minister for Justice very carefully avoided saying, in that paragraph or elsewhere, that he agrees for one minute with the decision of the Minister for Finance in this matter. He says he is satisfied that in the circumstances there is no alternative to accepting the decision of the Minister for Finance, the decision which is referred to as being an unfavourable one, but he does not say he agrees with that decision.  I think a fair interpretation of this letter and of the situation as it exists at the moment is to say that the Minister for Justice can be counted as supporting the claim&mdash; and I say again the legitimate claim&mdash; of the Garda Síochána Pensioners Association in this matter.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ryan has pointed out, there is not a whole lot involved but I do not base my appeal to the Minister even on those grounds.  I do not care what is involved.  It seems to me this is a fair request, very much a matter of justice, a request which should be acceded to by the Minister.  I have no doubt whatever that sooner or later this request will be granted, if not by this Government, by the next Government. It will be granted for the simple reason that whether they go into the Division Lobbies or not, it is clear that a very great percentage of the Parties, in fact, the majority of the Parties, and probably a majority of members of this House, support the plea being made in this motion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the <Col N="1370" /> position in the Civil Service.  I may be open to correction in this, but I believe it to be a fact that if civil servants&mdash; and this is a right under the law&mdash;are given rent allowances, these rent allowances will be calculated as part of their wages or salaries for pension purposes.  It seems to be an eminently just thing that that should be so.  As far as the members of the Garda Síochána are concerned, I think it is absolutely true to say that part of their conditions of service is that quarters will be provided for them; they would have to be paid higher wages than those they accept on the condition that quarters will be provided.</P>
    <P>If, instead of providing adequate quarters for them, a rent allowance is paid, again it seems to me to be a matter of simple justice that that should be treated as part of their wages.  As Deputy Ryan has pointed out it has been held as far as the income tax code is concerned that these allowances are part of their wages and I therefore cannot see how any other decision could be arrived at.  That being so, I cannot foresee what answer the Minister has to this motion. I cannot see that there is any reasonable argument for refusing it and I would join with Deputy Ryan and other colleagues in my Party in urging this on the Minister very sincerely as a matter of justice, not as a matter of charity or generosity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time and for the past few years, we have been dealing with an annual Budget of over £100,000,000.  What is involved here is a sum of about £60,000 which will be decreasing each year.  The Minister for Finance has a duty to adjudicate on the various claims in the Exchequer in as fair a way as possible and I presume the only argument that can be made for resisting this motion is that it would not be just in the circumstances of the present time.  I submit such an argument cannot stand up to any careful examination.  It is quite clear the amount involved is not great.  It is not a matter of principle that would have any serious effect on other sectors of the community.  It is not <Col N="1371" /> a matter which will involve the Exchequer in increasing demands over the years.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, what is involved here is an isolated case which will decrease as the years pass.  For those reasons, we feel that the justice of the case has been made out&mdash;I think, unanswerably made out&mdash;and that it should be accepted by the Minister and his Department.  I think the evidence makes it quite clear that the Department of Justice regards it as a just claim, that the only matter that has stopped justice being done in this case has been the attitude of the Minister responsible.</P>
      <P>The facts given by Deputies Ryan and O'Higgins are incontrovertible. The fact that the present members of the Garda are to obtain this benefit is now recognised.  The fact that these allowances which were paid in the past are payable and are regarded now as remuneration is another matter which is incontrovertible.  In the circumstances, we believe that this not very large claim is one which, in justice, should be granted.  The Minister for Finance has the difficult task of adjudicating on the various claims which come before him, but I think we can undoubtedly say this claim is one which should be granted in justice.  I find it hard to visualise any other claim of a like nature which could be turned down.  I do not see any harm coming to the Exchequer as a result of its being granted or any repercussions of a serious kind to any other sector of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is granted, what will be the result?  The pensioners will get an increase of perhaps £35 a year each.  In view of the great service these people have given to the country, I do not think that can be regarded in any way as excessive.  In view of the fact that the cost of living has been increasing so rapidly, I do not think it could be regarded in any way as a bounty.  It seems to me that the benefit which they would get would be, from their point of view, of considerable significance, of considerable help, in tiding them over these difficult times.  The Minister may <Col N="1372" /> decide this is a matter which he may leave over for consideration later in the light of Budgetary provisions.  If this course is adopted, I would urge him to consider the fact that these people have served the country well, that they are not looking for anything that is unreasonable, that they are looking for justice.  I would therefore ask him to reconsider his attitude.</P>

      <P>The only thing I have to say on this matter is that some time ago I had occasion to thank the Minister for Justice for the courtesy he showed to a deputation which I and some other Fianna Fáil Deputies brought to see him.  At that time, he received us courteously and said that he would do his best to examine this matter.  I have no doubt that the Minister has considered the problem because we all feel that there is a question of justice involved here.  It is a question of justice because the people who have come after these men have succeeded in getting the rent allowance added for pension purposes.  I have already sent a number of letters to the Minister on this matter; I have discussed it with him and at all times he has been most sympathetic towards this particular section of the Garda.  I have no doubt that he is still considering it sympathetically so that in the near future he will be able to reach a just decision in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from what Deputy Burke has said that we will have a favourable item of news to hear from the Minister in the next half hour or so.  If the Minister is as sympathetic as he is claimed to be, there is no doubt that he will concede the reasonable and equitable claim made by the Garda pensioners to have <Col N="1373" /> regarded as qualifying for pension purposes the meagre rent allowance which they received in the course of their employment.  There is one important fact which I would impress on the Minister&mdash;he is Minister for Finance and is not as well versed in the affairs of the Department of Justice as the Minister for Justice&mdash;that these men were in the service of the State when Gardaí were poorly remunerated. Surely on that account there is a very grave obligation in equity and justice on the Minister to see to it that in their old age they shall be fairly treated.</P>
      <P>Many of the pension schemes under the control of the Minister for Finance for various purposes fairly bristle with anomalies.  All of these have the effect of creating a very strong sense of grievance on the part of those pensioners who are the victims of them. A few weeks ago, I was in correspondence with the Minister about such an anomaly and I urge on the Minister that of all the anomalies with which the various pension schemes bristle, none of them is as bad as this decision made by him to treat the Garda rent allowance as not qualifying as remuneration for pension purposes.</P>
      <P>The rent allowance is treated as remuneration for tax purposes by the Minister, acting in another capacity, through the Revenue Commissioners. The Minister cannot have it both ways.  If the rent allowance is income for tax purposes, it should be treated as qualifying in computing the recipient's pension after retirement.  It is a matter of simple justice and equity and it is a grievance which can be remedied by the Minister at very little cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were in a position to argue that the rent allowance was not a significant matter for serving Gardaí, it might be a different matter but a Garda has no choice in where he has to live.  He is liable to be transferred to any part of the country and his rent allowance is of considerable economic significance to him and his family.  These are men who have been poorly paid when in the employment of the State, poorly paid by whatever standards you like to take and particularly <Col N="1374" /> by the standards on which serving Gardaí are paid at present. They are men who bore the brunt of the agitation for improved conditions and remuneration, an agitation which has resulted in an improvement, very happily, for those young men coming into the service.  That must surely increase the obligation on the Minister to see that they are fairly and equitably treated in the years of their retirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I consider that when the question of the pensions of the old Gardaí is concerned, it is my duty to speak upon it.  When I go back into the past, without wishing in any way to rake up that past, I think this House must remember that it is certainly true to say that it is these men who restored to this country the law and order for which the people were yearning. It was these men, with their little books and pencils, who went out through this country, even at the risk of their lives, and put the Minister for Finance and every other Minister and Deputy here into this House to-night. They made conditions safe when law and order in this country were in abeyance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those days, we had no such thing as law and order.  The man who came into the local fair to sell his few cattle was not safe in bringing his money home.  I saw it happen in my native town of Ennistymon.  I hate to dwell on the past because it is something that should never be spoken of in this House, but it is due to those Gardaí that we should remember that perhaps we are sitting here today because they put the law into force as they got it. They blazed the trail, rugged though it was.  They made it possible for the Garda of the present time to be recognised throughout the world as the most efficient police force in existence.  They are not asking very much and I firmly believe they are entitled to it.  They are asking for something that the <Col N="1375" /> Gardaí of today walk into.  I am not saying anything against the Gardaí of the present day but all this is prepared for them by the men who came before them and made it safe for them to put on uniforms and go out through the country to uphold the law as their predecessors did before them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the motion, being one of the signatories to it.  I did not hear what Deputy Murphy said but I feel he was arguing on the same lines as I should like to argue.  We are asked to pay tribute to the men who took this country out of chaos and brought about the peace that we enjoy today and brought respect for law and order.  I cannot see why a distinction should be drawn between the pre-1960 and the post-1960 men.  It is a disgrace. It almost seems as if the Minister had something against them&mdash;I hope I am wrong in that&mdash;because of the line they adopted in making some of those on the present Government benches toe the line.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy could say much more about the Garda.  When the first Garda station came to Ennistymon&mdash; the Deputy does not want me to say this but we must pay due tribute&mdash;he was one of the men who housed them and played his part in bringing about law and order.</P>
      <P>I feel the Minister is big enough to meet the case made for the men who gave their all, who were prepared to sacrifice even their lives against the gunman, having merely a little bit of boxstick to defend themselves.  They brought respect to the Force and they well deserve anything they get from this country.  That respect cannot be measured by the paltry sum that can be offered by the Minister and whether he gives it or not, they are entitled to respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I wish to associate myself with the other speakers on this side of the House who advocate the cause of these members of the Garda Síochána. Deputy Murphy put his finger on the real point of the situation when he <Col N="1376" /> alluded to the fact that these are the men who helped to establish law and order here at a time when it was dangerous to try to do so.  At the time these men came into the police force, there was a tradition of disrespect and dislike for police in general: they were called the &ldquo;peelers&rdquo; in the old days and that tradition lingered on, helped possibly&mdash;I believe it was helped&mdash;by the unfortunate atmosphere prevailing in the early '20's making it exceedingly difficult for these men to do their work and exceedingly risky.</P>
      <P>They were the first unarmed police force we had in the country and they had to go out at a time when every second man was able to secure a gun and they had no support in trying to establish law and order.  It is a very bad attitude now for the Government to refuse them this concession to meet a demand which will diminish in the natural course of events as the years pass.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned a second point which is important, that these men have been paying tax on these rent allowances all through the years. The State saw fit to take tax from them on this money but do not see fit to give them a pension based on it. On these two aspects of the matter, I think the House should support their request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the motion. I hope the Minister will find it possible to consider this matter as one of simple abstract justice and not be influenced by or concerned with some of the arguments which were put forward here and which I cannot help feeling have nothing at all to do with any decision that may have been reached. I have no doubt that it is a bad decision but I think it is one of those curious decisions taken from time to time about relatively tiny amounts of money. There is really no comprehensible reason why this decision was taken. As the opening speaker said, the money involved is very little, £60,000, while day after day we discuss different items of Government expenditure running into hundreds of thousands of pounds and sometimes millions.  These sums are voted without great difficulty, particularly in matters concerning <Col N="1377" /> industry and factory grants of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>One of the important points is that this is a diminishing problem, becoming smaller each year for obvious reasons.  Therefore, I think the Minister should not feel that he is creating an increasing demand on the Government. I think nobody will doubt that the fact that the Minister for Justice has accepted the proposition that a conciliation board should consider the present position of the Garda&mdash;and I imagine he would be favourably disposed to making quite radical alterations in the general conditions of the Garda&mdash;concedes the general claim made here that the conditions for the Garda were generally bad and certainly inferior to those in many other countries and certainly could be improved, as I think very likely they will be improved by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance together.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with people who most of us would agree worked in difficult circumstances for indifferent rates of remuneration and they are paying for it now.  Many of them are living on grossly inadequate pensions.  I know of one person who had something like 30 years' service and is now getting a pension of £8 or £9 a week.  If the question of the rent allowances had been taken into consideration for pension purposes, he would be getting about £10. 10. a week.  That is not a lot more, but it might make the difference between that man having some sort of reasonable comfort in his retirement or having to live eternally pulling the devil by the tail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This applies also to members of the Garda who had moved up to the rank of sergeant and held positions of authority in the community.  Understandably, they were looked up to in the various areas in which they served from time to time.  They are now paid grossly inadequate pensions. For that reason, the Minister should take this opportunity of conceding this small demand.  The point was made by other Deputies that the rent allowance was assessed by the Department for the purposes of income tax payments and the allowance was reduced by that amount, and yet when it came to the <Col N="1378" /> question of considering it for pension purposes, the rent allowance was not considered eligible.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be an important inconsistency, and one that is not readily explicable, that the concession has already been made by the Department in regard to those who retired after a particular date.  It is very difficult to understand why it should be a valid claim in regard to one group of pensioners and invalid in relation to another.  I do not understand the <i>rationale</i> of that conclusion.  Possibly the Minister may have his own explanation. This is a matter of simple justice and I do not think that extraneous matters from the past are relevant.  I do not think they will help the case. The Minister will probably consider it on its merits and I sincerely hope he does.</P>
    <P>The Minister should recall the fact that in regard to another section of the particular service in the Department of Justice, we certainly dealt extravagantly generously with the other end of the service, if I may call it that&mdash;the judicial end of it.  Again, I do not want to introduce controversial considerations but there seems to be a sort of schizo-approach, a two-way approach to this question.  One section of the service must have a very high level of remuneration, allowances, pension rates and so on, for one reason or another, to keep them incorruptible, to make them more efficient, or whatever it might be, but that does not appear to apply to what we consider to be an equally important section of the service, the Garda.</P>
    <P>Possibly the Department has been cynical in its approach to this question, so far as the Garda are concerned. It is said that eaten bread is soon forgotten.  These Gardaí have good service over a long period.  They do not appear to be a powerful organisation.  They are a diminishing liability.  The claim has already been conceded by the Department as a matter of principle in regard to another section of the same body.  A relatively tiny sum is involved.  I hope the Minister will give it sympathetic consideration and try to make the concession suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it has been suggested that the case being made for these men has a political complexion of some kind, I am inclined to regret that the signatories to the motion all belong to the Party to which I belong. I believe we would get men in every Party in the House to sign this motion. I believe that all Deputies are conscious of how well the Garda have served the country.  When the Force was established in 1923, it was established on the very courageous basis that it should be unarmed.  I believe that had the Minister been responsible for the establishment of the Force, these men would have behaved exactly as they did for the past 40 years.</P>
      <P>We must remember that the historical background was very difficult. In 1923, a policeman was in a position which he is not now in, thank God. The idea of getting these men to rely on the force of law and on moral law, without carrying arms, has brought very satisfactory rewards to us all. These men are of the people, from the people and they served all the people. They gave their services modestly and good humouredly, and they were generally racy of the soil.</P>
      <P>Apart from anything else, I think at times it is difficult to recruit men to the Garda Síochána because the rewards are not equal to the rewards that can be obtained by vigorous and fine young men in other walks of life. If that is so, no discouragement should be offered to young men who seek careers in the police force of this country.  I suggest that the situation we are trying to redress by this motion is a discouragement.  As practically every other speaker has said, the amount involved is very small and the justice of this claim is apparent to all of us who have the slightest knowledge of this case.</P>

We support the motion and we should like to give it our strongest support.  The justification for the motion must be evident to the House.  I do not want to go back on what has been said by previous speakers but I do not think it would be superfluous to say that we have always regarded the members of the Garda Síochána in the highest possible light and we think that anything the State can give them is only their due.</P>
      <P>Too few of us appreciate the magnificent work done by the members of the Garda Síochána in the building up of the State from 1922 to the present time.  While we are regarded now as a rather peaceful society, and can be regarded as such and while it might be said that the lot of the Garda Síochána in the enforcement of law and order is not as strenuous as it was, of course the Garda Síochána still have very many onerous tasks imposed upon them, not alone by the Department of Justice but by practically every other Department of State.  The duties of the Garda Síochána are not confined to patrolling the streets, enforcing traffic regulations, preventing crime generally.  A member of the Garda Síochána at the present time is a functionaire for practically every State Department.  In matters affecting the Departments of Social Welfare, Agriculture, Local Government, Finance, Industry and Commerce, he has been given added duties over the years.  I cannot say whether or not the Garda object to these duties. I know some of them regard them as very onerous, especially those in small stations down the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, anything that we can give, especially to those retired <Col N="1381" /> members of the Force, will be only their due.  I do not want to retrace the internal history of this country since 1922 but we do know that the Garda had their troubles and the type of member we make a plea for today is the man who was recruited in the early '20s, say, right up to the '30s. He, indeed, had a very difficult task. He was a member of a brand-new Force and between one faction in the country and the other, his job was very difficult indeed.  It can be said of the Garda that, no matter what Government were in power, whether Cumann na nGaedheal or Fianna Fáil, in those times, each member served the State well.  For that reason, we believe that those who retired prior to 21st December, 1960, should be given this addition to their pensions.</P>
    <P>I do not think there would be anything unusual in this.  I am sure it has already been pointed out in the course of speeches here that rent allowance is included for the purpose of assessing the pension in the case of many local employees and it would not be an unusual step in respect of the Garda. As a matter of fact, from 21st December, 1960, onwards, the case has been admitted in respect of pensions for members of the Garda.  The rent allowance is now non-existent and in lieu of it, 25/-, approximately, per week has been added to the salaries of members of the Force.  That 25/- per week will be included for the purpose of calculating pensions when members of the Force retire.  Therefore, it is only reasonable that we should ask that the rent allowance given down through the years prior to December, 1960, should be included for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>I want to say, therefore, without appearing to flog this case&mdash;the Minister must be fully conversant with it; he had representations from the Garda Representative Body and he knows their case &mdash; that the Labour Party support the motion fully and ask the Minister to make this gesture in respect of members of the Garda who for 25 or 30 years served each Government well and certainly served the country well.</P>

      <P>There is very <Col N="1382" /> little left that can be said but I wish to add my voice in support of the claim of members of the Garda who retired prior to December, 1960.  The motion asks that the rent allowance paid to them should be treated as a pensionable emolument.  In other words, it is claiming for those who retired prior to December, 1960, the same concessions as those who retired since that date now enjoy.</P>
      <P>I am one of the younger members of this House but I am speaking on behalf of a generation of men who contributed so much to the foundation of the State.  It is a sad state of affairs that this motion had to be tabled at all.  Justice and fair play should have seen to it that these men would have got what is their due and what they are justly entitled to.</P>
      <P>The large number of Deputies who have signed their names to this motion is an indication of the way in which our Party views this question.  I cannot see any reason whatever for differentiating between the men who retired prior to 1960 and the men who retired since that time.  I urge the Minister at this late stage to give these men what they are justly entitled to.</P>

      <P>If this motion proves one thing more than anything else, it is the truth of the old adage that eaten bread is soon forgotten.  We are dealing with a group of people who served the State very well over a period of years.  Since 1960 it has been conceded that it is right to assess rent allowance as salary but it is not agreed that that should apply retrospectively.  It is all right to talk about conditions in the Garda at the present time and to suggest that members of the Force should be treated well.  In my opinion, the Garda are deserving of the very best. The present Force are definitely doing their job very well and are entitled to the best.  But having said that, we must also admit that, as Deputy Corish said the people for whom we are speaking tonight served the State very well for a period of almost 40 years and were in the Force at a time when it was not a very popular thing to be a member of the Garda Síochána.  They are the <Col N="1383" /> people who did, in fact, establish the civil law in this State.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by a previous speaker to the manner in which what he described as the other end of the Department of Justice was dealt with.  He referred to the judiciary.  The treatment of the older Gardaí appears to be again an attempt to prove something which most of us all our lives have been trying to disprove, that is, that there are two races of people in this country, those who have plenty and must get more and those who have very little and who should get as little as can possibly be given to them.  This is a time when the Minister should have very little difficulty or hesitation in putting into operation what is asked in the motion.</P>
      <P>I am glad so many Fine Gael speakers have supported this motion. Most of us have memories&mdash;I am sure the old Garda have memories, too&mdash; of the time when the forerunners of that Party thought it fit to halve the allowances the Garda were getting. Perhaps this indicates that the younger people coming into the Party are anxious to right the wrongs then done. It does not matter whether the Garda pensioners are supporters of the Government, Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  Many of us speaking here have none of these people in our constituencies and are not interested in them from the political point of view. In common justice, however, they are entitled to the same treatment as the younger members who came after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was established in a court of law here, when Garda White's case came up over income tax, that the rent allowance was in fact part of the salary.  Since the Minister for Finance deals with pensions as well as income tax, he should not try to prove that something can be right, when it suits him and his Department, and wrong when it does not suit them.  Either it is right that the Garda have to pay income tax on their rent allowances, and therefore get credit for it for pension purposes, or it is wrong&mdash;in which case they should not have to pay <Col N="1384" /> income tax.  The mere fact that the State have now accepted, with effect as from 21st December, 1960, that the rent allowance is part of the salary is sufficient proof that the decision of the court was right and that the Department of Finance must in all justice give credit to the Garda for that rent allowance.</P>
    <P>If this rent allowance were something given intermittently, such as travelling expenses, I could understand the attitude, but this is something they had to pay regularly, and something for which they got damn bad value.  I have experience of going into some of the quarters for which they were paying £1 a week.  How they came out in fit condition to do duty is a mystery to me.  There were places, particularly in the country districts, which were, and are, a disgrace to the State. Therefore, the Department of Finance cannot say that the rent allowance was an extra.  They were paying for something, and the value they got for it was very doubtful.</P>
    <P>If there were not a precedent for this, I could understand the Minister saying: &ldquo;We just cannot do it,&rdquo; just as the Ceann Comhairle told Deputy Corish that we could not establish a precedent.  It is a fact that in outside employment, a rent allowance or lodging allowance is always considered as part of the salary.  The question of hospital employees of a local authority immediately comes to mind.  A deduction is made for their lodging allowance.  In every case it is counted as part of their salary and, when pensions are being assessed they get credit for the rent allowance deducted.  In the case of the Garda, as has been stated, in fact they have been credited with this.  But it appears that the Department of Finance are trying to tell the House and the Garda that it is all right to look after the young people but that the older fellows who have gone out do not count any longer.</P>
    <P>I should not like them to feel that they do not count any longer.  I should like them to feel that what they have done for this State is appreciated.  We would be doing a great injustice to those men if we did not state here publicly that we believe a very grave <Col N="1385" /> injustice has been done to them, and that the Government of the day should attempt to remedy it at once.  If the amount involved were a large one, it could possibly be said that there would be difficulty in implementing what we are asking, but the amount is not a large one.  In fact, it is so small that the Minister will have very little difficulty in covering it up in the Budget he is now preparing.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who is a reasonable man, will appreciate the force of the arguments which have been made here, and I am sure he will decide that the allowances should have been regarded all along as part of the salary.  I do not know what way the mind of any man works who can think that something can be right from 21st December, 1960, on and wrong before that date. Can the Minister himself honestly say he thinks that the man who retired on 20th December, 1960 is not as much entitled to credit for the rent allowance as the man who retired on 21st December, 1960?  Can he say that the man who retired in the years before 21st December, 1960, is not entitled to have the rent allowance counted as part of his salary and so estimated for pension purposes?  If the Minister is able to do that, I would be glad to hear his arguments.  If he does not think it right, I should like him to explain why he does not think it is right.  If, however, he agrees with the arguments put forward to-night, he should have no hesitation whatever in deciding that the case is strong enough to say to his officials: &ldquo;Prepare a case and give these older men credit for what they are entitled to&mdash;give them the pension they deserve.&rdquo;  If the Minister does that in his Budget, certainly very few voices will be raised against it on that issue.  What voices will be raised against it on other issues, the Minister himself might be better able to judge.</P>

      <P>When the debate was <Col N="1386" /> adjourned, I was dealing with the statements made by Deputy Esmonde on the necessity for getting foreign engineers to assist in this matter.  I had pointed out that, in my opinion, the engineering skill and ability of our own people are second to none.  Deputy Esmonde remarked also on the durability of the job to be done.  It is a pity he would not take a trip down to Minane in County Cork where the late Seán Moylan, God rest his soul, through the Land Commission and the Board of Works did a perfect job.  He succeeded in saving there some 350 acres of land for a sum of, I think, between £16,000 and £18,000.  In the opinion of our engineering experts in Cork, this is a job that will hold for the next 100 years.  It is a credit to both the Land Commission and the Board of Works engineers who took charge of it and carried it out.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether the 20 per cent required from the local authority can be raised by way of loan.  Provision should be made for that, remembering what the position of ratepayers is throughout the country at the moment. Our rates in Cork will be up by more than 4/- in the £ in the coming year. There would be a reluctance on the part of ratepayers' representatives to go very far under this measure unless we can get some help.</P>
      <P>Consideration should also be had to the necessity for preparation for the Common Market.  If the agricultural community are to prepare for the Common Market, then they should be allowed into it with as good an opportunity as their competitors in Britain and Northern Ireland who pay no rates on agricultural land.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde raised this question of &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I suggest we got the first instalment towards the Common Market in the rates last year. Now the sliding reduction of tariffs is to continue.  I think we are also entitled in equity to a sliding scale directed towards wiping out all rates on agricultural land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He is looking for a 20 per cent. contribution from the local authority.  I am suggesting to him that, in view of the sliding reduction in tariffs, this would be a good time to have a sliding reduction in rates on agricultural land.  I admit the Bill is pretty generous.  After all, in 1956, they gave us only 50 per cent of the cost of the job.  This requires us to contribute only 20 per cent of the cost.  That is fairly decent assistance from the central authority.  Other differences in this Bill have already been enumerated.  Smaller schemes will be executed by the Commissioners; under the 1956 Act, smaller schemes had to be executed by the local authority.  The Commissioners will be responsible for upkeep.  That may make them do a better job initially to prevent the danger of their being hauled over the coals later. Having seen the work of our engineers in the Minane bridge scheme, I have no doubt they will be able for any scheme or any problem that comes up.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on introducing this Bill.  It is badly needed.  I saw the terror within a few miles of my own house within the past 12 months and everybody is anxious that we should have an opportunity of removing that terror.  There is a good deal of noise about ratepayers but I should like to point out that in one area alone&mdash;the Little Island-Glounthane-Dunkettle area &mdash; the county council lost around £1,500 last year because landowners, whose lands were flooded for over five or six months, had to be relieved of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Little Island, one man spent £3,000 reclaiming land and putting it into tiptop pasture; that was all wiped out in one night.  He has to start all over again now, and he does not know the morning he will wake up and find the tide once more washing over his doorstep.  That land is some of the highest valued land in the county, carrying a PLV of 35/- per statute acre.  Such land is well worth reclaiming.  I am sure this will be one of the first schemes put before the Office of Public Works.  I remember a long time ago when the late Mr. Hugo Flinn, God rest his soul, was <Col N="1388" /> Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Office of Public Works, a scheme for that area was partially examined. That is a long time ago.  In view of the engineering skills we have now, there should be little difficulty in removing the terror that lies over the countryside there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to welcome the Bill and, in doing so, I wish to congratulate Deputy Esmonde for the part he has played over the years in keeping up the pressure on the Minister. Deputy Esmonde comes from the same constituency as the Minister for Finance and there has been a problem there for years, and I feel the Minister has been prompted by this pressure to introduce this Bill.  For that reason, Deputy Esmonde is to be congratulated. The Minister also probably knows there is the possibility he could be washed out of this House on a tide of public protest if he does not face up to this problem that confronts his own county in a particular way.</P>
      <P>I am not interested in that county but I hope this Bill will not have its beginning and its ending in Wexford. From the point of view of protection from the danger to valuable property through coast erosion, I welcome this Bill.  We in Galway have felt a great need for such protection during the recent storms.  Grattan Road was particularly badly hit and were it not for the grace of God, many lives would have been lost.  As it was, there was considerable damage to property by the sea.  The Parliamentary Secretary should know the area of which I speak. There is continued pressure on the Galway Corporation to prevent future damage and the matter has now been referred to the county council who are beginning to realise how big a problem it is.  They are very anxious that the Board of Works should take an interest in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope and pray this Bill will meet the particular situation I have mentioned. In passing, I would refer the Parliamentary Secretary to an area which is not in my constituency but in which I have an interest because of what I have seen.  I am speaking of Tawin in Oranmore, where one can see over and over again the work of a <Col N="1389" /> year's farming operations gone for nothing, swept into Galway Bay. These farmers have to pay rates and taxes, irrespective of the results of their year's operations, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to tell me that they will be eligible for assistance under this Bill for the protection of their property.</P>
    <P>I think the percentage of grant provided for, 80 per cent of estimated cost, is laudable but I think there should be some elasticity in the upper direction in cases where major schemes are necessary.  My point here is that where big protection schemes are carried out local ratepayers should not be saddled with a bigger bill than they can afford to pay.  This would, of course, apply only in cases of catastrophe but the remedy should not create another catastrophe for the ratepayers who might not be able to bear the 20 per cent balance of a major scheme, which is all the Bill provides for.  I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to allow up to 90 per cent of the cost in certain such cases.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should let the occasion pass without paying a tribute to the staff of the Board of Works.  It is with pride that we in Galway can look at the work they have done on the Corrib scheme.  We also take pride in the fact that this excellent work was carried out under the most arduous conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With the other Deputies who have spoken, I should like to welcome this Bill, particularly its provision of higher grants as compared with the previous Bill, because I feel these increased grants will ensure <Col N="1390" /> the success of the whole project.  When one considers the high cost of the work in connection with coast protection, I think it becomes pretty obvious that if the Parliamentary Secretary were to give only 50 per cent of the total cost no use would be made of the legislation by county councils.  This is more or less borne out by what has been stated by Deputy Coogan when he said even an 80 per cent grant might not be sufficient. If we were to give only 50 per cent, the whole legislation would be ineffective.</P>
      <P>This problem of coast erosion is one which has required attention for a long time, but because of the immensity of the problem, it took considerable courage to bring a Bill of this type before the House.  Therefore, I should like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary for having had the courage to bring it in.  There is hardly a section of our coastline not affected and this applies to the east as well as to the south, west and north.  People have a tendency to look on the coast in my constituency as not being affected.</P>
      <P>Efforts have been made over the years to tackle this problem but the efforts were sporadic, without cohesion and therefore ineffective.  Now the matter is being dealt with in a comprehensive way and while it would be wrong to expect miracles or to think the problem will be overcome in a very short time, nevertheless it gives considerable hope to the people affected by coast erosion.  If we were only to judge by the number of questions tabled here over the years and the flood of representations which the Parliamentary Secretary receives on this matter, we can see the problem is a very big one and that it will be a very difficult one to deal with.  In my constituency, there are numerous cases in need of urgent attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made representations on a number of occasions but because there was not any legislation whereby money could be provided for this type of work, I did not succeed.  I am hopeful now these matters can be handled under the legislation before the House.  I agree with Deputy Brennan that coast erosion is going on all the time.  What I find is that people become seriously <Col N="1391" /> perturbed only when property is in danger, when they fear that the erosion is beginning to endanger their houses and other property.  There is no doubt it is going on all the time along the coast in my constituency and people are losing a lot of good arable land. Because of the excellence of the land in Co. Louth any loss in that respect in that area is a serious one.</P>
    <P>There is a case in point in which I had to make representations some time ago with regard to coast erosion outside Castlebellingham.  In that particular area, the gardens of a number of houses were being rapidly cut away and the people became very anxious about their houses.  It is clear from that that there is a considerable amount of good land being taken away by the sea.  If that had happened in some other place where the houses were not in danger, it might have gone unnoticed until considerable damage had been done.  In this case, the Board of Works had no authority to do anything about it and the county council did some work on it.  I should like to have it looked into again under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also difficulty in the districts of Baltray and Blackrock in my constituency. There are sea walls there which are in bad condition and in Blackrock, the wall has subsided to some extent. In Baltray, improvements have been made recently by the local people but there again the sea is doing considerable damage and endangering property.  I do not know if this particular question comes under this Bill, but in Drogheda a number of the streets are regularly flooded by the Boyne and the unfortunate people there have become so used to being flooded out that they are beginning to take it as part of their way of life.  I wonder if anything can be done to help them under this Bill?  Another matter which I would like to bring under the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary is the case of the Castletown river.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>At least I have put the matter before the Parliamentary Secretary for his consideration.  The manner in which the whole question of coast protection can be dealt with is clearly laid down in the Bill.  It was suggested by a Fine Gael Deputy that the procedure is cumbersome but I feel that the work can be done more quickly under the Bill than if the plans were entirely a matter for the Commissioners. If we had not the promoting authority preparing the plan in the first instance and then bringing it to the Commissioners, there would be no other method of dealing with the matter except that the Commissioners would draw up the first plan themselves. As has been said by a number of speakers, there will be a flood of applications from various counties and if the Commissioners were responsible for planning in each county, it would be a long time before any scheme would be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the system laid down in this Bill is a very good one in so far as it gives the local council the opportunity of putting their own staffs to work on this problem and it gives them the opportunity of deciding as to whether they will continue with the project if they feel the cost is reasonable or to reject it if they feel the cost is too high.  For these reasons the procedure outlined in the Bill is as good as can be got.  The councils can investigate proposals for coast protection in their own areas.  These investigations should not take very long.  For many years: <Col N="1393" /> members of councils have been dealing with this matter of coast protection as it affected their areas and asking that something should be done.  All that is necessary now is to resurrect these proposals, decide on their merit and an order of priority, and put them before the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if it is intended that a promoting body must first make a total survey of its area, decide on the order of the projects and then place them in that order before the Commissioners or if they can begin by selecting a particular project and put that one before the Commissioners for consideration.</P>

      <P>I am also glad to note that the making of a declaration is a reserved function.  I feel that the layman's point of view is very important in cases such as this.  The engineers can draw up a technical plan but quite often that plan can be improved by indivdual members of councils.  I also like the scheme because it gives more power to the elected representatives.  The trend to do that has been noticeable not only in this Bill but also in the Bill brought in recently by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that local government has become so complex over the last number of years that it is necessary that the right to make decisions must in many instances be placed in the hands of certain people but it is a good trend to see that elected members of local bodies have the right to say that they will or will not go ahead with a particular project. According to the Bill, the Commissioners will determine, on the completion of a preliminary examination, whether a scheme should go on.  Here I should like to know on what grounds such a decision will be based.  For example, will the size of the scheme have anything to do with the decision? Will a small scheme be decided against just because it is small?  These small schemes could be of vital importance to the individuals concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Bill goes a long way to protect the rights of <Col N="1394" /> individuals.  Every opportunity is given to anybody affected to note the proposals and he is given full knowledge of what is planned before the scheme is finally accepted.  Where the Commissioners decide to go ahead with the scheme and the promoting authorites are agreeable the Commissioners will give an estimate of the cost.  It is stated in the Bill that during the course of the work the Commissioners may, where they deem it necessary, make changes in the scheme.  Obviously, this will alter the cost and I wonder whether it would be possible to give a fairly close estimate of the cost when the local authority decide to proceed?</P>
    <P>I am glad to see provision made for maintenance of the works by the Commissioners. If that provision were not in the Bill money spent on the schemes would in general, in this type of work, be useless.  I am glad that is not to be the case.  I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the Bill and I am very hopeful that it will do good work in coast protection generally and particularly in my own constituency.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which is long overdue.  A Bill with very little difference was introduced here in 1956 and we are now in 1963, having waited seven years for this Bill which was actually printed before we, in the previous Government, went out of office.  But better late than never; this is a step in the right direction.  I trust the Bill will benefit my own county, a maritime county bordering the Atlantic, a county which suffers considerably from flooding.  The Gortahork area and the area around the island of Arranmore and many other parts of the county, particularly west Donegal, should benefit under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first objection to the Bill is that it is completely wrapped up in red tape.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a man for whom I have nothing but the greatest respect.  When he assumed the office which he now has the honour to hold, I said: &ldquo;Thank God, it is somebody who will cut through red tape.&rdquo;  But somehow he has got it tangled around his legs again and it <Col N="1395" /> strangles and stultifies the benefits which should flow from this Bill.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the fact that the promotion of these schemes is a reserved function and not an executive one.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on that.  Schemes must be initiated by the members of a local authority as distinct from the county manager.  But what happens, if we find in West Donegal or West Kerry that we have coast erosion?  The local councillor is called in and he makes a preliminary examination.  He asks the local authority to promote a scheme to prevent erosion.  They send out their engineers to make a preliminary examination.  One can imagine how long this will take.  The engineers report back to the authority saying: &ldquo;Yes, there is flooding there and a feasible scheme can be promoted.&rdquo;  In other words, they are satisfied that the land in the area is being progressively damaged by the continued encroachment of the sea and that the encroachment is likely to endanger valuable property.  The local authority discuss the report and say: &ldquo;Here is a scheme that could be promoted.&rdquo;  They report to the Commissioners of Public Works. I have great respect for the Commissioners and for their officials.  They are kicked about this House and around the country but all they are is a plug in the gap between the Department of Finance and any promoting authority and whenever the Department want to hold up the flow of money, they say to the Commissioners: &ldquo;See that they dot the i's and cross the t's of any scheme they promote and hold it up as long as you can.&rdquo;  Neither the officials nor the Parliamentary Secretary can be blamed for that.  The root of that trouble is the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>However, the Commissioners receive this preliminary report from the local authority.  One would think that once the local authority have sent out engineers to examine the area, that should be satisfactory to anybody, but no, they report to the Commissioners. What do the Commissioners do?  They report to the Minister for Finance who looks at the preliminary report and <Col N="1396" /> then says to the local authority: &ldquo;The next thing you must do is notify all interested parties, put notices in the newspapers, publish notices in the area and hear objectors and those in favour of the scheme.&rdquo;  Having done that, the local authority again report to the Commissioners.  What may the Commissioners do?  They may refer the matter back to the local authority and may say: &ldquo;We do not think you should go ahead with this scheme and that you should drop it.  If you agree to drop it you must pay half the cost up-to-date.&rdquo;  If the scheme is a big one, I would guarantee that the Commissioners will recommend it should be dropped like a hot brick.  If it is a small one, particularly coming up to an election, you will be told go ahead as fast as possible and knowing the Board of Works&mdash;somebody described it as the Board of Jerks, and knowing the way it works through no fault of itself or the officials, there is a lot to be said for that nickname&mdash;that may take time.</P>
    <P>The scheme comes back to the Minister then and he may refuse to sanction it.  Or, having considered it carefully and having looked at what is in the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; he may say: &ldquo;Let us go ahead.&rdquo;  Here we have spent valuable months and, mark you, time and tide wait for no man.  The tide will not await its inroads on the land for the decision of the Commissioners of Public Works or the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister may refuse to sanction the scheme and that ends it, but then the local authority is responsible for half the cost up to that.  Suppose the Minister decides to go ahead and says: &ldquo;We will give you a grant.&rdquo;  He says to them: &ldquo;Will you undertake to pay 20 per cent of the cost and we will pay 80 per cent, but you must further undertake to pay the full maintenance of the scheme hereafter, in perpetuity?&rdquo; I reckon from my experience that from the day the member of the local council is called in for the purpose of examining some place where coast erosion is taking place until the day when the plug is put in the gap and the sea prevented from coming in, will be at least two or three years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> If the Minister said to the local authority: &ldquo;Promote a scheme.  Tell us the full cost.  Send it up to us.  We will have our expert look at it in the office to see if your costs are right.  If your costs are right, we will give 80 per cent of the costs and you can get on with the job&rdquo;, a lot of time would be saved.  In that way, we would be doing something to prevent coast erosion, but, as I say, we are actually undoing the good work which the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary intend to do under this Bill by being bound up and would up in red tape.</P>
    <P>My next objection to the Bill is that the local authority is being asked to pay 20 per cent of the cost and a full 100 per cent of the maintenance hereafter. I know the Parliamentary Secretary will hit me back and say: &ldquo;Look, you introduced a Bill in 1956 and you wanted the local authority to pay 50 per cent of the cost.&rdquo;  That is a very good answer, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine what the rates were in 1956 and compare them with the rates of today.</P>
    <P>We had not felt the impact of the Health Act on the local rates in 1956. I heard the President of Ireland saying from this bench in 1956: &ldquo;We have reached the limit of taxation at local authority level.&rdquo;  Since then, the rates have gone up throughout the country by approximately 10/- in the £, and local authorities are seeking a further 10/- this year.  In some counties, the rates will reach £3 in the £ and out of that £3, 20/- in the £ will go to the health services.  We had not these extravagant rates in 1956 and it was reasonable then when a plug was needed for coast erosion, to ask the local authorities to pay 50 per cent of the cost, but it is unreasonable and unrealistic today with mounting rates and a falling numerical strength of ratepayers to ask them to contribute 20 per cent of the cost and undertake the maintenance of the schemes for all time.</P>
    <P>When I first examined this Bill, I thought it was a great thing that it was a reserved function and not an executive function, but I can see counties where a councillor from a seaboard area is anxious to promote a scheme, but his colleagues from the <Col N="1398" /> hinterland of that county who have got to pay the piper and pay the costs will unfortunately oppose such a scheme because it will increase the rates.  We will find that a number of schemes that should be promoted will not be promoted, and we will find that people will sink their political differences and what I may describe as inland councillors will outvote the representatives of the seaboard when it comes to imposing on the rates 20 per cent of the cost of promoting a coast erosion scheme.  In other words, there is method in the madness of the Minister in making it a reserved function because if it were an executive function and the county manager thought it was a good scheme to promote, he would proceed with it, irrespective of what the impact might be on the rates.  That is what has left the rates where they are today.</P>

      <P>We will try to plug these holes now.  As I said before, there is method in the madness of the Minister.  He is ensuring that there will be a fight in the local authorities between the inland and the maritime councillors as to whether a scheme should be promoted.  I can imagine what will happen in County Dublin if Deputy Burke, as the representative of Skerries, wishes to have a certain coast erosion scheme promoted. I can see councillors from other parts of the county who are not interested in the seaboard opposing a scheme because 20 per cent of the cost would go on the rates.  Deputy Burke can say that the same thing will happen in my constituency and I agree.  It will not be his political opponents who will oppose him; it will be a representative of the ratepayers from his Party who is not interested in the seaboard.  Unfortunately, probably, whether we like it or not, they will be in the majority and we will find difficulty in carrying through these promotions.  The Minister could help us by saying to the local authorities: &ldquo;Promote a scheme and the Exchequer will pay 100 per cent of the grant.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>I sincerely ask the Minister between <Col N="1400" /> now and Committee Stage to reconsider the section which makes it mandatory on local authorities to pay 20 per cent of the cost.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Donabate, Portrane Strand, Malahide and parts of the Portmarnock peninsula.  This Bill is long overdue.  We have made representations to the local authorities, the Board of Works and everyone concerned, to have something done about the severe coast erosion where it was affecting built-up areas.  We tried over the years in every possible way to get grants.  The pressure from the northern part of the constituency has been very strong over the years.  There is property in the Skerries area which is in danger of toppling.  The same applies in some portions of Rush and the Portrane north shore.  But for the fact that a small job was carried out eight years ago by means of a grant from this House, a number of houses would have been washed away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is enshrined in the Bill the right of the local authority to make a decision.  I appreciate that very much. When a reasonable case is put to the members of a local authority, they see the justice of the case even if the area <Col N="1401" /> in question is one in which they are not personally concerned.  It is a very good feature of the Bill that the decision to carry out works should be a reserved function.</P>
    <P>I should like to see much more power being left to local authorities. Public men will not do anything that is unjust.  They have to face the verdict of the people at successive elections. If they have done anything unjust or dishonourable, the verdict will be given against them at the next succeeding election.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is in operation, I hope the most urgent cases will be dealt with first.  Priority should be given to North County Dublin.  Otherwise, I might not have any constituency in the next few years and would have to go down to Waterford.</P>

      <P>The position is really bad in parts of North County Dublin.  I do not want to hold up the House.  The Bill can be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage.  Members of the Opposition asked for 100 per cent grants from the State but the Parliamentary Secretary has improved the position considerably <i>vis-à-vis</i> the 1956 Bill, which provided for a 50 per cent grant from the State.; The 1956 Bill is one of the Bills that never went through, for some untold reason.  We on this side of the House welcome the 80 per cent State grant and if we are left in office long enough and if the prosperity of the nation improves, some future Parliamentary Secretary&mdash; perhaps the present Parliamentary Secretary as Minister&mdash;will go the whole hog when times improve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly welcome this Bill as a step in the right direction, particularly as far as Kerry is concerned because there is a vast problem there with regard to coast erosion.  I would, however, have preferred to see a much higher State contribution as Kerry County Council are facing a very difficult position because of the possibility of rates going over the £3 figure in this year.  The raising of the necessary rates for large-scale coast protection work will be a very difficult matter.  Where large-scale works are concerned at heavy cost, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider giving a 100 per cent grant.</P>
      <P>I have in mind the carrying out of protection work in the Maharees in Kerry.  There are 250 people living in that peninsula, if it can be so described. It is practically cut through at the inner neck, making practically islanders of the people who are winning a living out of the soil and the sea.  There is the very valuable onion planting and onion industry there, based almost entirely on the Maharees, and these people deserve the maximum help possible from the State.</P>
      <P>Many years ago, a coast wall was erected which has been completely washed away and the sea has encroached as much as 50 or 100 yards at various parts.  In a severe storm last year, the road was cut in two places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to make the point that the Kerry County Council cannot meet the contribution necessary to carry out the type of scheme that would protect the people there.  I do not know what the actual cost would be but it would be somewhere in the region of £200,000 or more.  The contribution demanded from Kerry County Council <Col N="1403" /> in that case would be beyond the capacity of the ratepayers to pay and certainly there would be great difficulty in getting the number of county councillors required to have the necessary rate struck by the county council.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that in such cases the Parliamentary Secretary should consider making an arrangement to give a 100 per cent State grant or, at least, a 90 per cent State grant. Where large expenditure is required, the maximum State help should be given.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points in Kerry where coast protection is required but the Maharees and Castlegregory provide the worst examples of coast erosion in the country.  In these cases, coast erosion affects the livelihood of the smallholders and other people in the area.  There is every chance that the sea will eventually cut through the neck of the peninsula, which, at the narrowest point, is only about 100 yards wide.  The storms last winter cut from the east side as well as from the west side, thus narrowing the neck.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is certainly a good Bill inasmuch as it indicates that the State is accepting responsibility for doing something for the people affected by coast erosion.  In my opinion, the State grant should be 100 per cent because unfortunately, it is the poorer counties that are affected by this problem, which is really a national problem.  Certainly all of the western counties are affected and most of the counties on the east coast that are affected are not the wealthiest counties.  Only a limited number of counties are affected.  Since they are the poorest counties, the maximum effort should be made towards providing the maximum grant.  It should not be below 90 per cent., and in cases where large expense has to be met, the grant should be 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill.  Our task is to protect the small-holders along our coastline.  Unfortunately, the position will be getting worse.  Experts tell us the level of the sea has been raised by <Col N="1404" /> 11 inches.  That is throwing a great weight of water on the breaches made over the years, tending to create greater havoc.  If this Bill can help restrain the seas, it will certainly be one of the best Bills to go through this House.  I know my constituents will welcome it, but I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to endeavour to get the maximum State contribution for the poorer counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will deal with problems which have caused a great deal of agitation over the years. The Parliamentary Secretary has set out the main points and principles, which, perhaps, can be discussed and improved on in Committee.  At any rate, the Bill gives an idea of the great problem to be dealt with in winning back a lot of fertile land which has been submerged.</P>
      <P>This problem is of long standing Where it arises from wide stretches of open bays, no doubt it will be costly; but in the case of narrow entrances&mdash; perhaps, what may be considered the primary stream&mdash;leading to the submersion of good land in the hinterland, that will be a comparatively easy problem to deal with.  In my constituency, 200 or 400 acres of submerged land were brought into cultivation some years ago again when the late Seán Moylan&mdash;Beannacht Dé air&mdash;held the office the Parliamentary Secretary now holds.  In that case, there was a contribution from the landowners, one from the county council and a large contribution from his Department.  With the insertion of half a dozen sluice gates, up to 500 acres of land were saved from the tides.</P>
      <P>The same may apply in other cases. There is no use specifying a number of them here, but at least some examples may be given.  There is one, for example, at Ballinspittle, where the farmers have been looking for grants for some years past.  Something was done 12 years ago and was successful at the time.  But the years passed and no maintenance of any consequence was carried out.  The position has deteriorated again so far that something must be done to remedy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> At Garrettstown, the Old Head of Kinsale is liable to become an island before very long, if maintenance is not continued there.  The tides come from both the east and the west.  In times of great storm, the sea takes its toll of the land, making the gap narrower and narrower as the years go by. Earlier today Deputy P. Brennan talked about the railway saving portions of the east coast.  In the case of Timoleague, the railway is no longer in existence.  The same position held there.  The Courtmacsherry branch of the West Cork railway went right along the shore.  Now that railway is gone, but unless proper attention is given to the foreshore there, more land is liable to be submerged.  In addition, the surrounds of Timoleague village itself will need attention.</P>
    <P>These are problems, I presume, which must be brought to the Parliamentary Secretary individually for examination of their particular circumstances. I shall content myself, therefore, in welcoming this Bill, which, I am sure, along with the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary, will go a long way towards solving these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to thank Deputies on both sides for the co-operative manner in which they have received this Bill.  The main bone of contention, so to speak, has been the possible incidence of local taxation.  As Deputy Lynch very wisely pointed out when replying for the Opposition to this measure, members of local authorities will have the decision as to whether or not a scheme will be considered.  He also welcomed the fact that the Office of Public Works would give the council an accurate estimate of the cost and that the responsible members of the local authority could then decide whether it was not only in the national interest but in the interest of the county as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important things I would bring to the attention of Deputies is the interpretation under this Bill of coast erosion and actual storm damage.  There is a vast difference between the two.  Deputy Sweetman, <Col N="1406" /> when Minister for Finance, dealt with that difference in a very capable manner.  As I have mentioned Deputy Sweetman, may I say that Deputy Sweetman, during the discussion today on the Order of Business &mdash;he did not speak on this measure at any point for reasons apparently best known to himself &mdash; referred to this Bill and described it as a rehash of his 1956 Bill.  As has been pointed out&mdash; I do not want to labour the point&mdash; the fundamental difference between this measure and the 1956 Bill is the fact that the latter looked for a 50 per cent contribution from the local authority and this measure looks for only 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is not really the point I want to make, but I want to correlate it with the criticism of this measure by Deputy P. O'Donnell.  He referred to the inordinate amount of red tape and suggested that it would tangle round my legs; he suggested it has been put in by the Minister for Finance and his officials to ensure that the Bill will not work.  Now, if this Bill is, as Deputy Sweetman has said, a rehash of the 1956 Bill, surely it is only logical that what is criticised now should equally have been criticised then.  Deputy O'Donnell made a nice little speech.  I am sure it will go down well in his constituency.  He certainly covered the points which might be causing anxiety to the people in his area.</P>
    <P>This being a reserved function, I am satisfied that, in the main, only schemes of a high economic merit will reach the Office of Public Works for further examination.  It would be a waste of time to ask the Office of Public Works initally to make a report, and the main purpose in asking the local authority to make an initial report of a not too detailed nature is because local authorities, their engineers and officials, have the local knowledge and will not send a report, or a request, to the Office of Public Works if the proposal before them is feckless and not worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I am surprised no Deputy has referred to one matter.  Perhaps I should not be the devil's advocate, but one might as well face facts.  What is worrying me is the exact meaning of <Col N="1407" /> the term &ldquo;coast erosion&rdquo;.  I am in process of discussing this with my advisers and it is essential that we should, on Committee Stage, make some attempt to put before the House a definition of coast erosion.</P>
    <P>In a Scottish Act I have here in my hand, the coast is defined as &ldquo;all the bays, the estuaries, the arms of the sea, and all tidal waters within three miles of the land.&rdquo;  The definition in the British Coast Protection Act of 1949 lays it down that seashore means &ldquo;the bed and the shore of the sea and of every channel, bay, or estuary, and of every river as far up that river as the tide flows, and any cliff, bank, barrier, dune, beach, flat or other land adjacent to the shore.&rdquo;  The reason I mention this&mdash;I am being as straightforward as possible with the House&mdash;is to show that there is a difficulty.  It is necessary that we should face that difficulty.  It would not be fair to ask our Commissioners, or the Minister, to interpret or to define coast erosion.  This is the place where that should be done, while the measure is being enacted.  To the best of our ability, we should include a definition in the Bill.  We should not evade the issue.</P>
    <P>We shall have to find some realistic definition.  The definition in the British Act says every river as far up that river as the tide flows.  I can put my finger immediately on a particular case.  Limerick is 60 miles from Loop Head at the mouth of the Shannon. Surely no one would suggest that, if the embankments are being progressively damaged 60 miles away from the mouth, this could be classified as coast erosion.  Yet, the river is tidal up to two or three miles beyond Limerick city.  I bring that to the attention of the House.  I trust we shall be able to do something about this matter on Committee Stage.  It is doubtful if a statutory definition is desirable, but we can consider the matter again.</P>

      <P>It would be most <Col N="1408" /> desirable to arrive at some kind of definition; otherwise, I can see trouble in the future.  Deputy P. Brennan asked what the position would be if a scheme cost £100,000, the State paying 80 per cent of the cost and the promoting authority 20 per cent, and, through unforeseen circumstances, such as increases in wages and so on, the scheme finally cost £50,000 more: would the promoting authority have to bear that?  That point is covered under Section 16.  The operative words are the percentage which the Minister for Finance shall contribute out of the moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas, that is, the percentage of the cost of the scheme.  If the scheme costs £50,000 more, it is obvious the Minister for Finance will have to pay his 80 per cent. of that.  I think that point is adequately covered in that section.</P>
      <P>It should be clear, too, that none of this will come from current revenue. It will be borrowed.  We are not operating as they do in the American budgets, which are based on current revenue; that is why they have these fantastic deficits; borrowing or the service of public debt is not included. Deputy Corry raised this point.  None of this is from current revenue.  There will be access to the Local Loans Fund. The only authority that would require permission for borrowing under this Bill would be a harbour board.</P>
      <P>Deputies Esmonde and P. O'Donnell asked what we have been doing since 1956 to prevent us from introducing this Bill.  We were doing a lot, but the main point is that we were engaged in protection schemes in the interim.  We carried out the £13,000 scheme in Wicklow in 1960-61 and we also tackled Rosslare.  We estimate that the works there, when completed, will have cost a total of £120,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give them their due, Wexford County Council have contributed over £30,000.  They have been told that this contribution will be examined and levelled off in the proportion determined by this Bill and that matter will not be lost sight of.  Since the 1956 Act lapsed, we tackled these problems at Wicklow and Rosslare, and we did some work at Bray as well.  Another <Col N="1409" /> thing we must face up to is that someone may say to us that when this Bill becomes law, we may not have the staff necessary to put it into full operation. We may be asked in that case what is the point in this legislation, which further worsens the position, so to speak.  That is a problem of which we are acutely aware.  We think that with the increased output from the four universities, and the possibility of the return of some of our engineers from abroad, we should be able to deal adequately with most of the schemes that arise.  There is also the possibility of our giving some of this work to the offices of consulting engineers, some of which have brilliant staffs too.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies envisage the possibility of our being inundated with applications from all over the country. I do not think that is likely, because I feel sure that local authorities will scrutinise very carefully all schemes submitted to them since they will be forced to pay 50 per cent of the cost of any unfinished scheme.  Deputy P. O'Donnell asked why the procedure should not be that the local authorities would send up estimates of schemes and that the Board of Works would simply check their costings.  One can see immediately the difficulties such a system would give rise to.</P>
    <P>On the question of maintenance, I should point out here that under the Arterial Drainage Act, all maintenance is carried out by the Board of Works. The same will apply under this Bill. I think that is a good thing&mdash;that the State, having expended a very large sum, by way of 80 per cent grant, towards the cost of a scheme, should recover the maintenance costs from the local authority concerned.  We have been asked why the local authority themselves would not be permitted to do the maintenance. There are several reasons.  One is that human nature being what it is&mdash;I was a member of a local authority myself &mdash;when members of a local authority would meet to strike a rate, they might be inclined to save 5d. or 6d. in the £ on such maintenance work.  The result might very well be that maintenance would suffer and that a whole scheme would suffer because of insufficient or <Col N="1410" /> inadequate maintenance.  From that point of view, the State has a duty to see that proper maintenance of such schemes is continued.  They therefore bill the local authority, who have a statutory obligation to pay.  What I have said in this respect should cover the point raised by Deputy Tully.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan mentioned the damage done at Grattan Road in Galway.  I do not think he should be too optimistic that the problem there will be solved under this Bill, because it will be obvious to anyone that it would be impossible to provide for the repair of all sorts of damage from storms, acts of God, all over the country.  I do not think anybody could seriously suggest that damage done through a sudden storm should qualify for attention under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry, who is Chairman of the Cork County Council, should realise that some of the schemes mentioned by him might well be considered as qualifying under Land Reclamation legislation, but I can assure him that if his suggestions come officially through the Cork County Council, they will be seriously considered, because, as the House will readily realise, as the area of that county council's jurisdiction extends to such places as Rathluirc, where the people would not have very much interest in tidal or coastal problems, it might not be easy for the Deputy to get the council to sponsor the proposals.</P>
    <P>Another problem was raised here. There is provision in the Bill to meet the situation where two local authorities, one perhaps urban, would possibly be affected and where one would act as the promoting body for a scheme.  Deputy Brennan mentioned the position of an urban council and I think Deputy Faulkner mentioned Dundalk and the refusal of one body to act as the promoting agent.  That is a problem and we must consider the question of permitting urban areas to initiate coast protection schemes themselves in cases where county councils might not promote them on their behalf.  Between now and Committee Stage, we shall consider what we can do in that respect.</P>

      <P>That is a possibility. I mentioned it to my people today, but if you had a substantial problem where damage was being caused to a lot of urban land running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, it would be impossible to ask these people to strike a rate for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The question of procedure was referred to time and again.  These stages in the procedure are necessary and reasonable.  I do not think Deputy P. O'Donnell was serious when he criticised what he had called the appalling amount of red tape and the number of stages.  These are important matters and could prove very costly, if they were not examined thoroughly.  The stages in the procedure are necessary to give the county councils a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they will commit themselves to what might be very heavy expenditure.  The preliminary examinations by the county council engineers could not be relied upon to produce even an approximate estimate of the cost.  The preliminary examination by the Office of Public Works will help to weed out unusually expensive schemes and some which might get in because of peculiar reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motions sometimes come from local authorities which might not come if there had been a full attendance of members at the meetings which recommended them.  Members might not have turned up for one reason or another.  Peculiar things happen and these peculiar proposals could come to us.  The House knows what I have in mind.  This proposal will prevent county councils from wasting money on schemes which are unlikely to come to fruition.  When a county council have an opportunity to examine the preliminary report of the Office of Public Works, they can then decide whether to go on with the work and then they can prepare a scheme, subject <Col N="1412" /> to the consent of the Minister.  That is the first approach to the Minister, and when the scheme is prepared, the Minister is consulted again and he then indicates the percentage of the State grant for the scheme.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies made play on the wording of the Bill, &ldquo;up to 80 per cent.&rdquo;  That is the usual phraseology in these cases.  It could happen that the local authority might not get the full 80 per cent.  Suppose the Commissioners reported that it was doubtful if a certain scheme could be fully justified on economic grounds and, at the same time, there was great pressure from the local authority.  The Minister could then say that if these people were so convinced that the scheme was fully justifiable, and he is not fully satisfied, then definitely only 60 per cent or 70 per cent of the cost would be given and if the local authority wanted to go on with it, they would have to borrow the remainder from the Local Loans Fund.  That might make them think again.  That is just an example of one of the occasions on which a smaller sum than the 80 per cent could be indicated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am sure I have left out some of the points raised by speakers, such as Deputy O'Connor and Deputy MacCarthy.  We have had representations from some of the areas mentioned by those Deputies, whether they anticipated this legislation or not.  These areas are the Maharees in Kerry and the areas mentioned by Deputy MacCarthy.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that if any Deputies have amendments which they think would be justified in the Bill, I can assure them that I will give them every consideration.  If they are at all feasible or helpful in cutting out what Deputy O'Donnell alleged was red tape, we will examine them carefully and try to have them included.</P>
