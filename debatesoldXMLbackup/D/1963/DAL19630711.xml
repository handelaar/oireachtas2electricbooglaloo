    <P>NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>Before Section 66, but in Part VII, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This part of the Act shall at the election of the society only apply in respect of profits earned subsequent to the 5th day of April, 1963 and any assessment that may be raised for the year 1963-64 shall, if the society has so elected, be raised as if the society was a new business commencing on the 6th day of April, 1963.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> The manner in which Part VII of this Bill deals with societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of 1893 is a trifle complicated. As I understand it, the effect of the Part is that in future no society will get the exemption from income tax which has heretofore obtained, unless it comes within the exceptions set out in this Part of the Bill.  I should like the Minister to confirm if I am correct in thinking that to that extent this Part of the Bill consolidates the law in relation to these societies.  If I am correct in that assumption, then we go on to the provisions in the Bill that, for the first time in the year 1963-64, the current income tax year, these societies are now to be made liable to tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister made it clear in the course of his earlier remarks that he was introducing these provisions for the purpose of stopping a loophole in his anti-avoidance measures.  That can be perfectly well understood.  I am concerned, however, to ensure that in such stopping of the loophole that existed, no damage will be done, in the first place, to genuine existing societies and, in the second place, to ensure that the ordinary arrangements operate by which any new business brought into charge for the first time is entitled to be assessed on the profits it brings into account during that first year.</P>
    <P>We shall have an opportunity at a later stage of discussing the exemptions and the societies that should be brought into the tax net properly, and particularly whether the exemptions provided for actual societies in the section and the exemptions the Minister introduces in amendment No. 45 are such as to provide that the appropriate society is truly exempted.  However, apart from that, there is the other question, that is, that where person starts a new business, that person, when he does that, is taxable for the first year when he starts in the actual capacity that first year.  If he starts a new business on 6th April in any year, he is taxable for that year on the exact profits earned in it and then, for the following year, he goes to the ordinary taxation <Col N="753" /> on the profits of the preceding year.</P>
    <P>In a partnership, for example, where there are three partners and one leaves before the end of the financial year the remaining partners have the right to decide whether they will be taxed on the profits of the preceding year or on the actual profits of the first year in which the new partnership operates.  I have, in this amendment, tried to apply by analogy the same proposals.  I do so particularly because I am worried about the effect this Part of the Bill will have on those societies which have been carrying on building activities.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that by reason of Section 6 of the Finance Act of 1935, people who develop land are assessable under that section to profits on the capitalised value of the ground rent they create.  That section was introduced because certain builders found a way out by selling the houses they had erected at their exact cost and taking their whole profit on the ground rents which they subsequently sold.  That has been the law since 1935 but if the effect of this Part of the Bill was that societies carrying on building last year were to be assessed, as a matter of mandatory provision and without choice of election, on the profits they earned last year, it would mean that they would be assessed not merely on any building profits as such but, in addition, on the capitalised value of any rents they might have created last year, even though they had disposed of them prior to 5th April last.</P>
    <P>I think the effect of that will be that virtually all the societies that were carrying on building, and particularly the societies doing speculative building, will have to be liquidated at once. They made all their arrangements last year in the belief that the operations they were carrying out were, in fact, free of tax and that they would be entitled to adjust their future arrangements and operations on that basis.</P>
    <P>Now they are being brought into the tax net.  I am making no point as to whether they should or should not be brought in but I am interested <Col N="754" /> to ensure that when they are being made liable for tax as from 6th April this year, the effect will not be to put them into liquidation.  I fear that unless there is some arrangement by which, during the current year, they can be taxed on the profits they are earning this year, after they have got due and adequate notice in the Budget, because if they are taxed on the profits they are earning and on the arrangements they made before they got that notice, the result will be to force virtually all of them into liquidation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is as aware as I am, and if he is not so aware, his advisers can readily tell him, that as well as the provident society that was in fact a family concern and was in fact solely a tax avoidance operation, there were many other societies which were operating in this way throughout the country, in not so small towns, and working on the basis of getting, sometimes through the local authority and sometimes otherwise, a site for six or eight or ten of them together.  They were getting that site and they were joining together to carry out a development plan for themselves and when that development came, they were, as a result, able to provide for their own housing needs, get the additional housing grant that is payable to a building society under the housing Acts, and borrow the balance of what they wanted by way of loans from the local authority under the Small Dwellings Act.</P>
    <P>The local authority was in the situation under the Small Dwellings Act that it could only take a first charge and therefore that meant if there was to be any development charge provided for, it had to be provided by way of a ground rent. The ground rent was sometimes done by way of a lease, a terminating lease for a period.  I know of one case where there was a terminating lease for 35 years.  There was a rent payable for 35 years to pay off the development charge and at the end of that time, the lease remained there but it was a lease at 1d. a year.  It was, if you like, a device for the purpose of enabling the local authority to provide, on a small dwellings loan, the balance of the money which the purchaser or member <Col N="755" /> of the society wanted to put up for the erection of his house.</P>
    <P>As I see it, unless some arrangement is made in this Part of the Act to ensure that the people who got together in a society and did that type of operation, are taxed on the profits of this year, not on the profits of last year, it will mean utter chaos and confusion and I fear it will mean for the tailend of the couple or so people developing in that scheme, whose leases may not have been created, serious financial loss.  I want to stress to the Minister that the proposal I make involves no loss to the Revenue, unless it is a fortuitous loss.  I am not suggesting in any way that the societies concerned should be freed of income tax for any year.  The Minister has decreed, and I am not arguing about it, that as from 6th April last, any society other than an exempted society&mdash;and roughly, I would call an exempted society an agricultural society&mdash;shall be liable to tax.  As I understand the provisions of this Part, if the Minister does not accept an amendment somewhat on the lines I have introduced, these societies will for this year be liable to income tax in 1963/64 on the profits they earn in 1962/63 and in 1964/65 will be liable for the profits they earn in 1963/64, and so on.</P>
    <P>Under my proposal, exactly the same situation would arise as arises in respect of any new business&mdash;for 1963/64, they will be liable for tax in respect of profits earned during 1963/64 and in 1964/65, they will be similarly liable for the profits they will earn in 1963/64.  In other words, the profits earned during this coming year will be the basis of assessment by the Revenue on that society for two years and the only loss, if one could call it that, would be the fortuitous loss that might arise if this year's profits were in fact less than last year's.  Even if that were so, I would think that the Revenue should not gain that extra tax, first of all, because these people are a new business coming into the tax net and secondly, people are entitled to expect to be able to plan their affairs on the basis of the law in existence at any one time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> I could understand it better, although I might not agree with the proposal in the Bill as such, if it were something that had been liable to tax always and if a person with a good knowledge of the tax laws had found a way around.  That is not the case. Industrial and provident societies have never been liable to tax so far as I am aware&mdash;certainly never in the past 20 years or so.  They are being brought into the tax net now and there seems to be no reason why they should not be treated in exactly the same way as any other new business is treated when it is brought into the tax net.</P>
    <P>Let me go back on an analogy again for the Minister, for although I may be sarcastic about other matters at times, this is a matter which is very technical and it is understandably difficult for him to follow it.  If you have a firm carrying on any business, say, a solicitor's business, and there are four partners in that firm, they make up their accounts every year to 5th April, the last day of the income tax year, and on 4th April, 1963, one of those four partners dies.  The other three will, of course, be liable, properly, for tax and then this new firm starts off the new income tax year. They have the right, and properly the right, to say whether they are going to be deemed to be a continuation of the old firm or whether they are going to be treated as a new firm and be taxed on their actual profits.  It is exactly the same suggestion I am making in this amendment.  May I just add that the amendment is far from perfectly drafted?  It would take a very long draft to put it in its exact form but it is drafted in such a way as to make it clear to the Minister and his advisers what is its purpose.</P>
    <P>Let me take another example.  Supposing three persons : Messrs. A, B and C go out today to start a new business, a motor garage business, shall we say?  They will be taxed for their first full year on the actual profits earned in that year and it will not be until after they have gone through a full year's trading that they will be taxed, as all of us are taxed, on the profits of the preceding year.  These <Col N="757" /> societies, for the purposes of income tax, are new businesses and should be treated as such for taxation purposes, and unless there is an amendment of the Bill of the nature of this amendment, they will not be so treated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to say whether the Deputy's amendment is properly drafted or not but I know what its purpose is.  We accept that its purpose is to require us to give a society the option to take last year's profit or this year's profit, as they elect. If the amendment applies, as it appears to, to agricultural societies, it is unnecessary. The other societies we had in mind when drafting the Bill were societies formed with the object of avoiding tax.  A very good example indeed was the one quoted by the Deputy of a building society, where a speculative builder formed a co-operative society and where the person for whom a house was built became a member but surrendered his share when the house was completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them do not surrender their shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It happened in some cases.  It is a very obvious method of trying to avoid income tax and the society mentioned by the Deputy could hardly have been formed for any other purpose.  This provision was brought in to stop that particular form of tax avoidance.  That being so, I cannot see that there is any great complaint against the Government for bringing in the Bill in this form&mdash; treating the society as a continuing body as far as income tax is concerned. By treating it as a continuing body, income tax will be charged this year on the basis of profits earned last year. I am not convinced the Deputy has made a case for changing that.  Therefore, we should leave the Bill as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no quarrel with the Minister if the only people hit by this were the people who deliberately formed a provident society for the purpose of a development, themselves taking all the profits, but as well as hitting them, the Minister will hit the people who come together <Col N="758" /> to do their own work by means of a society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In such a case, I cannot see that there would be big profits because the object of such a group would be to provide themselves with houses as cheaply as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but because of the provisions of Section 6 of the Finance Act of 1935, the ground rent would be capitalised.  That is not a factual profit.  If there were only the profit on the sale of the houses, there would not be any substantial assessment because such a group would naturally give themselves the houses as cheaply as possible, to use the Minister's phrase, but, as a device to get round the difficulty of having to provide in some shape or other for their development costs and still be able to give a first charge to the local authority under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, they would have to do that and that is the way they in fact do it.  If the Minister is adamant on this, I do not think I will get any further, but I submit he will find that in hitting the guilty, he will also hit the innocent.</P>

Do we start with them on 6th April, 1962, or whatever the accounting date was before they became liable?  There were allowances back before then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will commence from now, of course&mdash;from 5th April this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I think.  Therefore, it is not at any time. Is it not the situation that the owner of a company who had a capital allowance available to him which may not fully be expended, so to speak, for tax purposes on 5th April, 1962, could <Col N="760" /> have his accounts for the year starting on 6th April, 1962, influenced by that capital allowance of the preceding year?  If that is the case, then the society should be in the position of being equally able to do so and he should be treated as if he could have got credit for the capital allowances against his profit and loss account of last year where he is taxed on the profits of last year.  Surely any capital allowance that arises in respect of any period for the profits of which he is now being assessed should be taken into account?  Would it not therefore be capital allowance in respect of any expenditure as from 6th April, 1962?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), page 41, to delete &ldquo;or balancing charge&rdquo; in line 42 and &ldquo;and balancing charge&rdquo; in line 54. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Paragraph (c) of subsection (4) of Section 67 deals with the case of a co-operative society which has incurred capital expenditure on the purchase of patent rights.  The paragraph states that any annual allowance or balancing charge in respect of the expenditure which might have been made on the society <Col N="761" /> for 1962-63 or any previous year, but for the fact that the society was exempt from income tax, is to be taken into account in calculating balancing allowances or balancing charges for 1963-64 or any subsequent year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand, and perhaps the Minister would explain to me, why it was put in and why it is now being taken out.  What is the difference?  That is what worries me : what is the difference? It seems to me it should have been in and should still be in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference to a balancing charge for 1962-63 or any earlier year is unnecessary since such charge could only arise on the disposal of the patent rights and if they have been disposed of prior to 1963-64 they would not be affected by the present subsection.  The reference to balancing charge is therefore being deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On that analogy, if the patent rights were disposed of before 5th April, 1963, they would not be assessable?  Is that not what the Minister said?</P>

      <P>The disposal of them would not be assessable.  On the same analogy, why should the ground rents created before 6th April, 1963, be assessable?  Surely, what is sauce for one is sauce for the other?  If the effect is&mdash;and I think the Minister is right&mdash;that the deletion of the balancing charge does clear any patent rights assigned before 5th April last why, if that is so, is the position not the same in respect of the creation of leases?  I confess frankly I know very little about patent rights.  Perhaps my colleague opposite knows more about them.  My knowledge in relation to patents could be put on the half-farthing coin with which Deputy Sherwin wants to work the turnover tax.  Is it not a fact that what is sauce for one should be sauce for the other?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is treated as a discount. Subsection (2) brings co-operative societies into the ordinary income tax code in respect of expenses of management.  Subsection (3) deals with the point we have already discussed of charging income tax for 1963-64 on the profits for the year ending 6th April, 1963.  Subsection (4) deals again with the question of capital allowances, which we have dealt with as best we can.  Subsection (5) authorises charging for 1963-64 income normally charged by deduction as being paid in full to co-operative societies because of exemptions hitherto in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That was more or less as I thought.  Might I come back again to subsection (4) (a).  This says:</P>
      <P>Where for the year 1962-63 a society was entitled to exemption from tax in respect of the profits of a trade carried on by it&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) no capital allowance in respect of any property used for the purposes of the trade shall be carried forward from the year 1962-63, and... </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are already carrying forward the profit earned in 1962-63.  Should we not carry forward the capital <Col N="764" /> allowance in respect of things that happened in that year when we are taxing the people concerned in respect of the profits that arose in that year? Take the simplest example of all.  A society has its accounting date on 5th April in any year.  Say it starts its accounts on 6th April, 1962.  It does certain building in that year.  It is assessed to profits in respect of all it earned in that year.  It is paying as if it were an ordinary company and not a society.  Why should it not get the allowance in respect of what it did in that year when it is getting the &ldquo;knock&rdquo; for what it made in respect of that year?  As I understand subsection (4) (a), that is the situation.  It is being brought in for the &ldquo;knock&rdquo; and it is not getting the reduction the capital allowance would give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The society will get the allowance for 1963-64.  In the case of initial allowances, the computation will be by reference to expenditure in 1962-63.</P>

    <P>(e)  Where a certificate is revoked under the foregoing paragraph, notice of the revocation shall be published as soon as may be in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>(3)  Where, in the case of a trade carried on by a society, the transactions in any year or period for which the accounts of the society are made up, being a year or period throughout which the society was an agricultural society or a fishery society, include exempted transactions, so much of the profits or gains or the loss (as the case may be) of that year or period (computed in accordance with the provisions, other than this section, applicable to Case I of Schedule D) as is attributable to the exempted transactions shall be disregarded for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts.</P>
    <P>(4)  In relation to any trade, the amount of the profits or gains or loss attributable to the exempted transactions of any year or period <Col N="769" /> shall be taken to be the amount which bears to the full amount of the profits or gains or, as the case may be, the full amount of the loss for the year or period the same proportion as the aggregate of the amounts receivable by the society, by virtue of those transactions, from the sale of goods or the provision of services bears to the aggregate of all amounts receivable by the society, by virtue of transactions in the year or period from the sale of goods or the provision of services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am dealing with amendments No. 46 and No. 47 with this.  The simple explanation for these rather lengthy amendments is that it was almost impossible to define what would be regarded as a genuine co-operative society to which relief should be given, to make it wide enough to include all and, at the same time, to make it restrictive enough to exclude what we would regard as speculative societies or societies formed for the purpose of avoiding tax.  We put in certain things like costings of milk and insemination centres, which it was unlikely could be used in order to avoid tax.  Other activities were suggested by various people.</P>
    <P>In the end, I came to the conclusion that there would have to be some form under which societies of a certain class could be admitted from time to time. The best solution I could find was to provide that if the Minister for Agriculture recommended a certain class of society that should be included for exemption and if I agreed, then it could be scheduled as eligible for exemption from tax.  In the case of fisheries, it would be the Minister for Lands who would make the recommendation. I do not think it is necessary to say any more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said &ldquo;a certain class of society&rdquo;.  Surely the amendment refers to &ldquo;a certain society&rdquo;.  It is the individual society that must be included under subsection 2 (a)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that.  I asked the draftsman to give me &ldquo;certain classes of societies&rdquo; but evidently he found it <Col N="770" /> inadvisable or perhaps impossible to word it in that way.  I think it is fairly obvious, to take an example of a vegetable processing co-operative which is one of those we had in mind, that a society falling within that classification would qualify for exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to go back to the draftsman on that point.  It is a bad principle, and I think the Minister will agree readily in this, that he should have the right to exempt any particular taxpayer from tax.  I can understand the difficulty in certain respects but I think it could be met within a class.  If the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance of the time found that a particular society was a genuine case and was not included in the definitions, they would add to the definitions or regulations.</P>
      <P>It is a very bad principle to provide that a particular taxpayer should be exempted by a Minister from the general tax laws.  The tax laws must be worked on the basis that whatever applies to one class of person is operative for every member of that class. Even if it meant that the class of society had to be varied from time to time, it must be done in such a way that everyone knows that if society X is excluded and I carry on exactly the same business as that society in exactly the same way, I am equally entitled to exemption.  I do not think the Minister would disagree on that.  The Revenue Commissioners should deal with the individual liability of taxpayers within a general scheme and it is most undesirable that the Minister or any Minister in any Government should be brought into the individual liability of the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty was that I could not get a definition covering societies we think should be admitted. Creameries are easy to deal with as they are covered by the Dairy Produce Acts.  They will be genuinely co-operative, as otherwise they are not eligible at all.  Other societies are mentioned but it is not likely that you will have one of those promoted for big profit-making.  I think they are safe enough.  I could not get a definition <Col N="771" /> that would admit the societies we think should be admitted and exclude those we think should be excluded.  It will be equally impossible for the Minister for Agriculture and myself to give a definition of the classes that should be admitted but it is fairly obvious that where the Minister for Agriculture says that such a society, because it is processing, say, vegetable and has so many members, is eligible, then every society of that kind will be admitted.</P>
      <P>We are at a disadvantage here in that we are not as well equipped as other countries where the registrar of societies has certain discretion.  Here, the registrar has no power to remove the name of a society.  He automatically registers.  If the registrar had discretion, we might be able to make use of that.  I agree it is wrong that a Minister or two Ministers could say that they could exempt such-and-such a society from tax, but I see no way around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister could provide in subsection (2) (a) that &ldquo;The Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture, give a certificate entitling a society&rdquo; which complies with certain specified conditions....  Then it is not an individual society; it is any class of society that complies with some specified conditions.  I can see the Minister's difficulty in defining them now but the definition should be by way of a general class and from time to time.  The certificate can be one entitling any society to be treated for the purposes of the section as an agricultural society if it complies with certain specified conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, the Minister has in mind certain conditions at the moment but it might be desirable to expand them at a later stage.  I am not suggesting all the conditions must be specified now but I think the taxpayer&mdash;and a society is a taxpayer now&mdash;should only get exemption because it qualifies as a member of a class rather than because it qualifies as&mdash;I do not mean this in an offensive way&mdash;an object of the bounty of the Minister. The Minister says he entirely agrees with that principle.  I do not see <Col N="772" /> why you do not provide in the Bill that the certificate is for a class of society complying with certain specified conditions and give power to vary the conditions from time to time, to add new classes and so on, and so maintain the principle and at the same time, do what you want to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the real difficulty, as the Deputy realises.  If we give a certificate because a society is complying with certain conditions in regard to the number of members, type of production and processing, our experience is that no matter how well you define those conditions, tax evaders will take advantage of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They are cleverer? I think you could do it all the same. If you had a society processing raspberries, say, with 77 members and a capital of £50,000, you can cover it very well by saying : &ldquo;A society which processes raspberries by the so-and-so method and which has not less than 75 members and a capital of not less than £50,000.&rdquo;  The definition can be made to suit the individual case but the principle is still preserved.  Would the Minister have a look at that before Report Stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Sweetman in his urging of the Minister to endeavour to find a way around this problem of defining the class of society.  There is a difficult problem there but it can be overcome and the Minister does agree with the principle involved.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to subsection (1) (a), the provision which requires that for a society to be an agricultural society, the number of members must be not less than 50.  The subsequent definition of fishery society provides for a number <Col N="773" /> of not less than 20, and it does seem to me that there can be and almost certainly is a number of genuine agricultural societies in the sense that the Minister means it in which the number would be less than 50.  Perhaps the Minister would consider altering that to 20 as in the case of the fishery society?  There is also the point that it is a very common practice to have one industrial provident society as holder of shares in another and there are some societies in which the majority of the society members could be in other societies. I am wondering, if that is so, would such a society qualify under the definition in subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Colley that there may be a genuine agricultural society with less than 50 members is covered in subsection (2) (a) (i) which provides that where the number of the society's members is less than 50, the Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture, give a certificate.  Therefore, that difficulty could be overcome.  I do not know the situation in regard to the other point raised by the Deputy, of a provident society which has shares in another provident society.  I do not know of a case of that kind and I cannot say how it might stand.  However, the societies I have in mind here are agricultural societies and fishery societies and I can hardly imagine such a case arising.</P>

      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the provision about the number 20 in regard to fishery societies.  There are only about five important fishing ports in the country and in fact if you examine it properly, you find there are really only about three.  There are many small ports which would not have the required number of fishermen.  Fishermen are of such a type that it is very hard for them to get together, even on a co-operative basis.  They have done it in a few places but in the smaller ports, there might be only three or four boats of any account going into them and the men in the smaller boats might not join up.  It is very important the <Col N="774" /> Minister should have power to allow a very small number to form a society in a small fishing port.</P>

      <P>I cannot tell the Deputy what great objection there was to specifying them but what I had in mind was the great difficulty of defining the type of society that should qualify in respect of fruit and vegetables. As the Deputy knows a company in this country is going into the fruit and vegetable business in a very big way.  We have to be very sure about the relationship of a co-operative society with that company if they were to supply that company with their products.</P>

It seems to me the two would run on exactly parallel lines.  I cannot see any reason at all for putting in anything outside the Dairy Produce Acts and excluding other well-known items of agricultural produce.  Milk, cream, butter and cheese may all be defined in the Dairy Produce Acts.  I am not certain whether they are, but there is a possibility that they are in the definition.

Paragraph (a) (ii) provides &ldquo;that all or a majority of the society's members are persons who are mainly engaged in, and derive the principal part of their income from, husbandry&rdquo;. It is quite a common arrangement when a genuine agricultural society is starting in an area, that having regard to the limitation in the Industrial and Provident Society Act, 1893, and when they are canvassing for subscriptions&mdash; I am thinking of one that started in my constituency&mdash;they ask the farmers when they are taking shares to take some in the wife's name so as not to break the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, they would be in trouble under this paragraph.  Under the paragraph, you cannot consider the farmer's wife or his children.  It has been suggested to me that you could bring in the schoolteacher or <Col N="778" /> other people who are interested in forming a society in the locality.  You could bring them in, but you should bring them in as a minority.  They could not be allowed to have a majority.  It would be too easy to provide a loophole.  It seems to me that to provide &ldquo;that all or a majority of the society's members are persons who are mainly engaged in, and derive the principal part of their income from, husbandry&rdquo; excludes the wife and the child who is living at home.</P>

Is it open to the Revenue Commissioners, on the passing of this Act, to say: &ldquo;You failed last June to comply with a precept and produce a document and this makes you subject to the penalties set out in Section 72&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be offensive but there was a time when the Minister for Finance, when introducing sections of this kind, felt he had an obligation to inform the House that the Department of Finance found themselves confronted with a difficulty, that certain people conformed with <Col N="788" /> normal procedures but certain people had initiated new procedures designed to avoid the intended purpose of the law, and then to give us a short outline of the device employed and to say that this section is designed to prevent this activity and to bring everyone within the scope of the law as originally designed. I notice with some alarm the tendency on the part of the Minister to say: &ldquo;This is Section 72, and I move&rdquo;.  Then, we are all meant to say: &ldquo;Agreed&rdquo;.  But I still feel that Dáil Eireann is entitled to know the purpose of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Majority Report of the Income Taxation Commission referred to this in paragraph 291 and the underlying principle of the Commission's report is accepted and enshrined in the section.  The idea is that these new penalties should supplant the old system of penalties and do so in a much more intelligent and rational manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point about it is that existing penalties which fraud or negligence attract are dealt with on the basis of multiples of the tax payable, whereas these new penalties are specific penalties related to the fraudulent returns made by taxpayers as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 73 starts off by saying &ldquo;persons who fraudulently or negligently&rdquo;.  The penalty is £100 and the amount in cases of fraud is double that.  The recommendation in paragraph 291 of the Commission's report is, as the Minister has correctly stated, that the penalties should have reference to the mistake made rather than to the taxpayer's total income. The effect, however, of the Commission's report in subparagraph (c) is to provide that where the Revenue Commissioners require this arrangement in respect of trifling cases of negligence, <Col N="789" /> there is a right of appeal against all penalties.  I should like to have it indicated to me where is the right of appeal against all penalties in Part VIII of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the report for graduating penalties according to the gravity of the tax offence.  The report says it should be practicable to distinguish broadly between (1), fraud, (2), wilful negligence not involving fraud, (3), habitual carelessness or inaccuracy in tax returns, or merely technical offences.  Now this section starts off with the words &ldquo;fraudulently or negligently&rdquo;.  It does distinguish the amount of the difference for fraud but it does not say it is to cover the case of wilful negligence, which is what the Commission recommended.  Section 73 now covers any type of negligence.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the Commission's report in his hand and I should be obliged if he would turn to page 9, subparagraph (e).  I admit fraud has been dealt with by the doubling of the penalty.  Wilful negligence has not, however, because it is treated in the same way as ordinary negligence.  The report says the State should not have the right to seek alternative penalties in respect of any one offence.  Is it clear here that the State has not got the right to seek alternative penalties in</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Bill does not carry out the Commission's recommendation in that respect.  Does the Minister not agree that at least the Dáil should have been so informed when the section was being put before us?  Was it put before us on the basis that it was carrying out the recommendations of the Commission?  If it was not, the House should have been so informed because otherwise it is going very near to sharp practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, this is a similar <Col N="790" /> approach to this Part of the Bill in so far as the Commission on Income Taxation report is concerned.  The same report referred to purchase tax. It suggested there should be a purchase tax for the purpose of relieving income tax, and one percipient member of the Commission added a reservation saying he opposed purchase tax generally, on the ground that there was not the slightest prospect of its being used as a substitute for income tax or any part of it.  The Government then said that, for the purpose of relieving income tax contributors, there should be a universal turnover tax, which would raise £10¼ million in addition.  Now we come to a series of new penalties and we are told by the Minister for Justice&mdash;who incidentally is assuming the role of Pooh-Bah in our legislature now: he now appears before us in the roles of Minister for Justice, shadow Minister for Finance and heir-apparent to the position of Taoiseach ; I wonder what other offices he will acquire in the course of the Recess, but I see Deputy Dolan looking quite anxious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Therefore, I feel it is up to us legislators to prescribe that the remedies available to them will be adequate but not excessive, lest in their excess of zeal they would go further than we would wish them to go.  We are providing them now with new penalties for what the Minister assures me are new statutory offences.  I am not yet clear in mind as to whether in respect of these offences the Revenue Commissioners retain the right to obtain multiplication of their original claims.</P>

      <P>I think the position is this.  With regard to a number of offences which exist in the income tax code, these offences are being wiped out and, at it were, re-enacted in a different form in this series of sections, with new penalties set out in regard to them.  To that extent, a number of existing sections, and so on, in the code are being repealed and replaced. Side by side with that process, as it were, there are still offences existing in the code which are not being touched and which will still continue to attract the penalties which they attract at the moment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister really must realise that the whole of Ireland does not revolve around the city of Dublin.  Any Deputy will tell you that people in the country will ask you to act as executor of their estate, and frequently do.  It is a common thing, if an old person has family complications, for him to go to an outside person, whom he trusts, to administer his estate, in order that all sections of the family for whom he has made provision are equitably treated.  Executors are not always large firms of probate solicitors, accountants and so forth, familiar with all the business affairs of their clients.</P>
      <P>What appals me at first glance at this is how do we pass legislation entitling the Revenue Commissioners to proceed against a person for an offence committed by a deceased person, of which the executor or personal representative may have no knowledge at all?  How can you place an obligation upon a person to come into court and defend himself or his trust&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us pause a moment, please.  I approach this from the point of view of an ordinary citizen.  If I accept the duty of being the executor of a will, I there and then become the trustee for the beneficiaries of the estate.  I am obliged to defend my trust to the best of my ability.  Proceedings are brought against me in my capacity as trustee by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of an offence <Col N="796" /> committed by the deceased person. They say the deceased person failed to conform with precepts under Section 72 and failed to produce documents which he had a statutory duty to produce.  I come forward as the personal representative and say I never heard of it, that I do not know what documents they are talking about.  I tell them I have never seen any copy of the alleged letter they sent to the deceased, whereupon the Revenue Commissioners produce copies of correspondence. I say: &ldquo;That may or may not be true, but do you expect me to come to court and defend myself against a charge relating to the action of somebody dead and buried of which I have no knowledge at all?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply is that that is just too bad for you, that the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to proceed against you and, if they prove their case, to recover penalties from the funds of the trustee for the beneficiaries. That seems to me to be putting the personal representative in a perfectly hopeless position.  It seems to offend against a very elementary principle of justice, that is, that you should not be asked to argue the defence in a matter of which you have no knowledge at all.  You are the trustee or representative of the deceased person.  Allegations are made against the deceased person of which you know nothing.  The only evidence you have is such evidence as is produced by the prosecutor.  I have never heard of anybody being asked to stand his trial on the basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection at all to giving the Revenue Commissioners the right to recover from the estate penalties awarded against a deceased <Col N="798" /> person before his death.  The deceased person was there at the time to clear himself and to go to court and make his case.  If the court decides against him, I am prepared to say: &ldquo;Let the Revenue Commissioner recover.&rdquo; But where the person is dead and there is nobody to defend&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put this case.  Say you have a substantial merchant in Ballaghaderreen who dies. When the personal representative comes along to administer the estate, he discovers there is accumulated cash, which obviously represents undisclosed profits, of £50,000.  Surely it would be absurd to suggest that the Revenue Commissioners should not be able to proceed against that estate and collect the penalty the deceased person incurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be a very sensible and reasonable proposition. But I do not think it is that at all. It comes to light that this person has assets of £100,000.  The Revenue Commissioners in their experience say that fellow could not have more than £15,000 out of his income tax returns over the past 25 years.  I suggest the Revenue Commissioners have their remedy.  They have estate duties, succession duties and legacy duties.  By the time they have finished with them. they will have collected a very substantial amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argued that on an earlier section when we were determining that we ought to be able to order every bank to produce every man's deposit account to the Revenue Commissioners. I argued that, if you argue that this is simply designed to prevent avoidance of income tax, the case is unanswerable, but you must realise you are tearing down the whole vast structure of confidence existing between banks and their customers in order to remedy an evil for which, in fact, there is in existence a remedy, that is, estate duty, succession duty and legacy duty.  I put it to the Minister that in the case he envisages the Revenue Commissioners have their remedy.  I believe they will get out of the estate substantially the same sum as if they were to proceed against him <Col N="799" /> for inadequate income tax payment in the past and then levy estate duty on the remainder.</P>
    <P>I believe the Revenue Commissioners would be better advised to say: &ldquo;This is a cute operator, but he has fallen into our hands in God's good time, and what we did not get from him in his lifetime, we will get from him now.&rdquo;  If you take the penalties and income tax off the estate and levy succession duty and estate duty on the balance and simply say: &ldquo;This is a cute operator, but he has fallen into our hands now,&rdquo; would the differential be very great.  I doubt it.  When the washing is done, you would find the Revenue Commissioners would have lost very little.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be no assets.  It might be a question of the Revenue Commissioners penalty versus some other creditors of the estate.  It is not simply a question of getting estate duty instead of income tax and penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most extraordinary case.  According to the Minister, we are dealing with a man who has been plundering the Revenue Commissioners for 25 years and who has accumulated a vast store of savings through improper income tax returns but who turns out on investigation to be a bankrupt. He has not a penny and far from dealing with a wealthy defrauder, you are dealing with an impecunious person.  You cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no estate duty under £5,000 for the net value of the estate.  That is a fair sum to salt away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see the Revenue Commissioners holding up their hands in holy horror when some venerable citizen passes away with £5,000 salted away after a lifetime.  That represents £1,600 in pre-war money. A sum of £5,000 after a lifetime is not likely to excite the Revenue Commissioners. <Col N="800" /> We cannot have it both ways; either a man has accumulated a large sum through defrauding the Revenue or when his estate is cleared up, he has nothing and in fact owes more than he has and the Revenue Commissioners are in desperate competition with his creditors and will tell his relatives that they will get nothing.  These two cases are not reconciled.  I presume this section is directed at the estate of persons that the Revenue Commissioners feel have effectively defrauded them over the years and accumulated, as a result of fraud, substantial assets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In practically all, sufficient to justify my analogy.  We have exactly the same situation here. A taxpayer for some reason, presumably defrauding the Revenue, incurs a penalty and what we are stipulating is that after his death that penalty <Col N="801" /> should be capable of being procured from his estate.  I think that is valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no correct analogy.  These are subtle distinctions but important.  We create a statutory offence&mdash;failing to make returns or produce a document, for instance. There is no analogy in commonsense between a statutory offence of failing to make a return and knocking a man down with a car and crippling him, or setting a house on fire or anything which comes within the definition of tort.  There is a sound principle that when a man dies, the remedy against him for his tort dies with him.  That must be founded on the proposition that as he is dead, no court can effectively hear the issue properly argued in the absence of the tortfeasor.  That has been qualified by statute in order to remove the hardships that have arisen from the rigid application of the principle of the law.</P>
      <P>In so far as we have departed from that principle by statute, we have done it with our eyes wide open for good reason.  Now we are asked to depart further from that principle and to make a personal representative a contestant in a suit started for the purpose of establishing that a statutory offence has been committed by a deceased person, although the personal representative who is the defendant in this matter says in court that he never heard of it and does not know what they are talking about; that they have produced a file of papers which they allege contain a lot of correspondence they had with the deceased person.  He says he is not in a position to help the court at all.  Is that a desirable situation to create?  Is it not more desirable to say that if the Revenue Commissioners detect any offence and prosecute anybody the penalty attaching will attach to his estate but if he dies, he is dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asks: what are we to do if, as a result of his failure to provide these documents, he has succeeded in accumulating £50,000 that he should have paid in income tax during his life?  My answer is that you are going to get it now.  You will get the substance of it now but you are creating a statutory obligation on the <Col N="802" /> personal representative to defend a deceased person against accusations of which the personal representative has no knowledge.  That seems to be a fantastic statutory provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of the person who is dead and the tax liability to which that man would have been assessed during his lifetime if there had been full and proper disclosure. As Deputy Dillon puts it, I have a drop of previous years' blood in me and I feel personally that the estate should bear that liability.  However, this section does not deal with that liability.  This section deals with a penalty in addition to the liability and in relation to that penalty, there are two different possible sets of circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather Deputy Sweetman is not concerned with the case where the proceedings were commenced before death?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to argue the case where the proceedings have been terminated and where the court has fixed the penalty, but where proceedings have not been commenced or where, having been commenced, they have not been brought to a close, and therefore the court has not pronounced that the penalty should be payable, if I have correctly understood this penalty section, until the court comes to determine that the penalties are to be imposed, it is open to the person concerned to have lodged the defence that he was right, and the reasonable subsection we discussed a moment ago is open to him as a defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether the proceedings have been started or not, as long as they have not come to a conclusion, it appears to me that it would be wrong to have any penalties imposed as well as the tax properly payable.  So far as the penalties are concerned, the man has suffered enough penalty.  He has gone to his reward.  The purpose of the penalty is to ensure that a person is not going to defraud the Revenue Commissioners.  Nobody is going to defraud the Revenue Commissioners knowing that if he does defraud them, <Col N="803" /> it will have the effect of killing himself. The odd case of suicide of that sort is not worth making a general law for.</P>
    <P>What happens?  The case comes on to court.  As Deputy Dillon has stated, the personal representative has in fact absolutely no means of assessing proof whether it is a case that deserves a penalty or whether it does not.  If there is a substantial fund there, then the Minister's case is that it should be met out of that fund.  I am not a bit happy that subsection (1) of this section does exclude personal liability by the personal representatives as well.  It says it is to be a debt due from the estate. I agree, but it does not say it is to be a debt due from the estate to the exclusion of the liability of the person sued as personal representative.  The ordinary law in that case is that the personal representative is liable but with certain rights over; I am not a bit happy about that.</P>
    <P>I am equally most unhappy about the case the Minister has mentioned, where there is a deficiency of assets to meet all the creditors.  If there is a deficiency of assets, I accept the right of the Revenue Commissioners to a preferential claim in respect of the tax that would have been properly due but I think it would be all wrong for the Revenue to have a preferential claim in respect of penalties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no preference for penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister was wrong a second ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong that the Revenue should even rank as creditors for penalty.  It is wrong that they should rank for penalty to the reduction of dividends of any other creditor because the matter of penalty is virtually impossible to prove when the man has gone on.  I am perfectly prepared to accept that, subject to proper protection of the personal representatives, the estate of the deceased person, and only the estate of the deceased person, should be liable for the tax <Col N="804" /> properly due, but it is all wrong when a man has died that the question of penalty should be still pursued because nobody can really tell what the facts were.  Very often there are facts which the man himself would be able to explain to a court, for instance, that he had left things completely to an adviser.  There are good and bad advisers and the adviser might have made a complete misrepresentation of the position, might have fraudulently put in returns.  I know in law the taxpayer remains responsible for the fraud but it is a matter that the court would take into account as being reasonable and if the man is there, he is able to show it.  If he has gone, he is not able to do so.  For the very odd case in which the Revenue will be able to pursue the estate of a deceased person for penalties beyond his grave, it is not worth the candle, with the risk it runs of doing an injustice.</P>

In computing profit for assessing Schedule D tax, the taxpayer is entitled to charge up the value, namely, the amount of the assessment of Schedule A income tax.  Will the Minister agree that, in effect, there is no net revenue out of Schedule A tax by reason of the fact that there is an equivalent set off against Schedule D tax?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 54:</P>
      <P>To delete subsections (3) and (4) and substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) The foregoing subsections of this section shall have and be deemed always to have had effect as on and from the 1st day of October, 1926, and accordingly no section 7 certificate issued during the period which began on that day and ended on the passing of this Act shall be or ever have been made void or in any way prejudiced by the addition to the sum thereby certified to be in default of any fees or expenses which might lawfully have been so added if those subsections had been in force during that period, and no levy during that period of any such fees or expenses so added which would have been a lawful levy if those subsections had been in force during that period shall be or ever have been unlawful.</P>
      <P>(b) For the purposes of this subsection, the reference in subsection</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> (2)  of this section to a sheriff shall be construed as including a reference to an undersheriff and, in relation to section 7 certificates issued before the 8th day of December, 1953, the references therein to six hundred pounds shall be construed as references to three hundred pounds and the references therein to fifty pounds shall be construed as references to twenty-five pounds. </P>
    <P>(4)  No section 7 certificate issued before the 1st day of October, 1926, shall be or ever have been made void or in any way prejudiced by the addition to the sum thereby certified to be in default of any fees which might lawfully have been so added if the certificate had been an execution order, and no levy before the passing of this Act of any such fees so added which would have been a lawful levy if the section 7 certificate had been an execution order shall be or ever have been unlawful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this amendment is to validate the recovery of fees.  This amendment purports to substitute two new subsections in the section.  They are partly drafting amendments.  They deal with the execution of judgments by the sheriff in relation to the recovery of income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax.  They establish beyond doubt that the county registrar or the sheriff, when executing a Section 7 certificate, is acting as if that certificate were an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Really this explanation by the Minister is scarcely adequate.  This subsection which it is proposed to insert in the Finance Act operates to be deemed &ldquo;always to have had effect as on and from the 1st day of October, 1926, and accordingly no Section 7 certificate issued during the period which began on that day&rdquo;&mdash;that day is now 37 years ago &mdash;&ldquo;and ended on the passing of this Act shall be or ever have been made void or in any way prejudiced by the addition to the sum thereby certified to be in default of any fees or expenses which might lawfully have been so added if those subsections had been <Col N="810" /> in force during that period, and no levy during that period of any such fees or expenses so added which would have been a lawful levy if those subsections had been in force during that period shall be or ever have been unlawful.&rdquo; We are, in fact, legislating here retrospectively to cover a number of acts by the Revenue Commissioners during the past 37 years.</P>
      <P>I suppose some doubt has arisen in regard to certain levies made during that period and I think the Minister owes it to us to tell us more explicitly what his problem is.  Have proceedings been started against the Revenue Commissioners in respect of some previous levy or has there been some flaw in the law under which certain levies have been made which it is now sought to put right?  Manifestly, inasmuch as this is retrospective for 37 years, there is some explanation due.</P>

No one has brought any action against the Revenue Commissioners for issuing a wrong order and this is merely to establish that the law is as set out here and also to say that it has always been so.

These may or may not be significant amendments.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the First Schedule be the First Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the First Schedule, the Minister, when dealing with the amendment, referred&mdash;I think he was looking at the wrong subsection&mdash;to sales in bulk of earth, stone gravel and sand when Deputy Sweetman was talking about sales in bulk.  What I want clarified is what does &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; mean in regard to seeds, fertilisers and animal feeding stuffs?  The Minister says that he intends to determine that one cwt. of fertiliser is a bulk purchase but any lesser purchase would not qualify.  I regard this sales tax as being a fantastic arrangement in respect of the normal trade of this country but does the Minister realise what he is doing?  How are you going to differentiate for the people in rural Ireland between sales of fertiliser in bulk as defined by him and sales not in bulk?  Suppose a man comes in and buys 10 cwt. of super, or four bags of fertiliser, that is, 8 cwt. of fertiliser, and comes back a week later and says he wants three stone of fertiliser to finish a ridge of potatoes.</P>
      <P>Is it seriously suggested that any honest merchant can distinguish between sales in bulk and in smaller lots of fertilisers for any one day during the manure season&mdash;between sales to a man who buys by the bag lot and the man who buys by the broken lot? It is absolute nonsense.  It could not be done.  Is it seriously suggested that a merchant dealing in animal feeding stuffs will segregate at the end of the day his cash and credit sales in respect of meal sold by the cwt. and meal sold by the stone or two-stone parcel? The thing simply could not be done. It does not make sense; it is not practicable, no matter how conscientious or careful a merchant might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You would have at the end of the day in respect of a dozen sales of pollard, say, or bran or pigmeal, four categories of transaction to enter.  You would have your credit sales in bulk, your cash sales in bulk, neither of which would be subject to turnover tax; you have your credit sales of lesser quantities and cash sales of lesser quantities.  The thing is fantastic.  You can include your sales of fertiliser or feeding stuffs or exclude them, but to say you have to have them divided up is pure nonsense.  It could not be done; it will not be done, but it creates a very serious problem for people who have an honest anxiety to conform with the law, whether they agree with it or not.  I would be glad if the Minister would indicate how he thinks the <Col N="817" /> regulations here proposed will be complied with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say to the Deputy that of course this, like other provisions in the Bill, is being discussed with the trade.  I should imagine a person dealing in fertiliser, where he sells most of it in large quantities, will not be asked to keep separate accounts for his odd sale of two-stone or three-stone lots.  This is more to deal with the small trader who sells packages of seed for flower gardens and who might on occasions sell a stone of sulphate of ammonia or of nitrate of potash or some other such preparation.  It is aimed at avoiding administrative trouble for him and for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

The second company has separate accounts, and joinery and other sales to the main company are kept in it.  I think it is quite clear, but I want confirmation from the Minister, that when those various companies, all in the building trade and all with the same shareholders, pass on from one to the other the joinery plant for building purposes, they will not have to pay turnover tax because they are subsidiary companies of the main company.</P>

      <P>The test in this particular case is in relation to local authority small houses, the £2,000 type of house, where timber is exempt.  We have to draw a distinction between the timber <Col N="818" /> used in building and that used in furniture.  Sometimes timber is used for built-in presses and so forth, but sometimes it is used for furniture which is only screwed to the walls&mdash;mirrors, for instance.  We are excluding what would properly be called furniture from exemption.</P>

      <P>The point there is that if they buy their food for the residents, they will buy taxed foods at retail prices.  The hotel, of course, naturally, would get its food, and so on, free of tax because they have to charge tax to their customers.  The point is that neither of them escapes.  Where a person goes to an hotel for a meal, he pays tax on his bill but a person keeping a private lodging house pays tax because the tax is on the food.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister about the possibility of the exemption of medicines supplied on prescription by a doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the measure stands, they would be subject to tax.  It is a case I have been considering.  I am afraid it would be almost impossible to make an exemption there.  Chemist shops nowadays are very different from what they used to be.  Prescriptions form a very small part of their business now.  I wrote a prescription about two years ago for some person and when the chemist got it, he said he had not seen one of these things for 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be concerned about the position of the turnover tax in respect of medicines, drugs and appliances.  He some-what strengthens the case when he says that chemist shops at present are not exclusively chemist shops in that they deal with goods other than drugs, medicines and prescriptions.  Surely it is not impossible to devise some method whereby separate returns will be kept in the chemist shops for what <Col N="820" /> are regarded as drugs, medicines and appliances?</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider at least the exemption from turnover tax of these things that are so necessary to cure people and to keep them alive.  It may be difficult to segregate these things in the chemist shops as we know them.  I do not know what effort the Minister has made to try to exclude them or what consideration he has given to the problem.  It is very bad that we should, for want of effort in trying to exclude them, include them to the extent of putting at least a 2 ½ per cent tax on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I know, and they have to pay only on the food.  When the visitor or guest pays his bill, the turnover tax is not added if he avails of accommodation in a guest house rather than in an hotel. Supposing a small hotel proprietor who is at present registered with Bord Fáilte gets his registration withdrawn in order to opt out of the liability to pay turnover tax, is there anything illegal in doing that, even though his premises are well up to Bord Fáilte standard ?  Would that be legal on the part of such an hotel proprietor?</P>

      <P>A guesthouse, as defined by Bord Fáilte, would be in the same position as an hotel.  They give meals to people, and so on, and therefore would be in the same position as an hotel.  In other words, they would be entitled to buy what they want free of tax but would have to pay tax on their income from guests, and so on.</P>

      <P>Take any shop in rural Ireland.  Take any shop in a town such as Wexford or Athlone catering for farmers, the local hotels and for a variety of purveyors.  Do you realise you are asking such a person, if he is to conform to the law, to keep a growing multitude of registers of transactions of which, ordinarily, he has no record at all?  The ordinary practice in an ordinary grocer's shop is that the hotel porter comes down and asks for sundries and brings them back to the hotel.  According to the law now, that transaction is free of sales tax.  That is to be regarded as a sale to a person who is going to use the goods in the course of his trade as an hotel keeper, a guesthouse keeper or a lodging house keeper.  It is fantastic.  Can you picture it?  Every time a woman comes in to shop in Ballaghaderreen, you have to <Col N="823" /> ask her: &ldquo;Do you keep lodgers, Mam?&rdquo;  If she keeps lodgers or a guesthouse, as defined by Section 45, she can get the goods free of sales tax.</P>

Every grocer who wants to conform to the law must stop every messenger who comes in and ask: &ldquo;Are you buying for the lodging house?&rdquo;  If the customer draws herself up and says: &ldquo;We do not keep a lodging house; we keep a guesthouse,&rdquo; you must make a note in the book and say: &ldquo;You do not pay tax.&rdquo;</P>

I think most Deputies will agree that hotels, as a rule, do not buy in amounts of 6d. or 1/- They usually have an account.  It should not be a very hard job for the shopkeeper making up his returns at the end of the month to say: &ldquo;I received so much from hotel so-and-so on which I gave a discount of 2½ per cent and I am deducting tax on that sale.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This scheme was held up because it transpired during the course of the work that, owing to the unexpected discovery of substantial rock formation in the side banks, additional expenditure would be required to carry out the work as originally specified.  Work was suspended pending the preparation of an estimate for the additional work required.  The beneficiaries were not prepared to make an additional contribution towards the increased cost and on 8th July, 1963, the county engineer was authorised to reopen the scheme and complete it to a reduced standard.</P>

      <P>Recommendation 361 was discussed at a meeting of the Committee of Ministers at deputy level and a report on the decision taken will in due course be made to the Consultative Assembly.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Government to the Recommendation may be summed up as follows:</P>
      <P>As the Deputies may perhaps be aware, the Government concur in the view of the Committee of Ministers that it is not appropriate that one international organisation should contribute to another.</P>
      <P>The Government have, however, given full support to measures for the relief of world food problems and have taken the following steps in the matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>When the FAO Freedom from Hunger Campaign was launched, a voluntary contribution of $10,000 was made towards the central campaign costs.  In addition the Government have given full support to the promotion of the campaign in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The national collection for the Freedom from Hunger Campaign, undertaken by the Irish Red Cross Society at the request of the Government, has realised a total of over £90,000 to date. The Society deserves great praise for its devoted efforts in this matter.</P>
      <P>Ireland participated also in the World Stamp Plan.  A special Irish stamp was issued in March, 1963, and a donation of 100,000 copies of each issue with a face value of £7,900 was made to FAO in support of the Freedom from Hunger Campaign.</P>
      <P>In September, 1962, the Government pledged a contribution of $840,000 to the World Food Programme, of which amount $600,000 will be in the form of foodstuffs and $240,000 in cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he feels that sufficient <Col N="832" /> activity in sheep-breeding is being carried on by the Agricultural Institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the Institute have a considerable amount of sheep research work already in hand and are arranging to expand the programme appreciably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, and in no sense attacking the Minister on this matter, does the Minister feel that the number of university graduates involved in sheep research work is adequate?  Does it not seem rather incongruous that in fact 15 graduates are involved in horticultural research work and only two on sheep research considering that we have a tremendous potential in the export of lamb?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that it is the responsibility of those concerned in that Institute, the council and the director, to determine all these matters of policy.  As far as I personally know, apart altogether from the assurances I have received, I am satisfied that the Institute is and has been from the beginning keenly interested in the matter of sheep-breeding and development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that it is absolutely necessary, considering the great potential we have for the export of lamb not only to Britain but to Europe in future, that every effort should be made to get the type of lamb we require and that a proportion of two graduates assigned to that work in relation to 15 on other less important work is hardly correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no responsibility for the distribution of staff so far as the Institute is concerned but I know from my contacts with those who have that responsibility that they have been keenly aware of the importance of this matter and judging from all the activities and the distribution of these activities, I feel that they are going ahead with the work energetically.</P>

      <P>If the workers in question do any industrial work in the course of their employment, the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Acts 1936 and 1944 relating to hours of work and the short day would apply to them.  It depends therefore on the nature of the duties in each case whether or not the Acts apply.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, fishermen who work for an employer and receive wages or other remuneration have never been assessed with means under the Unemployment Assistance Acts in respect of such employment.  On the other hand, fishermen who are not employed under a contract of service have always had to be assessed, in accordance with the provisions of those Acts, with their net profits in the same way as other self-employed persons.  The means of applicants for unemployment assistance in the coastal area of Donegal are assessed in the normal course in accordance with those provisions by statutory officers and I am not empowered to reduce assessments in the manner suggested by the Deputy.  Any applicant who is dissatisfied with the rate of means assessed against him by a deciding officer has the right of appeal to an appeals officer whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>The question as to the extent to which the income of share fishermen who are not employed under a contract of service should be assessed as means for the purposes of the Unemployment Assistance Acts is at present under review in my Department.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the First Schedule be the First Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that it will be impossible to carry out the terms of this Schedule in accordance with its provisions.  Exempted activities are described as sales in bulk, <Col N="849" /> as defined in Section 51 of the Act, of seeds, fertilisers and animal feeding-stuffs. The Minister says that the regulations which he proposes to make under Section 51 will provide approximately one cwt. and that his purpose is to bring within the scope of the tax packets of seeds and small parcels of fertiliser purchased by gardeners from garden supply shops.  In his efforts to do that, he is creating an utterly insoluble problem for the ordinary distributors of seeds, fertilisers and animal feeding stuffs.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is to have any reality, and this detestable tax is to be capable of administration, the only sensible thing to do is to exclude seeds, fertilisers and animal feeding stuffs.  It is not credible that the amount of sales of seeds in packets and sales of 1-lb and 2-lbs of fertilisers made to gardeners in suburban areas can yield a revenue to the Exchequer sufficient to justify the creation of this ambiguity in regard to the sale of seeds, fertilisers and animal feeding stuffs at large.  But that is not the end of the ambiguity in this paragraph. Another exempted activity is the sale of other materials and substances of a kind used in large quantities by farmers and fishermen for the purpose of their occupation.</P>
      <P>Is there anybody in this House who can hazard a guess as to the meaning of the expression &ldquo;materials and substances of a kind used in large quantities by farmers and fishermen for the purposes of their occupation.&rdquo;  If there are, then I am not among them.  I do not know what that means.  I do not believe anybody knows what it means, but it will have to be interpreted by every shopkeeper in this country under penalty of the possibility of his being convicted of an offence under this section.  I suggest the appropriate amendment here would be to exempt from this tax all sales of fertilisers, seeds and animal feeding stuffs.  I do not think it matters whether the words &ldquo;other materials and substances of a kind used in large quantities by farmers and fishermen&rdquo; are in or out because, as at present advised, I have not the faintest notion what that phrase means.  I should be glad to know if the Minister does.</P>

Would fencing wire? Would medicines used generally be included?  If a farmer were to use a certain vaccine to inject all his lambs, 100 or 150 lambs, or even as few as ten or 15 lambs, would that vaccine fall within the ambit of this provision as a substance used in large quantities?</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that there are different ways of lending money.  The banks lend at the current rate of 5¾ per cent.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation lends at six per cent.  We have then the moneylender who charges any interest he likes, in some cases 100 per cent. There is no redress for the borrower unless he is prepared to face the publicity of court proceedings when the district justice will allow only the legal rate of 39 per cent simple interest. Unfortunately a number of people in the country find themselves in the hands of moneylenders.  Now why should we exempt that type of money-lending? Why should the moneylender not be asked to pay the 2½ per cent turnover tax in the same way as the housewife will be asked to pay it.  I agree that, if the banks or the Agricultural Credit Corporation had to pay the turnover tax on the interest they get for their money, they would in turn pass that on to the borrower. I maintain that the moneylender should be compelled to pay the 2½ per cent turnover tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been my opinion all the time that it will be all passed on and I still stick to that.  In regard to Deputy Donegan's point, the description &ldquo;large quantities&rdquo; is put in to cover articles mentioned by him. It would be impossible to put everything into the Schedule so this clause is a general clause which will be covered by regulation and will cover materials used by farmers in large quantities.  I may say that these matters are now being discussed in a reasonable way with the parties concerned. Mention has been made of the building trade and the builders providers are discussing these things with the Revenue Commissioners and are making very reasonable suggestions as to what is workable and what is not workable.</P>
      <P>We have also had discussions with farming organisations and they have been reasonable in the things they thought should be exempted.  We are all agreed that farmers' feeding stuffs, seeds, manures and fertilisers will be exempted but the other matters that come to fairly substantial amounts should be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is dreadful that the Minister will not indicate whether the items I have mentioned will be included.  When you leave the realm of foodstuffs, fertilisers, seeds and machinery, there are other large purchases which turn up every year and which represent substantial purchases on the part of the farmer.  A farmer with 50 sheep must dip them by law and for that he has to buy sheep dip which comes to a substantial amount.  A farmer may have to spray his potatoes four times in the year and, <Col N="852" /> in some cases, he may have to use an expensive spray for his cereal crops. The cost can amount to quite a large sum of money.</P>
      <P>Fencing may be a recurrent expenditure and another large expense to the farmer is bailing twine as you have more and more bailing being done now.  You also have bailing wire.  If there have been discussions on this at this level, then these matters must have been discussed.  We have a duty to inquire and seek the answer as to whether a farmer will have to pay 2½ per cent on the price of his sheep dip, his fencing wire, his bailing twine and bailing wire.  A farmer having 50 sheep may have 70 lambs and each of these will have to be injected with kidney vaccine.  Is that subject to the 2½ per cent or is it not?  We are entitled to be told that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not reasonable and he does not want to be reasonable.  I have said that all these matters can be discussed with the traders and the farmers concerned. Where it is practicable to include these matters, it can be done, but the Deputy mentioned on one occasion today that he had remembered another thing. What is to stop him from remembering yet another thing tomorrow?</P>

      <P>I could think of a myriad of things a farmer must buy but I have deliberately not included those.  When we leave the realm of feeding stuffs and other large purchases, we must remember that there are five or six other commodities which are generally used and the Minister knows as well as I do that these articles have to be bought every year.  One of these purchases is potato spray and that may have to be used four times in the one year.  In 1963, one of the purchases will be cereal spray which will be an expensive item.  There is also the purchase of the injection for the lambs and these are all over and above <Col N="853" /> the myriad of other items that farmers have to buy.  They are bought by the farmers every year in relatively large quantities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back to the question of building.  I do not understand, and I would like to understand, what is in the Minister's mind.  The Schedule is not clear at all. In the booklet that was issued, it is stated on page 11: &ldquo;The exempted services are building and allied services including the installation of heating, lighting, etc.&rdquo;.  I have got two different answers to questions I have put up and I want one authoritative answer now.</P>
      <P>A company which is a substantial building company does a great deal of business not merely in Dublin but in various parts of the country.  Part of the building which that company does is the building of houses.  For the purpose of its own operations, and for greater efficiency and productivity, that company does some of its work under the umbrella of its main company.  It owns its plant in a separate company and that separate company hires the plant to the main company.  It does its joinery work in its own shops and sends it out to the job, invoicing it from one company to the other in the ordinary way.  The ownership of the three companies concerned happens to be the same as regards the proportion in which the shareholdings are held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that when you have plant brought on to a job in that manner, there is a greater effort made on the job to get it finished and so prevent the plant lying idle.  The segregation of various aspects of work into subsidiary companies has come to be accepted by all good managements as being a desirable method of increasing efficiency.  I want to ask a simple question.  If those three companies operate on that basis and the plant hire company hires the plant to the main company, has it to pay turnover tax on the hireage charge?  That is No. one.  No. two: if the joinery company makes all its doors&mdash;I exclude any question of furniture&mdash;for the house and the joinery works sends them out to the site so that they can be put up on the site, have they to pay turnover tax on the cost of the <Col N="854" /> door invoiced out of the works where the joinery is done to the site where the main company operates?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of the Act, as the Deputy is aware, is that a sale will be taxable unless it is a sale of an article that is exempt, or is sold to a registered person.  A registered person of course would pay afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>An article sold by one person to another is taxable unless it is on the exempted list or is sold to a registered person who pays tax on it.  In regard to the particular item mentioned by Deputy Sweetman it depends on whether it is exempt or not.  I explained that the Revenue Commissioners have had discussions with the builders providers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about how the provision would come up.  The builders providers have made very useful suggestions about what should be exempt or not, but there has been no decision yet regarding at what stage an article will be regarded as a raw material, as it were, for a builder. I have already said today that there is a distinction between what a builder would use in building a local authority house and what might be put into a very well finished house, say, in regard to mirrors.  The mirrors would be subject to tax.  We have to draw the line somewhere but I do not yet know where.  That will be decided as soon as these discussions have been completed. I could not say with regard to doors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only make a supposition. In regard to the point made by Deputy Sweetman, about the firm which contracts for building equipment, I should have thought that that would have been covered by the subparagraph at the top of page 65, the &ldquo;provision of services provided for industrial or commercial purposes&rdquo;. That appears to me to cover it.  That is essentially the provision in regard to earth-moving equipment and is consequently exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only making a suggestion.  In the case of a joinery, I can see that point.  Very often, window frames are fabricated by another contractor. If the joinery company invoices goods to the building company, that in itself is a sale of an article, not for the benefit of the building company but for subsequent resale as soon as the building is complete.  I should have thought in this connection that it would be an exempted activity, being a sale of goods not for the benefit of the immediate purchaser but for subsequent resale by that purchaser to the final purchaser.</P>

If you get a person who makes a contract for building a factory and he gets a building contractor to erect the shell and <Col N="856" /> the contractor sub-contracts the joinery work, the joinery company will invoice its joinery work to the building company and the building company will subsequently charge the factory owner for the finished product.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that he has been unable to make clear whether certain items are exempt or otherwise?  I assume that the regulations governing this Schedule have been provisionally drawn up and the Minister should be able to give the information to the House.  If the regulations will be as vague as the Minister has been in his reply to a number of questions, it is not unreasonable to assume the courts will be referred to to determine questions arising from the Bill from time to time.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows the costly nature of court proceedings and I think in framing legislation, we should make clear, in order to avoid the necessity for recourse to the courts, what the interpretation of sections and subsections is.  Before the Bill comes back to us on Report Stage, the Minister should acquaint himself a little better with the terms of this Schedule so that he will be able to answer questions then which he is unable to answer now. What I mainly have in mind is the avoidance of court proceedings, where possible.  As I have said already, if disputes arise on interpretation of sections, we know the courts will be called in to determine them.  That is a costly business, not open to most people in this country with their small incomes, small resources.</P>

I want to know how he proved he was buying something for an exempt activity, without having a registered number to prove it.  I thought every builder, properly so called, would get a registered number that would mean that that was an exempt number and that, in relation to any of his activities under that registered <Col N="861" /> number that were exempt, it was all right, but if he got raw materials for any part of his business that was not exempt, then he would be a person who would pay tax.

      <P>Would it be possible for the Minister to consider the fourth item in the First Schedule, making some reference to sales in bulk of building materials such as earthstone, gravel, sand or cement?  The Minister has already stated that he proposes to discuss with builders suppliers exactly what items will be exempt from this tax.  At the moment, the fourth item there refers only to earthstone, gravel, sand and cement.  I presume that that is all in respect of those substances as used for building.  If that is so and if the Minister is prepared to agree with builders suppliers for possibly the exemption of timber, either finished or light, sanitary fittings, glass, slates, gutters, and so on, I think it might be an improvement if that item were clearly specified as being sales in bulk of building materials and then, by all means, leave it to the Minister to discuss with the builders suppliers exactly what items will or will not be covered.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fantastic situation at which we have now arrived?  There are in this country a large number of respectable merchants whose only offence is that they earn their own living and employ our neighbours' children.  We have now reached a point at which the Minister for Finance responsible for this Bill, fortified by all the resources at his disposal, finds himself exasperated to the point at which he says he is being persecuted by being asked what this Bill and Schedule mean.  Yet, this is the document which is going to be put in the hands of every shopkeeper in Ireland who is constrained to ask himself these questions 40 times every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only information we have so far is that a situation can arise in which a shopkeeper in respect of the sale of one commodity may necessarily keep four distinct categories every day for a credit sale, a cash sale, a credit sale and a cash sale, according to whether his customer is a hotelkeeper, a lodging-house keeper or a guesthouse proprietor.  Every time a farmer comes in to buy seeds, he must ask himself: &ldquo;Is my sale bulk sale or a non-bulk sale?&rdquo;  If the farmer comes in to buy a cwt of pollard that will be <Col N="863" /> determined as a bulk sale.  But if somebody buys six stone of pig meal that might not be a bulk sale.  These two transactions must be segregated for on one he must charge sales tax and on the other he must not.  That refers to only one department of a country shop.</P>
    <P>If you go over to the hardware department of the same country shop the proprietor must make the same series of determinations not only in respect of seeds and fertilisers but if a man comes in for a lb. of maize he must ask himself whether it is being sold for a domestic purpose.  One would imagine the Deputies of this House had been born on Mars or on the moon.</P>
    <P>Take a person who is a painting contractor in rural Ireland.  None of us call him a painting contractor.  We call him by his name.  We spend our time trying to get him to come to carry out painting work.  He tells us that today he is in the convent and that tomorrow he must work somewhere else.  Eventually, he comes to us.  That fellow is a painting contractor.  He comes in and starts painting somebody's house.  Do you seriously imagine that that man goes down and places an order for a quantity of paint?  He goes in every morning and gets a can of paint which he wants to use for painting his neighbour's house.  According to this they must stop him and say: &ldquo;Are you going to use that paint for a contract of work or on your own backdoor?&rdquo; If it is for his own backdoor, he must pay tax; if it is for his neighbour's house, he does not pay tax.</P>

      <P>Do Deputies realise that you are trying to apply to an economic set-up in our country a procedure which is as daft as a halfpenny watch? The thing will not work.  What is particularly maddening to me is that you are creating a situation in which a certain body of people who have consistently <Col N="864" /> complied with the law, and who want to comply with the law, whether or not they agree with it, will be driven almost insane and the bulk of the people will ignore the law and there is no conceivable means open to you of enforcing it.  If there is any more damning condemnation of law than a law which creates a thousand problems of conscience every day for an honest man and which is demonstrably unenforceable against a man who is indifferent to the law, I do not know of it.  It reduces the whole process of law-making to the lowest kind of degradation.  We are doing that simply because the Minister for Finance came to the conclusion that this was a form of tax collection which he hoped would yield a large revenue and the responsibility for which he hoped he could pass over to the shopkeepers.</P>
      <P>In the end, the impact of this tax must fall on the consumer.  The Minister makes pious affirmations of that from time to time.  In the process of doing it, we are making an attack on a law-abiding and public-spirited section of the community of the most scandalous character.  I do not want to multiply examples as I am peculiarly qualified to do, because I am intimately familiar with the whole procedure relative to the administration of a sales tax of this character.  Far from trying to bewilder the Minister, I am deliberately refraining from multiplying dilemmas&mdash;not by the dozen but by the hundred&mdash;I could propose to the Minister to expose him to the problems he would find himself unable to resolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What kind of law are we enacting? Is there a Deputy on any side with knowledge of the retail trade, particularly in rural Ireland who will challenge me when I say we are creating a position of utter impossibility for a man who wants to abide by the law?  If that proposition is true, when will we open our eyes to the quality of the legislation we are passing?  It is bad and it is evil.  It will beget every kind of abuse.  It will drive conscientious people into an impossible position, which will involve them in crushing expense in the effort to <Col N="865" /> give effect to the law.  It puts the unscrupulous person, indifferent to his obligations, in a position of great advantage.</P>
    <P>People may say you have to be practical in these matters, but it is not an easy thing.  If you are sending certificates to the Revenue Commissioners relative to factual statements on foot of which the Revenue Commissioners will reckon your tax liability, you are not entitled to sign a document which is not true.  People talk about the moral obligation to pay tax, that it is not morally due to the Government until they have got it.  But, whatever happens, you are not entitled to tell a lie.  This Bill is riddled with the obligation on individuals to make returns relative to grave matters in respect of which they are not morally entitled to lie, and to tell the truth is being made virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>I cannot make up an honest return to the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether the feeding stuffs, the seeds and the fertilisers sold in my shop are sold in bulk or not.  Nobody in Ireland can do it.  I cannot, and no country merchant can make an honest return as to whether every quarterstone of nails he sold was for the purpose of domestic repairs or was a contract within the meaning of the Act.  If he sells a can of paint, he cannot make a return as to whether it is sold to a man in his personal capacity or in his capacity as a painting contractor. Anyone with any understanding of rural business knows that to be true.</P>
    <P>I cannot make an honest return as to whether tea, sugar, bread and butter is sold to a woman who is a lodging-house keeper or a guesthouse proprietor.  No merchant in rural Ireland can do it.  It is an illusion to say to us that all such persons have accounts and are well-known to the persons with whom they are dealing. That is not true.  It has no relation to the ordinary conditions obtaining in the towns of this country.  I assure the Minister that, far from multiplying dilemmas for the purpose of exposing him to embarrassment, I have not spent one hour compiling questions <Col N="866" /> of that kind.  Under that Schedule, I could produce a thousand insoluble dilemmas for any conscientious merchant in this country.</P>
    <P>I say legislation of that character is evil, bad and the by-product of a lazy approach to a solemn duty and a grave reflection on those who introduced it.  I allege the reason it is being introduced in this dishonest form is to try to obscure from the people the real impact of the law and to deceive them as to where the burden of this tax will ultimately fall.  The net result is that the people have not been deceived, but we have created a wilderness of ambiguity through which no honest person can conscientiously find his way.</P>

The Minister, in reply, tells me we have to pass legislation here, although he admits he has not yet arrived at an arrangement with the people concerned. I do not believe he is really making arrangements with the people concerned.  I think he is vaguely pushing this through in bulldozer fashion.  In paragraph 10 of the first Schedule there is an item &ldquo;provision of services provided for agricultural, industrial or commercial purposes other than services provided in the course of carrying on a business which consists in whole or in part of selling goods by retail.&rdquo;  If a farmer who has a spraying machine goes out and sprays farm crops and charges a price per acre including the application of spray, is he in fact &ldquo;carrying on a business which consists in whole or in part of selling goods by retail&rdquo;?</P>

Quite a number of these shops will be the normal suppliers of the hotels and the effect of the situation now developing is that you will preclude them from supplying hotels or else you must make some arrangement for them to obtain a rebate of tax from the suppliers for the goods they sell to the hotels.

      <P>I am only saying what is the usual procedure in this House when we are putting through a Bill of this kind or any taxation measure in any year.  Deputies here cannot be expected to visualise every possible eventuality and all we can do in the Bill is to lay down the principle as to where the tax is to fall and then the implementation of that in detail and in particular cases is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  That is the way the business is normally done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the First Schedule, the Minister has said, if I interpret him correctly, that the Deputies of this House should not trouble themselves too much on these particular matters, that we lay down the principles and that the Revenue Commissioners will be the sole authority to determine the interpretation of these regulations.  We are further to assume from the Minister's statement that the Revenue Commissioners are a kind of infallible body.  My belief is that this House is the absolute authority in the country. We cannot delegate any function of ours to the Revenue Commissioners without giving them clear-cut directions. Every Deputy is entitled to elicit information from the Minister on any point mentioned in the schedule. I mentioned earlier that we were unable to get clarification on many matters. If the Minister were to say that next Tuesday before the debate on these items concludes, he will be able to give us more information, we would be as helpful as possible, and accept the fact that he is not as conversant with the measure as he might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone knows this is a very important measure.  In view of the different interpretations that will be put on it, many people will have to go into the courts for an interpretation of matters that might be in dispute. I want, so far as possible, to have <Col N="877" /> legislation defined here in such a way that no necessity need arise to have recourse to the courts for an interpretation of a particular section.  Everyone knows that is a costly procedure.  We all know that people in the lower income groups cannot go to the courts for a determination of their grievance, even though they may have a justifiable case.  We should not delegate our functions to the Revenue Commissioners to iron out all these matters. That is all right on small details, but as members of this House we should clearly understand the different sections, sub-sections and items in the Bill.</P>

I heard the Minister say in reply to the Leader of the Labour Party that the reason why veterinary medicines will be exempt is that they are the raw material of the agricultural industry.

      <P>It is true that if an <Col N="878" /> individual walks into a store and buys a bag of meal to feed two pigs he will pay no turnover tax on the grounds, according to the Minister, that is a raw material, and that there is an export purpose behind it.  Let us be quite clear.  There was a situation some years ago in which a number of people in the greyhound industry were feeding bread to greyhounds.  Supposing an individual walks into a store and says he is going to feed his pigs with flour, does he pay turnover tax on that flour if it is to be fed to pigs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the particular item that one buys.  The definition here is of a general kind.  It says, &ldquo;substances of a kind used in large quantities by farmers and fishermen&rdquo;.

      <P>To continue what I was saying before I was interrupted, are we to take it now that this new elevation of the animal in our society is to be continued to the question of the provision of medicines?  Is it to be considered more important to ensure that it will be possible for a farmer to buy medicine for pigs, than to buy medicines for his sick child?</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that there is no question whatsoever of a <Col N="881" /> scheme under which the white collar worker can, generally speaking, get free medicines?  Now it is true that, in relation to the farmer, no matter what economic sector he belongs to, he will get these medicines free of tax.  To that extent, there is discrimination against the white collar worker in respect of his children, since he will have to pay tax on essential medicines for his children, while the farmer will get medicines for his cattle free of tax.  A nice exhibition of Christian principles.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 55 of the Finance Act, 1920, <Col N="884" /> prohibits a company from entering into or carrying out any fictitious or artificial transaction for the purpose of avoiding payment of corporation profits tax.  Contravention of the provision renders a company liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500.  Paragraph 8 (1) of this Schedule provides for the recovery of a penalty incurred under Section 55 of the Finance Act, 1920 as a liquidated or fixed sum and accordingly the present amendment is designed to substitute a fine of £500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  Surely a fine not exceeding is the proper way of doing it.  The effect of the section, if amended, will be that the court will have no discretion in determining the amount of the fine.  That is the exact thing that was commented upon most unfavourably by the Income Tax Commission and commented upon again, and again unfavourably, by the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>Does the Schedule of repeals not frequently simply refer to the consequential repeals arising out of the statute we have been considering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  The normal procedure is that one puts in new provisions and repeals the old, two separate operations.  Here the old is repealed by the substitution of a new section for it.  We can ask the draftsman to have a look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole of Section 34 is going now, not merely subsection (3)?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 66:</P>
      <P>In Part III, in the third entry in the third column, to delete `in subsection (4) of Section 55, the words &ldquo;on summary conviction&rdquo;;'. </P>
      <P>This is consequential on amendment No. 64.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because of the recent Supreme Court case that you cannot go on summary jurisdiction, is it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that that is the point here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not, I should be glad to know what it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so.  The new practice involves High Court procedure in most of these penalty cases, so the words &ldquo;on summary conviction&rdquo; are deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred on amendment No. 63 to the court decision the other day.  I thought that one of the things the court decided was that you could not go on summary procedure for a penalty of this sort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Mainly, I suppose, because the Income Taxation Commission recommended these changes in procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this was exactly what it did not recommend. If the Minister says that this is justified by the Commission's report, I will be perfectly happy, provided he gives me the reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That did not say so. <Col N="890" /> We had that discussion a few minutes ago.  This is CPT, not income tax?</P>
