      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I raised with the Minister for Finance the possibility of improving the compensation payable to unestablished officers who are compelled, because of either age or health considerations, to retire from the public service.  These officials are not entitled to any pensions whatever and are therefore, in such circumstances, compelled to depend on whatever they may get under the social welfare legislation and on the gratuity they get from the Department concerned.  In the past, the gratuity has been based on a payment of one week's pay for each year of service.  When I raised this matter on Committee Stage, I asked the Minister to examine the whole question, with a view to paying a larger gratuity because one week's pay for each year <Col N="1696" /> of service seems pretty small compensation, particularly in the case of people compelled to retire for health or age reasons.</P>
      <P>The Minister met the point to some extent, and I am thankful to him, by providing that where you have 15 years service, you continue to get compensation on retirement at the rate of one week's pay for each year of service and if you have over 15 years service, then you get two weeks' pay for each year of service.  That was a substantial improvement for those with long years of service but, of course, it made no difference whatever to those who had service of up to 15 years and not very much to those with between 15 and 20 years service.  There is definitely a case to be made for the man with 15 or fewer years of service who is forced to retire, either on health or age grounds.  While I appreciate what the Minister has done, I would ask him to reconsider the matter between now and the time the Seanad come to consider the Bill to see if it would not be possible to do something more for those with 15 years service or less and who retired in circumstances of ill health or age.  I do not think it would cost very much to meet the claims of such people.</P>

      <P>When the Bill is being considered in the Seanad, the Minister might consider a point made by Deputy Corish and to which the Minister gave a reply which was not quite correct.  It related to district justices.  Four of them are concerned and of two of them the Minister said that because they were acting registrars, they were closer to the courts than those in State solicitors' offices. That is not correct, as the Minister will find out if he re-checks.  People in State solicitors' offices are in fact much closer to the court and should be included before those who are included as registrars.  There is a far closer affinity between the work of State solicitors' offices and district justices than there is between the work of registrars and district justices.  Would the Minister have a look at it before it goes to the Seanad?  He will find the point I make is valid.  Only two people <Col N="1697" /> are involved.  Perhaps he would consider it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the unestablished civil servants who retire on a gratuity, I think the first remedy for this question is to establish as many as we can.  We have been moving in that direction.  There is a calculation to be made, when we take in a number, of say, inspectors for a certain purpose.  There is the calculation whether it will be a temporary operation or whether they will be there for all time.  Where we are satisfied they will be there for all time, then I think they should be established straight off. Usually, what is done is a compromise. A certain number are left as a sort of margin in case there should be a fall down in the work.  Some could be let go and we would have the number who were established left behind.  I am having that position examined in all Departments to see whether more could be established in the various grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That applies, as I am sure Deputies are aware, generally, to the type of case I mentioned such as inspector.  It does not apply so much to the administrative grades because they are taken in by the Civil Service Commissioners and therefore are established straight off.  People are, at times, recruited for a temporary situation on a temporary basis and allowed to go again.  One instance of that would be the preparation of the Census every ten or five years as the case may be.  Apart from that, in getting as many as we can established we then have a number <Col N="1698" /> left behind who are unestablished. Many of these, of course, are not initially regarded as full-time, as, for instance, auxiliary postmen.  There are big numbers in that grade and, because of that, the number unestablished in the Civil Service looks very high but, when we analyse it, it is not as bad as it looks.</P>
    <P>There are, however, many unestablished people who are full-time.  In present circumstances, they would, when retiring, get the gratuity laid down.  Two improvements were made in this Bill.  One was to bring the period for a gratuity down to seven years from 15 years and the second, by way of amendment, was to double the gratuity in cases of service over 15 years.  The position, therefore, is relatively very much improved.</P>
    <P>It may be argued, indeed, that, even so, the sum received is still not very significantly high.  It must be remembered, however, as I pointed out on Committee Stage, that all these people are entitled to social welfare allowances, retiring pensions, and so on, when they retire.  That, of course, will add considerably to their income&mdash;and it will be improved next January.  I should say, perhaps, it will be improved by the vote of Fianna Fáil here last night and in spite of the vote of Labour and Fine Gael.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They are paying for it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy would not let them pay for it themselves by his vote last night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have given as much consideration as we can at the moment to the position of the unestablished civil servants.  I did, as I said, <Col N="1699" /> first of all legalise the position to bring the calculation down to seven years and, secondly, by way of amendment, ask the Dáil to increase the gratuity when retiring to make it two weeks for every week over 15 years.  A person with long service as an unestablished officer will now get more than a year's salary when retiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has long service, he will get more than a year's salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to make the calculation just at the moment.  The only other point that arises here is whether we have provided that all these people will be entitled to social welfare benefit when they are leaving and, as far as I know, that has been done.  I must, therefore, put it to the Dáil that, in relation to this particular class of Bill, we cannot do any better at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the entitlement to the gratuity at the moment is governed by a condition that you cannot get more than a year's pay on retirement through the medium of this gratuity.  If the new calculation should in any particular case work out that a person would appear to qualify for more than a year's pay under the new formula, will the Minister arrange that he will be able to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 40 years' period was there but, on account of giving two weeks for every year over 15, it may work out as follows.  Fifteen from 40 would be 25.  I am getting at the two weeks first.  Twice 25 would be 50 weeks and then he would have the 15 as well, which would equal 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recollect that in the Department of Agriculture we used to have some hard cases. Does a retiring lady civil servant now qualify for a contributory old age pension when she leaves the service at 60 years of age?  I thought the Minister said they were entitled to social welfare benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that include a contributory old age pension, if she left the service at the age of 60?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>She would not receive the contributory old age pension until 70, as well as her Civil Service pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister will remember, some of these persons in the Department of Agriculture had 40 years' service&mdash;I think in the Eggs and Poultry Division.  We then discovered that they were being constrained to leave at 65 but there would be a hiatus as between the age of 65, the date of retirement, and the age of 70 years when they would, under this new system, have a gratuity of a year's salary but no pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the cases I am personally thinking of, I believe we did succeed in getting them established and in overcoming the difficulty, but there may be others surviving.  Would the Minister, now that he is dealing with this whole matter, consider is there ever a stage reached where a temporary civil servant has served so long that he or she ought to be deemed established?  I think the Minister, who has been Minister for Agriculture, will agree with me that in the case of ladies who give 40 years' service being told when they are 60 that they are temporary civil servants and that they must retire without pension is a desperate hardship.  Would the Minister take under consideration some rule that would permit these exceptional cases of hardship to be dealt with by providing them with some pension instead <Col N="1701" /> of having an <i>ad hoc</i> battle between the Department of Agriculture and the Department for Finance trying to get such persons established.  I am thinking of the case of the supervisory officers in the Eggs and Poultry Division, for whom I think we got special provision made; but I think we succeeded in getting them established just a week before they retired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that persons can be taken into the established part of the Civil Service only through the Civil Service Commissioners. They have to do a competitive or qualifying examination. Take the case of clerical officers.  They qualify a certain number.  Then the number at the top of the list are called as required.  Sometimes all the qualified people are not called but that cannot be helped.  I think it is a very good rule that a person cannot reach an established position unless he comes through a competitive or qualifying examination.  In fact, both are combined as a rule.  There is the provision in exceptional cases of taking in a person in the public interest, but that applies, as a rule, only to somebody very high up.</P>
      <P>The position arose in the past that a big number of temporary people were taken in and their work went on and on for a long time.  Then they held what was called a confined examination. There are, say, 100 temporary civil servants on a particular job.  A confined examination is held and we qualify and establish 40 of the best of them.  Of course, again that is a qualifying examination, although in this case they have come in on a temporary basis and thus have an advantage over people outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not the fellows to whom you give reduced children's allowances in the Post Office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different question. Deputies will agree with me that if we are to increase the number established, we should insist that they should not come in except through some form of competitive or qualifying examination.  The people Deputy Dillon has in mind were probably <Col N="1702" /> eligible to compete for the confined examination at some stage.  Maybe they did not compete, or else did and were not successful.  If there is a hiatus and if they go at 65&mdash;although temporary people are usually allowed to stay on until 70&mdash;they will be entitled at least to the unemployment allowance under the social welfare code.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a nice point in regard to this as to what exactly is the meaning of the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo;. If the Minister will look at Section 2 on page 5, he will find in that definition section at line 36 a definition of an &ldquo;advertisement structure&rdquo;.  If he looks further on in the same section, he will find on page 7, line 24, a definition of the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo;.  I should be glad to know from the Minister if the doctrine of exclusion may be expected to apply here and where in a subsequent section of the Bill, as in Section 24, subparagraph (b), which we are at present discussing in connection with amendment 72, the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; is used, for the definition of which we must turn back to page 7, line 24, are we not entitled to assume that it does not include an advertisement structure and that it refers only to a structure other than an advertisement structure?  If that interpretation of the section is correct, then I think a wholly new situation will arise, and unless I am greatly mistaken, that is the construction the courts will put upon this reference. If the Minister were to be deemed by the courts to mean that Section 24 should cover an advertisement structure, they would expect him to say: &ldquo;all structures including an advertisement structure.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) on <Col N="1703" /> page 7 defines structure as meaning, among other things, &ldquo;any structure&rdquo; and any structure does mean an advertisement structure.  To say an &ldquo;advertisement structure&rdquo; is really qualifying the type of structure but the definition says it means &ldquo;any structure&rdquo; and it includes without, any doubt, an advertisement structure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the interpretation the Minister now says falls to be considered under this section, how would this apply to the matter we discussed on the last occasion, structures that might be regarded as unauthorised? On that occasion, I asked the Minister if there was not a seeming inequality in the circumstances of local authorities which did adopt resolutions under previous town planning legislation and those authorities which did not.  There is also the question of people in areas where local authorities did not accept the previous Town Planning Acts and did not adopt resolutions in respect of them.  I pointed out there was the question of structures erected at that stage which did not require any local authority permission since the authority had not adopted the planning resolution or, as was the case with a large number of authorities, had adopted the resolution but did not make a town planning scheme.  There are counties close to one another in which the same type of structure could in one county be authorised and even across the road could be deemed to be unauthorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invited the Minister to comment on this and to say what treatment the citizens could expect in these cases if the decision is that these structures remain unauthorised.  In one case, if the local authority decide that the structures are to be removed, they will have to pay compensation, whereas in the other, the citizen could be made to <Col N="1704" /> remove the structure without compensation. It seemed the citizens would suffer from inequality brought about by the failure of adjoining local authorities to achieve uniformity in respect of previous town planning legislation.  It would seem that grave hardship would be imposed on one citizen while another might not be so affected because even though his structure might be removed, he would be compensated.</P>
    <P>Having heard the Minister on the previous occasion, I suggest this is something that needs consideration in relation to this section.  There are thousands of structures throughout the country, if we are to treat an advertisement structure as a structure within the scope of this section, and a great many of them have never come to the notice of local authorities.  The owner of land simply gave permission for the erection of a sign.  In many cases, the necessary approval may have been given but I am sure that in quite a large number of cases, in the strict town planning sense, these structures might be regarded as unauthorised from the point of view that permission was not sought.</P>
    <P>The onus on the advertisers and those who engage in this business would then be, if the section remains as it is, to make thousands of applications to various authorities under this Bill.  A great amount of work might fall on the Minister and his Department in regard to the interpretation the local authorities give this type of structure.  Now, when we find the Minister feels the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; includes advertisement structure, I invite him to comment at this stage on the generality of the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; as now used and on the use of two definitions in the definition section of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Three things have been raised by the Deputy and I shall deal with them in order.  He spoke of the position in the town planning authority area in which no resolution was adopted in respect of the 1934 Planning Act.  In other cases, the planning resolution was passed and interim control has existed.  In the first case, <Col N="1705" /> if the planning authority did not pass a resolution, any structure or building which would fall to be dealt with under this Bill, would be there at the moment and would continue to remain there and even after the passage of this Bill could be required to be removed only on payment of compensation by the planning authority.  That is in so far as the planning authority area is concerned in which no resolution was passed under the provisions of the 1934 Act.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other local authorities who passed a resolution, the resolution was to make a scheme to bring a plan into operation.  Even though such plan was not finally and formally adopted, nevertheless interim control has since been exercised by the planning authorities concerned.  Any person, therefore, who since the passing of such a resolution, constructed, erected, altered or anything else, any buildings or structures of the nature we are dealing with, and who did not apply for and get permission, will be regarded as having acted contrary to the law on and after the appointed day for the coming into operation of this Bill.  That does not mean that each and every unauthorised structure will be subject to removal without compensation.  If an unauthorised structure is unobjectionable from the point of view of planning criteria, then that structure will be quite safe.  The owner of such property will on application to his planning authority or, if necessary, on appeal to the Minister, be entitled to get permission for that unauthorised structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if it is objectionable and the planning authority concerned consider that permission should not be given, it will fall to be dealt with in the same way as present applications for planning permission are dealt with.  The local authority will be entitled to refuse permission for the structure.  Alternatively, they may say they will give permission subject to the removal of a certain part of it or to certain additions which will make it unobjectionable.  If it is a blank refusal, or one subject to conditions with which the applicant is not satisfied, appeal will lie to the Minister.  If <Col N="1706" /> the planning authority refuse, or grant permission subject to conditions which appear to be either penal or unjustified, and the Minister is satisfied that that is so, then he may uphold the appeal and grant the permission.  Such permission will make the position of the unauthorised structure completely clear and safe so far as the law is concerned.  If for any reason it has to be removed later it will rank for full compensation.</P>
    <P>So far as the definition of structure is concerned, between now and the Report Stage I will have a look at the definition section again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will depend on the type.  Poles are mentioned actually.  I have been advised that the definition of structure does include such things as advertisement structures.  The putting in of the word &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; in that particular instance is merely for the purpose of qualifying the particular type of structure.  I am quite satisfied the position is as I have stated it to be. We will, however, check on it between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister equally to give some thought to the point I made with regard to the vast number of these structures at the moment.  Does the Minister envisage that application will have to be made for each and every one to each and every planning authority?  There is a large number of such structures here in Dublin and throughout the other cities and larger towns.  Advertising is a big business.  Leaving aside aesthetic values, and some of these structures are an advantage when they are properly lit at night, this type of advertising has almost become a necessity so far as the general public are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know if they are to be included as structures which would come under this definition, whether the Minister would consider it a reasonable thing to assume that if the local authority has no objection to them as they now exist, they would be deemed <Col N="1707" /> to be authorised structures if a notice has not been served within a period of, say, six months from the coming into operation of this Bill.  I am sure the local authority have had advice on this matter.  When new structures are being erected and where town planning has been in operation, interim control would have been exercised and, perhaps, permission refused for the erection of some structures.  It would simplify the procedure if the Minister were to adopt the suggestion I have made as being the more reasonable way of dealing with the matter than to provide that every individual who has erected such sign or advertising structure must apply to the local authority concerned for permission in respect of each sign.  I suggest that it would be more reasonable that they would be deemed to be authorised if notice was not served on the person concerned within, say, a fixed period of six months.  Would the Minister comment on that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree-and I could refer back to my contribution on Second Reading&mdash;that the business of advertising is a necessary part of our present day way of life and is something which, apart from anything else, gives quite a lot of employment and serves a need.  I should not like it to be understood at any stage that we regard advertising as such as something that should be abolished.  There is no such thought in our minds.  However, we do feel that a certain amount of control of this type of thing is just as necessary as it is in regard to any other type of business or structure.</P>
      <P>As far as control is concerned, there is little in the planning codes of any country that goes back as far as control of advertising, which goes back to the beginning of this century, from which date there is evidence of the first effort to control advertising as distinct from many other things which are coming under control in more recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> Having said that, let me make it clear that the planning authority in the case of unauthorised advertisement structures may not take any action unless, on planning grounds, they are satisfied that a particular structure is objectionable as it exists. That is even further limited in that even though the structure may be objectionable on planning grounds, unless the local authority have taken their action within five years after the appointed day, they may not do so thereafter.  In other words, even if the structure is objectionable, unless they have taken action within the period of five years, they may not ever do it again.  I repeat that they may not do it even within the five years unless on planning grounds it is objectionable.</P>
    <P>The owner of the advertisement structure, if he feels he wants to regularise the situation and that his structure is sound, good and unobjectionable in every way, may at any time after the appointed day apply for permission to put his position beyond doubt.  That may be an advantage to him at the time and he need not wait until he finds out whether the council object or otherwise.  He may apply at any time and be dealt with by the planning authority as if it were an application for a structure about to be erected.  Appeal facilities will be available in that case also.</P>
    <P>So that this matter is not dealt with in the way that may have been understood by Deputy Jones or other members of the House.  The manner in which it is being approached is quite fair and certainly where the structure is unobjectionable on planning grounds the owner need have no fears whatever. In fact, he may not have to do anything, either to regularise his position or anything else.  He may leave it there and if the planning authority have no objections, they may not call on him to do anything about it and if they have an objection, unless they have called upon him to take action within the five years, his position becomes regularised and his structure becomes legal, even though it may have been objectionable.</P>

      <P>While appreciating the Minister's explanation this morning, which has been very helpful in regard to this whole matter, might I put a point to him in connection with structures which are unauthorised because of the fact that a person did not make application in regard to them and who, on appeal, now finds he is out of court, so to speak in regard <Col N="1710" /> to his structure?  Would the Minister agree with me that this person would be visited with a penalty but would not be denied some compensation in regard to a structure which is going to be removed?  While there would be a penalty attached to the fact that he did not comply with the terms of the law as it existed and on appeal now fails to establish the fact that the structure complies or could be held to comply with town planning, the Minister would feel that he would not visit him with a complete denial of some compensation, but that the authority would pay him some measure of compensation? The Minister might consider it from the point of view of imposing a penalty on him and, at the same time, awarding some compensation for the fact that, in a large number of these cases, a scheme was not made by the planning authority concerned under the previous Town Planning Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be the odd case, but I think in any case where the law is so inadequate or so defective that people could not be stopped from erecting such structures, we should not penalise them retrospectively.  If a person built a house and he could not be stopped because there was not sufficient power in the law to do so it would be a shocking business to go back now and say to him: &ldquo;You must pull down that house, and you must pull it down at your own expense.&rdquo;<Col N="1711" /> That is what this section empowers the Minister and the local authorities to say.  It is very serious for those reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the question of a dwelling house, there are very few people who built a dwelling house for many years who did not have recourse to Government Departments and local authorities for grants.  For many years, the practice has been that no grant was payable, or even considered for approval or allocation, unless and until the permission of the local planning authority was furnished with the application.  If some houses were built for which grants or planning approval were not sought, the fact that that is so does not make them removable, as it were, on the passing of this Bill.  It will be only in such rare cases as exist, and I doubt if there are any that have not applied for grants or planning approval and yet are in existence in areas where grants were available and planning control was in operation.</P>
      <P>To equate the type of dwelling house which was built in recent years with what would be regarded on the passing might exist in that set of circumstances, it must still be objectionable on planning grounds before there is any of this Bill as unauthorised would be a difficult exercise, if not well-nigh impossible.  Even allowing that such question of any removal, partial removal or change in its structure or layout under these provisions.  If we add that to the very difficult set of circumstances I have mentioned, it is very difficult to see that any house in existence will be required to be removed and removed without any compensation.  Candidly, I do not see it happening, although theoretically it could happen, I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, let us look at it another way.  Undoubtedly there are in existence certain structures which may offend from the planning point of view which were erected without permission being sought, and which could have been prohibited by a prohibition order but were not.  In many cases, they are of no substance.  They can be advertisements which were erected hurriedly and quickly on the roadside without any request to the local <Col N="1712" /> authority or the planning authority.  It might be some sort of movable shack or hut.  Quite a number were erected in different parts of the country but they are probably temporary and movable structures put up to do a particular job at a particular time, without recourse to the planning authority for permission for their erection.</P>
    <P>In many cases, permission would not be granted for them and, indeed, the people would not expect permission because of the type of structure they were proposing to erect.  From the owners' point of view, they were worthwhile for the time being and for the duration of the job for which they were required.  They got a few years out of them and they felt they had paid their way.  It also might well be that after some alteration or some slight improvement or titivation, as it were, a structure of a temporary nature which has no great value might come to be regarded by the owners as being worthy of an application for planning permission.  It may be that after a little additional trouble and expense, planning permission might be granted for it.  That is quite possible and quite conceivable.</P>
    <P>It is not our wish or the wish of the planning authorities to penalise people, if it is at all possible to avoid doing so. If we put this law through, we intend to work it in that spirit.  We want to regularise things throughout the country in as nearly uniform a manner as is thought to be consistent with good planning.  That is really what we are trying to do.  The very essence of the whole effort of this Bill is to try to make for more planning for the country as a whole, and in order to do that, we must try, where we can, not to penalise people for the sake of penalising them.  We want to bring them within the general scope of, and in conformity with, the law which they may be outside, rather than try to find how we can punish them by application of the law.</P>
    <P>If the whole Bill is scrutinised from that point of view, it will be found that our general aim, which runs consistently through the Bill, is not to try to penalise people or catch them out. They may be already on the wrong <Col N="1713" /> foot because of a lack in some Act in the past.  We are endeavouring, where possible, to bring them within the fold of the law which they may have gone outside in the past, and in that way get everyone into step at the same time in the interests of planning in our country, our cities and our towns in the best possible manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 73:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) of subsection (4) reads:</P>
      <P>It shall not be necessary for the prosecution to show, and it shall be assumed until the contrary is shown by the defendant, that the development in question was neither exempted development nor development commenced on or before the appointed day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This paragraph of subsection (4) is very much at variance with the approach we have had up to this on the Bill. I suggest to the Minister that this provision is bureaucratic.  The paragraph sets out that if the local authority says the person has not obtained permission that will be enough to condemn him. As it stands, the paragraph does not require the planning authority to show it has made a development plan, that the development plan, has come into operation or that the property owner <Col N="1714" /> failed to get permission for development.</P>
    <P>The whole onus is being thrown over on the property owner in this case. It could very well happen that permission had been obtained but a difference might arise as to the interpretation of that permission, what it actually was, or whether it had been substantially complied with.  The planning authority is being put in a position that it may say it has not been complied with. Surely all these matters ought to be determined by an appropriate tribunal. The onus of proof should be put on the planning authority.  They should be required to prove to the satisfaction of a court or the type of tribunal the Minister mentioned previously that they have a good case for saying either that a person has not had permission to carry out development or that the development which he has carried out has not been in accordance with the permission given.</P>
    <P>This is a complete reversal of the normal procedure and it is an intolerable burden to place on the individual. The scope of this provision is very wide and it leaves the planning authority, which has all the resources at its disposal to produce the relevant documents and so on, in the happy position that it need only say that a person has not obtained permission or has not complied with the terms of the permission he received.  I certainly hope that the approach which the Minister spoke of on previous sections will be made applicable in these cases as well, and that the onus of proof will be placed on the planning authority to establish the guilt of the individual rather than that the individual would be required to establish his innocence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be a departure from the normal practice but it is not a unique departure.  The principle underlying the placing of the onus of proof in this instance on the person who is said to have offended, that he has, for instance, commenced a structure before the appointed day is something which is within his knowledge. If a person commences some sort of structure it is curiously within his knowledge when he commenced it. What we are getting after here is the <Col N="1715" /> persons who erect hoardings, shacks or other objectionable structures and do so secretly.  How is a planning authority to prove that it was commenced on any particular day?  It is not unreasonable in those circumstances, where no permission has been sought or got, that the onus of proof as to what day it commenced should rest with the person who constructed it.</P>
      <P>This is not a unique case as the Deputy would seem to infer.  It is a change of practice in so far as other parts of the Bill are concerned but there are other provisions, for instance, under the Road Traffic Act where the onus of proof is placed on the person rather than on the body seeking to deter that person from doing certain things.  Any person who carries out unauthorised development will be liable to prosecution and a fine of up to £20.  This provision is intended to be a deterrent to such people who would hurriedly and at no great cost erect a structure; if they get away with it well and good and if they are caught they do not stand to lose much.  They take that risk and erect these objectionable structures around our countryside. They do it perhaps at night, secretly, in order to evade whatever laws or controls exist.</P>
      <P>It is only in such places and where the weakness of the present law has been exposed by practice over the past 30 years that we seek to bring in this provision in order that there will be some deterrent to such practices in future.  Possibly it is departing to some degree from our general approach in this matter but the circumstances are peculiar.  As I said already, it is not unique; it is a provision we have in many other Acts, even in a much more serious sense than we can envisage under this section.  I would ask the House to bear in mind that it is the type of situation which I have outlined that we are attempting to get after.  It is not a serious matter in the sense of some of the matters covered in other Acts such as the Road Traffic Acts.  In many cases, it would be impossible for the local authority or any other person to prove the exact starting date of a particular structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is dealing with matters which he envisages may arise in the future and did arise in the past, the erection, perhaps, of a hoarding with something at the back of it, but this subsection, which is general to Section 24, applies to all the types of things we have been mentioning.  It applies to the type of structure we have already discussed, or houses, or advertisement structures or otherwise. While a number of these cases may be legalised under the terms of this section, there will perhaps be the case that will not be legalised.  There could be the type of case where somebody, having sought permission in a general way, did something which the planning authority felt was not in accordance with the permission.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be taken as attempting to defend the type of person who would flout town planning requirements and the aesthetic considerations which should govern all types of structures, and the type of building which the Minister has in mind, but when the subsection applies, it would be a general procedure in relation to all structures and the onus of proof is being transferred to the defendant.  That is going back over the years since town planning first came into operation.  I can see this applying in the future but it is an undue imposition on the citizen.  While its general application would be commendable in so far as the passage of this Act is concerned, there is the retrospective aspect in regard to previous legislation, which was more honoured in the breach than in the observance, by people who should have been giving the example.  If the citizen finds himself under this type of imposition which is envisaged, it is totally unfair at that stage to transfer the onus to the individual and leave the authorities say that this was something they could not regard as having been within the type of permission afforded under the previous Town Planning Acts.  It is to that type of visitation on the citizen that I wish to draw the Minister's attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can agree with the Minister in regard to the procedure in the future but might I ask the Minister to have a <Col N="1717" /> further look at this with regard to the retrospective aspect, an aspect of legislation we do not like, particularly in regard to reversing the normal trend in respect of the administration of what might be classed as justice, where there is retrospection and where it transfers the onus of proof from the complainant to the defendant, if I might put it that way?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Subsection (a) is objectionable on the grounds mentioned by Deputy Jones in so far as in ordinary law, the citizen is innocent until he is proved guilty and it is up to the State to produce proof against the citizen.  It is completely illogical to say that because the accused person may have more information about a matter, the onus of proof should be laid on his shoulders. That would apply to every misdemeanour and crime.  If a man is accused of murder, it may be said that he knows more about the time it was committed than anyone else and, therefore, should be asked to produce proof of his innocence and the State should not be asked to produce proof of his guilt.  This is clearly an analogous position where the bureaucrats want the citizen to do the job they are unwilling or unable to do themselves, that is, to produce proof.  It is a bad departure and is completely wrong in principle.  The Minister's facile argument that he is the only person who would have knowledge of this particular date is completely untenable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jones is applying this much more widely than it will, in fact, apply.  This is really a sort of transitional requirement in that it cannot go on indefinitely in the future.  It will not in practice; possibly it could in theory.  The appointed day is mentioned in many parts of the Bill, and as and from that day, in any planning area, the new order of things comes in.  As the House is well aware, we have been dealing very extensively, even this morning to quite a degree, with what the position is in regard to that which is in existence before the appointed day, whether in an area where the controls have been in operation or <Col N="1718" /> where no planning proposals were ever passed.</P>
      <P>The problem in this amendment has to do with what has happened or what was in existence before or after the appointed day, and there is an advantage accruing to the person concerned. If he wants to show that a structure for which he is responsible was erected or commenced before the appointed day, it is to his advantage to show that was so.  He gets a better deal if the structure were not in existence before the appointed day, whether he is in an area where there was control or an area where no control existed previously.  If he is in an area where there had been no control, it is a very important thing for him to be able to show that his structure was in existence before the appointed day. He will then be within the law.</P>
      <P>When looking at this type of case, it is asking too much to expect the planning authority to go to the endless trouble, and practically the impossible in many cases, of proving whether or not a person commenced the structure on or before a given date, which proof would, in fact, redound to the benefit of the person concerned.  Why put the planning authority to all that trouble if, in fact, it is to the benefit of the person who has that knowledge easily within his grasp?  If the person concerned does not wish to prove it, surely there is something wrong somewhere. That is really the net situation here.</P>

      <P>I was keeping that apart because we have a different procedure for it.  In the case of exempted development, if it is claimed to be exempted development and the planning authority disagree and dispute the matter, there is recourse, by way of appeal, to the Minister to determine which of the two parties is right.  It is only after the decision on appeal to the Minister that any further repercussions would take place.  This provision is, in fact, a buffer between the two parties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 75:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (4) to add at the end of paragraph (b) &ldquo;or establishes to the satisfaction of the court that a permission or approval shall be regarded as having been given to him pursuant to the provisions of subsection (4) of Section 26 of this <Col N="1720" /> Act or was deemed to have been given to him under subsection (6) of Section 57 of the Act of 1934.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of this subsection says:</P>
    <P>It shall be a good defence if the defendant produces a permission which, by virtue of subsection (1) of Section 28 of this Act, was granted in respect of the development complained of.</P>
    <P>What we propose is to add on after that the text of the amendment.  This sets out the defence a property owner may make and we suggest it should be unnecessary to say it would be a good defence if the person produced a permission, because obviously that would be a complete answer to a charge of not having got permission.  In subsection (4) of Section 26, the Bill contemplates that the planning authority might be dilatory in the discharge of their functions and that if a decision on an application is not made within two months of the day on which the planning authority receive the application, permission shall be deemed to have been given.</P>
    <P>When we look at that subsection., paragraph (b), we see this:</P>
    <P>in case any notice or notices requiring the applicant to publish any notice, to give further information or to produce evidence in respect of the application has or have been served by the planning authority pursuant to permission regulations within the period of two months beginning on the day of receipt by the planning authority of the application&mdash;within the period of two months beginning on the day on which the notice or notices has or have been complied with.</P>
    <P>In the normal course, a decision by the planning authority to grant permission or approval shall be regarded as having been given on the last day of the two-month period.  The defendant cannot produce that permission if the planning authority are dilatory and do not give the permission until the last day of the two-month period but he may be able to produce proof&mdash;a letter or document &mdash;to show that he has made an application. <Col N="1721" /> Accordingly, we think it is necessary that the words of our amendment should be inserted at the end of the subsection to cover that type of situation.</P>
    <P>If the planning authority is in any way dilatory in regard to the application before it, and if it has not given the permission up to the end of the two month period, it would be deemed to have been given.  But, if it were to give the permission on, say, the last day of the two-month period, then the person could not produce this, though he might be able to satisfy any tribunal inquiring into the matter that he had made application.  He might produce a document, a receipt or a letter from a solicitor acting for the property owner, to prove that he had made application to the planning authority. Therefore, we think that the words in the amendment should be added.  Then it would read:</P>
    <P>(4) In a prosecution for an offence under this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) it shall be a good defence if the defendant produces a permission which, by virtue of subsection (1) of section 28 of this Act, was granted in respect of the development complained of or establishes to the satisfaction of the court that a permission or approval shall be regarded as having been given to him pursuant to the provisions of subsection (4) of section 26 of this Act or was deemed to have been given to him under subsection (6) of section 57 of the Act of 1934.</P>

      <P>What is sought, I think, in this amendment is not really necessary.  What is in the Bill at present covers adequately what the amendment appears to seek.  Having heard Deputy Jones just now confirm his views of what it is wished this amendment will do, I would reiterate that the section in the Bill generally does, in fact, give fully what that amendment is seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say, even further, that there is this added distinction and improvement in the present proposals as against what existed in the past under <Col N="1722" /> the 1934 Act.  Instead of permission having been deemed to be granted for all purposes, as it says in subsection (6) of Section 57 of the 1934 Act, in future, under the provisions and terms of this Bill, the document must ultimately be produced showing that permission has, in fact, been granted.  In other words, in future, under this Bill, there will be the advantage that, where permission has been gained by default, as it were, on the expiry of a certain date without a decision having formally been given by a planning authority, documentary proof will be given to the applicant, as of right, by the planning authority and that will be his evidence and proof for all purposes thereafter.</P>
    <P>As I have said, generally, there is nothing in the amendment, nor has the elaboration by Deputy Jones shown anything to be in or intended by it that, in fact, I can assure the House, is not actually fully covered by our present proposals.  In other words, the terms of the amendment are not really necessary.  We are doing all and any of the things being asked in the amendment fully and without question.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 24, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not particularly happy about this section&mdash;not the actual words contained in it or any of the provisions that have been disposed of by the various amendments that have been tabled by the members of the Fine Gael Party and dealt with to, I suppose, the utmost extent by the Minister.  I understand and appreciate that as far as the formulation and establishment of an overall development plan is concerned, the planning authority have the power to do that&mdash;&ldquo;the planning authority&rdquo; meaning the elected members of the various councils, corporations, urban councils, and so on.  My concern is that in this particular section the planning authority is, in fact, the city manager or is, in fact, the various officials who would be employed for the purpose of this Bill.  I want, therefore, the Minister to say&mdash;I suppose there is no necessity for him to say it because it is a fact&mdash;<Col N="1723" /> that, as far as the operation of this section is concerned, &ldquo;planning authority&rdquo; means officials and I take exception to that.</P>
      <P>I believe that the elected representatives should have a power of control in respect of the type of extra development mentioned in this section.  I am not saying that the officials will deliberately act in any biassed manner but we have to be practical about this. We have to try to safeguard the interests of the elected public representatives. The elected public representatives in any district, needless to remark, have a particular interest in their own town, county or village. Whilst this section is not the fully effective section for the purpose of this Bill, it does mean that development which is not exempted development or development commenced before the appointed day will be controlled, so to speak, by the officials of the public authority.</P>
      <P>We must appreciate the position of the elected representatives in this matter. They are people who have lived in their areas, in the majority of cases, for practically all their lives.  They know the area.  They know what is reasonable and what is unreasonable as far as development is concerned. They will also be bound by a decision which they made in respect of the development of their town or village. However, I suggest they also have a particular interest in any further development over and above all that and, in making decisions in matters of that kind, I think the public representatives should be consulted.  There seems to be a definite and deliberate trend in Local Government legislation to take more and more power from the elected representatives and to vest it in the hands of some official.  For that reason, I would be opposed to this section as it stands and believe that where permission is to be sought for further development over and above the general development plan the public representatives should be consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certainly in favour of the general ideas or overall principles for the better planning and the better <Col N="1724" /> development of the towns and cities and villages in the country generally, as provided in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill which the Minister has introduced, but I suggest that unless it appears that the men who have been elected by the public generally have a say in planning and development it will not be a 100 per cent success.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to confess that there are not so many things in the Bill to which I would take exception but the one thing I consider more important than anything else is that in the administration of the Bill the elected representatives should have the utmost say.  If we are to confine decisions, as described in this section, to officials, we certainly will not get the goodwill of the public representatives. For that reason, I suggest that the Minister should consider on Report Stage or in the Seanad some method whereby there might at least be granted to an individual the right to appeal&mdash; not to the officials but to the public representatives who know their area better and perhaps have a greater interest in it than the officials, who may not necessarily be natives of the county they administer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In a democratic House such as this, if I appear to take a line slightly different from that taken by the leader of the Labour Party, it is not because I do not sympathise with the idea that public representatives should have what I would call a reasonable say in this matter.  The system of local government we have needs an adjustment of mentality on all sides, both by officials and public representatives.  It is only going to work if that adjustment is there.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record that my experience of local authorities, as much as I have been in contact with them over a long number of years, has left me with a very high opinion of the good standards set by these public servants.  I have always found where problems of this kind arise that good public servants tend to heed the advice given to them by elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want in one regard to protect the <Col N="1725" /> elected representative.  Very often the weaker kind of public representative &mdash;and they are in the majority&mdash;find it extremely hard to resist the pressure that can be exercised upon them under this kind of lawmaking.  If that sounds reactionary, I am sorry.  We have to be somewhat reactionary to deal with the problems this Bill sets out to deal with.  This country has got into a mess. There is a number of things for which we have to set standards&mdash; standards that are acknowledged and accepted in other democratic countries in western Europe, but which we have flouted in the past.  If we are to get done what the Minister and his Department seek to have done here, we must see to it that we do not allow public representatives to be stampeded by vested and other interests who want to have the indiscriminate free-for-all that existed up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we on this side of the House will be forgiven if we have one bureaucrat amongst us.</P>
      <P>I have some experience of planning in Dublin and my relations with the officials have been very happy.  However, while the public representatives under this Bill have the responsibility of making the general plan, it ends there.  It would probably be impossible to have it otherwise.  There are so many proposals before the planning authority that it would be quite impossible for the elected representatives to make decisions on them.  The planning officials take over and they are supposed to give permission within the general framework of the plan agreed by the elected representatives, but that puts unnecessary obstacles in the way of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes I think there is a lack of cooperation.  For instance, you get this sort of reply to a proposal: &ldquo;Elevation and details unsatisfactory.&rdquo; No possible indication is given as to what will meet the requirements of the planning officials.  You also get this sort of reply: &ldquo;Disposal of surface water unsatisfactory.&rdquo; Again, they give no indication of what will satisfy them. You also get: &ldquo;Plans insufficiently detailed.&rdquo; It is not stated in what way <Col N="1726" /> they are insufficiently detailed.  There should be a more positive attitude on the parts of the officials.  It is not a good practice to send back a curt reply giving no indication as to the manner in which the matter might be rectified to make it acceptable to the people responsible for granting planning permission. That is the only objection I have to bureaucracy.  It would be quite impossible for the elected representatives to say it should be done this way or that way.  They would not be allowed to live in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There were more than three together.  Looking at this matter from the point of view of local authorities&mdash;and I have been a member of a local authority for a number of years&mdash;I think the situation is pretty well safeguarded as far as the rights and responsibilities of elected representatives are concerned.  As I said previously, the very fact that we have over 80 planning authorities proposed under this Bill is in itself indicative of the view the House takes of the role local authorities can play.  In the proposals in the Bill we have taken care to ensure that the elected representatives of the planning authority will be responsible in the first instance for the laying down of the general plan to be adhered to by the administrative head of the council, generally the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the plan has been agreed to by the elected representatives, subject to whatever advice they get from their technical people, the manager will operate it on their behalf and will be governed by the general plan laid down by them.  If he should depart from that plan, he will be doing something wrong.  That is something he is not likely to do and if he does, the elected representatives may requisition the manager to do as they wish because what he proposes to do is outside their plan.  The requisition may or may not be heeded by the <Col N="1727" /> manager, but if not, it comes to the Minister.  If no requisition arose but there was an aggrieved party, who would then become the appellant, and he appealed to the Minister and if the decision was not in conformity with the local authority plan, that, in itself, would be a fairly good case for the appellant as to why he should succeed.</P>
    <P>I do not think it can be said that we are neglecting or writing down the role of the local elected representative. It is rather peculiar that&mdash;and this arises not only in regard to this morning but also to other references&mdash; much thought does not seem to have been given to restricting the manager if he is giving permission.  It is all directed to restraining the manager from exercising his administrative functions in refusing something.  On the various questions raised in the House about the role of the elected representative and the right of appeal to them by an aggrieved party, it is always envisaged that the manager will refuse something rather than that the manager should not do something or that whether he is giving or refusing permission, he is not the proper person to do it.  I do not understand that distinction.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of sense in what Deputy Barry said.  I think it was Deputy Clinton who said that when the local authority members are dealing with these cases, especially the bigger planning authorities, they will be very busy people if they do nothing but deal with awkward planning cases that arise.  It is only awkward ones that will come to them, according to the views expressed by Deputy Corish. In a sense, I think this legislation merely continues the pattern which is becoming clearly established over the years, that, as the volume of work in local authority offices increases it becomes impossible for the ordinary elected members to give sufficient time to enable them to, as the old elected bodies did in the past, undertake all the work of their council.</P>
    <P>The pattern here is, I think, in conformity with the general trend that local elected representatives generally <Col N="1728" /> can lay down what they wish done, indicating clearly what they want the manager and his staff to do but I think it is clearly demonstrated that they have not time to sit around in the local authority offices to ensure that their last word is put into action. I do not think it would be fair to local elected representatives to add the question of determining appeals at planning authority level on to them also.  They do the positive and useful work of laying down the plan generally and the manager and his staff take over the working of the plan and carrying out the day to day detailed administration.</P>
    <P>If in that administration, including dealing with applications for permission, the manager decides to grant or refuse permission resulting in certain people being aggrieved, then there is an appeal to the Minister.  On the ground floor, in preparing the general layout or background of the plan, you have the elected body and no better people can be found for the job. As Deputy Corish said, they have the local knowledge and interest.  Then the manager operates the plan and makes the detailed decisions.  If anybody is aggrieved by those decisions, they may appeal to the Minister when, under the new law, they may have the benefit of oral hearings.</P>
    <P>If the manager has transgressed against the plan as passed by the local body in making a decision, the local body have the right of requisition requiring the manager to do other than he proposes to do.  If he refuses, the normal sequel is that it is referred to the Minister for final determination. While I appreciate Deputy Corish's view and those of the other two Deputies who have spoken, I think, in general, we are approaching this in a reasonable and sensible way and, above all, we are recognising the definite, positive and useful role of the elected body without whom the whole proposal could not work.  They make it go; otherwise, it fails.  We are placing that responsibility on them and I expect they will make it work because of their interest and knowledge of what is good for their own localities.  That is why we have retained the big number <Col N="1729" /> even though in many cases they may be dealing with small units.  That may create difficulties in general administration but we think it is worthwhile since we rely on the members of the local authority to do a better job than any other agency we might consider.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I put this proposal to the House and to Deputy Corish and his Party in particular who expressed some views on the matter.  I believe we are doing a good job in bringing all three elements into the matter in their order of importance, first, the elected representatives, secondly, the manager and his officials and thirdly, the Minister and his Department.  If that still does not seem to certain Deputies to be sufficient, I need scarcely tell the House that I shall be thinking about this between now and Report Stage. Probably I shall not be able to stop thinking about it until it is through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly appreciate what the Minister says but I should like to see the local representative brought into this section in a more positive way.  The Minister has described how public representatives can, so to speak, keep a check on the manager and curb him in respect of practically anything. I have as much respect&mdash;I happen to be a local officer; I do not know whether or not Deputy Barry knows it&mdash;for them and their judgment as I have for any other section of the community. It is true, of course, that some managers do consult, but I find that, when a manager consults a council in something in which he is not bound to consult them, in nine cases out of ten, he is trying to get the county council to share some of the responsibility where he himself should have one hundred per cent responsibility.</P>
      <P>Now, I do not say that against county managers, but that is the way they operate, in my experience.  If they have a function, then they have a function and they should be prepared to take responsibility for that function. Where they consult the council, they want to present the matter to the public as being a decision not alone of the manager but of the council as well.  It may be some sticky problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The manager need not heed the council's advice.  As far as other functions of the manager are concerned, he is guided more or less by the law, by the various Local Government Acts, by the Health Acts, by the Public Assistance Acts, and so on, and if it is right to do a certain thing in Wexford then it is right in Cork, and Galway, and all these other places.  But, as far as town planning is concerned, what is good for Cork may not be good for Waterford, and what is good for Waterford may not be good for Galway.  That is the reason I advocate that public representatives be brought into matters like this in a much more positive way than the Minister has described.</P>
      <P>I repeat that managers and officers generally, who are usually not of the county in which they operate, could not expect to have the same local knowledge as public elected representatives have.  I know they are subject to pressure.  We are all subject to pressure from time to time.  I do not think there is anything wrong in being subject to a peaceful pressure by any individual or by any section of the community.  Deputy Barry said unfortunately&mdash;I do not propose to quote his exact words&mdash;that many of our public representatives, if not the majority of them, tend to be weak when they are subject to pressure.  If that is so, then I suggest the whole nation is weak because these are the men and women who represent the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the criticisms we can make of local government is, I suppose, that those who criticise most are those who should be prepared to take responsibility <Col N="1731" /> in local matters but who never seem to put themselves forward for election.  I am glad that a man of Deputy Barry's stature and standing is not within that category; he has demonstrated over the years that he is prepared to take his responsibilities as a public representative not alone in Dáil Éireann but in local bodies as well.</P>
    <P>Public representatives should be brought into this matter in a much more positive way.  It is true, as the Minister said, and we all know it, that you have the power to establish this plan.  I am not concerned now with the day-to-day administration of the plan but perhaps the Minister would listen to this positive suggestion, unless it is already provided for; that is, that the manager be compelled or required to provide for a progress report.  Of necessity, in establishing the plan over weeks or months, the council cannot go into the details, details that may be very important, and I suggest, therefore, that the manager might periodically make progress reports on the actual operation of a plan in any particular locality.  In particular, I think the local public representatives should be consulted in respect of Section 24, subsection (1), paragraph (b).  In areas in which town and regional planning Acts were not in force, structures, the erection of which is commenced without permission after the appointed day for the coming into operation of the Act, can be dealt with by the manager and should be dealt with by him because, in cases like that, they have got due warning so to speak that these authorised structures should not be tolerated.  But, in respect of unauthorised structures in areas where town and regional planning Acts were not in force, I think definitely the public representatives should be consulted because, with all due respect again to public officials, and again bearing in mind the great defects in the planning Acts, there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of structures erected without any permission having been obtained because the attitude of local officials and local authorities generally <Col N="1732" /> has been: &ldquo;Well, these Acts are so defective we close our eyes to most of these things.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I venture to remark that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of unauthorised structures.  Are we to take from Section 24, subsection (1), paragraph (b) that the manager himself will have the power to deal with cases of that kind?  I suggest that in relation to these structures which may have been erected long before a manager came into the area, the public representatives be asked by the manager to at least adjudicate on these. I know that public representatives have two or three different ways under which they may appeal to the Minister and in which they may reverse the decision taken by the manager. In many cases, they are very cumbersome and no public representative, to my knowledge, wants to invoke, and for very good reason, the famous Section 4 of the Act of 1955 or 1956 to reverse a decision made by a manager. Believe it or not, they do not want to do that.  They do not want to appear to reject absolutely their manager. For the better operation of the Act, therefore, if there could be some positive proposal in the Bill, whereby the manager or the officials would be required to consult the public representatives, I honestly believe this Bill would operate much more smoothly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it what we want to do is to provide some kind of system whereby the local elected representatives will be made aware of the propositions, proposals and decisions. The procedure in Cork city that we adopted about two years ago is that every two weeks, at the appropriate meeting of the authority, all applications and decisions must be listed and placed on the agenda.  The town planning officer is in attendance and the list is gone through seriatim and every decision approved or awaiting approval is subedited in that way.  The architect describes what state the application is at&mdash;approved or awaiting approval or approval refused for certain detail and the detail is listed.  The council are able to discuss every one of these cases across the table.  In fact, on the list we have <Col N="1733" /> also a list of cases known to be on appeal to the Minister.  When a case is on appeal to the Minister, it is obvious that a decision has been taken by the applicant, that he regards his case as in justice requiring that final arbitration take place, and the council members are aware in a case like that that it is probably a finely balanced point of decision and can throw their weight on any side they like.  The manager and his architectural adviser, his town planning officer, are required to justify their decisions before the council at these fortnightly meetings.</P>
      <P>The manager and the council in any local authority can decide to establish that system.  It does not require a law of this House to do it.  If there is not that kind of relationship between the manager and local representatives in local councils, then we are in a mess.</P>

      <P>In a case where a plan is rejected the officials should be obliged to state exactly what they want. If that is not done they could spend two months rejecting a plan for insufficient detail or something like that without telling the applicant what they wanted.  Then you could relodge the application and another two months could elapse.  The case could take 12 months.  This has happened to me in business.  It has taken 12 months to pass an application merely for the sake of some small items.  Deputy Clinton asked this question and I have not heard a reply to it.  Surely when a plan is rejected it is up to the officials to state exactly what they want and what is wrong with the plan.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> In our county council affairs, as regards a simple question like a question of boreens, we have drawn up certain stipulations to which people must comply if the boreen is to be taken over.  That was done in order to get some kind of control over the following out of demands.  In each case the engineer tells the local applicant that he wants such a hedge cut, such a thing done.  He can simply state what he requires and the people are free to go ahead and do that.  If he just sent back a blank refusal saying: &ldquo;This is not acceptable&rdquo; the people would not know where to begin or end. By simply stating what the objections are and what he requires done, it is made simple and workable for everybody. I see no reason why, as regards the planning authority, the same principle could not be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy Corish's point that he would like public representatives to have a more positive say as regards the administration of this Bill when it becomes an Act, in general, I would agree with him completely.  It is a fact, and no one can deny it, that local government as such has practically disappeared.  It is a county managerial system now and local government is there only as a name and local representatives are there merely to give a democratic face to bureaucratic government.  That is <Col N="1735" /> exactly what the position is.  No one can deny that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">

      <P>The position as I see it is that the members of local authorities are completely and entirely ignored by the bureaucrats who often wish to carry out any kind of scheme which suits themselves and to stop any sensible scheme.  It is a shocking state of affairs that things which I have seen happening can happen and I hope some action will be taken to prevent them.</P>
      <P>Some of these allegedly famous planners have minds on a par with some average 12-year-old children.  That is clearly indicated by some of their activities.  I have seen a man decide that a petrol pump should be 56 feet from the side of a road and, according to that, it would end up in the middle of a field.  I should like to know what use the petrol pump would be if it were in the middle of a field.  That happened.</P>

      <P>It is only reputable people in Mayo who can afford helicopters. Were it not for the intervention of the local representatives and the goodwill of the Minister, this person would not have his petrol pump or he would have it in another man's field. How anyone would get into that, I do not know.  When we have there a bureaucratic planning genius who decided on that without even looking at it, surely it is time that not only in the towns or cities where you have urban authorities, but in ordinary cases throughout the country these matters should be brought before the local authority by the planning officials and should be discussed with the members of the authority?  No matter how little sense the members of the local authority as such may have, most of their servants have a good deal less, as I have found in Mayo and as I see in other counties and particularly in this city where the thing is standing out 100 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely essential, unless we are to lose sight of democracy altogether, that steps should be taken <Col N="1736" /> to ensure that the members of local authorities would have a say in this matter.  They are not all as daft as they are written up to be by many people. Many of them have good, common sense, fortunately, and more common sense than some of the people who try to dictate to them.  I hope steps will be taken to ensure that local authorities will have a say in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very concerned from the beginning when this question of reserved functions came up. I take it that in regard to this section and in regard to town planning in general, the regulations which the Minister will make and the subsequent plans or the plans that have been spoken of already will be available to the elected representatives and the planning authority when they come to consider the plan proposed to them and that the elected representatives will know at that stage what regulations the Minister has in mind and what instructions ought to be borne in mind in regard to any particular type of development.  This would enable the elected representatives to retain that type of supervisory control which Deputy Corish has referred to and to which the Deputy who has just spoken has referred.  I am glad to know that democracy won the day as far as the petrol pump to which he referred is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the regulations which the Minister makes or envisages in regard to this whole field of development were available to the elected representatives at the same time as the planners bring before them the proposed plan, the elected representatives would have a reasonable chance of knowing the steps that might be taken administratively to deal with the development plan.  Indeed, Deputy Corish referred to the fact that the same set of circumstances would not be in operation in any two counties.  It would be very desirable that planning in general would not have complete uniformity which would tend to make it common and monotonous throughout the country. There must be freedom of development which will allow planners to <Col N="1737" /> plan for their own regions.  The type of situation to which Deputy Corish referred, and the type of procedure which Deputy Barry told us has been adopted in Cork would not only be desirable but necessary, if this Bill is to work as it is envisaged it should work.</P>
    <P>From the beginning, I have been saying that goodwill is required to make the Bill work.  The goodwill not only of the planners but of the elected representatives in conjunction with the planners is required.  If there is a clash of interests between the elected representatives who know the areas, and the planners who may come from outside the areas, there would not be as much respect for the plan.  If the Minister could see any way in which the type of situation which Deputy Barry has told us is in operation in Cork could be brought about, it would meet Deputy Corish's point that there should be a type of progress report which would give the elected representatives in any planning area an idea of what was in the official or administrative mind, not only on what was before it at the time but what had been dealt with since the previous meeting of the authority.</P>
    <P>It will occasionally happen that representations will be made&mdash;I prefer to use the word &ldquo;representations&rdquo; rather than to say that pressure will be brought to bear&mdash;to public representatives in local areas.  That is most understandable, because if people who are affected by any phase of the development want to convey their views of the administrative machine, the public representative is the man to carry them.  It is very desirable that that type of representation should be given due weight by the people who are responsible for a decision even before it leaves the planning authority and comes to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether we are still dealing with the section we started out to deal with.  We have ranged quite widely since but, perhaps, in some way there is a connection. There is much talk of getting co-operation by goodwill rather than by <Col N="1738" /> compulsion.  Previously no distinction was made as between one approach and the other.  It was said that the local elected representatives were entitled to this, that and the other. How they got it was not really of any great importance.</P>
      <P>We seem to be forgetting that we have Section 2 of the 1955 City and County Management (Amendment) Act. Section 2 (1) provides:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Section, a local authority may by resolution direct that, before the manager performs any specified executive function of the local authority, he shall inform the members of the local authority of the manner in which he proposes to perform that function, and the manager shall comply with the resolution.</P>
      <P>The managers are aware of that, even though all councillors may not be.  A request to a manager for information such as this is as good as a command. I am merely putting that to members of the House who feel that the necessary type of information should be supplied.  It might be sufficient to meet some of the objections that are being made that the local elected representatives are not properly informed on the question of appeals.  Under that section the manager can be commanded to give the information if he refuses, but he will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A manager may want to bring to the council a matter which is difficult to decide and on which he wants to spread the load of responsibility and make it lighter for himself.  A manager who does that is sensible but a manager who does not bring every type of case to the council, perhaps because it is an easy case, it is popular and has outside support, will get away with that only a couple of times before the council tell him to take a walk for himself.  He will not cod them by bringing in only the difficult and awkward cases which he wants to get out from under.  If he ignores the council in the ordinary run of business and brings in only difficult cases or decisions which may not be popular, he will get away with it once or twice <Col N="1739" /> and if the council are very patient, perhaps, three times.  If a manager wants to be helped to carry the burden of responsibility&mdash;and most of them do&mdash;in regard to decisions which are not always popular, and if he is to get that help, he must co-operate in full with his council.  In that way he will get the co-operation and help of his council in awkward and difficult decisions. He cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>The ideal of our City and County Management Acts is the idea of co-operation. If that co-operation is not forthcoming by goodwill there are powers to compel under various enactments. If we can get that co-operation without compulsion, that is fine, and that is the ideal way, but if there is, as there must be occasionally, a manager or an official who does not seem to be built that way, we try to build into our laws sufficient powers for the local authority to compel such people to co-operate in the interests of the common good.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton raised the question of the local authority stating the exact grounds for refusing permission.  The proposals in this Bill are an advance on the present law.  More detail will be required to be given in future if we enact this Bill than is the case at the moment.  Furthermore, what is far more important, and coming to what Deputy Belton mentioned, there is provision for oral hearings.  In such circumstances undoubtedly the applicant will have an architect; there will be a planning official, or an engineer, or an architect of the local authority, and they will probably get together and have a talk at the oral hearing about what one feels should be done and the other feels could be done.  Probably, before they leave the room they will know each other's mind as to what is feasible and what is possible.  These oral hearings will probably be a means of short-circuiting some cases.</P>
    <P>I agree there is an idea that you may get a refusal which very briefly may give a vague reason or reasons why the application has been refused. The applicant or his architect or solicitor amends that, but, again, because of the vague terms of the refusal, <Col N="1740" /> he may misunderstand or not fully understand what is intended or what the objection is.  He comes back with the amended proposal, feeling he has now met all the grounds objected to and yet when that is received, he gets back another objection.  This can go on, and indeed in many cases has gone on, for weeks or months or maybe years.</P>
    <P>We hope the new method of approach, particularly the oral hearing, will to a very large degree prevent that type of frustrating experience.  I am confident that we shall get quicker decisions and a more satisfactory operation of the law in regard to planning in the future than we have had in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very patient and I just want to say my last word on this very quickly. The Minister in this Bill is putting the responsibility on the local authority to prepare a plan.  It seems to stop at that.  May I appeal to the Minister, therefore, to put the onus on the county manager or the city manager by saying to the county or city manager: &ldquo;These men have given you a plan.  You will operate that.&rdquo; Surely it is not unreasonable to put the onus on the county manager to make a progress report?  The Minister has said that public representatives can make the manager do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want it in this.  The local authority can sack the manager, if they like.  I want to see this strictly connected with town planning.  There is a happy arrangement in Cork where it is done by agreement but there are dozens of local authorities in the country who may not think of getting an arrangement like that of the Cork County Council.  The onus should be put on the county manager to make that progress report without the county councillors appearing to chastise the manager by saying: &ldquo;You must do this or that&rdquo;.  Then it would operate much more smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see this operating without that being provided but that it should be put to the Minister for Local Government that it would be better if the Minister says to the manager that it should provide this or that for the council rather than that the council should say it to their own manager, indicates a certain weakness in approach to this matter as regards having a manager controlled as he should be controlled by the local authority for whom he is working.  I know the Deputy's view is that we should bring this about without the local authority seeming to rasp across the manager so that goodwill and co-operation will be forthcoming.  However, if the Minister has to tell the manager what he should supply to the elected representatives, it would look as if the local body were afraid of the manager or that they felt they should not tell him what to do, that is, if he does not know already what to do himself, and I would assert that nine out of every ten of them will know it is something they should do.  If they do not do it, they can be required to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This same sort of progress report is required in every other field of activity of the local authority, whether it is roads, sewerage, water schemes or anything else.  At every committee meeting, progress reports are received from various heads.  I do not see why that should not relate to town planning as it does to every other activity of the <Col N="1742" /> local authority.  It follows as the night the day and without it things would not work too well.  Whether I should say it must be done or not is a matter which I can and shall consider.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say again the responsibility is on the local authority to give the county manager a plan.  I do not think it should even appear that they are being used as an instrument in the name of democracy to give him a plan and that that is the end of it as far as they are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they do not finish entirely at that, but the Minister would be making a breakthrough.  I have a certain sympathy for what Deputy Leneghan said in respect of officials and Deputy A. Barry will appreciate this as well.  No matter what a county manager or city manager or any officials of the local service do, the public representatives have to take responsibility for him.  I would ask the Minister to include this one section to ensure that the county manager will in a democratic fashion tell the public representatives what is happening every week, every month or every three months, as the case may be.  This is a small matter and I do not think we should have been discussing it at such length.  He could easily do it and would not be creating a precedent which would embarrass him later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is well aware, we have gone to great pains to try to evolve a system that will operate to make councillors aware of what is going on and also to devise a way in which we shall make the public aware of what applications are received and what decisions are reached.  We are going to endless trouble to provide a register and various other forms of publicity so that people who might have an interest or who might be aggrieved will be aware of what is taking place, what decisions are being made, and can make the appropriate appeal, if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is for the general public. Surely the members of the local <Col N="1743" /> authority, the local planning authority, in whose offices the register is kept and in which offices or building they have their normal meetings, if they are not aware through the normal channels made available to the public, must be aware of what is going on, even if the manager never provided such a report.  If there is not in the local authority harmony to the degree that the manager will present a progress report to each of the meetings dealing with town planning generally, just as he does in regard to roads, sewerage and so on, then there is something wrong, not necessarily only with the manager.  There might also be something wrong with the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this difference. In all the decisions the manager has to make, he is guided by law or regulation.  In this, he must be dependent on judgment and he can relate it to local circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the county manager's job is as clearcut as that.  He has to use his discretion and in many cases, there is neither law nor technical process to determine his way of thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody can do that to suit himself ultimately.  He hopes he can, to justify his action. Seriously speaking, managers in the case of executive functions which it is their right to determine &mdash; and I have known a few managers in my capacity as a member of a local authority &mdash; even where they are not obliged by law to do so do, on the basis of common sense, do seek views and advice from the elected members, particularly if a matter is likely to be disputatious, as planning appeals will be.  I must say that there will be something wrong somewhere if what Deputy Corish is seeking does not evolve of itself.  He is anxious that I should ask the House to compel the managers or direct them by law to provide this.  I shall think about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make one short <Col N="1744" /> submission, that is, in connection with a person who seeks permission for a structure and is advised by the planning authority that it does not conform. The position is that the planning authority should be required to give reasons why it does not conform.  I would remind the Minister of an experience which probably he does not remember.  When I first became a member of this House, one of the plagues of our lives was that if there was an appeal under the Old Age Pensions Acts, we were simply told the person was not allowed the old age pension or was allowed half the standard rate.  If you went to the Custom House, you met a most polite officer who explained the whole case and went through the file with you.  When you asked him if he would give you that in writing, he replied: &ldquo;No; we cannot do that.  We are limited to saying that Mrs. So-and-So is entitled to half the pension or to no pension.&rdquo; You could see from the file that the decision was perfectly reasonable but if you tried to explain that to your constituent, your life was a misery.</P>
      <P>I shall not apportion credit but a change was made in the regulations and old age pension officers were allowed to state that &ldquo;Mrs. So-and-So's means have been assessed at so many cows, which represents such an income, and she has another income of so much and that places her within a certain category of income and the appropriate rate of pension is so forth.&rdquo; The relief that has been not only to Deputies trying to serve their constituents but to old people who now know what they have to meet if they are to seek a full pension, has been very great indeed. In 90 per cent of the cases, the old people know that they have no answer to the reasons and the matter can be allowed to drop and everybody is satisfied. In a small percentage of cases, it can be demonstrated that there is a misapprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By analogy I suggest that if a developer or a person intending to build a structure is told: &ldquo;You cannot proceed with that structure unless the following things are done, A, B, C, and D,&rdquo; he knows where he is and he can make up his mind whether he can conform to the four conditions or <Col N="1745" /> abandon the project, or, in the alternative, say: &ldquo;Conditions A, B and D are reasonable but C is manifestly unreasonable and I want to argue that with you.&rdquo; If he comes to me to complain that he is not getting a fair deal from the Department of Local Government, I can immediately say: &ldquo;Well, A is reasonable; therefore we can write that off.  Condition B is all right and condition D is acceptable but C is unreasonable.&rdquo; You are then immediately in the realm of reality but if he comes to me simply with a categorical refusal, an endless argument goes on at the end of which nobody is satisfied.  For that reason if the Minister would consult with those of his colleagues who remember the former system under the Old Age Pensions Acts, as compared with the existing system where some information is required to be given, I think he will agree it is better in the long run to give the reason and allow the matter to be argued on its merits and not on an amorphous sense of grievance which it is extremely difficult to define.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter earlier but unfortunately I had to leave the House for a short time and I do not know the nature of the Minister's reply.  I understand that he felt it was fully covered by the fact that in future oral interviews would be arranged.  I think that that would be quite impossible because there are so many planning decisions to be taken in an area such as Dublin that the responsible officers would spend all their time interviewing people.  It is only after the other channels have been explored that we should have recourse to that practice.  This is the sort of thing to which I have been objecting for years &mdash;injury to amenity, disposal of surface water in such a manner not acceptable, elevational detail unsatisfactory, and so on.  It would be just as easy to explain in what way a building was an injury to the district, or in what way plans had insufficient detail, or in what way the elevational detail was unsatisfactory and what would meet with the satisfaction of the officials.  If they simply wrote back and said: &ldquo;Your proposal to dispose of surface water in such a manner is not acceptable to us <Col N="1746" /> but if you did it in such a way, it would be,&rdquo; that would be a direct way of co-operating with the developer and we would make progress.</P>
      <P>We have excellent people in planning in Dublin but it is an easy way to report back.  The same people are coming back again asking &ldquo;why&rdquo; and the architect submits a fresh plan and perhaps it may have elevational details which are unsatisfactory.  I remember years ago, before I became a member of a local authority, complaining about this and asking if the planning officer would give some indication what elevational appearance would meet his requirements and he replied: &ldquo;Send me another plan and I will tell you whether it is right or wrong.&rdquo; That is not the sort of treatment that leads to co-operation and rapid development.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I want to refer to progress reports mentioned by Deputy Corish.  The Minister should give this matter sympathetic consideration, not alone as regards progress reports in reference to this Bill but in reference to county council reports in general and reports from county managers.  We do get reports from the Department of Health and from the Department of Agriculture but we have county managers all over the country spending on average £2 million per year and there is no such thing as a county manager's report.  Reports on this aspect are given to councillors, but in the interests of good public relations, and for comparison purposes from year to year and county to county, it would be an excellent idea to have such a report incorporated in the provisions of this legislation.</P>

Any member of a local <Col N="1747" /> authority who does not know what is going on, particularly after the annual estimate meeting of his council, could not have matters made any easier for him, or have a more lucid account of happenings, through any action we would take in this legislation.  What the Deputy is asking would, anyway, be inappropriate to this Bill.  If the Deputy still wants a report, there are ample opportunities under the County and City Management Act of 1955, which gives the local council, the elected body, the complete right to demand from the manager all sorts of information, including information about how he proposes to use his executive functions, apart altogether from minute details of such things as expenditure and so forth.</P>

      <P>I submitted amendment No. 77 which reads:</P>

      <P>My view is that in the following two amendments, Nos. 78 and 79, the Minister deals with the same question and I shall be satisfied to hear the Minister's intention when we come to discuss those two amendments, which actually incorporate part of mine.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 17, lines 16 and 17, to delete &ldquo;the constructing, erecting or making of any structures&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;development&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 79 can be discussed <Col N="1748" /> with this amendment.  The two amendments will serve to remove certain restrictions and bring us in line with existing British planning legislation. They will serve to widen the scope of the section and make it easier for the planning authority to accept the minimum outline of plans when giving decisions in principle.  That was really the purpose of Deputy Jones' amendment No. 77.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), paragraph (c), lines 23 and 24, to delete &ldquo;and to any other specified persons&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to get from the Minister the purpose of the phrase in this subsection &ldquo;any matters specified&rdquo;. The section refers to specified persons to whom the applicant will have to give information.  Could those specified persons include competitors in business? I adverted to this problem earlier.  If information to be supplied by an applicant were available to a business competitor, it could have serious repercussions on the applicant and I should like the Minister's assurance on this point: whom would the Minister regard as &ldquo;specified persons&rdquo;?  Would he give us the type of limitation he has in mind in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, first of all, put on record that this subsection is in respect of regulations that may be made by the Minister.  Having said that, then, let us get on to the really pertinent part of the issue, that is, who these other persons might be.  I will give a couple of examples of who they might be.  An applicant for permission, as the House is fully aware need not be the owner of property.  Where a <Col N="1749" /> decision has been taken on an application received from a person who is not the owner of property, it may be only right and proper, indeed, that the owner of the said property should be informed of the decision or the proposals, lest his interests might be over-looked. If it were, for instance, a question of refusal, the owner's lack of knowledge of the actual refusal for development would leave him unaware that he might be entitled to compensation for that refusal.  That is an example of what might be the position in that particular case.  There could be several cases, if that were elaborated. That is one.</P>
      <P>Another example would be the case of a party wall where something was proposed to be done to it or with it.  I think it only right that the other party to that wall should be notified of any proposals that might be suggested. That could be another type of case. Then we might have the question of excavations&mdash;say, the digging of foundations which, indeed, could possibly bring about the undermining of adjoining property.  Again, that could be a type of case and call in the type of person who is mentioned here&mdash;&ldquo;but any other specified&rdquo;.  That could be a specified person again, who by the regulations, as we examine the matter, we feel should be entitled to this type of notice in order that his interests would be protected.</P>
      <P>In so far as the type of information required to be given is concerned, it certainly would not include such things that are not really relevant to the matter at issue.  It would not include things such as where a man would get the money to do a certain job, or other such detail.  It would deal merely with the structural proposal or otherwise which in itself would affect the third or specified party, as the case might be, and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I say that, I say it on my own behalf, and no doubt on behalf of any Minister for Local Government who may follow me, because specified persons and the type of information to be given will be dictated in regulations by the Minister of the day.  So far as I am concerned, none of that sort of <Col N="1750" /> detail which Deputy Jones fears might be available to the detriment of the applicant, by being available possibly even to his business competitors, will be included or specified in the actual regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been dealing now with development.  It applies to land as well.  We have been dealing with the type of thing which comes up when land adjoins other land.  Take the information which a person might supply in regard, say, to a housing scheme on the verge of a built up area; information on what he proposes to do by way of access roadway, extension of water main, extension of sewerage facilities, and so on.  That would be the type of information which I assume he would have to supply under this type of application.  Would this information be conveyed, so, to a person with property contiguous to his property so that the person might become a competitor of the person proposing this type of development?  Could that not reasonably happen?  Could it not happen that that type of information would be available to a person and would so enable him to derive an advantage from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first of all say it is impossible, of course, to cover all possible eventualities.  We have to take that for granted before we start on any of these things.  Let me then say that in so far as any adjoining property holder would be a competitor in regard to any business, we should not forget the register and the various methods of publicising that for which permission is being sought or has been granted.  That type of publicity is available to the public in general.  In fact, it is our wish to make it available to them so that no person with a real interest will be unaware of what is happening.  When we keep that in mind also, the likelihood of there then being any further information requested or required to be given to some third party that would have any grave effect on a particular proposal is remote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot envisage very well an adjoining property-holder being entitled, merely because his land adjoins <Col N="1751" /> the land of the applicant, to get specific knowledge sent to him by the applicant in accordance with the terms of the section and amendment we are discussing. It is unlikely that there would be much he would need to know that he would not already know without any such action even being contemplated because of the existence of a register and the various other methods of publicity we are designedly bringing in in order to make the public aware. We cannot cover it off but I do not think it is a real danger.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 82:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 17, line 53, to delete &ldquo;and any other material considerations&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment the Minister just moved was to delete &ldquo;and any other material considerations&rdquo;.  I made reference to this on the Second Reading. I put the point of view that this could be capable of very wide interpretation.  The Minister's removal of that phrase at this stage does limit the effect of the type of application <Col N="1752" /> that could be inferred from the phrase &ldquo;and any other material considerations&rdquo;. To my mind, it is not really a cure for the situation because it incorporates all the conditions which are provided in subsection (2) and which are enumerated at the end of page 17, and on pages 18 and 19 of this Bill.  The terms of reference under which they operate in lines 46 to 53, ought to be sufficient for their needs and should be restricted to questions of whether the planning development is proper, having regard to the development plan, and any special arrangements should relate to their own area. If we look at subsection (2), we find the conditions laid down are extremely wide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt the adoption of amendment No. 81 would cover amendment No. 82.  The substitution we propose here will enable the planning authority to consider all the items in Section 26 which can be imposed as conditions in the granting of permission, including conditions for requiring contribution towards expenditure incurred by local authorities on works facilitating development and the giving of security for the satisfactory completion of proposed development works.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 83 would provide that all subsection (2) should be wiped out.  The fact is that a great part of it is already included, and the reason we elaborate on it is that there is a reference to &ldquo;planning criteria&rdquo;.  In subsection (2), there are a number of considerations that could not, strictly speaking, be regarded as planning criteria.  We felt it incumbent on us therefore to put these things in a more specified form.  By and large, that is the reason for this method of approach. There are matters that might not be regarded as coming within the term &ldquo;planning criteria&rdquo; and a dispute over interpretation might give rise to endless trouble, not to mention the deadening effect it might have on the provision as a whole.</P>

    <P>This amendment conforms to a degree with the views expressed by Deputies who spoke on this matter.  A change has been made to bring about an easement of the position.  Instead of having retrospection for seven years, as would have been the case, retrospection cannot now go further back than the appointed day.  Retrospection can only be in respect of something brought in after the appointed day when the person responsible would be aware of the law and would have due warning that this subsection would apply.  Even in such cases the amendment ensures they can go back only seven years and not more.  The real easement however, is that retrospection cannot go further back than the appointed day.</P>

      <P>Yes, in so far as those people are caught, but the real thing is that where these contributions will be sought in future, they will be sought by persons who will know that on and from the appointed day, this is the law.  That makes a real difference, apart from the differences it may make to existing developers.  It is a substantial change.  It is a big easement for existing developers who might have been caught as it stood but that is what we propose and it is in conformity with what has been said here.

      <P>I do not like to argue with the Minister but perhaps he is being too liberal.  I remember in my youth living in Chicago.  A gentleman there bought a large section of the prairie.  He had some influence with Chicago corporation and to the astonishment of all, the roads, sewers and the lights of Chicago struck out into the prairie.  He bought himself an estate in Florida and that was the last Chicago ever saw of him but at regular intervals over the ensuing 40 years&mdash;I think it still goes on&mdash;whenever he wanted to extend his demesne in Florida, he sold a corner site on what had been the Chicago prairie. The value of his property was in no way related to the soil but related to the sewerage and the water and lighting system which he had induced the corporation to carry out on to the virgin prairie of Illinois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is it prudent to say, at a time when certain of our cities housing <Col N="1756" /> development is progressing and must progress very rapidly if we are to meet urgent needs, to corporations in these cities in the course of providing essential amenities for a developed area; the general engineering plan of your own Department indicated that you should carry these improvements further out in order to give a completed job.  In respect of a quarter of this developed area, it has been built up but in respect of the other three-quarters, there is no housing on it but somebody is going to sail in and purchase the property, develop it and simply because this work was carried out six weeks before this Act came into operation, pay nothing for it, whereas if similar work was done hereafter, he would be liable for a fair share of the total cost?</P>
    <P>I do not think that prudent and certainly, if my experience counts, the Minister is in danger of creating not a permanent evil but what might become something of a scandal.  Is it unreasonable to say that if a person develops an area within two or three years of these amenities being provided by the municipal authority, he will become liable for whatever share is considered equitable under the new Act?  If he does not want to buy subject to that condition, he need not buy but it seems odd to have around cities like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and even Waterford a number of choice pieces of land of a character which can never occur again, municipally developed land in respect of which the developer makes no contribution at all, while the permanent Act, which we are in the process of enacting, provides that once it comes into operation, that can never occur again because we think it unreasonable that the developer should have the value of his land enhanced at public expense without an appropriate contribution from him.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that we could go into a long philosophical argument about Henry George and taxation of land values and the efforts of Lloyd George in 1909 to provide against this very contingency.  I should be prepared to make that argument but for the fact that, once the Bill now before us has come into operation, the <Col N="1757" /> question can never arise again.  Are we wise to create this anomaly of a certain amount of land in existence prior to the coming into operation of this Act which will have this peculiar value for the vigilant land speculator who fully understands this law?  There is a good deal of this kind of land around Dublin.  I suggest the Minister should have another look at this and I do not think anybody would regard it as unreasonable to provide that where land has been developed within two or three years prior to the passing of this Act, the person about to develop it would be required to make an appropriate contribution as defined by this Bill in respect of any development work done by the municipality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy and the House know, it is difficult for one to argue against an amendment that is really amending what he originally proposed.  That is my present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very creditable position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but it is not an easy position.  My original thoughts were embodied in the proposals in the Bill.  The amendment was the result of representations received and cases made.  I now find myself in the most awkward position of trying to defend an amendment which was only brought in because of representations and cases made.  It is a most difficult situation in which to find oneself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment, we are abandoning entirely the idea that any developer should pay anything by way of contribution for betterment as a result of the operations of a local authority. Without doubt, certain anomalies will be created but they will not be continuing anomalies.  Let me give an illustration: if we take the appointed day as the day as on and from which such contribution will be demanded, there may be on one side of a road lands which will be subject to contributions because of certain circumstances and, on the other side of the road lands immediately facing those subject to contribution for which nothing will have to be paid.  That kind of anomaly <Col N="1758" /> will be created, but it will not be a permanent anomaly.</P>
    <P>Unless we wipe out the contribution for betterment altogether, we are bound to create some anomalies.  It was put to me pretty forcibly that there are lands on hands, part of which may have been developed.  They have been purchased.  They may have changed hands several times from one developer to another.  They are provided with local authority services and have a certain value.  Suppose we were to anticipate and say that the appointed day would be two years from now, that would mean that the developer owning the land, for which he paid the market price in relation to its situation, water, sewerage and other services, would suddenly find himself faced with a charge he never anticipated and which he could not have been expected to anticipate.  That contribution would be levied on him retrospectively and it could well ruin him financially.  I doubt if anyone would agree to legislation which, even unintentionally, might ruin a person in his business.  It was because of the representations made to me I brought in this amendment.  It may have its defects and if the House can suggest a better way of overcoming the difficulties, I shall be prepared to listen sympathetically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, I think, all agreed that where land is developed in the municipal sense of the word, the least we can ask the owner is to make an appropriate contribution to the cost, and many would argue that he should pay the full cost.  A very strong argument could be made on that basis. We come now to the case of a man who has bought property under the existing law and who says that it is now proposed to change the character of his property by passing a law with a retrospective provision in it, that, because it is being developed by the municipality, he ought to make a contribution towards that development.  I think one could make the same argument about any man who bought whiskey out of bond before the Budget, or tobacco.  None of us is an angel in that respect.  I suppose there is not a publican or tobacconist who does not <Col N="1759" /> speculate a bit every 12 months; he takes it all in the run of the mill. Some years he makes; some years he does not.</P>
      <P>The property developer is not like an orphan child.  He is an intelligent, shrewd operator.  I do not suppose any of us know where the sewers run in the city of Dublin.  It has never occurred to us to root about in the City Hall to find out what the map can show us, but I venture to swear there is not a property developer who could not give you the name, number and colour of every sewer, footpath, road, lamp and yard of wire that the Dublin Corporation has strung during the past five years.  I venture to prophesy that he has a pretty shrewd anticipation, and a friend in the Corporation to warn him, of where the road is to go.  You will find him snuffing around like a setter dog trying to find out if there are any elderly ladies, or anybody else, out there who would like to liquidate their property in the area and come in and take a flat in Merrion Square.</P>
      <P>We are not dealing here with innocent children who know nothing about town planning.  Indeed, I wish we could get some of them to come in here.  They would make this debate even more elaborate than it is.  We have met deputations and a great many of these people know this Bill better than they know the Four Gospels.  I appreciate one cannot ever hope in legislation of this character to improve that which is perfect but one has to go as near to it as one can. I imagine if you fix two or three years, you will cover all the land which any municipal authority has in fact developed municipally, with consequent housing development.  Perhaps some of the people who are active in local affairs would correct me if I am wrong, but I should imagine that generally land which has sewers, roads, lights and water extended across it has been developed with buildings within three years of municipal development having taken place.</P>

    <P>I think if you say two years, you may beget the very anomalies the <Col N="1760" /> Minister is anxious to avoid, but if you say three years from the operative date, it covers virtually 100 per cent and if some particularly diligent bloodhound has discovered one per cent where he can circumnavigate the law, by the unanimous consent of the House, we would verbally pat him on the dewlap and tell him he was deserving of credit as an exceptional performer and congratulate him on having doublecrossed us in this particular case; but we would have effectively said that in so far as it was possible for a legislature to avoid anomaly and, above all, to avoid situations in which a doubt could arise as to whether an improper advantage had been taken of the law, if we provide that development undertaken by a municipal authority on a property being developed by a property developer three years before the coming into operation of this Bill when it becomes an Act will attract from the developer of the land the appropriate contribution which is set out in the Bill for all those who develop developed land after the coming into operation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition has put a reasonable proposition to the Minister.  Everybody is aware that development of the kind he has mentioned has been taking place on the outskirts of built-up areas within, generally, three years of the extension of water mains or sewerage lines or light.  Certainly, the person buying land like that has a more valuable property.  The Minister's point is that he has bought it at its value as it then exists.  I think he means that for the type of development he contemplates in these cases, generally housebuilding, he takes that into consideration in the price he will charge and the general procedure is that he recovers not alone his investment in building but also by virtue of the ground rents which are a feature of this type of property, he ensures that his investment is well remunerated and therefore, the development which has been done by the municipality or local authority could reasonably expect to be remunerated, as is contemplated now in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> The Minister originally proposed a period of seven years before the commencement of development.  We think it goes a bit too far and that the Minister ought to reconsider that point.</P>

We may be confusing ourselves a little by talking about works and development.  What is in question here are the works done by the local authority and not the works carried out by the developer.</P>

      <P>Have I understood the Leader of the Opposition correctly, that it would now appear from what he has put to the House that in addition to the terms of the amendment, we might also bring in in some way a going back for two or three years before the appointed day during which time any works of sewerage or roads or whatever it may be having been done by that local authority would have the effect of attracting betterment charges or contributions from the developer on any development that may arise in future?</P>

      <P>Does that not bring about a situation&mdash;again I am not saying that this is wrong because this is what I thought beforehand, although I have come to change a bit&mdash;that land, regardless of who owns it, which is capable, we will say, of housing development at present, stands marked into the book at a certain price which would work out at a figure per site of £X, and that by virtue of the adding in of the two to three years&mdash;the stipulation that Deputy Dillon has mentioned &mdash;that land would after the passage of <Col N="1762" /> this Bill into law become priced per site at £X plus&mdash;whatever the divide is into the betterment contribution which has been demanded?  I wonder is that a fair thing to do?  Is it a reasonable thing to do?  Is it the right thing to do?  I am not sure.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, what we are saying in this amendment now is that taking the appointed day as, say, the beginning of a new age, a local authority may demand in respect of land that is proposed to be developed or being developed for any particular purposes a betterment contribution from the owner or the developer in respect of works that they themselves have done not earlier than seven years before the date on which the development commences.  In other words let us put it this way&mdash;if in 1990 the local authority, Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council, were to demand a betterment charge for lands, say, in Coolock in respect of works that they had done in 1970, they would not be entitled to any benefit charge because they may not go back seeking that betterment charge beyond seven years which, if it were 1990, would mean that they could only demand a contribution for betterment in respect of any works done by them back for seven years and no further.</P>

      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would adopt that course.  I do not feel for the Minister's embarrassment in having to reconsider his own amendment.  This will be a good Bill, principally because the Minister has tried to listen to all sides, and to meet reasonable representations.  If it transpires <Col N="1763" /> that during discussions on representations made to him, he has leaned rather further in one direction against his better judgment, I do not think that is any reflection on him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  On the general question of principle in relation to the seven years about which the Minister has spoken, I am trying to see&mdash;and Deputy Jones and all of us are trying to see&mdash;what is fair.</P>
      <P>If a person is living on a demesne or a farm and the city is developing around him, and if he does not want to be developed, it is a great handicap to say to him: &ldquo;We are going to develop, whether you like it or not, and you are going to pay your share for the development&rdquo;, if that person simply says: &ldquo;I do not want to be developed.  I want to continue milking cows where that has been done for five, six, seven or eight generations, and I wish to stay here.&rdquo; The situation is wholly altered if that person proceeds to skim off his property all the surplus value created by municipal expenditure. Then it seems reasonable for the municipality to say: &ldquo;If you are going to benefit financially from the heavy outlay of the municipal authority, you must make your contribution towards the cost.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's test is a reasonable one.  If the property owner continues to reside on and farm his property as has been done for years, that is abundant evidence that he really did not want or desire the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If his assets are realised within seven years, whoever develops the land must pay the charge to provide against the case of a land speculator who may buy the land and seek to wait the statutory period in order <Col N="1764" /> to avoid making a contribution.  It will be dearer for him to sit with his capital idle, and pay rates on his agricultural land for seven years, than it would be to accept his liability under the Planning Bill for the appropriate contribution. Let us be realistic.  A man who buys land for development assesses the value of the land.  It would be highly improper if a land speculator should buy land and sit idle for seven years in order to avoid what is the relatively trifling expense of making his appropriate contribution towards the cost of development.</P>
      <P>As I say, no instrument the Minister can devise will be 100 per cent fool-proof, and no instrument will be absolutely fair in every conceivable case. Therefore, we should try to arrive at an instrument that will be as fair as we can make it, that will not be capable of ruthless exploitation at public expense by the wide-awake land speculator, and that will&mdash;and this is all important&mdash;operate to get land suitable for housing where houses should be built.  We do not want to create a situation in which a man can buy up an area of land where houses should be standing, and leave it to lie fallow for 15 or 20 years.  We want to create a situation in which we will induce the development of houses as quickly as possible and, at the same time, protect the municipality from fraudulent exploitation by cute operators.</P>
      <P>There are cases present to my mind into which I do not want to go and which could equitably be met by the suggestion I have made to the Minister and which would, at the same time, impose no undue hardship on the people who might become liable for a modest contribution towards the cost of development.</P>

      <P>Something comparable is done by the Revenue Commissioners in regard to ground rents.  If a land speculator buys land, the ground rents are capitalised.  If a farmer has land and building extends out of the city and he gives a site to someone to develop, the ground rents are not capitalised.  He is not a speculator.  It is already done in regard to ground <Col N="1765" /> rents and perhaps something similar could be done in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister says he will consider withdrawing the amendment, I should like to put a point which may possibly be overlooked.  When a local authority decide to provide facilities, water is usually provided first and sewerage follows pretty slowly.  After that, building takes place.  Surely that helps the local authority It creates rateable property.  Would the Minister not be wise to ensure that nothing is included in this Bill which might deter people from such development?  At present there is extreme difficulty in getting sites.  I am sure the Minister is as well aware of that as I am.</P>
      <P>I am sure he will agree that if an additional charge is put on by the local authority, it is met by the person buying the site and not by the person selling it.  That means that the site is dearer for the person who eventually builds the houses.  The Minister should be very careful to see that nothing is done in this Bill which would make the position worse than it is at present, or make it more difficult to get sites for house building.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to persons who are able to get prior information about where the city is to be developed.  The same thing happens in small towns.  We know there are people who you would think had not an idea in their heads, but who can tell you what portion of a rural district outside a town the town commissioners or the corporation have decided is to be developed or acquired.  That is beside the point because no matter where the development takes place, if the amenities are laid on by a local authority, eventually greater benefit will accrue to the local authority itself.</P>

While the application for the Minister's consent under this provision is being considered by the Minister, a situation could arise in which the applicant, by default, through lapse of time, could be deemed to have got permission.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties about accepting an amendment such as this is that both in this amendment and further on, it would remain in the hands of the Minister as to what he might allow in addition.  Harking back to what has been said already about the incidence of delay in dealing with applications, I am inclined to have my mind set against the amendments. There is provision of a couple of months within which the local authority has to make a decision on these matters.  That is all right.  On top of that, from the date of their declaring their decision and notifying it to the applicant, there is a further period of 30 days, in all, three months.  Until the end of the 30 days when it becomes evident that no appeal has been lodged and none can be lodged, no development can commence.  To add further to that time even by way of allowing the Minister to do it in a specific case does not seem justifiable.  There may be circumstances of which I am not aware or cannot conceive at the moment.  I say that on this side of the case, knowing that possibly at times an extension of time for dealing with these matters would be very welcome to any Minister or his Department. However, if somebody has a particular case or circumstance he can outline and which would make it necessary to have the power to extend the time, <Col N="1768" /> I shall consider the matter, but, generally speaking, I do not think it would be a good thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the appeals in relation to this Bill, in the main, those appeals are to the Minister.  In the ordinary way in legal proceedings, where a certain length of time is laid down for appeal, the court is enabled to decide in its discretion that an appellant should have some extra time. What we are seeking here is that, for a good reason stated, the Minister would have the right to extend the time for any length he would consider reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy who put down the amendment meant this to be of general application. It is a wise power to have in the hands of any Minister.  There might be a very good reason for extending the time in certain cases.  Everybody is not as slick a businessman as his fellow and, therefore, there should be some protection for the individual.  It seems rather odd that we are trying from this side of the House to give the Minister power, not power that would be obnoxious, and at the same time, he is trying to refuse it.  Perhaps it is an effort to obtain wisdom on both sides.  Perhaps in this instance the Minister could meet this side by allowing for the exceptional case.  I would emphasise that the Deputies over whose names this amendment appears intended to meet the exceptional case of the person who for one reason or another did not make the appeal in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When we consider that in this Bill we are taking steps to ensure that every interested person is made aware of the permission granted by the local planning authority, and when we consider that appeals can be made by anybody, any third party, against the permission, and that there is the publicity which I have mentioned &mdash;the register and so on, and all the paraphernalia we hope to introduce to wise him up to the fact that such permissions are being granted&mdash;and that he has 21 days in which to appeal, by the merest informal letter to the Department or the Minister, surely it will be seen that we are taking care <Col N="1769" /> of the interests of the third party?  If anything we are probably leaning over backwards for the benefit of the public who might be interested.  At the same time, we should not forget the man who is standing by, the property owner to whom permission has been granted&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the danger. Possibly a crank by acting as a third party could hold it up for a considerable period.  Is there anything to ensure that that cannot happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We already dealt with that.  Where there is a crank operating, it will not be long before we get to know him.  There is provision here in case of frivolous appeals so that that type of person will be discouraged on the basis that the Minister can apportion costs.  Taking it by and large we are going a very great distance to protect the interest even of the cranks or semi-cranks.  All the time the person who owns or controls the property is standing by and may not do anything by way of development and cannot do anything until the appeal is settled.</P>
      <P>The suggestion here is that power should be given to the Minister to stretch the time of 21 days further in certain cases.  The question is what would the certain cases be and what pressure would there be to have certain cases brought in, and so forth.  I do not think it is necessary.  If I did, I would be the first to put it to the House.  As I say, if anything, we are leaning over backwards for the third party's interests and at the same time, there is the danger that we may be forgetting the interests of the owner of the property who proposes to develop it for his own, or the public's, or the neighbourhood's benefit.  He can do nothing until the appeal is settled and why prolong that agony when the period allowed is fairly long as it is?</P>

      <P>There may perhaps only be odd cases but in previous sections we did have the case of people who may not be aware of the permission, despite these other provisions.  A person might not be in the country at this stage and may have an interest in the matter.  In any case, the Minister would <Col N="1770" /> be the final court of appeal as far as the amendment is concerned.  If the Minister feels that it is frivolous he need not grant the extension.  It is completely within his competence to decide whether it is reasonable or not. In one case the Minister might say that he could not give this because he was prevented by the Act, the time was up and he could not give this extension, whereas in our amendment the Minister has discretion to say: &ldquo;I think this is reasonable and I will allow the extra time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The answer to the other part of the question is that a communication was received in my Department on the 25th April, 1963 and was acknowledged by telephone and that I saw the Mayor of Limerick and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance in relation to the matter in my office on the 1st May and again at Shannon Airport on the 14th June.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. T. O'Donnell</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture what effect the recent extension of the quota for import of butter to Britain will have on the expected losses of An Bord Báinne, in view of the fact that British import prices are the highest obtaining at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The export of the additional 5,000 tons of butter to Britain this year will have the effect of reducing our stocks at the end of the season and will, therefore, involve additional losses in the current year instead of at some future date.  These losses will, however, be largely offset by savings arising from the recent improvement in prices of butter in Britain which will reduce the loss on the other exports.  The final outcome will, of course, depend on whether the current prices will be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not so that the levy is related to one-third of the cost of the export subsidy on butter?  If this extra quota of butter to Great Britain reduces our obligation to ship butter to other destinations where the subsidy required is substantially greater, will this not reduce the total subsidy burden with a probable reduction in the total of the levy to be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>All the law requires is that the producer will provide one-third of the losses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  The levy has been struck on the assumption that this additional quota was not available. It has since become available, and am I right in believing that that will reduce the total of the subsidy to be made, with a corresponding reduction in the one-third due by the farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no advantage to be derived, either from the point of view of the House or the producers, in making any forecast, but I do not think the arrangement which has been recently effected as to the additional allocation will have the effect of relieving the producers of the commitment for which they are legally responsible now.  As I said in reply to Deputies Donegan and O'Donnell, it is not possible to say just what the final position will be because of our inability to prophesy what the market for butter will be like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but we do know surely that, in effect, it costs us about 6d. a gallon less on milk to export butter to a British destination than to a European or Near Eastern region, and that ought to result in a substantial saving on the total butter subsidy required to finance butter exports from here?  Will the contribution of the producers' one-third be correspondingly reduced, or can the Minister give an estimate of what the likely reduction will be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it need not necessarily be so.  The broad general principle is that the producers will be responsible for one-third of the loss on exports and simply to ask me at this stage to make a forecast as to the ultimate effect of this year's trading by the arrangement recently made with the British is looking for the impossible. I cannot do it with any degree of accuracy, and I shall not attempt it.</P>

    <P>I received a proposal from the Tipperary (NR) County Council for the creation of an additional office of rate collector on the 22nd December, 1961. The original proposal involved also changes in the method of selection of persons to fill the proposed offices.  The local authority's letters of 22nd December, 1961, indicated that the matter was to be considered further by the local authority and consideration of the proposal was deferred until that had been done.  A further letter was received from the local authority on the 18th January, 1962, and the proposal in final form was submitted on the 19th April, 1962.  Reminders submitted by the local authority in the matter were dated the 3rd and 30th August, 3rd October, 22nd November, and 18th December, 1962, and the 12th February, 13th March and 15th May, 1963.  Consideration of the effects <Col N="1785" /> of the proposal on the cost of collection of rates in the district was deferred pending developments in relation to the general question of rate collectors' remuneration arising out of changes in the Agricultural Grant and no reply issued to the local authority.

Is he not aware of the fact that if you dial a call to Dublin, you are liable to get anybody in Dublin?  As far as subscriber trunk dialling is concerned, it is giving very unsatisfactory service in that area. Is the Minister further aware that two large businesses in Newbridge, which are considerably interested in the export trade, are finding their businesses frustrated by the disappointments they get when they have to use the telephone?  Would the Minister send somebody down to Newbridge to see what exactly is happening and with a view to applying a remedy to the unsatisfactory conditions there, which have now gone on for four to six months?</P>

One person dialled an insurance office in Dublin and got the Department of Defence.  You cannot talk to anybody in Newbridge on the subject of telephones without everybody wanting to complain.  There is something obviously wrong with the internal mechanism when you dial a Dublin number and get somebody in Letterkenny.  You will get numbers completely out of course altogether. Notwithstanding what the report before him says, the Minister should send somebody down to Newbridge to examine the situation.</P>

That situation no longer applies and there is now no danger of any such diminution in the value of these funds arising in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 90 and 98 might be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 90:</P>
      <P>In subsection (8), page 20, line 13, to delete &ldquo;of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;setting out with particularity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) of Section 27 reads:</P>
      <P>(5) A decision given under this section (whether on the original application or on appeal) by which permission is refused or is granted subject to conditions, and the notification of such decision, shall comprise a statement of the reasons for the refusal or the imposition of conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (8) is designed to ensure <Col N="1804" /> that where permission is refused, the planning authority will give reasons for refusing or for imposing special conditions.  The general Civil Service practice in such cases is merely to quote the relevant section of the Act as justification for the refusal of permission.  Such a communication gives no indication as to the real reason for refusal and the purpose of the amendment is to oblige the planning authority to set out the real reasons with particularity.</P>
    <P>We had some discussion this morning verging on this particular interpretation in regard to this subsection. Examples were quoted as to the type of reason given for withholding permission or imposing a condition.  An analogy is apparent with other legislation of which Deputies and the public have experience in dealing with Departments of State, particularly under the social welfare code, where an appellant is referred to a subsection of a section of an Act.  I suggest to the Minister that the reasons for rejection of an appeal should not be stated in that way under this Act.  The reasons should be set out with particularity so that it will not require an interpreter to explain them.  The reasons should not consist of the recital of a clause or subsection of a section.  The individual should be informed that his application contains an inherent defect which should be pointed out.</P>
    <P>The other amendment which we are taking with this amendment deals with an appeal and notification of the reasons for the refusal or for the imposition of conditions.  There are two types of cases which fall to be dealt with under this amendment.  The first is an original application made to the planning authority which is refused or is granted subject to modification and the modification is notified merely by reference to a subsection or section of the Act.  The second type of case deals with the upholding or rejection of an appeal by the Minister.  The Minister should give the reasons.  Where the planning authority have refused an application for reasons which seem good and sufficient to them and the Minister, having considered the evidence submitted to him, decides to allow the appeal, it is incumbent upon him <Col N="1805" /> to inform the planning authority, with particularity, of the reasons why he has allowed the appeal.  It has advantages both for the applicant and for the planning authority.  The applicant, as an individual, is in greater need of clarification.  He has not the advantage of having advisers to inform him.</P>
    <P>It may be that I am misinformed in regard to this matter.  If the Minister tells me that the reasons will be cogently set out so that the ordinary layman can understand the reasons for a refusal or for proposed changes or conditions imposed on the applicant, I shall be very pleased.</P>
    <P>We have had experience over the years of decisions coming from various organs of Government in cases where appeals have been made to Departments and the applicant was referred to subsection (3) of Section 2 of such and such an Act.  That is not the type of information which would be helpful to an appellant.</P>
    <P>In order to get goodwill and co-operation and to avoid frustration of the individual and of the planning authority the reasons for refusal of an application should be clearly and cogently stated.  That should apply also in the case of the imposition of conditions.  In the case of an appeal, the reasons for rejection or acceptance should also be clearly stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The architect who lodges a plan for a builder or developer and the corporation architect who receives it are both professional men and when the two cannot agree on a plan the official who rejects it must have some reason for doing so which the architect who lodges the plan may not know.  Is it not reasonable to suggest that if the architect has objections to a plan he should specifically state every one of them?  If he does that, the plan will be passed within four months at the outside.  If he does not specify his reasons, it may take 12 months or two years to have the plan passed.  That leads to loss of continuity of building in an area and the cutting down of building operations. People move out and if they have to be re-employed, it costs more money. <Col N="1806" /> That type of disruption leads to parttime employment.</P>
      <P>All I am asking is that, if possible, where a plan is rejected exact reasons should be stated and the conditions for acceptance of the plan if relodged. That would give the builder more time, would reduce costs and would lead to harmony between officials and builders.</P>
      <P>When a man rejects a plan he must have reasons for doing so.  Why not insert them on the rejection or disapproval form?  The builder's architect may not know the mind of the official architect.  The reasons should be exactly stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slight misunderstanding here as between what is contained in the Bill and what is proposed to be added by way of amendment No. 90.  Subsection (8) as it stands does set out that the notification of decision shall comprise a statement of the reasons for the refusal or the imposition of conditions. That is, in fact, what we propose in this Bill at the moment, as distinct from the present situation in which no such requirement actually exists in the law, although in practice, to some degree, reasons have been given, possibly vaguely at times, but nevertheless the practice has been developing.</P>
      <P>In this Bill as distinct from the present law, we clearly say in subsection (8) of Section 26 that the notification of the decision shall comprise a statement of the reasons for the refusal or the imposition of the conditions.  The only difference of opinion we have as between the subsection and the amendment is that the amendment wishes to insert that the reasons should be set out with particularity. Setting the reasons out with particularity could be very difficult to operate from the point of view of the local authorities.  It could be more difficult than the annoyance and the flustration caused by the lack of a requirement to set out the reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we insert the words in the amendment, we will bring about a situation which has been adverted to briefly by a speaker earlier today.  He envisaged a situation in which if you had a bit <Col N="1807" /> of property and you wanted to do something with it, you could bang in any old plan at all which had no hope of getting through, and to all intents and purposes, the planning authority would have to draw a plan for you.  I do not think we should go so far because we must remember our planning authorities are there to try to control and to a degree their overall functions in their day-to-day administration are not really of a positive kind.</P>
    <P>We cannot by any stretch of the imagination come to the point where a planning authority, by virtue of the wording of the law, would be obliged to do what was tantamount to planning in each individual case and that otherwise they would be rapped across the knuckles.  Subsection (8) is a result of our having had regard to the existing situation about which Deputies complain.  To go the whole hog would be overdoing it.</P>
    <P>I propose that while, according to subsection (8), the notification shall comprise a statement of the reasons for the refusal or the imposition of the conditions, that could be supported and made much more meaningful in the sense requested by the Deputy, if the Minister, by circular, by instruction or in whatever way you will, conveyed to the local authorities throughout the country that they should go as far as possible, consistent with their overall administrative duties in regard to the planning laws, to set out in a helpful way the reasons for refusal. If that would meet the situation, I should be quite happy to undertake it, and I shall probably do it anyway.</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion I could make.  We could provide that the notification of the decision would comprise a statement specifying the reasons or some such wording which would not be as detailed in its intent as the words proposed in the amendment.  I feel we would be going a little too far in inserting the words in the amendment. I understand the wish of Deputies who are sponsoring the amendment, but I feel that by overdoing it, we could offend in the other direction, and make the situation very difficult, if not wellnigh impossible, for some authorities <Col N="1808" /> where there is a big volume of applications to be dealt with.  It would make the smooth running of their planning administration very difficult.</P>
    <P>I am putting it to the House that we might deal with the matter in two ways. We might leave subsection (8) as it stands; it is a distinct improvement on and elaboration of the present law which does not require any statement of the reasons for refusal if the local authority do not want to volunteer such information, plus the added improvement we would hope to get by instruction through circulars to each and every planning authority setting out what we feel would be a reasonable approach to the requirements of subsection (8).</P>
    <P>On the other hand, and in conjunction with that, we might consider inserting the word &ldquo;specifying&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;statement&rdquo;.  That might go just a little further without going too far in the direction the amendment would tend to go.  I am throwing out those suggestions to the House for consideration.  I appreciate the point of view of Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's approach.  I think I conveyed to him what we have in mind.  We want to avoid being referred to a section or a subsection of some Act.  The Minister assures me that the statement will contain the reasons without going into them in great detail.  That goes a lot of the way to satisfy me.  He also suggests the words &ldquo;specifying the reasons&rdquo;. If that means what the Minister now says it means, the statement would set out in general, and not in particular, why the application is refused or conditions imposed.  That goes a long way to meet the objections we had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was reminded by my colleagues who had recourse to the planning authorities of the case where objection was taken to a plan and it was sent back as not being suitable.  The person in question got in touch with the local authority and asked in what way it was not suitable.  He was told: &ldquo;Submit a plan again and we will tell you about it.&rdquo; That is why we want this type of document or statement which will set out what ought to be <Col N="1809" /> done to improve the conditions so far as the applicant is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious to hear from the Minister whether he would specify his reasons for refusing or granting an appeal made to him, either to the applicant or to the planning authority. I should like to know the Minister's intent on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be obliged to give reasons for his refusal of an appeal.  In fact, that is in the proposals as they stand at the moment.</P>
      <P>The other matter mentioned earlier by the Deputy was that in upholding an appeal, the Minister should give reasons to the local authority.  We are getting down to very fine points when we start justifying the actions of the Minister for Local Government and the local planning authority.  We are beginning to make life a little too difficult for both strata at that stage.  I should say that in the annual report of the Department, which does not always follow quickly on the heels of the year in question but nevertheless does ultimately emanate from there, there are typical cases that have been decided, either upholding or refusing an appeal. It will give examples of the manner in which these appeals have been approached and the criteria on which they have been decided.  In other words, they will give annually a view of these matters, particularly if they are of outstanding complexity.  They will be listed and given in full detail, as if they were case histories, as a guide.  They will be given not only as a justification of the action of the Minister during that year in some of these typical cases but also as a sort of guide to the local authorities as to what has been taken into consideration in arriving at whatever the conclusion may have been.  In so far as that end of it is concerned, we shall be covering it to quite a degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to there being any apparent radical departure by the Minister on an appeal against the views of the local authority as they had determined the case, there are many ways and means of finding out, or attempting to find out, at any rate, <Col N="1810" /> from the Minister why he came to the conclusion he did as against the view of the local authority and altered their decision.  I do not think we should worry so much as to how things may stand between the Minister and the planning authority.  That is not the important part of it.  The matters which affect the public, on the one hand, and the local authority and the Minister, on the other, are the problems we have to iron out and which it is vital we should iron out.  Problems that might arise between ourselves are not insuperable.  I do not think, in relation to anything a local authority or a Minister does, that either of them cannot be brought to book in one way or the other ultimately, and that is our general safeguard in our treatment of each other as Minister and local authority.  However, the public we must try to safeguard in so far as laws can be devised to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; I am considering that.  That is something that would go a little further to clarify what is intended, plus the fact that we shall also send, by way of circular, introduction or otherwise, to our planning authorities our views as to what these things should contain in order to facilitate everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would properly come within the terms of a regulation.  If it does not come within that, we shall try to make it as our view and our wish as to the right way of doing things, as a general guide rather than a command.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the word mentioned, &ldquo;specify&rdquo;, I agree, provided it covers this point.  Heretofore, when <Col N="1811" /> there was a shortage of workers under a local body or pressure of business, they could just send some reason.  If the word &ldquo;specify&rdquo; is put in, does the Minister think that will cover the majority of reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have added this.  If, for instance, a local authority is so minded&mdash;I am not saying they will be but it could happen&mdash;that they get around whatever we might put here so that no matter what words we put in, they will not operate the provision in the spirit in which it is intended, when reasons for a refusal are given by the planning authority, if the applicant is not satisfied and feels he will get nowhere he has the immediate option of appealing and there will be the new facility of an oral hearing. Therefore, if there is any sign of dilatory action on the part of any local authority at any particular time in giving the reasons as we would wish them to be given under the law, the applicants can appeal, can have the oral hearing and then everything, plans, elevations and so on, will clearly emerge.</P>

      <P>As this subsection stands, a person is not entitled solely by reason of a permission or approval under this section to carry out any development.  I wonder what reason the Minister will advance for this subsection.  It would seem to be obvious that a permission or approval will not entitle a person to do something in relation to the property which he could not do if there never had been a Town Planning Act.  I wonder would the Minister justify this section on that ground.  There does not seem to be any reason for the subsection.  Would the Minister like to justify it for our enlightenment?</P>

For instance, a person who might apply for planning permission does not have conferred on him by that permission any rights to erect a structure or maintain it and have it in a particular place unless he has cleared his rights to ownership in so far as the property is concerned.  This subsection is really setting out that the mere getting of a planning permission conveys no rights to the proposer other than planning permission.  It in no way assists a person who has not otherwise cleared his other obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a long section and it provides a lot of the machinery by which town planning will proceed in an orderly fashion.  I want to reiterate what I said previously.  In this matter of conditions which will be imposed on individuals, I hope that town planning authorities, having made a plan on good principles, and having had the benefit of the instructions and regulations which the Minister will issue, will use these to get from the public the type of co-operation which is both desirable and absolutely necessary.  I have been assured and reassured by the Minister in regard to some of the matters which we thought were objectionable and he has clarified quite a number of these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the section, when it is <Col N="1815" /> operated by the planning authorities, will at all times be used, as it is intended, for the good of the neighbourhood or locality in giving the widest possible liberty of action to the individuals in the local authority area. That is the wish of the Minister and the House in regard to this type of legislation.  There were portions of the section which we felt were unreasonable but the Minister has to a certain extent met these fears and has expressed the hope&mdash;which may be regarded as more than a pious hope&mdash; that the local authorities will operate the section with the same intent as has been discussed here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 93 (b):</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 20, line 42, after &ldquo;structure&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and for the retention of which permission is not deemed to have been granted under subsection (*) of this section&rdquo;. (*) Subsection (1) proposed to be inserted by amendment No. 93a.</P>
      <P>I adverted to the fact earlier that a large proportion of structures exist throughout the country in respect of which there is a general permission. These structures are mostly advertisements. They are so numerous that they are well known in the areas where they are erected.  The effect of this amendment would be to ensure that, where they are in existence after the Act comes into operation, within a period of six months if notification has not been given to the individuals concerned, permission may be assumed to have been given for the continuance of these structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> It would be perhaps a much easier and a much less costly manner of dealing with these structures than that the people who owned them would be asked to make application to the planning authority.  If that were to prevail, I could imagine some of the technical staff in the local authority going out to find where these structures were. It is easy to find them because they are mainly situated on highways but, from the point of view of familiarity breeding contempt, we pass them by without taking notice of them.</P>
    <P>However, by this time, with the Bill being debated in the House, the advisers of the planning authority would have them listed.  If there are any that are offensive from the point of view of being badly constructed or from the aesthetic point of view, they would be already written down in the lists and it should be a simple matter for the local authority to notify the owners at an early date after the coming into operation of the Bill that they were objectionable.  I would hope that the effect of this amendment would be to ensure a more ordered and quicker type of development in regard to these matters than had the owners of the structure themselves applied in respect of each one of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that, having dealt with amendment No. 72 (a), we had really dealt with all these matters.  If we were to accept the amendment, we would have to go back and amend Section 24.  That in itself would not have been an impossible task, but take the case made by Deputy Jones.  I should like to set out a few reasons why even now we do not feel it would be a good thing to accept this reduction of time from a five year period to six months.  Six months would be the first six months after the appointed day and it would also be the first six months of the three year period within which a draft plan would have to be made.  Naturally, from the appointed day to the date of acceptance by the elected members of the draft plan will be a very difficult period for technical staffs.  To say to them that on the appointed day, or within six months of it, they must make <Col N="1817" /> a special survey in order to ascertain what is unauthorised or otherwise in their area&mdash;and not only that but that they should take the steps that should be taken&mdash;would create untold difficulty. It would be a task beyond the capacity of a planning authority or their officials.</P>
      <P>It is far more sensible to leave the situation as it is&mdash;that there will be a five year period, including the period of three years in which the draft plan will be in the course of preparation and during which there will be general surveys for the purpose of drawing up the draft plan.  In that process, these structures will emerge in the ordinary course and will not create a special problem.  Therefore, the imposition of this five year period could not be held to be any penalty on those who own these unauthorised structures.  If the unauthorised structure eventually turns out to be one about which the planning authority have grave objection, and if it were to be on the six monthly basis, it would mean that six months after the appointed day the owners of these unauthorised structures would be out of business, whereas under the present proposal, if it were an objectionable structure it would be five years before the owner was, as it were, brought to book.</P>
      <P>In fact, if it is not brought to book through any lack of persistence by the planning authority, the structure would, through lack of any action, come to be a legally authorised building as against its present status of unauthorised building.  I cannot see it would be to the detriment of any person who may own these unauthorised buildings that we should leave the five year rather than the six month period. It would, in fact, add four and a half years to the useful life of the structure. In the other cases, no harm is coming to them as a result of the five years probably elapsing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very good reasons, I think, why we should not have a special task force to go out and find them, wherever they are, and then take action in every case and go through the whole paraphernalia of consideration, rejection and probable appeals <Col N="1818" /> arising from them, and so on.  We do not necessarily have to do that.  This information will come as a matter of course from the surveys which will come after the appointed day by the planning technical officers.  Without adding in any way to their overall onerous task, it will emerge as a factual statement of unauthorised buildings in the area.  We are not putting pressure on them.  We shall be sensible and approach it in a general way in the drawing up of the whole draft plan.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what we have already decided in amendment No. 72 and Section 24, I think the argument could well be said to be slightly in favour of leaving the proposal in the Bill as it is in the belief and knowledge that it does not harm those who have the unauthorised structures.  It is an advantage to those who have objectionable unauthorised structures and, overall, it will facilitate, I think in a difficult time, the technical people of the planning authorities who will have their hands more than full in the initial years in getting this thing under way.</P>

      <P>A number of amendments are cognate to amendment No. 94.  A series of alternative amendments has been submitted by Deputy Jones and others.  For the purpose of debate, perhaps the House would agree to take a number of these together?  It is suggested that the following amendments could relevantly be discussed together&mdash;Nos. 94, 95, 110, 111, 130, 131, 149, 150, 158 and 159.</P>

    <P>This amendment is designed to meet the representations of Deputies, including particularly Deputy Jones, who argued that the phrase &ldquo;and any other material considerations&rdquo; could be misleading. That was their case on this. It was also argued that it might be capable of abuse.  The amendment proposes to delete these words &ldquo;and any other material considerations&rdquo; in line 55.</P>
    <P>The section relates to structures which existed immediately before the appointed day and which on the commencement of that day are unauthorised structures.  The section also provides that application may be made to the planning authority to retain the structures and it may refuse or grant it. I take it that, in so far as the deletion of these objectionable words is concerned, Deputy Jones may have something to say but will not ultimately object.</P>

I think, in the main, the amendments which stand in our names are really at one with these amendments which the Minister is proposing.  It is a wise thing, as we said originally on Second Reading, to be more specific and the Minister has now done that by taking away these words which may be too wide.  In so far as that has met us, I do not see any reason for prolonging discussion on these and the other amendments which, I take it from the Minister, are in line with that.</P>

      <P>To delete subsection (2), page 20, lines 56 to 58 and page 21, lines 1 to 22.</P>
      <P>This really is in line with the type of argument which I made on previous amendments.  It is in line with the logic of amendment No. 95 where we already spoke of trying to confine the planning authority to the broad terms. On the previous amendment, the Minister felt that to confine it to the terms of reference laid down in lines 49-55 was not wise.  I would hope that, by leaving in this subsection (2), the planning authority officials would still use the section in such a fashion as not to include things that were not necessary for the proper and orderly planning of the particular area.</P>
      <P>Restrictions are imposed in the Bill. In this subsection, quite a number of restrictions are imposed on the individual. The Minister said in a previous subsection that he felt these were necessary.  On discussion, the Minister advanced the argument as to why the subsection should stand.  I do not think there is anything further I can usefully say in regard to it beyond referring again to the Minister's view that if this is not left in the Bill the planning authorities would be restricted in some way.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate even more fully at this stage than I did when the amendment was put down what was in the mind of the Minister when this section was put into the Bill.  I can see even more so now the necessity for such things as planting trees and shrubs. Therefore, I am prepared to accept the Minister's assurance that this provision is necessary for proper town planning.</P>

      <P>Before subsection (6) to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) Where permission is granted under this Part of this Act for the construction, erection or making of a structure, the grant of permission may specify the purposes for which the structure may be used; and if no purpose is so specified, the permission shall be construed as including <Col N="1823" /> permission to use the structure for the purpose for which it is designed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that, where permission is granted for the erection of a structure, the grant of permission may specify the purposes for which the structure may be used and if no purpose is specified the permission shall be construed as including permission to use the structure for the purpose for which it is designed.  This would avoid the position where permission is sought for the erection, say of a dwelling house which, on first occupation is used as a shop.  Another case is where permission is granted for the erection of a store and on first occupation it is not used as a store but as a factory. If this situation is not clarified as proposed, persons could get around the control of use and that would be creating quite a large gap where we are trying to close gaps with these general provisions.  The Bill provides that a material change of use requires planning permission, a change from one use to another, but on first occupation of the structure there would be no change of use so that the use control provisions of the Bill would not apply. That is why we find it necessary to propose this amendment so that control of use shall be properly maintained and capable of being maintained.</P>

      <P>A person under this section may obtain permission for the erection of a structure for a specific purpose, in which event the structure can be used only for that purpose, if I understand the Minister correctly. There is no provision authorising the town planning authority, the Minister or even the court, in the event of the use for which the structure was erected ceasing to exist, obtaining permission for the use of the structure for any other purpose.  In this case, I should like the Minister to clarify the position generally.  If the amendment is agreed to, is the right of an owner to apply for permission to use the structure for a purpose other than that for which he originally obtained permission, protected?</P>

    <P>The purpose of the paragraph does not seem very clear.  I should like the Minister to explain what exactly it is intended to achieve.  On ordinary reading it would seem to be a limitation of the rights of ownership and a limitation on the full enjoyment of property.  If a planning authority have any grounds for grievance in relation to the wrong use of land or the use of land in contravention of the Act, there are means available to them under this measure to prevent such wrong use.

      <P>I move amendment No. 109:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (6), page 25, lines 3 to 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (6) deals with the obliging of the local authority to buy land where permission to develop it has been refused, or granted subject to conditions which the landowner claimed render the land incapable of reasonably beneficial use in its existing state, and the land cannot be rendered capable of reasonably beneficial use <Col N="1827" /> by the carrying out of other development for which permission has been granted under the Act; and, where permission was granted subject to conditions, that the land cannot be rendered capable of reasonably beneficial use by the carrying out of the permitted development in accordance with these conditions.  In such circumstances the landowner may require a notice to be served on the planning authority requiring them to purchase his interest in the land.  Provisions are then made for the making of an application to the planning authority requiring them to purchase the land compulsorily.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) which this amendment seeks to delete, provides that in determining what would be the beneficial use of land no account shall be taken of any prospective use of that land which would involve the carrying out of development of any class which is not exempted development.  This is a restriction which could work out very unfairly.  In addition to the matters which are regarded as exempted development it is specified in subsection (2) of Section 4 that the Minister may, by regulations, provide for any class of development being exempted development. Exempted development is, therefore, a variable.  It is variable in accordance with the regulations which the Minister may make from time to time.  In one particular year an owner of land might find himself not entitled to have certain development taken into account, because it is exempted, and in another year another owner of land, by reason of regulations made by the Minister, might be entitled to have certain development taken into account because it has, by regulation, been made exempted development.  I do not think that is the type of subsection which should be permitted in legislations like this.  Subsection (6) of Section 29 provides:</P>
    <P>Where, for the purpose of determining whether the conditions specified in paragraphs (a) to (c) or paragraphs (a) and (b) (as may be appropriate) of subsection (1) of this section are fulfilled in relation to any land, any question arises as to what is or would in any particular circumstances <Col N="1828" /> be a reasonably beneficial use of that land, then, in determining that question for that purpose, no account shall be taken of any prospective use of that land which would involve the carrying out of development of any class which is not exempted development.</P>
    <P>Exempted development is dealt with by ministerial regulation.  One person may find himself able to claim that his property should be acquired by the local authority because he is not allowed to use his land beneficially and another may suffer the disability of finding himself not entitled to the beneficial use of his land because, by ministerial regulation, he has been deprived of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection is contrary to prudent legislation.  I can imagine a situation in which a local authority produces a plan, setting aside an area for industrial development. That development having taken place &mdash;this has happened in my constituency &mdash; certain disabilities follow for certain people.  There may be obnoxious fumes from factories, and so on. In my constituency, a man who was carrying on horticultural activities by choice actually had a very valuable holding, far more valuable, as he knew, than the profits he could hope to derive from it through agricultural or horticultural activities.</P>
      <P>The reason he had this valuable holding was that it was an area which according to the plan was open to housing development or industrial development and was therefore far more valuable than its value as agricultural land.  The reason it was far more valuable is removed in the assessment of the purchase price if the local authority are to buy it from him because he can no longer carry on because of the smoke and fumes from the industrial activity in close proximity. That may sound far-fetched but, in fact, it is not.  In my view, it would appear to be unfair to that individual.</P>

      <P>The section is inserted in order to give some redress to a person holding land that is incapable of reasonably beneficial use in its existing state and who is not permitted some proposed development which he feels will give him a good return.  Subsection (6), which the amendment proposes to delete, affords some guidance to the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;reasonably beneficial use&rdquo; on which to a large degree will hinge the decision as to whether or not he is to get compensation. An application to purchase land on refusal of permission cannot be imposed on a planning authority by service of a purchase notice under Section 29, unless the land has become incapable of reasonably beneficial use in its existing state.  This subsection (6) makes it clear that a claim may not be disqualified unless the existing use of the land or any alternative use is found to be reasonably beneficial, provided that in considering alternative use no account is taken of any use involving the carrying out of development other than exempted development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense, I would put it to Deputies that the deletion of subsection (6) would to a degree weaken the section as a whole, which, by and large, is there in order to enable some redress to be given to the owner of land who is prevented, for one reason or another, under planning legislation, from developing it in a way that would be beneficial to him as against its existing condition which he may hold is non-beneficial.  The deletion of subsection (6) by acceptance of amendment <Col N="1830" /> No. 109 would weaken that redress which the whole section is intended to give the owner of land in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>I do not understand what the Minister means when he says this does not affect agricultural land. What I was thinking of was a market gardener who found himself within this industrial area which, according to the plan, was being developed as such, and who as a result of industrial fumes or any other reason, found the land was incapable of reasonable use.  This man now is in the position of seeking to have his land bought from him by the local authority.  This land was always far more valuable than its use to him and he was quite aware of the fact, but, with his way of life, was giving him a profit.  In using these lands, he was employing far more capital than the profit therefrom would justify.  The situation as I see it is that this man cannot get account taken in the assessment of a fair sum for the purchase of the land of the fact that for years he was using a far greater capital value in land than the ordinary profits therefrom.  I may be dense but that is the way I see it.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that what Deputy Donegan is talking about, while akin to the matter we are dealing with, is not at all the same thing.  The owner of the land with whom the section deals would have proposed a development which would have been refused by the planning authority and only consequent upon that and for various reasons would he then be enabled to require the local authority to purchase the land from him.  Deputy Donegan's case refers to a man who has, for instance, a market garden which as a result of other developments becomes not so useful or not usable at all as a market garden because of smoke or pollution or so on. He thinks that is the type of case we are dealing with.  That is not so.  We are dealing with the case where the owner of the land proposes a development that is turned down by the planning authority.  The case put by Deputy Donegan is where the activities of developers of adjoining lands have a <Col N="1831" /> detrimental effect on the market garden potential of the person's land.  They are two distinct things.  We are not dealing with that case in this section. I want to get that quite clear.  The type of case mentioned by Deputy Donegan is not dealt with by this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>This section refers to the beneficial use of land, and it is the section under which the owner who feels himself aggrieved in certain circumstances may require the authority to purchase his land.  I am not too happy about it in so far as its variable content is concerned, if by way of regulation the Minister can determine what is an exempted development at one stage, and if a situation can arise that it has become variable and the development is no longer exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear on another Section that of two individuals having the same type of problem, one can feel aggrieved by the type of interpretation which we would give to this question of exempted developments.  In the ordinary way this section obliges the planning authority to buy land from a person who has been refused or granted permission according to certain regulations.  A <Col N="1833" /> person may feel he cannot use his land beneficially, and he is entitled to oblige the local authority to purchase the land from him.  In addition to the matters already classed as exempted developments, there is provision that the Minister may make regulations under subsection (2) of Section 4 to provide for any class of development being exempted development.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that an exempted development is a variable in that instance.  It may change from year to year or from time to time. In one year, the owner of land might find himself not entitled to have a certain development taken into consideration, and in another year, may be entitled to have a certain development taken into account.  In certain circumstances, the property owner may not be dealt with in an equitable fashion.</P>
    <P>It is clear that if, by regulation, the planning authorities are to schedule areas for development in certain ways, and control the usage of land, then that usage is necessary for the type of planning and development which the Minister envisages in this Bill, but if a person feels that he is aggrieved under this section, and that he cannot use his land as benefically as he had hoped to use it by reason of conditions that are imposed on him, the exempted development figures very largely.  Of course, that is particularly true of land which is rather close to the builtup areas, or to the areas where industrial development is taking place.</P>
    <P>The Minister says it may never happen but it is certainly conceivable that by way of ministerial regulation, irrespective of who is in charge, a change may occur in so far as land-owners are concerned.  I am not terribly happy about the determination of the questions arising from what is the reasonably beneficial usage of land. Perhaps the Minister would advert to that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jones is probably placing too much emphasis on the question of exempted developments which, in the context of this question, would be of no great significance at all.  He is probably placing <Col N="1834" /> greater emphasis on exempted developments and exempted structures than is called for in the light of the general intent of the section.  The intention of the section and of the Bill is that if a landholder makes an application to his planning authority for permission for a development and is refused that permission, or such penal conditions are attached that it is tantamount to a refusal, the applicant then becomes the appellant and makes an appeal to the Minister who, in turn, may confirm the views of the local authority and refuse the appeal.</P>
      <P>At that stage the landholder, or the proposer, or the developer, would approach his local planning authority by serving a purchase notice on them and indicating that his development proposals, which had been refused in the first instance by the planning authority, had been refused on appeal. Assuming that the planning authority refused to act upon the purchase notice, the next move would be that the Minister is again brought into the matter by being invoked through appeal by the aggrieved party and, in this instance, if the Minister is satisfied that no reasonably beneficial use could be made of the land other than that which had been proposed and refused, he may decide, subject to the guidance of subsection (6), in favour of the appellant.  That would bring about a situation in which either the land would be purchased by the planning authority on the one hand, or compensation would have to be paid on the other, if it was not agreed that purchase was going to take place.  By and large, the whole intent of the section is to give redress to this type of applicant or appellant.  Subsection (6) is a very necessary provision for the guidance of the Minister and for the benefit of the appellant and the applicant.</P>

      <P>Let me give a few instances of what exempted development in this type of case would be: a greenhouse, a potting shed, a toolshed, a cycle shed, a fuel shed, and so on.  It is these smaller and insignificant types of structure or development that are in mind and Deputy Jones has given to exemption in this section and as it is related to this section an exaggerated importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 states what is exempted, and these which we propose to issue by way of regulation or otherwise would be marginal additional exemptions.  Section 4 states positively what are exempted and they are the major exemptions.  What we suggest here and what would be of importance to Section 29 would be marginal exemptions which would be of the nature of greenhouses, toolsheds, fuel-sheds and that sort of smaller development.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 112:</P>
      <P>In subsection (5), page 25, line 41, to delete &ldquo;completed&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;commenced&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) reads:</P>
      <P>The power conferred by this section to revoke or modify permission to develop land may be exercised&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where the permission relates to the carrying out of works, at any time before those works have been completed.</P>
      <P>This is the section whereby things which are brought to the notice of the planning authority will influence them in modifying the permission which they already gave.  In other words, permission to erect a structure already commenced could be revoked and the building demolished.  It would seem in this instance the planning authority have it all the way.  They ought, in the first instance, to be required to make up their minds in regard to the type of permission they will give.  A developer of property at that stage should have some certain knowledge of the type of permission he has and what he can do under this section.  The landowner is equally entitled to this knowledge and he ought to be entitled to the knowledge that the permission he has got for development will not be revoked.</P>
      <P>There have been cases where this type of development has taken place and it is most unfair that the planning authority in such cases should be enabled to change their mind in regard to the permission they have given. When the proposition is put before them in the first instance, they have had the technical staff available to examine the proposal.  They have had it long enough to determine whether the type of development which is proposed is reasonable and proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very topical case in this and it certainly pinpoints the whole purpose of the section.  If somebody seeks permission to erect a building and having got permission&mdash;I want to emphasise that&mdash;he should not find, having gone a certain way, that he may have to comply with regulations <Col N="1837" /> or a change of permission and have to demolish his work.  This is unreasonable. In the first instance, the planning authority should ensure that their examination of the proposals has been carried out meticulously enough to ensure that permission is a certainty in so far as the development is concerned.</P>

      <P>I feel that this is rather as if the Department and the Minister wanted to have three parachutes, instead of two.  It seems to me that the Minister has a real responsibility to tell us, very lucidly, why it is necessary to have this power to revoke. The expense that can be incurred, even in engineers' and architects' fees, is considerable and the amount that could be incurred in the development of land, even before building is more so.  A horrible set of situations could be set in train if a revocation did take place, or even a modification, some time after permission had been given. The development of a site is a highly expensive business.  However you look at it, the individual citizen is in grave danger as long as the section remains in the Bill.  Legislation, as well as looking after our people and trying to put things on a proper footing, should also see that the individual is not trampled upon.  It is also necessary that the Minister should give us examples of where such power would be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As a person who has, in the professional end, some little experience of building development in general, it seems to me, if I understand it correctly, that it will have the effect of completely stopping development. No developer who proposes to develop a building scheme in a big way can possibly face that development, if he feels that, having got permission and having got all his arrangements streamlined into effect, there is a possibility of being stopped without his consent halfway through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with a case in which a person has applied and has produced all the appropriate information prior to the application and, having done that, has been given his permission. The basis upon which that permission was given is not in issue. We are not suggesting that the power, <Col N="1838" /> as in, say, financial legislation, could not be varied if there was fraud in the submission of the plans or anything like that.  Nothing like that is in issue.  A person makes a plan when he goes on a site to carry out a big development and he does that on the basis of running through it.  If he is not able to plan with certainty that he can run through it and go on from the development, if you like, of the first half-dozen houses to the remaining 24 houses in his scheme of 30, he cannot really plan where he is going.</P>
    <P>Unless in relation to what one might term speculative building estates, there is complete certainty at the beginning, of where the person concerned can go, you will have either of two things.  You will either have substantial costs added to the development, because it will be a stopping and starting operation, or people will be afraid to start at all or certainly afraid to start at an early date.  They will want to allow the planning permission to lie there for a time to see if there is any possibility of second thoughts in relation to the power of revocation or amendment. The margin of profit in relation to sales and development of that sort by these people, by the speculative builder or owner, should be kept as low as possible.  This will not assist in bringing that margin of profit down.</P>
    <P>I can see that there could be a necessity occasionally to amend or to revoke permission for a particular purpose, but it should be only on the basis of the amendment being made with the consent of the person, or his representative, to whom the original permission was given.  I cannot see otherwise how there can be the certainty in relation to the planning of overheads, in relation to the planning on the site itself, if the developer feels that at any time the permission obtained could be changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister will readily concede that there is quite a substantial what I would call head office overhead personnel machine, necessary for the planning of development of this sort by the builder, be he speculative or otherwise.  It is impossible to run such a machine economically, unless there is an even flow and unless the people concerned are able to see with certainty <Col N="1839" /> for some period ahead where they are going.  I cannot see the certainty being there at all if this power of amendment or revocation is kept.  I will put it this way: it seems to be such an extraordinary provision that I feel it may be possible there is some point in it which I and my colleagues have missed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing we seem to have ignored or to have missed is that any operations by way of modification or revocation of planning permission granted will carry full compensatory measures from the planning authority in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but it would be very difficult to bring in the consequential loss on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but nevertheless to start off with, it is a fairly high premium which the planning authority would have to pay if they needlessly, or frivolously, or as a result of negligence, were to leave themselves in the position that such revocation or modification would be required in any of the plans they had approved.  In addition to compensation, it can so happen in this case that a personal notice under the previous section can also be sought and the whole outfit, lock, stock and barrel, of half-finished or imperfectly-finished state of development might be foisted on to the local authority or the planning <Col N="1840" /> authority, if they in fact seem to make a complete misuse of this section.</P>
      <P>The section as now drafted provides for the revocation or modification of permission at any time during the course of the works and before they are completed.  The section was really drafted, having in mind the rather large housing estate development which possibly would have commenced a considerable number of years previously and was done in planned stages but during the passing of time, from the time the original permission was sought and granted, new factors have emerged.  For instance, it might be the realignment of a roadway not all of which is completed in the estate which would tie in more readily with some new road development of the planning authority.  It is for that type of situation that the section has been drafted and it conforms in spirit to the general spirit of our new conception of planning laws, which is that it should be flexible, if there is in fact to be any progress with planning at all. We have found ourselves in our present position with regard to planning laws due to the fact that the laws if put into full operation, would have been completely inflexible.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
