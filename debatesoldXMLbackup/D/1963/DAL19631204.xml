      <P>Is it not a fact that in this war between the local authority and the farmers in Kilkenny, in which I have no personal interest, the Minister has declared that the Offences against the State Act will be used?  Is it not also a fact that the local authority in Kilkenny have taken the first step by taking a sum of 12/- from an unfortunate disabled lady as revenge for the fact that her brother took part in the withholding of rates from the local authority ?  Would the Minister say now if it is a fact, or otherwise, that the Offences against the State Act is to be invoked against <Col N="482" /> the weaker section of the community while the large farmers and the ranchers are left untouched ?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that this lady who is disabled and in receipt of 12/- per week from the local authority is having that amount stopped because her brother, in company with others, is refusing to pay a certain amount of rates?  Will the Minister say why the local authority does not take action against many of these men who can afford to pay ? They take action against a disabled person while men who could afford to lose a half a dozen bullocks or a hundred barrels of wheat are left untouched. This matter is to be treated in a very serious fashion and the Minister has said that the Offences against the State Act is to be invoked. Does the Minister say that it is still his intention to invoke the Offences against the State Act ?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was dealing with the question of why Sligo is not regarded as a congested area as far as migration is concerned.  That has become clear to me as a result of question and answer over the past year or so.  I would ask the Minister to state if he is prepared to regard Sligo as a congested area for the purpose of migration.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, I welcome this Bill.  I sympathise with any Minister who has the courage to tackle such a gigantic problem.  In my opinion, there is not sufficient land to distribute amongst the land-hungry people.  Some 15,000 acres are held by the Land Commission in the midlands.  Those broad acres would help to resettle 200 or 300 families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that the west is dying, even though it may be a slow process.  There is very grave concern among the people in the west about the future.  This requires a forthright and courageous policy by the Government, because this is a Government responsibility.  That policy must be put into operation before it is too late to save the west. As I said before, I can foresee the day when the west will become a shooting ground and fishing place for foreigners. Depopulation is going on at an alarming rate.  I welcome the Bill, therefore, as an effort to do something <Col N="502" /> concrete for the west.  No matter what Deputies from other parts of the country may say and no matter from what side of the House they say it, it must be remembered that our problem in the west goes back to the 1st May, 1654, when Cromwell issued his famous edict telling the non-settlers in the remaining parts of the country to go to hell or to Connaught.  The evil that besets us in respect of small farms stems from that.  I do not intend to go into the history of that, because I think the position is well known.</P>
    <P>If the depopulation of the west is to continue at the same rate, it will be disastrous.  Nothing can compensate for the loss of human flesh and blood. Animals, grassland or large farms will not compensate for it.  In my opinion, there are only two solutions to the problem.  If we carry out migration from the west&mdash;and I agree some must take place&mdash;we are, nevertheless, reducing our population.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  The small farmer can and might make a living on a small farm if there were proper encouragement, proper advice and, as was mentioned last night by a Deputy on the other side of the House, pocket industries in, say, towns of up to 1,000 population.  That is the only solution that I can see to the problem of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>I do believe the Minister is doing his best, that his intentions are good in this Bill.  There may be a few amendments required which he may meet.  As a Deputy from the west, I welcome any Bill designed to help to relieve the distress of the people there.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate yesterday, reference was made to the battering ram and all the rest.  One thing that I mentioned in that connection was the great clearances, when the battering ram was used to batter down small holdings in the west of Ireland in order to make an estate for a landlord. We have read about these things and they have left an impression on our minds.  The people outside the west who think that this Bill is designed for the west should look up the history of the famine days and read about the number of people who were buried <Col N="503" /> without coffins, even in the Minister's native county, in Swinford, in the workhouse there, and all over the west. To anybody who would criticise the Minister on the ground that he has brought in this Bill for the west only I say it is time that something was done for the west.</P>
    <P>The question of the pool of land available inevitably brings me to the question of the purchase of land by foreigners.  Personally, I am not against foreigners entering this country.  I welcome them.  A new infusion is probably due.  I welcome them in their own sphere, that of industrial development. The Minister should introduce legislation to preserve the land of Ireland for the &ldquo;mere Irish&rdquo; who are willing to work it and who do not wish to leave the country if they can get security in a reasonably good farm.  It would appear, at least to the ordinary individual, that the Government condone the buying of land by foreigners. I should not like to subscribe to that idea, but it certainly looks that way.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the Land Commission hold on to lands which they have acquired is a matter about which I have an open mind.  It depends entirely on whether the holdings are small or big.  In Sligo they have taken two holdings beside mine and I agree 100 per cent&mdash;I could not agree more &mdash;that the Land Commission are absolutely right.  They have two holdings. The amount of land is so small that it will settle nothing.  They are hoping that another one or two holdings will come on the market and that they will be able to settle something. From that point of view, I quite agree with the Irish Land Commission in holding on to land, if that is their object.</P>
    <P>In so far as large holdings are concerned, it has been suggested that they are holding on and making money out of them.  I know nothing about that. I do know that the officials of the Land Commission in Sligo are very co-operative and I can see their point at all times.  Certainly, I have no crib whatsoever.  I get any information I look for.  I am satisfied with the information <Col N="504" /> when the matter in question is explained to me.  I consider that they are operating in the proper manner.</P>
    <P>It has been asked if the Minister is serious&mdash;personally I have no doubt that he is serious&mdash;in hastening the relief of congestion in the west and in setting a target of a 40-45 acre farm. Personally, I do not think that will be achieved for the next 20 years.  It will be a gradual development.  If more work is to be done than has previously been done, there must be extra staffing, at least in local offices in the country.  That is logical.  I have been going into the offices of the Irish Land Commission in Sligo every Saturday for the past two or three years.  It is the same staff that is there.  They have not complained&mdash;I want to make that very clear&mdash;but extra work cannot be done unless extra staffing and extra money are provided.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a doubt as to whether extra money has been provided for the acquisition of land.  It has been stated that an extra £5 million is being put into the Land Bonds over the next five years and then it appears that already there was £1 million being spent.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that matter in concluding the debate.  I do want to emphasise the need for extra staff.  It is very difficult to get extra work done if you have not got extra staff.</P>
    <P>There appears to be quite an amount of confusion in respect of the recent statement by the Minister in regard to loans from the Irish Land Commission for the erection of houses.  I would ask the Minister to clarify the position as soon as possible, especially in respect of two points&mdash;the period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister just to clarify the matter about loan charges and the period of time and the interest charges.  I would suggest that he should take £100 over a period and indicate what the repayment would be over that period.  That would satisfy everybody and would be a simple means of illustration.  Would the Minister also tell us when replying whether a borrower can redeem his loan at a time to suit himself or must the loan run its full period?</P>
      <P>The only criticism I have to offer on this Bill is that the Minister said too much too soon about it.  In my county there was a bit of panic buying and selling and there was not much opportunity given to enter into the open market and find what the real value of the land was.  This will involve some difficulty afterwards for the Land Commission officers who are trying to acquire land.</P>
      <P>It is doubtful whether the small farmers in the west of Ireland will benefit to the extent to which they think they will benefit, that is, that everybody will be pushed up to 40 or 45 acres of land overnight and that economic salvation is around the corner.  I do not think that is correct and we should not encourage that point of view.  Not far from the Mayo border, I know a parish called Rathlee where the average size of holdings is eight statute acres.  There is intensive farming in the area and those eight statute acres are tilled from fence to fence and grazing land got for the cows.  Nothing can be done in that place.  There is no land on offer.  There is one farm there which would settle very little, and nothing can happen in that place unless there is migration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention the Lissadell estate. I understand the proceedings in that respect are <i>sub judice</i> and consequently I will not force the Minister to reply on it.  However, here are thousands of acres in the heart of the country and, having due regard to what the family concerned have done for Ireland and all the rest of it, I still <Col N="506" /> think it is a matter of expediency and, perhaps, charity that that estate should be taken over as soon as possible.  As every Deputy who knows the position will confirm, we saw acres and acres of meadow going to loss last summer and acres and acres of oats rotting in the ground all because the management had not the permission of the court to get sufficient labour.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make this Bill workable.  My earnest wish is that it will help to solve the problems of small farmers but I would not like to hold out any hope that it will do so for many years to come.  Although I know it is not the Minister's function, an ancillary activity would be pocket industries in the villages.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been mentioned on this Bill is the question of commonages.  There are quite a few of them around my place, what they call &ldquo;co&rdquo; farms and they are creating a headache from this point of view.  I have one in mind where a trustee was appointed to collect the rent: that would be probably 30 or 40 years ago and he has been dead for the past 20 years.  Nobody now pays rent until such time as he gets a six-day notice.  The original receivable order appears to have been lost and nobody knows where he stands.  The Land Commission should intervene in the matter and maybe the Minister could deal with it under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, in dealing with the congested areas and with the acquisition of land, not to insist, where there is acute congestion, on paying by land bonds.  Some of those people like to get cash.  Some of them would be satisfied with half payment in cash and half in bonds.  Actually, I think the Land Commission are not too rigid but if they were even more elastic, land might become more readily available. I do believe the Minister in introducing this Bill has brought forward a good proposal to deal with the congested areas, particularly in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have had a conviction for the greater part of my life that if the economists who advise the Government had their way, they would advocate <Col N="507" /> wiping out the west of Ireland altogether since it is not an economic proposition from their point of view. This Bill will serve to allay a lot of those fears.  I wish it every success and hope the Minister will be able to make it work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>When framing the Bill, the Minister was faced with one very big problem, the 60,000 uneconomic holdings in the country.  This Bill is designed to relieve some of those.  There are a few aspects of that problem with which the Bill could have dealt more fully, but I still think that in its present form it is a definite step in the right direction.  Naturally the Minister must now find the land, and Ireland is not one of those countries where plenty of land is available. There are so many people here looking for the few acres that are available that the solution to this problem is rendered more difficult.</P>
      <P>When framing the Bill, the Minister had to consider the size of a farm that would prove economic and I welcome here his target of 40 to 45 acres.  In aiming at this size of holding, the Minister is keeping in step with other countries.  Holland has arrived at that figure in respect of land being reclaimed from the sea.  The Minister also proposes to give people settled on new farms proper houses, more in keeping with modern standards of living. Last year, in the precincts of the House, we had an opportunity of viewing an example of the type of house the Land Commission propose to provide for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the powers being taken in the Bill to have any area in the country declared a congested area.  I hope the Minister uses this power fairly freely because the Land Commission have themselves created an immense amount of congestion throughout my constituency.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the area between Dunboyne and Maynooth.  There, for five or six miles on either side of the road, one can see a very large number of holdings, each of which comprises no more than 23 or 24 acres.  All of these are Land Commission farms, provided <Col N="508" /> out of lands acquired and settled by the Land Commission on those people.  It is an area that should definitely be declared a congested area.</P>
    <P>I agree it is very close to Dublin and that there may be no other land in the neighbourhood with which to extend those holdings.  However, that does not provide any consolation for those people who have to travel miles in order to produce hay and also to take conacre.  Their only salvation there will be a declaration of the area as a congested area, and the moving of a number of the people and the redivision of the land among the remainder. The Minister may say there will be a problem about the vacated houses but the area being so near Dublin, there should not be the slightest trouble in that respect because there are hundreds of people working in the city who would be only too anxious to acquire such houses. I suggest the Land Commission seriously apply themselves to that area.</P>
    <P>Near Rathmolyon, the Land Commission have divided quite an amount of land in the past 30 years.  Between Sallins and Kill, you have Sherlocks-town where all the farmers have 22 acres only.  It is to the credit of those people that they have been able to make a livelihood out of those small parcels of land.  They have had to struggle to do it and if they had not got a mill contract some years ago, they would have been unable to survive. Now there is a big farm to be divided there, possibly in the spring, and I hope the Land Commission will seriously consider extending the farms of the people in that district, bringing their holdings up to the 45 acre holdings aimed at in the Bill.  The Commission will be recognising the work those people have been doing over the years.  It is much easier to judge people when you can see the results of their work and I hope that on their results alone, those people will be judged and given the increased acreage they so badly require.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that in this Bill we are setting out to remedy some of the <Col N="509" /> past faults of the Land Commission. In order to get the Land we require to settle all the people who need land and who are entitled to it, the Bill proposes the revolutionary step of buying all land that has been set over five years.  I agree it is the only possible way of getting all the land we require but I would sound a note of warning that there are exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a widow with a young family growing up; take the case of a person who went away for two, three, five years with the hope of coming back with sufficient capital to extend and improve the farm.  It would be a cruel thing to take land from such people.  A man might go away leaving the family with practically no capital.  Naturally he goes out to try to get that capital.  I suggest that the Land Commission should not press too severely in regard to some of the land being taken up.  By buying land at market value, it will leave land available where otherwise there would be little possibility of that happening. I know areas where no land has been divided for the past 30 years.  An example of that is the area of Moone, County Kildare.  I was told recently that all the holdings there are uneconomic but no land has come up for division in the area for 30 years.  There is a chance, with land being set like that, that the Land Commission will buy it and I hope they will consider giving it to local uneconomic holders.  That applies to any area.</P>
    <P>The one aspect of the Bill about which I am doubtful is the matter of people coming from the west of Ireland and having their annuities halved while the local people will be charged the full amount.  I can see cases where a herd or somebody working on land gets a full holding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a person has worked on an estate and has got a full holding, he will be paying double the annuity compared with a person coming from the west of Ireland.  We saw this happen in Meath before when you had the old Gaeltacht areas to which people were brought and given literally everything, provided with horses and, I think, they were even paid a certain amount of money each week for six months.  It has taken in the region of 30 years or more to break down that barrier between the local people and those in the new Gaeltacht areas.  I fear the possibility that we might create something like that again when the local person has to pay double the annuity that the incoming farmer pays.</P>
      <P>It is to the credit of the Land Commission that, to some extent they have been able to overcome the situation in time, and it is not too long until the people are able to mix with the community.  I feel there might be a danger of this situation recurring. Where a man with land gets only an addition, the difference will not be felt so much as the new rent can be included in the one receivable order, but in the case of a man getting a full holdings and living in the midst of the incoming migrants, he will find on comparing notes that he is paying twice as much as they pay.  I should like the Minister to consider that aspect of the Bill again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> I know the principle of paying fully for the land is accepted.  Quite a number of the sons of very good farmers have not much hope of getting land in the future.  They are second, third or fourth sons and I think if those, or some of them, could be selected through a scholarship scheme or some such scheme and given full holdings, it would be a great achievement as they are people whose whole ambition is centred in the land.  With present high values of land, they have no chance of buying a farm as the bank would require repayment in about ten years and the Agricultural Credit Corporation in 15 or 20 years. Their only chance of being able to make a livelihood by buying a farm lies in making repayments over 59 or 60 years.  That would give them a chance of buying an economic holding.</P>
    <P>In that respect I should have liked this Bill to go further.  Perhaps the Minister might amend it on Committee Stage to provide some means of giving farmers' sons a chance to acquire an economic holding.  Many of us have seen how they remain at home helping the parents until the age of 23 or 24 when they would like to settle down but are unable to do so.</P>
    <P>I feel there is a good chance of getting results through the provision whereby a person may be taken out of the congested area, the Land Commission buying the land from him and giving him a loan to buy an economic holding in another area.  Such people will be able to settle themselves elsewhere and the Land Commission are doing a wise thing in providing that only one such person, backed with a loan, may attempt to buy any one holding.  Otherwise, further inflation of land prices would be brought about. By allowing only one person to bid for the economic holding in which he is interested, inflation of the price of land will be prevented.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have condemned payment by way of Land Bonds.  At the moment the Land Bonds stand above par.  Even though one cannot redeem them immediately, anyone who wishes to borrow money can do so at a lower rate of interest than he is getting on his <Col N="512" /> bonds.  There is really no problem. One can borrow an equivalent sum at about one-quarter per cent less than the rate of interest one is getting on the bonds themselves.  There really should be no grouse.  I imagine the Exchequer would find it very difficult to pay out hard cash all the time.  The loan has to be spread over a period of years.  Nobody holding Land Bonds is at a disadvantage because if he wants to buy land, or invest money in any industrial concern, or buy any particular shares, he can borrow the money at a lower rate of interest than the rate he is getting on the bonds.  There should be no question of hardship.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It may not go quite as far as I should like it to go, but it is certainly a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill.  Most people who are not familiar with County Meath seem to think we have nothing in the county but very large tracts of land with gentlemen farmers and very few working people.  I should like now to put some very interesting figures before the House.  We have in Meath 13,201 holdings, of which 4,000 odd are under one acre.  They are mostly county council cottage plots.  Deducting that 4,000 from the total, one gets a figure of 9,090.  Between one and 15 acres, there are 2,033. Between 15 and 30 acres, there are 4,324.  That gives a round figure of 6,357 holdings under 30 acres.  In other words, they are uneconomic holdings.  Many of these are in congested areas.  According to this Bill, if these holdings are added to, the holders will have to pay the full annuity.  If a migrant comes in from a congested area outside the county, his annuity will be halved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the previous speaker, I think this is an unfair discrimination where the local congests are concerned.  The full annuity is an imposition on them. Furthermore, a barrier will be created between the migrant who is transplanted to Meath and the people already there.  In the case of the former, the annuity will be halved, while, in the case of the latter, the full <Col N="513" /> annuity will have to be paid.  If the Land Commission and the Minister want to transfer people from congested areas outside to County Meath, the rent should be fair and equitable for all sections.  We have no animosity towards migrants coming in.  I want that to be clearly understood.  They have been coming in for a long time now and the people have accepted them.  The fact remains, however, that uneconomic holders in Meath are crying out for a fair share of lands being divided, and who will blame them?  Not even the Minister or the most ardent supporter of Fianna Fáil from the west can blame the people of County Meath for looking for a fair share of the lands of Meath when they are being divided.</P>
    <P>I wish now to say something about the activities of the Land Commission. Down through the years, the Land Commission have acquired a great number of holdings in County Meath.  I cannot understand why the Land Commission have to hold these lands for, in one case beside Trim town, almost seven years.  Those lands have been in the hands of the Land Commission since 17/4/'57.  One or two holdings have been given off those lands.  This was a very big farm and there are still between 400 and 500 acres undivided.  I cannot understand why the Land Commission cannot make up their minds, in a period of five or six years, as to whom they will allot these lands.  The applicants who applied when the lands were first acquired are long since dead and their descendants are applicants now.</P>
    <P>It is a mystery to me why there should be such a delay.  Some maintain that the Department of Lands do not want to give land to the local people, that they want to bring in migrants.  It is also said that, because of a certain amount of agitation, they are afraid to allocate the lands to migrants.  I do not believe the Land Commission would be concerned about such matters and I think they should have done something before now. There are many uneconomic holdings in and around that farm.</P>
    <P>We have in County Meath men who only own from ten to 15 acres of land. <Col N="514" /> They are engaged in dairying.  Many may wonder how a man with such a small acreage could engage in dairying. The fact is he rents lands on the 11-months system and, one way or another, he is able to keep ten or 15 cows and make a living for himself and his family.  If, as the Minister has promised in this Bill, he will acquire these farms that are let beyond five years or farms that are not being husbanded in a proper way, and the congests in the area do not get a proportion of these lands, these men will have to go out of business.  They will have no alternative.  They will not be able to feed their cows.  They will not be able to rent land.  They will have to go out of business.  Is it a good proposition, I wonder, to put a new man into an area if, in doing so, you put another man out?  I appeal to the Minister to give a fair share to local congests and uneconomic holders when lands are being divided.  That is all I ask.  That is all the congests and the uneconomic holders in Meath ask.</P>
    <P>We have in County Meath a number of farmers' sons, young men who were reared on farms of from 30 to 50 acres. There may be second or third sons, as Deputy Crinion has said.  They work the holdings.  The parents die off and one of the sons inherits the farm.  He gets married.  The only thing the boys know is farming.  There is room for only one family on the farm.  The others become landless men.  They cannot get a farm from the Land Commission, though they would have a little capital, be able to stock a farm and have the know-how.  I would seriously recommend to the Minister and the Land Commission that they consider the position of these men.  It is bad to see the sons of traditional farmers having to emigrate or take up different employment when they are about 30 years of age.  It is not good for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the policy of the Land Commission with which I do not agree, that is, the letting of land for tillage.  They have been doing that in my county for a number of years. They have been letting land for tillage to wheat ranchers and to small farmers <Col N="515" /> also.  These people have been tilling the land for two, three or four years and when the Land Commission come to allot it, perhaps two-thirds of it is in stubble and very often it is more weeds than stubble.  The new tenant is then expected to bring it back to fertility.</P>
    <P>The argument of the Land Commission in favour of this practice is that they will give grass to reseed the land and bring it back to fertility but I have seen many of these men trying to bring the land back into heart and it takes them four or five years to do so. A man gets 30 acres of land and 15 or 16 acres of this land can be in stubble, with low fertility.  It can take him four or five years to get it back and he will not become a prosperous farmer overnight. I would suggest that the Land Commission cut out that practice so that the fertility will not be taken from the land.  The Land Commission are in a better position to purchase and allocate land when it is in good condition than the poor fellow who gets it and has to bring it back to fertility.</P>
    <P>It is implied in this Bill that all letting of land is bad but I could not hold that all letting on the 11-months system is bad.  We may have the case of a widow with a small family to whom no other course is open but to let the land on the 11-months system. Land in the midlands commands a fair price and that widow is able to survive until some member of her family can take over the farm.  There is a market for this type of land and many people let their lands to get them over their difficulty.</P>
    <P>You can have the person who inherits a farm with an old debt on it, and very little stock.  If he owes £1,000 or £2,000 to the bank, he cannot go to the manager and say that he wants another £2,000 to stock it.  He has no option but to let the land, unless he is to sell it and few people who come from traditional farming families want to do that.  They want to hold on to their land and to work it so what they do is to let it for seven, eight or ten years until they get on their feet.  Then they usually turn out to be good farmers.  I know dozens of people in County Meath who have done that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> The letting of land can also help out the uneconomic holder who is engaged in the milk business, as many of them are.  There are many aspects of land letting which are not bad and many of those people after a struggle of up to ten years to get out of debt find themselves free of debt but also find that they have to go back to the bank for another £1,000 to stock the land.  So they keep on letting.  For that reason I do not agree with the people who say that all letting of land is bad.</P>
    <P>We also have a number of cottiers in County Meath.  Some of them are agricultural labourers and some of them are industrial workers.  All the land they have is one cottage plot but some of them have a couple of cows and rear a few calves.  The wife and family look after the stock while the man is away and they rent pieces of land for this purpose.  I think such people should be considered in the allocation of land, even if they got only accommodation plots.  Years ago in County Meath, the Land Commission gave accommodation plots of about five acres each to cottiers in certain cases.  They did not all work out very well.  Land was not so valuable then as it is today and many of these sold their accommodation plots, with the result that the Land Commission developed a prejudice against them.  Today it is very rarely that a man in a cottage will get a plot from the Land Commission but I think they should be considered.</P>
    <P>There is another section in the Bill about which I am perturbed, that is, the section giving power to the Land Commission to serve notice on a farmer telling him that he cannot offer his land for sale.  I agree that the term may be short but we have all heard a lot about the fight for the right of free sale in this country.  The farmers are quite satisfied to have the rights of free sale and I would seriously suggest to the Minister that he have another look at this section of the Bill to see if there is some other way of getting over this problem of the acquisition of land without the service of this notice on the farmer and the <Col N="517" /> holding up of free sale, if a farmer wants to sell.</P>
    <P>This section may look harmless enough today but the Minister will not always be here and the members of the Land Commission as we know them today will not always be here.  But this section will be on the Statute Book. How do we know who will be Minister for Lands or what the personnel of the Land Commission will be in ten years' time?  That section in the hands of an unscrupulous official of the Land Commission could do a lot of damage to the farmers of this country.  I suggest to the Minister that he should not let it be said that it was an Irish Minister in an Irish Parliament who advocated interference with the farmers' right of free sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House very long in welcoming this new Land Bill.  Previous Land Bills have worked fairly well but we all know the extraordinary delays which took place in their implementation.  This Bill is to be welcomed if only for the amending clauses which smooth out and speed up the division of land.  It has one or two novel features and these I welcome in as much as they embody the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on Small Farms in the west of Ireland.  I refer to sections 5 and 6.</P>
      <P>The job of the Minister for Lands is never an easy one.  I do not think the land question in Ireland will ever be settled or that this Bill will solve all our problems.  Hunger for land is wide-spread here.  Listening to the speeches in this House, it would appear that everybody wants land and that Leinster has as many problems as Connacht. Of course, that is absolutely untrue.  Any examination of the size of holdings and the density of land will show that Connacht is very badly placed indeed.  The land in the west is not of the same quality or fertility as the land in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker talked about small farms in Meath.  In Sligo-Leitrim, there are 21,485 holdings, and examination will show that 60 per cent of these are under 30 acres while 26 are under 15 acres.  To resolve that problem, all <Col N="518" /> the land cannot be found in Sligo-Leitrim. I am aware there are many vacated small holdings in Sligo-Leitrim which, for one reason or another, are not available to the Land Commission. They are held on to for some sentimental or other reasons.  I strongly hold that the land of Ireland belongs to the Irish people and those who have land have a duty to keep it at a high standard of fertility and see that it is used to produce for the people of the nation.  Keeping it for sentimental reasons, allowing it to become infertile and overgrown with weeds and rushes, is a disgrace.  The sooner we look at this question of sentimentality in a more realistic light, in the light of the nation's needs, the sooner we will make progress on these matters.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to be welcomed for many of its innovations.  Apart from its novel features, the fact that it will tend to speed up land deals between the Commission and the vendors is to be especially welcomed.  Sections 15 and 16 give power to the Commission to delegate to the examiner the function of making a decision.  That will speed up matters.  Furthermore, a subsequent clause indemnifies him if a mistake is made.  That will further encourage the examiner to do the job speedily.  Sometimes it takes up to four years to clear title.  Again, under sections 15 and 16, a shorter title will be adequate.  That provision will speed up the process.</P>
    <P>Payment for land is dealt with in section 25.  Heretofore, when the Land Commission took over a farm, the owner was paid in Land Bonds at the prevailing rate, although four or five years might elapse before he got these bonds.  This section provides for payment in current bonds.  This will make the acceptance of Land Bonds more welcome, since they are running over par, at 102.  There is always the farmer who likes to get cash.  I would ask the Minister as far as he can to authorise the payment of cash, especially for small holdings, where the amount is only £1,000 or £2,000.</P>
    <P>The control of sub-letting of land is also an admirable feature of the Bill. It is only proper that the Land Commission should have full information on what is being done with land.  It is <Col N="519" /> only fair that those who let land should at least notify the Land Commission they are so doing.  In this way the Commission will have far better information.  If there are good grounds for people letting land, the Land Commission are sympathetic enough to be told about it rather than have behind-the-scenes-letting, as if the Land Commission were an oppressive body who would put them out immediately they let the land.  If land is let for years and neglected by the tenant, it is high time we took stock of that situation. Throughout the length and breadth of the country, there is much of that type of land which is a disgrace to the nation.  The sooner it is taken over by the Land Commission, brought to full fertility and allocated to those prepared to farm it, the better.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a novel feature, recommended to some degree in the report on small farms in the west.  Under this provision, a person living in a congested area who decides to move out and buy a farm may have his existing holding valued by the Land Commission. He can go to the public auction with his money and the Land Commission will lend him sufficient money, in addition to that which he obtains for his farm, to enable him buy the holding of his choice.  That provision is qualified by the stipulation that he must be a progressive farmer.  That is only right.  I believe this will get the more forward-looking of our young farmers moving into good farms of land where they will use their ability to good effect and make a reasonable living.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with elderly or incapacitated people living on farms. They can be compensated for the land and allowed to live on in the home and get an annuity based on the value of their holding.  That should be a great help to quite a number of people. In the case of a small holding of seven or eight acres, worth £400 or £500, one wonders what type of annuity that would produce and what the actuarial assessment would be.  I cannot give the answer.  It would want to be fairly reasonable, assuming a person might live from ten to 15 years.  I <Col N="520" /> have no doubt that actuaries will work it out and it should be fairly attractive.</P>
    <P>There is one thing to be commented on in reference to that section.  It is stated in the explanatory memorandum that &ldquo;so much of a relevant life-annuity as does not exceed £3 a week is not to be reckonable for old age pension means test purposes.&rdquo;  That is a very useful provision and one which I heartily welcome.</P>
    <P>The retention of halved annuities for congested areas is an admirable provision, although I have heard Deputies from other parts of the country objecting to migrants from congested areas being treated sympathetically in this way as against those in areas that are not congested.  I do not think that they have any good or valid argument. Seldom does one hear of land in congested areas fetching the high price for conacre or even for grazing as is obtainable in parts of Leinster and Munster.  Seldom is there a dearth of purchasers for land when it is offered for sale anywhere.  In the west of Ireland, in Sligo-Leitrim, as I know it, there are many farmers with large families living on small holdings who certainly are not in a position to save a large sum of money to be able to meet a high annuity, as compared with people in richer and more fertile parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In any case, the most chronic problem of congestion exists in the west of Ireland.  If this country, if this Government and if this House have any regard for the west of Ireland, they must live up to their responsibilities and help the west to a far greater extent.  Irrespective of the needs of other parts of Ireland, Connacht does need help.  A small farmer in the west of Ireland does need encouragement. Even if this has to be given to him at the expense of other sections of the community, I say that Connacht needs it.</P>
    <P>The people who today live on the land in Connacht are there not by any desire of their own but as a result of an edict issued years ago: &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht.&rdquo;  Land in many parts of the west of Ireland is largely <Col N="521" /> reclaimed bog and mountain on which God never intended that men should live.  Conditions, privations and history drove them into it.  Now, the effort of a Minister here to take these people out of these conditions, to put many of them back into the parts of Ireland from which their forebears were driven, deserves the highest credit and the highest merit.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to the section whereby dealings in land may be to some degree controlled.  Deputy Farrelly deplored the idea that free sale should be abolished.  I also deplore the idea that free sale should be abolished but there is nothing in this Bill to abolish free sale.  There is provision in this Bill to stop the underhand dealing that has been going on.</P>
    <P>At times the Land Commission are blamed for not taking immediate action when land is put up for sale. Deputies are constantly called upon when a farm is up for sale to make representations to have it taken over by the Land Commission.  We know that this is virtually impossible as the law at present stands, that there must be a report and examination of the position before the Land Commission can act.  In this Bill the Minister proposes to do something about it, and I welcome the provision.  It means that when this Bill has been passed, if the local inspector of the Land Commission is interested in a farm, he can immediately serve notice, pending examination of the position by the Land Commission, and if the Land Commission are not interested in acquiring the farm, they can say so within 12 months and if they are interested in acquiring a farm, they can negotiate a price.  Any auctioneer or solicitor is well aware that the Land Commission always pay the last penny.  That provision is to be welcomed and I hope it will be used effectively and prudently and that it will have the proper and desired effect.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was circulated, I have discussed this section with farmers and have pointed out to them that it is a section that might at some time affect them if they were selling land, that <Col N="522" /> notice might be served on them that they could not sell.  That did not seem to upset them at all.  Several of them have told me that they would be glad if the Land Commission were to buy their land and pay them cash, that they pay as much as anybody else. That is how they reacted.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House and hope it will have general acceptance by the nation and will do the good that I know the Minister so earnestly hopes it will do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seemed to me that the last speaker and the two previous speakers from Meath wished to have Meath declared a congested area.  I do not know what the Minister will do if that has to happen.  One Deputy tried to throw cold water on the idea of migrants coming from the west of Ireland.  I come through part of that Deputy's constituency on my way from Galway.  I have met businessmen in small towns in the heart of Ireland who have told me that, were it not for the migrants who came there from the west of Ireland, the towns of the midlands would be ghost towns.  They told me that some 15 years ago they might stand at their counters all day and never see anybody, and that things are very different now because of the migrants.  There may be a failure or two amongst the migrants.  In every walk of life, there are failures.  At least 95 per cent of the migrants have proved successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a section in this Bill whereby a migrant is given two years in which to make good.  That is much too short a period.  Previously migrants got seven years in which to prove themselves. A period of two years is much too short a period to allow a man to get on his feet or transfer to a strange area where, as a Deputy on this side of the House stated, he may not be too well received either.  It is a disgrace that such should be the case because in very many cases that migrant is a man whose forefathers were driven from this land.  We remember well the story of Cromwell.  It was &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht&rdquo;.  It is a long time since that statement was made.  I trust that those who in the recent past have <Col N="523" /> come and those who we hope will come in greater numbers in the near future will be well received.  Anyhow I have no doubt they are used to hard times and will make their presence felt.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of this House for about 22 years.  I have seen many Ministers for Lands come and go. From what I know of the job, I would say that very few of them ever wished to stay there very long because they were always in a very awkward position. Questions are put down here to them and no matter from which side of the House they come, the answer is always: &ldquo;The Land Commission have decided&rdquo;.  I thought it regrettable that that should continue, as I am afraid it will continue.  That is why I say this Bill falls far short of what I hoped it would do.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about 45 to 50 acres of land.  I hope that every migrant will be able to get that, that every man in the west of Ireland who is looking for additional land will be able to get it but where will the Minister get it?  Take my own county of Galway.  There are 2,945 people under £2 valuation.  They all want holdings of 50 acres each.  There are 4,113 farmers there whose valuations range from £2 to £4; there are 4,096 farmers whose valuations range from £4 to £7; there are 3,544 farmers whose valuations range from £7 to £7 10; and there are 4,933 farmers whose valuations range from £10 to £15.  That makes a total of 19,620 uneconomic holders in my county alone.  The situation is much worse in the Minister's county of Mayo.  The same thing applies to Sligo and Leitrim, and to Roscommon to a certain extent.  Would the Minister not need the Six Counties to have enough land for all these people? Nothing less than 50 acres of arable land is any use.</P>
    <P>When I refer to the Minister, I mean the Land Commission to a certain extent.  In passing, let me say that I deal with the Land Commission here in Dublin and elsewhere.  I have dealt with the inspectors and commissioners in Galway city, in Castlerea and in Dublin.  As far as I am concerned, whether in Castlerea, Galway or Dublin, <Col N="524" /> there is nothing I can say against the inspectors of the Land Commission. They would do anything in the world to be helpful and I despise any Deputy who would stand up in this House and say you would have to have so-and-so or do so-and-so.  That is not the case.  It is a disgrace that it should be said or allowed to be said in this House.</P>

      <P>I cannot at the moment but I assure you the figures are correct.  The Land Commission have allowed that to go on over the past few years.  They have no notion of giving 50 acres to a migrant.  Where will they get the land?  We hear the Minister being pushed by Deputies from Meath, on his own side of the House as well as on this side, to declare County Meath an uneconomic area.</P>
      <P>Again I ask, where will this additional land come from?  They are the things I want to know.  The Minister knows as well as I do that as far as we are concerned in the west of Ireland, the tenant farmers there are in reservations like Red Indians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly like Red Indians.  I am sure, Sir, you will allow me to say that, were it not for the good work done by Lieutenant General Costello on behalf of the small tenant farmers of the west of Ireland, thousands of them would have gone today in the footsteps of the thousands who have already gone. Were it not for these schemes&mdash;the acre and a half of beet, the acre of potatoes, the acre or so of vegetables &mdash;they would all have left.  No man has done more than he has for the west of Ireland.  He was a God-send to the workers there and he deserves the tribute I am now paying him.</P>
      <P>Only today I had a letter from a man in Ballygar, pointing out the number of holdings in that area available for re-settlement.  The letter is signed by seven tenant farmers.  I shall send that letter to the Minister so that he can let the Land Commission have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter troubles me considerably. Where father and mother die, perhaps, the son goes to England for a few years in order to earn some money to keep the holding going at <Col N="526" /> home.  I do not think it is fair, I do not think it is honest, that the Land Commission should go in immediately and take that land.  Very many of those people come back &mdash; of course many of them do not come back and never intended coming back &mdash; and make very good farmers afterwards. I would appeal, therefore, to the Minister not to be too drastic in cases of that kind.  He should allow a certain number of years to elapse before taking up the holding.</P>
    <P>This Bill falls far short of my wishes in many respects.  I make bold to say that it fails in the same respect as every Land Bill introduced here since the late Deputy Hogan brought in his in 1923&mdash;that it does not put a ceiling on the number of acres any one man may hold.  You have people who own 1,000 acres, 2,000 acres and some even 5,000 acres.  Are such people to be allowed to get away with saying to the Land Commission: &ldquo;We are looking after it well; we are using it well; and I defy you to take it from us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now this Bill protects those people again.  I make bold to say that in my 22 years in the House&mdash;with the help of God, I shall be 22 more years here &mdash;I have been advocating the placing of a ceiling on the number of acres any one person may hold.  I entirely agree with Deputy Carty on this.  In County Galway I know people who own 1,000 acres.  I shall not mention their names, however.  When I read the speech of Deputy Millar here, I had a laugh because I recall his speech in Ballinasloe six months ago when he said the Minister proposed to put a ceiling on the number of acres any one person could hold.</P>
    <P>Mind you, the Minister did not take his advice&mdash;the ceiling is not there.  In a country like this, such a provision is most desirable.  It is very easy to blame the Land Commission for holding up the division of the land already in their hands.  I used that cry quite a lot in my earlier days here but now I appreciate the Land Commission's difficulty.  I shall instance the case of a man living in my village who had three holdings of land.  A year and a half ago, that land was offered to the Land <Col N="527" /> Commission and a decision was made on it only last August.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question by another Deputy, I made a statement on the Estimate for the Department in connection with the taking up of that land.  I made a slight slip and added six months to the length of time over which I had been making representations. Of course the Minister said I was actually telling lies.  Such was not the case.  That land is taken now.  It was taken at my request to the Land Commission and not at the request of anybody else.</P>
    <P>I must say I am afraid there is not a hope in the world of achieving the Minister's target of 40 to 45 acre holdings, when you go over the list I read out, when you find that in the west of Ireland alone, in the province of Connacht alone, there is a total of 95,323 uneconomic holdings.  I agree the Minister will solve part of the problem of land scarcity by taking up many of those holdings that have been unworked, unoccupied or let for years. That will be a help but not to the extent that we would hope for.  As a matter of fact, without setting a ceiling on the number of acres any one man may hold, there is, in my opinion, no hope of generally applying this principle of 45-acre holdings.</P>
    <P>We have heard Deputies from the midlands saying that some migrants who came up there did not make a success of their holdings.  I disagree completely.  They certainly did make a success of them&mdash;at least 95 per cent did.  We have heard it said that there was no welcome for these migrants, that very little is thought of them.  I should like some of these people in the midlands to realise that those are the true Celts, the people whose forefathers were driven from those lands by Cromwell.  I should like the Minister and the Land Commission to realise that also.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say except that I wish the Minister well, probably much more so than he thinks.  I wish him every success.  Any comments I have made on the Bill were made in an attempt to improve the measure. There is one amendment I hope the Minister will introduce later&mdash;that a <Col N="528" /> ceiling be set to the acreage of land held by any individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMedler" hpid="Mr. Medlar Mr. Medlar">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Medlar</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill which apparently is very well received by all sides, with a few exceptions.  It is very interesting to hear the views of Deputies from different constituencies with their different outlooks, definitions and interpretations, all of which may be right from their own point of view. We have heard the former Minister for Lands saying that if the Land Commission do not act soon, there will be nobody to take land in his part of the country, that people are flying from it due to Government policy.  The position is altogether different in my constituency where more money is being invested in land every day.  The uneconomic holder has little hope of extending his acreage in competition with larger farmers.  His only hope is in the activities of the Land Commission because land prices in my own immediate district go as high as £500 per Irish acre.</P>
      <P>I have heard it said here that under section 5 of the Bill, which is very laudable, loans may be given to more progressive congests for the purchase of farms.  I shall assume that in my part of Leinster they might be able to pay £8,000 or £10,000 but I wonder where is the uneconomic holder who would be able to repay that sum with interest?  There might be hope if congests in that particular district were facilitated in that way. I trust the Minister will give those facilities to congests in every part of the country because if they are progressive and enterprising, they must surely have confidence in their own future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The giving of life annuities to old people under section 6 is also very laudable and I should like it to apply to every part of the county, in fact, perhaps more to Leinster than to Connacht.  Exception has been taken to sections 13 and 27 by some members of the Opposition.  Those, I believe, are two important sections and if you remove them, you are only tinkering with the whole question of land resettlement.  Section 13, I understand, is designed to prevent quick <Col N="529" /> sales intended to frustrate the work of the Land Commission.  In the past year or so in my constituency, estates have been sold in that very way and if a local inspector had had the power that is now being given to him in this Bill, those estates would now be in the possession of the Land Commission for division among local uneconomic holders in some of the most congested districts.</P>
    <P>Section 27 gives a senior inspector power to serve this Section 40 notice which would cover the very point I have mentioned.  A junior inspector may only make a report to a senior inspector who in turn submits his recommendations or suggestions to the Lay Commissioners who act upon these reports.  Only recommendations are submitted for sanction and therefore I cannot see very much that is revolutionary in that section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 34 makes the land of the absentee landowner more vulnerable to acquisition.  There is another section giving the right to the Land Commission to hold up the sale of a farm for 12 months and I hold that those four sections together will play a big part in preventing the sale of land to foreigners.  Under section 27 as I understand it, if a farmer is served with a section 40 notice, it does not prevent him putting his farm up for public auction with a view to getting its full market value, if he intends to sell it, but if the Land Commission are prepared to pay the same price as the highest bidder, the issue of the notice gives them the right to purchase it.</P>
    <P>Generally, this Bill is very welcome. It is a pity that over the years Land Bills were introduced which only tinkered with the problem.  The main feature of this Bill is the giving of more power to the Land Commission to acquire land and it is a step in the right direction.  As regards conditions of allotments, that is a matter in respect of which I am inclined to differ to some extent from what is in the Bill. I also differ in regard to the provision relating to the letting of land and I would like to know the motive for it.</P>
    <P>I know what I am talking about, too.  Three-year letting should be <Col N="530" /> encouraged&mdash;encouraged with a capital E.  I claim to come from an area where there are good farmers and if land is let for three years, even for grazing, the purchaser will put balanced manure on it according to the recommendation of the local agricultural adviser but if he gets it for one year, he will do no such thing.  If land is let for three years for conacre, it is usually set for cereals, roots and cereals, and that is surely farming according to good farming rules. Setting land for 11 months in my part of the country is bad farming.  I do not know what situation obtains in other parts, but I suggest that where land is being set for three years for corn, roots and corn, the permission of the Land Commission should not have to be sought.</P>
    <P>Concerning conditions of allotment, I find over the years, in my constituency anyway, that owners of freehold land are generally not recognised for land allotment.  A land owner having 15 acres under the Land Commission is recognised but farmers with a freehold may not be.  In fact I know a ten-acre farmer having a freehold on his land who purchased a 30-acre farm and the Land Commission would not certify it on the ground that he had a freehold.  At the same time, if a man with a chequebook came in and purchased it, he would be facilitated all along the way.  It is a case of facilitating the man with the chequebook and frustrating the small farmer and I would like to have him put in the same category.</P>
    <P>There is another condition which I should like to see at least extended.  An uneconomic holder must live within a mile of an estate before he can qualify for an allotment.  I do know that in the distant past the Land Commission gave allotments to small farmers living four miles away or over.  Perhaps in the course of time since it was in the days of horsepower, this may have been considered uneconomic.  Many allottees may have sold their allotted portion and the Land Commission record showed that allottees got sanction from the Land Commission for a <i>bona fide</i> reason: distance, that it was too far from their own farm.  The result was <Col N="531" /> that the Land Commission reduced the mileage, but surely in the days of mechanisation they could increase it.</P>
    <P>The position obtains in my constituency that we have pockets of congestion, some of Land Commission creation.  You have conacre men taking conacre from an estate some miles away.  Subsequently it may be sold and purchased by a large farmer, on the one hand or taken by the Land Commission, on the other.  Those unfortunates, those grade A farmers, are denied allotments on the grounds of distance.  After they have spent a whole lifetime working 30 or 40 acres of that estate and rearing a family successfully on that land, the Land Commission man tells them that to give them allotments would not be economic.  But these people are the real experts on what is or is not economic.  Where such people have that record, they should be given at least two miles. That is not asking for too much.  If you do not accept that, you are going to create a very grave injustice in my constituency.  There are very few estates left for acquisition now and the only hope of those men is to get a parcel if ever they are acquired, as some are at the moment.</P>
    <P>Another very deserving and, I think, not very popular type of land applicant is the cottier or the conacre landless man.  That is emphasised by the fact that there are only three or four counties in the 26 where there are such men in any great number.  I happen to live in one of these constituencies.  We have cottiers, landless men, who before the advent of mechanisation, were fully equipped with horsepower.  Then they switched over to mechanisation.  I know of cottiers who are fully mechanised and who live by conacre.  Where that can be proved, I would ask the Land Commission to give them favourable consideration, even for an accommodation plot.</P>
    <P>Now with this new idea of processing foods, particularly in the vicinity of the new processing plant in Carlow, accommodation for those landless men to grow fruit and vegetables would be ideal.  It is the small farmer that you may depend upon to grow these food <Col N="532" /> crops and if you want their record over the years, you will get it in the sugar factories.  You need not depend on their own statements.  All those people have ordered their way of life in that way over generations through real work.  They are assets to the country, people of whom any country could feel proud.  Their record proves that they are prepared to compete in the Common Market or anywhere else on equal terms.  The men I have in mind are equal to the best farmers in Europe.  They farm the land owned by landowners.  Some of the landowners who set their land may describe themselves as farmers but what I describe as a farmer is the man who works his land.</P>
    <P>I will not go back to the definition of lands being properly worked, but I believe this: If the Land Commission were to take over in the morning all the lands of the 26 Counties that are not being properly worked, they would take over more than 50 per cent.  How much land is soil-tested, tested to see if elements need to be replaced?  How many landowners have their land brought up to the correct state?  The Land Commission may acquire estates on the ground that they are not being properly worked but do they examine the people to whom they are giving them, the uneconomic holders, to see if their holdings are being properly worked?</P>

      <P>It is a big question and debatable.  If you like, you may call it local or narrow, but my main case is for the uneconomic conacre farmers living within two miles of a given estate who have worked all their lives on it and the landless conacre men of Carlow and parts of North Kilkenny. When you relieve the congestion there, I shall be delighted to welcome the people who were driven across the Shannon in the distant past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDunne" hpid="Mr. T. Dunne Mr. T. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention in this debate will not be very long, but I wish to voice my disapproval of one section of this Bill, section 7, as I feel that this section defeats the whole purpose of the Land Commission.  It <Col N="533" /> provides that in future certain classes of persons who receive an allotment of land on an annuity basis will not benefit by the halving of annuities under the Land Act of 1933.  The classes affected are: (1) farmers with existing holdings who may receive enlargements in non-congested areas, and (2) cottiers and other persons who may get allotments in non-congested areas where surplus land is available.</P>
      <P>This section 7 relates to the discontinuance of the halving of the annuities. In my constituency, which is considered a non-congested area, there are 13,519 holdings of under £30 valuation and the total number of holdings in the county is 19,945.  I feel that the discontinuance will mean that a person who receives an addition of land will pay approximately £9 7s. 6d. per acre of an annuity, plus £1 rates.  It would be a lot cheaper for him to take conacre because he could throw it up any time he felt that he was not making money or was falling down on the job. I am informed that the annuity on land purchased at £100 per acre is £6 5s., and land in my constituency is going at roughly £150 to £200 per acre.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position of cottiers with reference to the division of land.  These people live in hope and die in despair.  Most of them are farmers and expect to get land when a holding is going near them, but the only cottier entitled to land is a person who loses employment or who is employed on the estate on the day it is acquired by the Land Commission. The Minister should put in a definite section clarifying the position of a cottier.  These cottiers are men who derive their livelihood solely from agriculture&mdash;from conacre, grazing or otherwise.  They put a lot of hard work and money into farming but they can never acquire a farm on their own. They might possibly have capital enough to work a farm but not to purchase one.  The Minister should make some provision for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards section 13 of the Bill, which introduces a system of control in the letting and selling of land, under the section, where a farmer is letting land and the Land Commission step in to acquire it, he cannot let or sell <Col N="534" /> the land for 12 months.  That is an undue hardship on the person who owns that land, for he may not be in a position to carry on for 12 months without some income, and that section should be amended.  The Bill in general appears to be a move to migrate the whole west of Ireland into the south and midland counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been generally well received in the House and up to last evening most of the contributions were very much in favour of its provisions.  We had most of the western Deputies here applauding the Minister for taking the very necessary powers he is seeking to provide the Land Commission with the machinery that will create a larger pool of land for the relief of congestion.  Then we had a typical Fine Gael effort yesterday evening when we had some front bench members coming in to tell us that we were doing something unconstitutional and were encroaching on the rights of the individual by the introduction of certain provisions of this Bill.  If these provisions were to be withdrawn, then it would be just something that might have been in operation already.  Sections 4, 13 and 27 have made me stand up to welcome it wholeheartedly, even though I come from the eastern part of the country.</P>
      <P>We had Deputy MacEoin telling us that section 4 should not be in the Bill because it might be abused by some Minister in the future.  He did say, of course, that he would not accuse the present Minister of abusing it.  Neither would I or any other member of this Party do so, and I think it is very wrong for any Deputy to suggest that the people who will succeed us will be dishonest.  We look forward to Dáil Éireann remaining, probably extended to embrace the whole 32 counties, and a Minister of State here in the eighties will be as honourable and honest as the Ministers who are now here in the sixties and as the people were in the forties.  It comes very badly from a man who has spent so many years in this House to suggest that we will have that type of person in future representing the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because of the <Col N="535" /> inclusion of section 4.  That section holds out the only hope to a congest in my constituency that something will be done for him.  I understand from the Minister's speech that he intends to have local surveys carried out to see where there are pockets of congestion and if there are such pockets, he will have them classed as congested areas. When that survey is taking place, I hope that my county will be included, and I am satisfied that if it is and a thorough investigation is carried out, some congests in part of the county can look forward to getting the full benefit of this Bill that is being made available to small farmers in the non-congested districts.</P>
    <P>If sections 13 and 27 were removed from the Bill or amended in any way, its whole purpose would be defeated.</P>
    <P>As I say, if section 4 is extended to the eastern midlands and the eastern parts of the country, I see some hope under section 5 of relieving the problem of congests in my constituency.  I take it that if we have areas in County Wicklow classified as congested areas, then farmers in that area will be entitled to avail of the benefits of the Bill whereby loans will be made available by the Land Commission for the relief of their congestion.  That is a good provision because plenty of small farmers will in the future be able to solve their own congestion problem.  I take it that what will happen is that the Minister or the Land Commission will put a value on each of those congested farms, so that the farmer can go to an auction with the knowledge that a certain amount of money is available to him in terms of hard cash, which will influence him to go whatever distance he wishes after that to provide a farm for himself.  If money is needed to make up any difference, it will be made available through the Land Commission and repaid on an annuity basis.  That will help us, too, in the eastern parts to solve our problem of congestion.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the acquisition of land that is in the possession of or occupied by elderly people.  I know of one or two such cases myself.  I hope that the Bill will also deal with the case of a bachelor or a married <Col N="536" /> couple.  Will the same facilities be available to an elderly brother and sister living on a farm?  I hope they will be.  This is a good approach because we find a brother and a sister living on a large farm but yet they are living in poverty.  The social welfare code does not provide for such people because their valuation is very high.  I know of one such case and what has happened is that some of the slick boys have got the land from these people for half nothing.  I am certain that in some cases they do not pay sufficient to meet the rent and rates and the unfortunate people are living on very very small incomes.  If the Minister proposes to deal with that type of case, he has my full support so that these people may be provided for in their old age.  I am sure they will be patriotic to make their land available for the relief of congestion not only in their own area but generally.  The Minister is sure to meet this type of case and in cases where the brother may own the holding, I hope the sister will be provided for also.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with annuities and I take it that where land is made available, the small uneconomic holder in the non-congested district will have to pay the full annuity.  I hope the Minister will have second thoughts about that aspect.  Congestion differs from one part of the country to another.  Yesterday somebody said that a man with an acre of land in one part might be considered a small farmer and he would not be considered a farmer at all in the rest of the country.  I do not see why people in the non-congested districts should be expected to pay the full annuities, why they should not benefit from the existing legislation in regard to annuities.  The Minister may have been influenced in doing this by the agitation, and the deputations he has received in recent years, about land division.  I have been on a deputation which included a number of people from outside my constituency and they told me how much they were paying for conacre. As far as my constituency is concerned, we do not have that problem. <Col N="537" /> We have not many people who go in for conacre.  The small uneconomic holder in the western part of the county will have to go to Kildare to get an acre or two to provide a green crop, potatoes or vegetables, or perhaps oats, to feed his family and his livestock but he is not in it in a big way and he has no intention of going into it in a big way because he could not afford to.  In counties adjoining mine, people are paying £24 an acre. I think they are mad.</P>
    <P>I met one man from Deputy Medlar's constituency who was paying £800 a year for conacre and even at that, the land was not in a block.  He got a couple of acres here and a couple of acres there.  The sum of £800 a year would finance a loan of about £10,000 from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the man could have his own holding.  With conacre, he has nothing at the end and in a bad year, he has nothing.  He may be enterprising enough to have purchased machinery and the only way he can go on is to have conacre.  When he goes to the auction, he has to pay exorbitant prices because of the keen competition.  To my mind, £24 or £25 per acre is exorbitant.  That is not the general pattern of conacre throughout the country.  If the Minister has based this section on the assumption that people generally pay that kind of money for conacre, I think he is wrong.  He should have another look at this and provide facilities for the allottees on the same basis as heretofore.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 18, which deals with gaming rights.  A number of farmers in my constituency are very anxious to become the owners of their own gaming rights.  I applied to the Land Commission some six or eight months ago in regard to this matter and nothing happened.  It was only within the past week or two that I discovered there is a very cumbersome type of machinery and all the files had to be examined by the local inspector who has to carry out an investigation to discover if the landlord who had the rights used them for the past 20 years or so.  The Land Commission are not geared for that type of thing because the inspectors have enough to do with regard to land without having to deal <Col N="538" /> with gaming rights.  I welcome anything that will simplify that procedure. I hope the farmers in Wicklow who have already applied will get their gaming rights even before this Bill is fully implemented.  However, people who apply in the future will have a much easier passage.</P>
    <P>One other point with which I should like to deal is in relation to the purchase of land by foreigners.  A lot of lip-service is paid to this problem. Some Fine Gael speakers, and admittedly some of our own Party have spent a considerable amount of time dealing with this question.  Quite recently, I brought to the notice of the Land Commission the case of a holding of something like 600 acres in Wicklow which had been advertised for letting in eight and ten acre lots.  The person who owns the land does not reside there and anything the Minister can do to deal with that case he should do immediately.  I hope the Land Commission take action in that regard.</P>
    <P>To get back to the lip-service paid here, I remember that in 1956, in my constituency, a County Wicklow man tried to purchase a farm.  The Land Commission were then interested in it. Being a good Irishman, when he got to know the Land Commission were interested&mdash;and they were definitely interested&mdash;he decided he would not bother with the farm there and would go elsewhere.  In the course of 12 months, we found that a foreigner purchased the farm and the Land Commission withdrew all their interest in it.  That was at a time when we had the Fine Gael people in Government. They now come in here and talk about the influx of these foreigners.  The foreigners were coming in here in the time of the Coalition Government and I do not know that much was done about it.  At the same time, I should be glad if the Minister would do something to discourage it.  There is little enough land in this country for the number of people looking for it at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is the first attempt I have seen in land legislation to do something for the congests in my county: believe it or not, we have them in substantial numbers.  With the <Col N="539" /> enactment of this Bill, I trust that part of County Wicklow will be declared a congested area and that when that is done, we can look forward to receiving the full benefit to be derived from this piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>Most of the western Deputies have spoken on this Bill.  I waited most of yesterday and part of today to add my little contribution to this debate.  I am proud that a Minister from the county of Michael Davitt and the county where the word &ldquo;boycott&rdquo; was coined introduced this revolutionary measure to Dáil Éireann and has given hope to the people in the west that their problem is nearing solution.  The Minister has taken a bold step.  I do not intend to go through this now, section by section, but I must say I am disappointed with some of the speeches by the western Deputies.</P>
      <P>We have a song in the west called <i>The West's Asleep.</i>  The first three or four verses are a bit sad but the last verse is a rousing one which says that the west is awake.  If some of those Deputies want to go along the lines of the first three or four verses in that song and to say we are still asleep, I am glad to add my voice to the last verse and that we have a Minister who has shown with this Land Bill that the west is awake and that there is hope for the west.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear Deputies from every constituency welcome this Bill. They realise that the people in the west who are congested are the descendants of those who were driven there in the days of the Plantation.  We know well that the descendants of those people are entitled to be brought back across the Shannon and to be migrated to the midlands.  We are told that those who have already gone have made good farmers and were made welcome there. This Bill will ensure, I hope, that more of them will go and that the land that is left will bring congests up to an economic unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister was appointed Minister for Lands, he has brought a breath of fresh air into the Land Commission.  Even with legislation as it <Col N="540" /> is at present, he has made regulations giving powers which in my constituency have brought a new pool of land into the Land Commission.  Heretofore, if a farm were put up for sale in my constituency, the auctioneer did his best to sell it to anybody but the Land Commission.  However, the Minister announced at the auctioneers' dinner that if they sold it to the Land Commission, he would give them the same commission, up to so many thousands of pounds, as they would get if they sold it to a private individual. I have seen positive proof, since that regulation was brought into effect, that a big pool of land in my parish and in adjoining parishes was taken by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I had questions here in the Dáil about every holding that came up for sale, as advertised in the <i>Connaught Tribune</i> and the <i>Tuam Herald.</i>  I took out the particulars of every one of them and sent them to the Land Commission. These have been inspected and the Land Commission, even under existing legislation, have purchased a lot of them.  I would ask the Land Commission not to set these lands for any length of time but to divide them and to settle the uneconomic holders as soon as possible.  Through the Minister's efforts and through the efforts of the Land Commission, a big pool of land has already been accumulated in my constituency.  There were deputations to the Minister and there will be others this week or next week but in all these cases he has taken action and beneficial results have followed.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Donnellan, about the ceiling that should be set to the number of acres a man should hold.  When I made my maiden speech here in 1948, the late Mr. Frank Fahy was Ceann Comhairle. I advocated that very same policy.  Mr. Fahy said he did not like to interrupt a man while he was making his maiden speech but that what I was advocating bordered on Communism.  However, I was well briefed.  I quoted a Papal Encyclical to prove my point.  Since then, the late Pope John XXIII in his Encyclical <i>Mater et Magistra</i>&mdash;I have not the quotation now&mdash;said something to the effect that if it is for the <Col N="541" /> common good the land should be used because it is different from any other type of wealth.  I am not a theologian. The point is that it is not interfering with private property: it belongs to the Irish people.  I believe something along those lines should be done.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be some limit to the amount of land held and that a ceiling should be placed, at whatever height you like, on the amount of land a man may hold in this country.  I can foresee that if you bring every farm up to the size the Minister has in mind&mdash; 40 or 45 acres of good land&mdash;people will die out or will not marry, and so on, and you will have one man in a village like the landlord of old because by buying up three or four 45-acres, he will become a new landlord.  That is the trouble and that is what is happening in some of our parishes and places today.  I do not intend to go into this in detail.</P>
    <P>I complimented the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  I congratulate him and hope it will get a speedy passage through this House and through the Seanad, that it will soon become law and that we shall see beneficial results accrue from it.</P>

      <P>I am very happy about the reception this Bill has received in general from all sides of the House.  I am particularly happy about the thoughtful speech by the Leader of the main Opposition.  I believe that the fears expressed by him are unfounded and that when I deal with them, as I propose to do in detail tonight, he will be reassured about the legal effect of section 27.  He appears to accept the provisions of section 13 as being fair and reasonable.  Yet, this is the section about which such a song and dance was made last night by some Deputies, Deputies who either did not read the Bill or who, having read it, failed to understand it, or else set out on a deliberate campaign of misrepresentation to frighten the landowners of Ireland as to the contents of the Bill and its objectives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that, in view of the many recent increases in the prices of essential foodstuffs and services, and in view of the fact that no satisfactory explanation of the necessity for such rises in prices is available either to Dáil Éireann or to the general public, the Government should without delay set up, under the Prices Act, 1958, machinery for the public investigation and, where necessary, control, of any such increases in the prices of essential goods and services.</P>
      <P>This motion was put down by the Labour Party to get information from the Minister and from the Government as to their intention of seeing that only the 2½ per cent increase justified by the turnover tax is, in fact, extracted from the public and that prices are controlled or discovering what exactly the Government intend to do to keep prices at the level at which they stood prior to 1st November.  On a number of occasions prior to the introduction of the tax, the Labour Party endeavoured to secure from the Minister information as to what would happen when the turnover tax came into effect, should prices rise unduly. On 23rd October, 1963, at column 48 of volume 205, in reply to a question tabled by Deputy Norton as to whether the Minister was aware of the general increases in prices forecast in the papers, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I have seen various press reports of the kind mentioned by Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a question on prices on 17th July, 1963, I explained that the circumstances in which my powers in regard to price control may be exercised are laid down in the Prices Act, 1958.  I stated that I believed that the ordinary course of competition should apply to ensure that no excessive increase will take place in the price of any commodity <Col N="543" /> but that, if circumstances required any action under the Prices Act, I would take it.  I reaffirm that I will not hesitate to take action if any undue increases take place. Deputies will appreciate, of course, that increases in prices in consequence of increases imposed abroad on commodities which we must import are outside the possibility of control by me.</P>
    <P>On 30th October, immediately prior to the introduction of the tax, Deputy Norton asked the Minister if he would state categorically whether the Government proposed to establish a Prices Tribunal for the purpose of controlling prices and thus preventing any exploitation of the consumers.  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>I made it clear in reply to questions on prices on 23rd October, 1963, volume 205, column 48 of the Dáil Debates, that I will not hesitate to take action under the Prices Act, 1958 if any undue increases take place.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to add to that statement.</P>
    <P>Again, on Tuesday, 12th November, at column 1239 of volume 205, the Minister again indicated that he would in time, if he saw fit, introduce price control.  On 24th October and 21st November in reply to questions put down by Deputy S. Dunne in relation to the price of coal, the Minister indicated that, should the need arise at any time, he would be prepared to see what he could do to control prices, but indicated that the price of coal was not a factor over which he had control.  It was pointed out to him by Deputy S. Dunne that he had information that something like 20,000 tons of coal were already in the country prior to 1st November and that, notwithstanding that fact, the price of coal had been increased, apparently to compensate for the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister has met all efforts by the Labour Party with vague generalities and promises.  He has one stock reply: competition will keep down prices.  Another Minister stated there <Col N="544" /> would be no increase at all.  A third Minister stated that retailers will be free to take whatever steps they like to recoup themselves for the cost of the turnover tax.  These three diametrically-opposed opinions seem to me very unusual.  They show a note of discord as between three different Ministers in the same Government.</P>
    <P>We did not, of course, have to wait until 1st November for price increases to occur.  Since the eighth round wage increase concluded, there has been a rise of some ten points in the cost of living index.  The cost of living index relates to essential services and commodities used by the ordinary working people.  By 1st November, the date on which the increase consequent on the turnover tax took place, the cost of living had increased to the extent of ten points.  The full effects of the turnover tax are not yet known but anyone living in the country, and not isolated from the conversations of ordinary people, must be well aware that instead of 2½ per cent being added to the various commodities, in actual fact, the increases range between 7½ per cent and ten per cent.  Neither I nor anybody else can prove an actual national figure because every different commodity in every different shop in every different locality has a different price.  It is practically impossible to give the average so the Minister will understand if I give him the prices I am aware of in Waterford.</P>
    <P>Milk has increased by 1/8d. per gallon while 6d. per gallon would be an increase of 2½ per cent.  I suggest that 1/8d., which is fixed by United Dairies Ltd., operating in west Waterford, has, without any doubt, completely violated the principle of endeavouring to collect the amount of tax for which they will be responsible to the Government, plus a small amount for administrative costs. Nobody can suggest that 1/8d. per gallon is a reasonable increase when 6d. is the amount which they can legally charge.</P>
    <P>The price of bread has increased.  I have not the particulars of the amount of the increase in the loaf but I am aware that it is substantially more than 2½ per cent.  In the case of <Col N="545" /> the cwt. of loose turf sold by the merchants in Dungarvan for 7/-, they have added 6d. for the turnover tax and you have the choice of taking or leaving it.  The merchants have apparently got together and decided to fix the charge so that the people have no choice but to pay it.  Coal has increased by 1/- per cwt. not only as supplied by those merchants but throughout the whole county.</P>
    <P>I have named but a few commodities in the price of which there have been these increases but it is true to say that every single commodity one purchases, everything in excess of 6d. in price, has added to it a halfpenny or a penny, all making an increase not only of 2½ per cent but in excess of five per cent.  Cigarettes have been nationally increased by 2d. on the packet of 20.  Drink has been increased by 1d. per pint in some cases and in other cases by 2d. per pint.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had power under the 1958 Act, and he still has power, to control prices, if he so decides.  He has power under the 1958 Act to set up a Prices Advisory Committee and I would like to quote from that Act what power is given to him.  The Act states in part II, section 9:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may from time to time by warrant under his hand constitute such and so many bodies of persons as he thinks fit, each of which bodies shall be called a Prices Advisory Committee and is in this Act referred to as an Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>(2)  The warrant constituting an Advisory Committee shall state the names of the persons who are to be members of it.</P>
    <P>In section 10, the functions of an Advisory Committee are described as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  The functions of an Advisory Committee shall be to enquire into, and report to the Minister upon, such of the following matters as may be specified in the warrant constituting it, namely&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the prices charged for the commodity specified in the warrant by manufacturers thereof,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> (b)  the methods of marketing that commodity by manufacturers thereof,</P>
    <P>(c)  the charges made for rendering this service specified in the warrant by persons rendering it,</P>
    <P>(d)  the methods of rendering that service by persons rendering it.</P>
    <P>(2)  An enquiry by an Advisory Committee shall, as may be specified in the warrant constituting it, be&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  general, or</P>
    <P>(b)  relate to a particular area or to prices charged or charges made under particular conditions, or be otherwise limited in its scope.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from that that the Advisory Committee would have full powers to advise the Minister and that he would have full powers, having got their advice, to fix a price.  If he had not the power, it is given to him quite clearly in section 13 of Part III which says:</P>
    <P>(1)  Where the Minister, having considered a report of the Fair Trade Commission under the Act of 1953 is of opinion that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  restrictive practices, in connection with the supply or distribution of any commodity, exist, and</P>
    <P>(b)  by reason of the existence of such restrictive practices are being or may be charged for that commodity,</P>
    <P>the Minister may by order fix the maximum price at which that commodity may be sold.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister has ample powers under that Act and that he is well aware of them.  For his Prices Advisory Committee&mdash;and it is now five years since the introduction of the Act&mdash;he proposed to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that they should nominate a number of persons.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, believing that stability of price is more important than increased wages, nominated certain people, but, because of the fact that the Committee was never called on to function for the <Col N="547" /> past five years, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions never nominated anybody else to act on it, believing that the Minister had no intention of using the powers given to him.  The fact that there have been no meetings in the five years since that power was given to the Minister indicates that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was right in that assumption.</P>
    <P>The Minister is reluctant to exercise the powers given to him under that Act but he must be living in isolation if he has not heard in Cork and in Dublin and anywhere else he may travel, that prices have increased and that they have increased not only by 2½ per cent but by as much as ten per cent.  The Minister's only contribution to this problem that I am aware of is that he advised manufacturers to state publicly why they have increased their prices.  That is very little consolation to the consumer.  It may save the face of the Government but it is suggested that the manufacturers have increased prices to recoup themselves for the corporation profits tax they have had to pay retrospectively.  It is more than likely that that is part of it but that is very little comfort to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion of the Minister was that price lists should be displayed by retailers.  That suggestion has been observed in a number of shops, but, again, it is very little use unless the trader is compelled to sell at the price listed.  Supply and demand govern most things.  If you go into a shop for a commodity that is not available elsewhere or if you are seeking credit until the end of the week, you are compelled to buy at whatever price that retailer demands.  Advice was given to the people by the Minister and the Government to go round the shops and to deal with the retailer who had the lowest price.  If a man is a county council worker and paid by the fortnight, or if he is an industrial worker, he has very little left at the end of the week to give to his wife for her shopping.  His wife has to look for credit and there is very little use in telling her to go around and look for the best prices.  That is all right for people with cash in their <Col N="548" /> pockets but it is very far from being any use to the working people in the country towns and villages.</P>
    <P>The present increase in prices is 2½ per cent, plus the administrative cost to the retailers of implementing the tax.  What will happen when the ninth round wage increase comes into operation? The Taoiseach suggested to the trade unions that they would now be justified in seeking a readjustment of wages.  I am sure the trade unions are alive to when and how they should secure a wage increase.  Discussions are taking place with the employers in the hope of fixing a national wage increase. I am sure the trade unions know how much compensation will be necessary to offset the steady increase in prices.</P>
    <P>Judging from individual wage demands of which I have knowledge, I shall be surprised if a national wage agreement is reached or, if it is, I believe it will not be less than 20 per cent, not to talk about 2½ per cent plus certain additions.  The unions do not want increased wages purely to offset increased costs.  I believe any honest trade unionist would advise his members that stability of prices is more desirable than a steady spiral of wages chasing costs and then costs catching up with wages.  The unions would be loath to upset the wage structure and would seek, as they did last year, fringe benefits.  such as reduced working hours, increased holidays and certain other concessions that would not of themselves, if taken with increased output, lead to increased costs of production.</P>
    <P>The unions are as aware as the Government that we can only get from the employers what we give to them and that it is in the interests of both that prices are kept at a minimum. It is because the unions are interested that prices are kept at a minimum.  The unions have always given the deepest consideration to the effect of their demands on the less fortunate sections of the community. If the unions bear these people in mind and restrain themselves from making excessive claims, then the Government have a responsibility, too. The unions can take care of their members, but what happens to the <Col N="549" /> social welfare classes?  It is true the Minister can say that the benefits for old age pensioners, widows and orphans and sick and disabled have been increased.  State pensioners may get increases, but there are many pensioners from industrial concerns, people living on fixed incomes, who through no fault of their own are forced to exist on annuities which provided a fairly comfortable income when they were first fixed but which now have been reduced to a fraction of their value.</P>
    <P>The ninth round wage increase, plus the further increase in the prices of essential commodities, will bear on these people and on the social welfare group&mdash;indeed, on anybody living on a fixed income.  The Minister must take cognisance of that and act quickly.  I would ask him to accept his responsibility to the public.  He has the power and the means.  I ask him to indicate what he intends to do and when he intends to do it.  He should either do that or admit that this talk of a 2½ per cent increase is a myth to coat the pill of the turnover tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion, Sir, and reserve the right to speak later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We must consider what has been offered as a substitute for price control.  The Minister has repeatedly referred to the fact that the Fair Trade Commission are there, but it is reasonable to ask him what they have done about the increase in prices.  What have they done about the increase in butter of 2d. per lb, the increase in potatoes of 4d. per stone, in 2 lbs of sugar of 1d., in the small Procea pan of 1½d., in the lb of rib steak&mdash;the cheapest kind you can buy &mdash;of 4d., in the lb of rashers of 4d., in the bar of toilet soap of 2d.?  Those increases amount to a total of 10 per cent.  It is significant that some of those increases took place before the implementation of the turnover tax. People who have had to have recourse to hire-purchase to buy necessities for their homes have also had to face an increase of 2½ per cent, although the contracts might have been entered <Col N="550" /> into a long time ago.  This is another argument for price control.</P>
      <P>When can we have something positive done about increased prices?  We are told there is provision in the Act for a prices advisory body.  Deputy Kyne has indicated that a panel was established under the Act to do something about price control.  As far as I know, however, that panel has never met.  As a result, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions decided not to submit any more names for it for the last two years.  Talks are going on between the trade unions and the Federated Union of Employers on what increase in wages should be given to workers. These talks may result in an agreed formula or a free-for-all.  The trade union movement will be able to take care of their members so far as prices are concerned, but what of the other people who have not got a trade union organisation to look after them? Surely it is imperative that something be done to ensure that those people are not exploited any more?</P>
      <P>There is evidence that the increase in social benefits of half a crown to compensate for the turnover tax has been insufficient to meet the increase in prices.  The people I am referring to are old age pensioners, people living on small incomes&mdash;indeed, the CIE pensioners who were knocked out last night&mdash;as well as the unemployed and the sick.  If the present situation continues these people will be ground further down, and I believe nobody here wants that.  Some people are inclined to blame all these happenings on the turnover tax, but before the introduction of the tax there was a tendency&mdash;perhaps in anticipation of it&mdash;for prices to increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not long since the Dublin Council of Trade Unions, representing 40,000 organised workers, decided to request the Minister to introduce price control.  They were concerned because they knew that while the ninth round was about to come into operation, it was terribly important, if the ninth round were to be any good to anybody in eliminating the effect of recent increases in prices, that there should be price control.  The situation at the moment is that the eighth round of <Col N="551" /> wage increases, which was brought about in order to give people an improved standard of living, has been nullified by the increase in prices.</P>
    <P>That decision was passed unanimously. Indeed, it was not a political decision.  A Deputy from the Fianna Fáil Party was a delegate on the council and voted in favour of price control at the meeting.  But, while the resolution and the motion were passed on to the Department of Industry and Commerce, nothing has been done and up to recently there has not been even an acknowledgment of receipt of that motion.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that must be taken into consideration.  Deputy Kyne referred to the making of an order by the Minister in connection with the display of prices in shops.  That does not mean a thing in so far as price control is concerned.  People can still charge what they like, when they like. As I have said here before, there are six shops in Finglas West and there are approximately 15,000 people depending on those shops for practically everything they buy.  The shopkeepers can open when they like, and display whatever prices they like in their windows. That does not prevent them from charging what they like.  The people want some form of price control. They want an assurance that they will be able to get goods at reasonable prices and will not have to pay exorbitant prices for essential commodities simply because they live some distance from the big marketing centres.</P>
    <P>There are many thousands of working class people who deal in particular shops and have weekly or monthly accounts.  I must say that in some cases the shopkeepers are very often found to be friends and reliable people during a time of hardship caused by a trade dispute or unemployment.  While that is so, the customers of the shops feel that they are under an obligation not to complain, not to report, not to say anything about the increases in prices that take place.  The Minister may say that he is not getting many complaints.  I do not know whether he is or not.  I would expect that he would <Col N="552" /> be inundated with them.  The fact must be taken into account that it is not everybody who finds time to make a complaint or who knows how to make a claim.  A simple canvass of working class areas will satisfy any departmental official that prices have increased far in excess of 2½ per cent.  Indeed, there is proof positive that prices have increased in excess of ten per cent. That being so, the opportunity and the reason exist to do something about controlling prices.  It will not suffice for the Minister to say that he is awaiting reports from the Fair Trade Commission or some such body.  We cannot say to those living on social welfare benefits or on small salaries that they must endure hardship until these bodies make up their minds.  The matter is far too serious.</P>
    <P>It is rather significant that within the past few days one very large store in Dublin, which has a reputation for selling goods at reasonable prices and which sells all types of goods, ceased selling butter.  I presume that is as a result of pressure.  The store had been selling butter at less than 4/7d. a lb. I phoned that store this evening to ask if they were selling butter and I was told that they were not.  It is the general belief that that store is not selling butter now because the people who really control prices got at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the motion and to say, first of all, that it is a very reasonable motion from the consumer's point of view.  I hope that at this late stage the Government will have sufficient regard for the general public as to take immediate steps to implement the motion and bring in price control.</P>

    <P>I realise how difficult a task this is and how difficult a conversion it will be on the part of a Government which has declared time and again that price control machinery is a complete waste of time, that the proper method of controlling prices is by competition. I heard the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, on numerous occasions in this House over the last ten years sneer at the suggestion of price control by State interference.  I do not wish to <Col N="553" /> bore the House by producing the quotations but I think even the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as a loyal supporter of the Taoiseach, will admit that his Taoiseach has no faith whatever in price control machinery for the purposes suggested in the motion.  Therefore, as one who believes in the setting up of machinery such as is suggested in the motion, I find it very difficult to know how a Government like Fianna Fáil could be serious about price control if they do not believe in the methods suggested.</P>
    <P>Deputies, if they have not sufficiently long memories, can have recourse to the Dáil Debates to refresh their memories as to what their colleagues said in this House.  I see Deputy Colley in the House.  I should like to remind him and his colleagues of the confident way in which they spoke when the turnover tax was being discussed.  They suggested that the law of competition would solve the problem created by overcharging. I wonder what Deputy Colley and his colleagues in the Government Party think today of their expression of belief, their supposed belief, during the debate on the turnover tax?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Colley will intervene in the debate.  I must say that that is the most pleasant news I have heard yet.  According to Deputy Colley now, competition between traders has been sufficient to bring down the increase in prices to the 2½ per cent turnover tax which was imposed by the Government.  If that is true, according to what Deputy Colley says, then there is no need for his Minister for Industry and Commerce to threaten to bring in price control and there is no need, in fact, for this motion to be discussed at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking now as a person who has a little experience of shopping in Dublin, especially of window-shopping.  Having done a fair amount of that and worn out a pair of <Col N="554" /> shoes on the job, for the replacement of which I presume I will pay not 2½ per cent but at least nine per cent of an increase, I am satisfied, both from my window-shopping in Dublin and from practical experience down the country, that price control through competition is a myth.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, while the debate on the turnover tax was being conducted in this House not so many months ago, the manufacturers and the wholesalers were already preparing new prices, irrespective of the turnover tax.  Those prices were submitted to traders over the weeks prior to the turnover tax coming in as the new prices for various commodities to be imposed, irrespective of the turnover tax.  When the turnover tax itself came into operation, not alone had the 2½ per cent come in but what the Minister for Finance described as a little bit of help to the business man himself came in on top of it.</P>
      <P>The Government are getting this 2½ per cent but the manufacturer and the wholesaler, and, shall we say, the retailer in a minor way, are getting between them anything from five to 15 per cent.  I do not want to talk about the turnover tax but I will say that if ever there was a wasteful way of collecting money, we have it in this instance of the turnover tax.  It is the most wasteful method of collecting money that was ever adopted by any Government and it would only and could only be adopted by a Government who had no regard whatever for the public and were too lazy to go to the trouble of working out a proper tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance pointed out here on a number of occasions in connection with the turnover tax that all he was concerned with was getting the 2½ per cent; it did not matter what happened to the consumer.  We know that Fianna Fáil misjudged this whole issue and that it will bring political disaster on their heads.  All they are fighting now is a retreat and they are trying to make the best of that.  Let them not do harm to the country at this stage.  I hope they realise that if this free rein is given in regard to prices, it will mean that this country <Col N="555" /> will be priced out of the limited markets they have abroad.  There is no use in the Taoiseach appearing on a television programme and telling the public that prices are rising in other countries as well, that because they are rising in other countries, it is justification for allowing prices to rise here and that our position in the export market will not be worsened as a result of the increase in prices here.  That is the statement he made the other night on the programme &ldquo;Celtic Challenge&rdquo;. There is no doubt that it is a twilight programme as far as the Taoiseach is concerned, the twilight before darkness descends on his Party in the form of a disastrous electoral defeat which will come to them before the next six months are out.</P>
    <P>No matter what increases in price take place, the organised sections of our community will be able to recompense themselves financially.  There is strength in organisation and that strength exercised through the trade unions will ensure that an increased income will be given to workers because of the disastrous effects on the cost of living of the turnover tax. What will happen the remainder of the community?  Is it seriously suggested that those sections to whom Deputy Mullen referred, the old age pensioners, the widows, the orphans and other social welfare recipients, will be recompensed by the miserable increases which have been given?  Is it not a fact that the increases in social welfare allowances were absorbed by the increases in price which came even prior to the turnover tax being implemented?</P>
    <P>What about the other unorganised sections in our community?  What about the people who are living in rural Ireland?  What will happen to the people, for instance, in Connacht who live on small holdings under £15 valuation and who depend, as many of them do, on a local authority or a State Department to give them work for a period of the year in order to supplement their meagre earnings on a small farm?  Through the use of machinery and modern methods of work in State Departments and local <Col N="556" /> authorities, those people are now out of work.  How will they fare as regards living costs with the huge increase in the cost of living that has taken place and without work?  They are the unorganised, forgotten people and there are thousands of them in the country. The unemployment figures this week have topped the 50,000 mark and if you want to find out from where the increase in the unemployment figures has come, go down to any exchange in rural Ireland and you will find out.</P>
    <P>How are those people to live?  Who is to speak for them?  Who is to ensure their organised strength or who is to ensure they will get the same benefits as their colleagues who are organised in strength?  There is no means by which they can be helped.  In fact, as a result of the Government's failure to impose a standstill on prices, there is no alternative for many people in these areas but to get out of the country as fast as they can.  One of the first things we will find in the New Year is an increased impetus to emigration.</P>
    <P>The Government speak with divers tongues on this question of the cost of living and how to keep it down. Some of the young Deputies talk about competition amongst traders doing it.  How does competition among traders affect prices when the wholesaler and the manufacturer have put up their prices by three and four per cent prior to the implementation of the turnover tax?  Is it not a fact&mdash; and I challenge contradiction on this &mdash;that big business in this country has taken on Fianna Fáil at this stage?  Is it not a fact that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce are as sore as scalded cats because big business did not wait for another six months to put up its prices?  I know for a fact that the Fianna Fáil &ldquo;top notchers&rdquo; in this House have been in contact with the leading industrialists in the country, criticising them for raising their prices at this stage and suggesting to them that if they had any regard for Fianna Fáil who had fathered them over the years, they would have waited for about six months before increasing <Col N="557" />their prices and then they could have brought in their increases gradually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be, but I am not in the same type of pain as Fianna Fáil are at the moment.  One thing I should like the Minister to explain to me is this.  Why is it considered right and just that if trade <Col N="558" /> unionists or others, professional people demand increases in salaries or wages they must make their case openly? There is nothing wrong with that.  We have a Labour Court and people must go before it and fight their corner. They must give the reasons why they have requested an increase in their incomes and the whole thing is thrashed out thoroughly.  Why is it right to do that as far as the wage and salary classes are concerned and wrong for the people in business to be asked to give an explanation in public for increase in prices?</P>
      <P>I know there are occasions when increases in the prices of commodities are beyond the control of the distributors, the wholesalers or the retailers. That can happen through a jump in world costs or through an increase in wages at home, but why is it wrong to ask them to give a public explanation? I think the Government are afraid to bring that into the open and are being completely dishonest with the people.  In fact, price control is a dirty expression as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House because I know many more Deputies wish to speak on this motion, who even at this late stage want to impress on the Government that the present situation is disastrous as far as the consumer is concerned, that if there is no hope at this stage of forcing the Government to repeal the turnover tax, at least the Government should call a halt to the exploitation of the public by bringing in price control before further disasters occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing the motion, Deputy Kyne said its purpose was to get information as to what was happening about effecting control of increasing prices.  I might at this stage refer to what my powers are under the Prices Act, 1958, to which the Labour Party motion refers.  In the first place, in so far as the cost of commodities or the cost of rendering services are concerned, I can, on the report of the Fair Trade Commission into circumstances which indicate that collective action exists between traders which eliminates competition and causes <Col N="559" /> prices to rise unduly, take action to fix prices.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, there is in existence a Groceries Order which was made by the Fair Trade Commission and which was legislated into the statutes of this country by this House, which provides a remedy whereby traders who act in that collective way to eliminate competition, can be prosecuted if they are in breach of the terms of that Order. In relation to manufacturers' prices, I have power to draw from the Prices Advisory Panel to set up a committee to investigate the action of manufacturers who, by their action, cause prices to increase unduly, and on the report of that Prices Advisory Committee, I can fix maximum prices.</P>
      <P>There are four commodities which are exempted from the obligation to go through that procedure&mdash;bread and sugar, milk and butter&mdash;in respect of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce can act without that procedure but, in the case of milk and butter, he can act only after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture. Fourthly, the other main remedial action the Minister for Industry and Commerce is empowered to take under the 1958 Act is the making of an order requiring price lists to be prominently displayed of certain scheduled commodities. These in the main represent the action open to the Minister in circumstances like this.</P>
      <P>With regard to price control generally, and having given a broad outline of my powers in that respect, I think I must emphasise it is totally illusory to think prices can be satisfactorily controlled by Government action or by some statutory authority. It certainly would be impossible to devise a system which would prevent prices rising when costs of production are rising.  When the Prices Act was being debated in this House, that point of view was generally accepted.  The Taoiseach, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce then, expressed it, and Deputy Cosgrave, speaking on behalf of the main opposition Party, agreed with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> I should like to quote what Deputy Cosgrave said from column 126 of volume 164 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I suppose experience has taught Deputies on both sides of the House but it is possible that both sides have contributed to the illusion that prices can be controlled by Government action or by some statutory authority.  Experience in recent years, however, has demonstrated that, with occassional exceptions, that is not so.  In fact, experience of wartime and emergency conditions has shown that with the exception of special circumstances pertaining to wartime or emergency conditions and then only in relation to goods which are either rationed or within the control of the Government, it is not possible to make price control effective.</P>
    <P>When I say this was the generally accepted view of both sides at the time, I think I can justify that claim. The Labour Party did not demur in the slightest from that statement and that exposé of the position.  In fact, for some reason, they did not contribute at all to the Second Reading. The fact is that we now have this Prices Act in operation which was accepted by the House without division or amendment of any sort.  It is true that certain price increases took place, some before and some since the coming into operation of the turnover tax, but some of these did not have reference to the turnover tax.  I instanced these in reply to a parliamentary question.  I took, for example, coal and I said as a result of world shortages due to many circumstances &mdash;one of which was the very adverse weather conditions obtaining last year &mdash;freight charges had increased and, therefore, with the scarcity of coal and the increase in freight charges, there was a consequent impact here over which we had no control.</P>
    <P>Deputy S. Dunne did ask a question about stocks of coal but I think I can challenge Deputy Mullen that I got no information from Deputy S. Dunne about the quantities he alleged existed in the country.  He asked, in view of the fact that there were certain quantities existing before the operation <Col N="561" /> of the turnover tax, why this increase in coal prices took place.  I made inquiries and investigated the subject-matter of the question.  As far as I could ascertain, there were no stocks of that nature in the country before 1st of November.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of bread, there was a slight increase as a result of an increase in the cost of flour.  I think I explained why that took place: it was because of the increased quantities of millable wheat of a higher standard than usual taken in by the mills from Irish farmers for conversion into flour and the consequentially decreased imports of cheaper flour for admixture to the Irish supplies.  That <Col N="562" /> caused the increased price of flour which effected a small increase in the price of bread.</P>
      <P>It is true also that some manufacturers' prices increased irrespective of the turnover tax because of increased cost of raw materials and because in some cases the manufacturers held back the effect of the increased cost of production, due to the eighth round of wage increases.  I got a number of complaints about these increases and I investigated where I was able to do so.  I went to the sources of supply or the manufacturers.  In some cases, I was satisfied, from the reasons given by manufacturers, that the increases were justified.  In other cases, I was not.  Some of these cases are still under consideration.</P>
      <P>I do not think I have any difficulty in accepting the terms of this motion. The first part of it says:</P>
      <P>... in view of the fact that no satisfactory explanation of the necessity for such rises in prices is available to Dáil Éireann or to the general public, the Government should without delay set up, ...</P>
      <P>I did ask manufacturers of commodities in which price increases took place to give me reasons for these increases. Some did give satisfactory reasons and, where they did not, I decided to take action to which I shall refer later.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the motion asking the Government to set up machinery under the Prices Act, 1958, for the &ldquo;public investigation and, where necessary, control, of any such increases in the prices of essential goods and services&rdquo;, I think I shall be able to indicate to the movers of the motion that the action I have initiated will be sufficient to meet their purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the turnover tax was introduced, members of the Government, including myself to a considerable extent, said we believed that the force of competition would reduce prices; that those who exploited the situation would be quickly identified and forced to reduce their prices.  In many cases there has been a reduction in prices in recent days as a result of competition by honest traders in different centres. <Col N="563" /> There are, I admit, some small centres of population where collective action by traders has pushed up prices unduly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that be a restrictive practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that would be a restrictive trade practice.  As I told the House, I asked the Fair Trade Commission to carry out certain surveys, first, a general survey and then, special surveys, particularly where genuine complaints were made of collective action which eliminated competition and forced prices up.  I have here now the first reports of the authorised officers of the Fair Trade Commission who carried out these inspections and I propose to take certain action in regard to them.  I say very specifically that where I find as a result of these reports that collective action is taken by traders in an area to exploit the situation brought about by the turnover tax by increasing prices unduly, I intend to use to the full the powers given to me in the Prices Act, 1958.  I am issuing that as a solemn warning and not only that but I propose as I shall indicate in a minute, to back it up by positive action.</P>
      <P>To refer in more detail to the Fair Trade Commission's activities, through their authorised officers, this general survey was carried out in certain places.  In Dublin, for example, there was one particular complaint about the price of intoxicating liquor.  It was suggested that the trade organisation catering for licensed premises had issued a list of recommended prices. Authorised officers visited a number of licensed premises in and around Dublin.  In some cases, traders had adhered to the recommended prices for a while and then brought them down, while some traders had never adopted the recommended prices.</P>

      <P>As well as that a Fair Trade Commission inspector visited a number of small towns throughout the country and their visits are still being pursued.  It is now being done on a countrywide basis.  Some of the reports which I now have indicate <i>prima facie</i> evidence of collective action which resulted in the elimination of competition and the forcing up of prices.  In these cases I have instructed the officers of my Department to take action to initiate prosecutions against the traders concerned.</P>
      <P>The House will remember, too, that I made an Order under the prices Act requiring lists of prices of certain commodities to be displayed prominently in shops.  I have asked inspectors of my Department to carry out a survey of the extent to which this Order is being complied with.  I have asked them to offer warnings to traders concerned in different centres of the country to the effect that unless the price lists are displayed, prosecutions will follow and I can assure the House that I intend to carry this warning into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the other type of action which I can take, the setting up of a <Col N="565" /> prices advisory committee, it is true, as Deputy Mullen said and, I think, Deputy Kyne, too, that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions refused to nominate persons to the panel from which I can nominate a prices advisory committee.   Nevertheless, as as result of the inquiries I had made about manufacturers of a particular commodity&mdash;and I will not name it this evening because it will be very soon known&mdash;I have set up a prices advisory committee to carry out an investigation of the actions of these manufacturers to see whether an increase in prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>I want to refer to Deputy Mullen's remarks about the Dublin Workers' Council.  I am going to anticipate his question here tomorrow, to nail his misunderstanding of the question on the spot.  He said I did not reply to <Col N="566" /> the letter of the Dublin Council of Trade Unions.  The letter was received in my Department on 18th November and an acknowledgment was issued to the secretary of the council on the 19th.  A further letter was received on November 28th and a reply was issued on 3rd December.</P>

Their letter was dated the 12th and I received it on the 13th.  On the 14th, there was an article in the <i>Irish Times.</i>  Somebody of the Federation apparently told the <i>Irish Times</i> reporter that a request had been sent to me and that no reply had yet been received, the implication being of course that I had sat on it and ignored the request.</P>

I believe that even now prices are levelling out.

      <P>You are pretty much a household figure all the same.  I should mention that I am going to address myself to the Minister's remarks. In case you might think I am digressing from the actual subject of the discussion, I am not, because I can hear now the hollow and ironic laughter that will echo around the pubs of Dublin at 9 o'clock to-night when the Minister is reported in the words which he used here to-night in regard to the prices of drink in Dublin.  Deputy Colley supported him. I do not know where Deputy Colley gets his information in regard to drink prices but it seems to be just as faulty as that supplied to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the <i>Irish Times</i> and you were probably cut out of it.  Anybody who suggests, and any official of the Department who seriously suggests to the Minister, that there has not been a steep increase, much more than 2½ per cent, in drink prices in this city is either a knave or a fool.  The Minister said that he had got these complaints that the trade association had circulated recommended price lists, that some licensed premises had displayed the lists and that others did not and that some people put up the prices but in most cases the reaction to the position was such that he did not deem any action by him necessary because the suggestion or the inference, being supported by Deputy Colley, was that there was no increase at all.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy's finely-adjusted lawyer's mind can make something else out of it but I think it is incorrect.  The Minister being a Corkman would not know about Dublin, but his colleague, Deputy Colley, should know better, and what I say is that when the news comes in to-night and the few people who can afford now to be in pubs, especially on a Wednesday night, in this city are startled in the middle of their drink by this statement I can hear a mixture of ironic laughter and a language which I think even Corkmen would not know. This is the measure of the degree of dependability with which we can regard the Minister's assurances here to-night. The Minister said that he saw no difficulty in accepting the terms of the motion, but it is a fact that his whole attitude up to now in this matter has struck me as being one of &ldquo;come day, go day, God send Sunday.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That particular attitude was quite evident from the very first day of the reading of the Budget speech in this House, when I got the impression listening to the Minister for Finance&mdash; and not alone I but a good many other people got it&mdash;that he was reading a lot of that speech for the first time when he came into the House, that he had never read it before, and that it was handed to him by his officials in his Department.  He had some idea surely that there was a turnover tax coming in, but until he started turning over the pages he did not know what a morass was coming to light.  What a morass it has proved to be, so much so that my constituents throughout County Dublin, including the area of Ballyfermot which I mentioned here on several occasions, and which has a vital interest to myself, Deputy Burke, Deputy Boland, Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Clinton and Deputy Rooney, have felt the lash of high, increased prices by profiteering unscrupulous people within a matter of hours after the coming of the tax and in some cases long before the tax became legally operative at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion on the Order Paper is prompted by the conviction we have that there is not any real appreciation in the Department of Industry and <Col N="571" /> Commerce of what is happening abroad in this city and in this country. To say that there has been no increase in the price of drink in Dublin is an example of how blind people can get and how much out of touch with the facts they can be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate, I was dealing with certain aspects of the discussion on this Bill. In the main, Deputies coming from the west of Ireland, and irrespective of Party, and who understood the problem involved here, have welcomed the Bill and welcomed the approach made to the problem in this Bill.  We should go ahead with the new schemes now proposed and see how they work. Although some Deputies have suggested that other measures might be taken, we do not want a whole flood of new schemes which possibly would interfere with one another and perhaps upset the market for land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some matters about which Deputies expressed misgivings&mdash; the definition of congested areas, the new powers for senior inspectors, rural houses, non-nationals' purchases, and the making of any limit on the size of the holdings.  I will now deal with items which cause difficulty in the sequence in which they occur in the Bill and thereafter I will deal with those items which Deputies complained should be in the Bill and are not in the Bill.  From the discussions on the Bill, there appears to me to be a considerable amount of misunderstanding amongst Deputies generally as to what the land law is and what my powers are, as Minister, in directing policy. There are many matters which can be achieved by a policy directive without legislation and under the existing law. Indeed, some 12 months ago I did direct as a matter of policy that the Land Commission should take the new <Col N="572" /> family-sized holding of 40 to 45 acres as the aim they should try to achieve. In schemes awaiting division and where people were waiting allotments of land, if these had not been finalised by the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission before that directive, the inspectorate were ordered to resubmit these schemes to conform with the new concept laid down by me of the family holding of 40 to 45 acres.</P>
    <P>I am giving that as an instance of what can be done by policy directive without coming to this House.  I also ordered as a policy directive that the inspectorate should start to establish a register of lands throughout the length and breadth of the country which had been let for a period of five years.  The idea was that where these lands had been let and where the owners were absent, they would get notice from the Land Commission, once these holdings were on the register, and the Land Commission would offer to purchase these lands and find out the intention of these people, whether they were going to come back and reside on the lands and work them, and if not, the powers that now exist for the compulsory acquisition of these vacant holdings would be used by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>These directives were put into force over the past year as a matter of policy.  Matters such as the type of Land Commission house can be prescribed as a matter of policy.  In cases where it was not necessary to wait for this Bill, we went ahead with the new concept of a family farm which we are endeavouring to achieve and which we are laying down as what should be in the minds of the Land Commission inspectorate for ultimate achievement in the resettlement of our land pattern.</P>
    <P>Some complaints were made by some Deputies that people had &ldquo;jumped the gun&rdquo; and that I had been unwise in publicising my intentions in connection with the Bill some 18 months or two years ago.  Let me say that I did that very deliberately.  Some Deputies were complaining about what are alleged to be revolutionary provisions in this Bill.  I thought it was fair to <Col N="573" /> give due notice of what was the intention as far as policy is concerned and in addition, I wanted to let the people throughout the country and in rural organisations know what I intended.  Indeed I recollect on one occasion appealing to Deputies to have the fullest discussions on these proposals which I intended to introduce.</P>
    <P>I realise that I am adopting a very serious change in the Land Commission's approach to this national problem and asking for very definite powers to try to make some impact on this problem in this day and age and to provide a modern machine for the Land Commission for the intake of land that will meet present requirements. I felt that it was necessary that these proposed powers should be widely discussed if our people were to understand them and if Deputies in rural organisations were to understand them.  I realised, too, that it would be necessary, also, to have widespread co-operation with the aims of the proposed legislation which it was my intention to introduce.  Let me say that I believe that, in the main, in so far as lands were transferred because of my statements, it was a good thing nationally.  In a number of these cases, people who had gone away from this country for many years, who were in America, Canada or England, and who had no intention of returning, transferred land to relatives and the lands are now in production.  It is true, as a number of Deputies have said, that a number of people did jump the gun in anticipation of this Bill but let me assure the House that with the new powers I am seeking, it will be possible for the Land Commission, where the case justifies it, to move in and acquire many of the lands so transferred in order to defeat the intentions expressed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been, I am very gratified to hear, over the past fortnight intense interest in the provisions of this Bill as expressed by practically every Deputy who spoke.  Indeed, as long as I have been a member of this House I do not recollect any Bill that seemed to arouse more interest amongst such a large number of Deputies.  I welcome that; that is what I desire.  I hope that <Col N="574" /> before Committee Stage and indeed by tonight, all the Deputies who expressed genuine fears through misunderstanding or otherwise of the provisions of this Bill will have them allayed by me and I will point out the necessity for having the powers which I propose to take here.  I am not, as those who have known me over many years will agree, without a knowledge of these matters in the west of Ireland, indeed for half my lifetime which I have spent in this House.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the powers sought here are not only necessary but are absolutely essential if we are to make any impression on holding our population in rural Ireland: otherwise, we can let emigration and the other forces depopulate our country.  I shall come to these aspects of the arguments made by some Deputies on a later stage of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies taunt me cynically with being a westerner bringing in a western Bill for the sole benefit of the west of Ireland.  I think there was such comment by Deputy Rooney in particular, Deputy Hogan (South Tipperary) and others who have not a clue about this problem.  Let me refer to the Schedule to this Bill which is taken from the definition of &ldquo;congested area&rdquo; in the Land Act, 1909.  It refers to Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, portion of County Clare comprising the former rural districts of Ballyvaughan, Ennistymon, Kilrush, Scariff, Tulla and Kildysart and the portion of West Cork comprising the former rural districts of Bantry, Castletown, Schull and Skibbereen.  That was the definition of &ldquo;congested area&rdquo; as set out in the Land Act, 1909.  The authors of that Act could no doubt be accused by the Deputies Rooney and P. Hogan (South Tipperary) and others of that day of acting solely out of self-interest.</P>
    <P>Let me point out that the old Congested Districts Board was set up and provided with funds to deal with the counties I have included in this Bill&mdash; the congested areas.  Furthermore, the first duty of the Irish Land Commission in its charter is to deal with congested <Col N="575" /> areas, the national congestion problem&mdash;and that problem exists in those counties.  It is quite true for Deputies to say that there is an historical background to all this.</P>
    <P>I know the difficulties I am facing as Minister for Lands in introducing this legislation but in so far as I am privileged, and the other Deputies serving in this House at this time, to undo the work of Cromwell we shall endeavour to make the best job of it we can and that is the purpose of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This nation has inherited these intensely congested areas for the historical reasons already referred to by other Deputies.  This Schedule is not invented by me, as a Mayo Minister for Lands.  It is a Schedule which was laid down in the Land Acts all over these years and it was taken directly from the definition of &ldquo;congested area&rdquo; in the 1909 Land Act.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have complained that congested areas other than those areas on the western seaboard have been omitted from the Schedule.  Of course, that is true.  Some Deputies have failed to appreciate the first implications of section 4 (1) (b) and my earlier explanation.  Wherever, in the north, south, east or west there is an area in which the existing conditions are comparable to the conditions found in a western congested area I shall be seriously prepared to consider making an order which will have the effect of putting the congests in that area on an equal footing with those already covered in the Schedule to this Bill.</P>
      <P>It will readily be acknowledged that the western seaboard is the principal centre of congestion.  There it is more pronounced.  There it originated owing to our history.  There is the chief drain of emigration.  There is the chief area in the country of depopulation of the land.  We must have national priorities in this field as well as in every other field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have adopted the traditional congested districts merely as a starting point and as rapidly as possible other congested areas will be brought within <Col N="576" /> the scope of this Bill.  We are taking power here for the Minister to schedule any pocket of congestion where he finds it in any county as a congested area.  It naturally follows that where an area outside the areas scheduled in this Bill and taken from the 1909 Act is scheduled under the regulation that would be made under that particular section then that is a congested area and will be entitled to all the benefits provided for in this Bill, including the half-annuity benefit.  This, of course, will take time.  What is proposed to be done and what I must have done is to get my outdoor staff in the different counties to report on pockets of congestion that would be comparable with the conditions in the western areas and these then can be scheduled under the Bill as congested areas entitled to be dealt with in the same way as these counties and areas I have referred to and which are included in the Schedule to this Bill.</P>
    <P>All kinds of figures have been thrown around this House in the form of statistics. I should like to warn Deputies to be cautious about the conclusions they draw from statistics about the number of uneconomic holdings in the State. That is true whether these statistics come from publications of farming organisations or from State agencies themselves.  Not all Deputies were quite as modest as Deputy Donnellan who was not prepared to give the source of his statistics.  Some Deputies purported to quote from different documents here tonight but the figures of smallholdings from the <i>Statistical Abstract,</i> for example, do not reflect the number of congests because they include the holdings of those who hold land as a sideline.</P>
    <P>Rural Deputies familiar with the problems of congested areas will know that in many cases some farmers have three, four or five rent receipts or three, four or five demand notes for rates.  Some Deputy said he knew one small farmer who had 25 different receivable orders in respect of 25 different patches.  Therefore, taking these statistics, if you quote&mdash;as many Deputies have quoted&mdash;valuations of £1 to £3, £1 to £5, and so on, in many cases these would be just houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's kindness in saving me from any injury.</P>
      <P>Now, when I was endeavouring&mdash;I have been studying this problem since I went into the Department&mdash;to try to get a true picture, not alone of the number of congests but also the number of what I call genuine farmers, I found it quite impossible to get that information from existing statistics. Before the last census, therefore, at my instance, special questions were put in the forms designed to get the correct information so that we would for the future be in a position to quote accurate statistics and not figures which purported to represent, but did not in fact, represent, a true picture of the number of people deriving a livelihood solely or mainly from the land or the number of congests on the land. As a result of the 1961 census, I have now got a new set of figures related to land held by persons whose main occupation is farming.  These statistics &mdash;they exclude non-farmers&mdash;indicate that there are only a little over 200,000 true farm holdings in the country. When I say 200,000 true farm holdings, I mean there are only 200,000 people approximately who are solely or mainly dependent on farming as an occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those 200,000 holdings must be, of course, broken down as between the different categories of farmers, big and small, and in that 200,000, we shall endeavour to find the number of congested holdings or non-viable holdings, or, as I prefer to describe them, the number of holdings that are not up to the standard of the family farm I am <Col N="578" /> endeavouring to achieve under this Bill.  All kinds of wild figures have been quoted here during this debate&mdash; 320,000 farmers, 270,000 farmers, and so on.  It is obvious from the figures I have just quoted that these statistics are haywire.  The people with whom we should be concerned here, the people who live on and deal in the land of Ireland, are the 200,000 to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said in the course of the debate about things that are not in the Bill and it is, therefore, necessary for me now to answer some of the points.  I told the House that migrants, even during the past year, have been placed on the family farm of 40 to 45 acres.  From all the evidence I have&mdash;I know many of these migrants and I have had reports from agricultural instructors in relation to some colonies&mdash;the vast majority of these migrants have been an outstanding success.  In the early days of the history of this State, the Land Commission took migrants who were partly fishermen and partly farmers, or cottiers, and some of these admittedly were not successful, but for a number of years back now, the migrants from the western seaboard have not alone proved an outstanding success but have been an example of thriftiness and hard work in their new neighbourhood. I would invite any Deputy who may pass through the town of Kilcock to inquire from any trader; he will be very quickly told what has been achieved by these migrants from the west.  In every field of human endeavour, of course, there are the odd failures as well as the successes.  Many of these migrants, however, have progressed from the initial comparatively small holdings to quite substantial holdings acquired through their own hard work and thrift.  Many years back, there was strong feeling in some counties about migrants.  I thought that day had gone.</P>

      <P>Deputies, irrespective of which side they sit, should resolutely set their faces against what I describe as segregationists; the people <Col N="579" /> who try to foster narrow, local prejudices for their own selfish reasons. These segregationists are actuated by the same selfish prejudices as actuated Governor Faubus in Little Rock or the white extremists in Dallas, Texas. Parish pump politics should finish for all time in this country.  We ought to realise that the country is small enough and we have enough borders without trying to raise more borders for selfish political motives.</P>

      <P>It is gratifying to know that the section dealing with loans for migrants has been welcomed by practically every Deputy.  Deputy O. J. Flanagan expressed the view that there should be interest-free loans and that the section should be drafted accordingly. I should like to point out here that he misquoted the Taoiseach; his suggestion was that these loans might be free of interest in the early years. Under subsection (1) advances are authorised in connection with the purchase of land and the definition is wide enough to provide loans, when regulations are made, for any purpose in connection with land.</P>
      <P>Some speakers suggested that certain functions of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Local Government should be taken over by the Land Commission.  There are other agencies, such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which come into the picture, whose administration has been geared to deal with many of the matters mentioned in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested, in relation to life annuities, that these pensions might be made available to middle-aged persons who were unable to work <Col N="580" /> the land or who were prepared to get out of farming.  My first reaction is that I do not see any objection in principle. If any person, young or old, is dissatisfied with farming, then the best interests of the nation would be served by encouraging him to get off the land so that it may be put in more competent hands.  I am quite prepared to broaden the scope of the section in that respect if, on closer study, no serious difficulties present themselves.  The House will appreciate, however, that I shall have to give further consideration to the matter.  At present the only difficulties I see is that a middle-aged person might get a relatively small annuity and might not be tempted by it.  On the other hand, if he had a large farm, the annuity would be substantial, even with the long life expectation.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked for an elaboration of the scheme but they will have to wait for that until the emergence of the regulations to be made under section 4.  Other Deputies asked for more particulars about the completion of the cash purchase scheme but I shall be dealing with that in more detail later on.  The Land Commission can take steps to purchase from incapacitated people either by way of cash purchase or by way of life annuity, or partly by one and partly by the other.  It is my intention to provide for these life annuities and cash purchases in order to induce the incapacitated people to part with their land in any way they can.  The transfer order to which I have referred will operate to give the Land Commission a good statutory title to the land.  We are taking power to do other title cleaning up work in other sections of this Bill which I will deal with when I refer to some of the points made by Deputy Seán Flanagan.</P>
    <P>The life annuity will be calculated actuarially, taking into account the normal expectation of life of the person and it will be calculated, I will say, as generously as possible. Some Deputies seem to think that this was a compulsory matter and that these people could be compelled to part with their land.  That is not so. <Col N="581" /> These life annuities which will be given to old people or to people who are incapacitated can only be used by way of inducement.  They will get their choice either to take cash for their lands, or part cash and part annuity, or part of each and can also retain possession of the dwellinghouse and possibly a couple of gardens for their lifetime.  The scheme will be made as flexible as possible and it is very necessary that this should be so.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that life annuities up to £3 a week will not be taken into account under the means test for old age pension purposes.  The main use that can be made of this particular section is in dealing with the hard core of congestion left and that is in the rundale estates.  There are approximately 7,000 unvested holdings and they represent in the main the hard core of congestion in this country.  The cream is gone off the milk as far as the acquisition of large estates in the west of Ireland is concerned.  Practically every one of them that I know of has been acquired and where you have these pockets of rundale they are there because nothing that the Land Commission could do down through the years could solve the problem in any way.</P>
    <P>This may explain some of the complaints made by Deputies about long lettings made by the Land Commission. In order to divide these rundale estates it is necessary to get the agreement of every individual on that estate.  On these estates these little holdings are fragmented up to 20 or 21 different patches and it means the selection of different fields to be joined together and the owners having to agree as to what they will take in order to provide a practical unit.  There must be co-operation on the part of all and in many cases it is difficult to achieve that.  It is difficult in rural Ireland to get ten or 20 people prepared to move their fields and lands which they were used to.  In many cases you may have jealousy over one person or another getting a certain piece of land.  If one individual refuses to co-operate the Land Commission's plans for the estate may be hamstrung and even though they may have on hands one, <Col N="582" /> two or three holdings there is nothing they can do with them.  All they can do is wait for the old person to die off and hope that he will be succeeded by some more progressive individual and that in that way they will ultimately achieve agreement.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the cases that are left are those that have proved insoluble up to this time.  It is in cases like these I consider that the power of pensioning off aged and incapacitated owners will be of tremendous help to the Land Commission in trying to achieve their objective through a rearrangement scheme in these areas.</P>
    <P>Deputies have complained that section 7 involves discrimination between holders of different types in different parts of the country.  I explained in my opening statement that the State is putting a great deal of work, money and effort into the solving of this problem and that there must be some limit to subsidisation by the taxpayer.  In the least congested parts of the country it should not be necessary to have the Exchequer foot too many of the bills.  I have been assured that applicants in the least congested counties would be happy to pay for any land they got.  At present they are paying high conacre rents without any prospect of ever owning the lands they work.</P>
    <P>It is true that in many of these cases they are paying up to £25 an acre for the letting of land.  I distinctly recollect meeting a large deputation that came to see me before the Oaklands Estate in Carlow was acquired. They pointed out that they were paying from £25 to £30 an acre for the letting of those lands.  They added that if the Land Commission would move in they would be delighted to pay back the full cost of the land to the Exchequer by way of annuity.  They said that if they could get the land for up to £10 an acre it would appear that they were getting it for nothing in comparison with what they were paying.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Brennan stated tonight that he knew a man who paid £800 for conacre last year.  There has to be <Col N="583" /> a system of national priorities and I put it fairly to the House that if a man is able to pay £800 for conacre in one year and still make a living would it be fair to the Exchequer and to the people in intensely congested areas to limit the amount of land available to solve the congestion problem by halving that man's annuity or subsidising him to the extent of 50 per cent for the land he is getting?  Incidentally, I think it is fair comment on those who say that farming does not pay that a man can pay £800 for conacre and still make a living afterwards.</P>
    <P>This is a question of priorities; first things must come first.  The real answer to the Deputies who are concerned with this matter is that under this Bill, I am taking power to schedule any pocket of congestion in any county. Where any such pocket is so scheduled, the people there will be entitled to the full benefits that congests are entitled to under the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jones and others seem to be apprehensive that somewhere in section 9 might be found means to compel local authorities to pay for Land Commission work.  They can rest assured that the section is not capable of such interpretation and I have no such idea in mind.  The essential point is to allow local authorities voluntarily to co-operate with the Land Commission by helping to pay for work which will be for the benefit of the local authority.  Perhaps some purists might say there is no statutory authority for paying out the taxpayers' money in such instances by the Land Commission.  It is desirable, therefore, to provide clear-cut statutory authority.  If the councils do not see fit to exercise it in any particular case, well and good; they need not do so.  The local authorities are in full <Col N="584" /> charge of their own business.  But if they do, if they want the Land Commission to be free to co-operate with them or if they want to pay something for the Land Commission, after this section is passed, they will not be questioned by the Local Government auditor.  This is a clearing up procedure. It would be purely voluntary for the local authority to co-operate with the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a rather technical section, and I shall go into it fully on Committee Stage.  It does not transfer any liability from the Land Commission to the local authority.  Its purpose is to set out clearly the liability of my Department in relation to improvement works after the Land Commission have parted with possession of the lands.  Ministers of various Governments have always taken the view that the Land Commission are not a road maintenance authority or a drainage maintenance authority.  The Land Commission never had permanent maintenance organisations in the different local authority areas, unlike, for instance, the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>Under section 10, the Department will be legally liable for the period during which the Land Commission are in sole and exclusive occupation of the lands.  The Department will also be liable where there is a question of negligence and where the injury is not a matter of expressed contract.  Where the Department are not legally liable, it will still be possible to give grants in appropriate cases and, if necessary, to carry out the work on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.  Indeed, as Deputies know, that practice is adopted in many cases at present.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, there was an action about some allegedly implied liability at law and the matter was raised at the Committee of Public Accounts.  It was as a result of that that this was inserted here.  This section would not affect cases where there was an expressed liability about embankments assumed by the Land Commission on the purchase of old estates.  Without any liability at all, in suitable cases the Land Commission have done some of these embankments.  They do them by way of <i>ex gratia</i> grant.  This section <Col N="585" /> is not, as some Deputies seem to think, for the purpose of unloading expressed liability on to the local authority.  It is necessary.  If Deputies give me specific instances about which they are worried, I shall deal with them more fully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 13 was fully understood and appreciated by some Deputies, but completely misunderstood, and, I think, in some cases, deliberately misconstrued, by others.  Many of the Deputies who spoke about this section were completely unrealistic and illogical. On one hand, they call for speedier action by the Land Commission in purchasing places bought by foreigners and other undesirable owners.  They give instances of what they allege to be delay and procrastination on the part of the Land Commission in dealing with these cases.  But they completely overlook the fact it is because of the restricted powers of the Land Commission that they cannot deal with the cases referred to.  Any Deputy from rural Ireland knows that the existing procedure, with all the red tape it involves, is regularly defeating the purposes of the Land Commission across the length and breadth of this land.</P>
    <P>I know how this section can be misinterpreted, and I was therefore very glad to see that Deputy Dillon realised that it was necessary.  He stated it was not unreasonable.  Later, I shall deal with Deputy Dillon's fears of tying in this section with section 27.  With Deputy Dillon as leader realising the necessity for this section, it was rather amusing to hear Deputy T. F. O'Higgins, who either did not read this Bill at all or who has no idea of the provisions of the Land Acts, describe this section as an atrocious one and deploring its inclusion in this Bill.  We also had the threat from him that this section was completely unconstitutional, but I propose to deal with that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I think it is a fair interpretation of the debate to say there was no serious objection to this standstill until the point was made that section 27 would, in effect, permit senior inspectors to impose a standstill.  Some Deputies seemed to misunderstand that.  I shall <Col N="586" /> deal with the question of senior inspectors when I come to deal with the other section.  For the moment, let us assume the standstill to be acceptable if it were imposed solely by decision of the Commissioners themselves.  If Deputies have any lingering doubts about the matter, I should like to remind them that, when these compulsory notices are issued by the Land Commission, the Commission normally have some reason for believing that the lands against which they are moving are owned by an absentee, by a bad farmer or by a person who is selling out.  Deputy Jones need not fear that this standstill will have the effect of shutting out other purchasers.  The compulsory acquisition machine does not dominate the market to that extent.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this section and the need for it, I should like Deputies to realise what the position is at present. If a Deputy or a deputation of local farmers comes into the local Land Commission office and tells them that John So-and-So's farm is up for sale and is needed for the relief of local congestion or that this farm has been let for the past 20 years and that it is needed or, possibly, that there is a local rumour that John is selling out to a foreigner, the local Land Commission inspector takes particulars of the complaint and the allegations.  That has to be passed on by him under the present procedure to a senior inspector and that senior inspector reports to the acquisition section of the Land Commission in Dublin and, in that acquisition section, that report has to go through the gamut of three different officers, and from that acquisition section ultimately the matter is submitted for a ruling by two of the Commissioners. Now, we have the Commissioners' ruling on this, and if the Commissioners approve, the acquisition section serves the inspection notice and the next step is that the inspection is made.  The whole purpose of this inspection is to find out whether these lands are suitable or not suitable for Land Commission purposes.</P>
    <P>With all this red tape on the line up from the local office to the acquisition section and from there to two Lay Commissioners whose sole function <Col N="587" /> it is to authorise this notice to be served, it takes all that time to go through all those people.  What is actually in the notice when it is served? This notice has no effect other than that the owner of the land concerned is notified that at a certain date a Land Commission inspector will call on him to inspect that land to see whether it is or is not suitable for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners are busy men. These officials are busy men.  This is purely a rubber stamp procedure for the purpose of notifying the owner that on a certain date a Land Commission inspector will call to see whether the lands are suitable for the relief of congestion or not and it takes under the present procedure in many cases from 18 months to two years from the time the local deputation comes in to go through this gamut before this rubber stamp notice comes down to enable the local Land Commission inspector to give notice that he will call to see whether the land is suitable or not.</P>
    <P>What happens in nine out of ten cases is that the individual concerned brings the nephew home from England or he sells the land to a foreigner or sells it to anybody but the Land Commission in order to defeat the Land Commission's purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>And you allow him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The result is the local people are defeated, the Land Commission are defeated and, furthermore, if the Land Commission go to bring compulsory acquisition proceedings in that case, by the time they have the notice as a result of the inspection published under the present law in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and if the case ultimately comes to court, it is another two years before the case does come to court and then what the court must consider is the user of the land when the case comes before it.  So that the person who has let the land for years can go ahead and rehabilitate it and bring in people to till it and in court will be in a position to say: &ldquo;I have stocked the land.  I have tilled it.  I have changed <Col N="588" /> my way of life,&rdquo; and in that way he or whoever succeeds him can succeed before the Land Commission Court.</P>
      <P>In this procedure we are providing here, in the first place, to deal with the divisional inspector signing this notice, he is not signing a notice that will have the effect of taking the man's land.  The sole purpose of his notice is to enable one of his inspectors, in the case in which there is a complaint about a farm and where he is satisfied it should be investigated, to come in and make the report to which I have referred, to say whether these lands should be acquired, whether they are suitable for Land Commission purposes or whether the adequates are being provided, that is, whether the owner is providing sufficient employment and obtaining sufficient production and, of course, there is another provision coming in with this Bill&mdash;this is a new power&mdash;that he must be resident on or in the immediate vicinity of the land.</P>
      <P>Under this procedure, that report is sent on to the Commissioners as formerly and it is the Commissioners who decide on that report whether these lands should be acquired or not.  So that the power of the acquisition of land is still a reserved matter in the hands of the Commissioners and it is they and they only who have the right to decide, on this report, whether the lands in any particular instance should be acquired for the relief of congestion.</P>
      <P>I want to ask Deputies here which do they want.  Do they want to do away with this section that will enable the Land Commission to act expeditiously and quickly or do they want the old red-tape, this run-around for two or three years, to defeat the purposes of the Land Commission in the acquisition of land for the relief of congestion? Let us clear our minds on this matter and let us not blow hot and cold in connection with it.</P>
      <P>I agree that the Leader of the Opposition has seen the necessity for this section and, as Deputy Collins and some other Deputies said, if you take this and a couple of other sections out of the Bill, you might as well forget about any Government in this day and age making any impact whatsoever on this colossal problem that confronts us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> As to the powers of these people to deal with these matters, there would also appear to be a vast amount of misunderstanding amongst Deputies as to what the legal position is.  In taking this power away from the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission in order to speed up the work of the Land Commission, I was accused by Deputy Blowick of inflicting some terrible unconstitutional act on the landowners of Ireland.  It was alleged by Deputy Blowick that this was a thumbscrew.  He described this Bill as a poisoned bar of chocolate and that this section 13 was part of the poisonous measure.  Deputy Blowick sat over there like an indolent predator pike in the rushes.  He was willing to wound but afraid to strike because he knows quite well what his constituents would do to him if he tried to defeat the purposes of the Bill in this House.</P>
    <P>Let me point out to the House that Deputy Blowick himself in the 1950 Land Act, for the first time since the passing of the 1923 Land Act, deprived the Land Commissioners of their power to exercise certain of their reserved functions which until then were reserved to them by law.  I would refer the House to section 12 (8) of that Act which says:</P>
    <P>The following provisions shall have effect in relation to schemes for the re-arrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said re-arrangement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  no such scheme shall be approved by virtue of subsection (2)  of this section save by an officer;</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister shall not authorise pursuant to that subsection an officer to approve any such scheme unless the officer is an officer of the Land Commission and not below the rank of Senior Inspector.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) of the same section reads:</P>
    <P>Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a power or duty is exercised or performed by virtue of subsection <Col N="590" /> (2) of this section by the Minister or an officer, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in exercising or performing the power or duty, it becomes requisite that any document should be sealed with the common seal of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>the Minister or such officer (as the case may be) may cause the document to be sealed as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>That was taking away from the Lay Commissioners the power of dealing with rearrangement schemes and putting it under the wing of Deputy Blowick.  This is the Deputy who suggests I was driving a coach and four through the reserved powers of the Lay Commissioners for the first time in the history of the State.  That will give an indication to Deputies as to how sincere Deputy Blowick was in representing what he alleged was the position under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and, I think, Deputy Flanagan and others have indicated their opposition to section 27 on the ground that power to inspect lands thereunder is open to abuse by the political head of the Department of Lands, that is, by me.  On the other hand, Deputies like Deputy Tully welcomed this provision and expressed confidence, having regard to the high standard of public life in the country, that the section would not be used for political purposes.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that this section was drafted with only one purpose in mind, that is, to expedite inspection of lands and, in conjunction with section 13, to eliminate the possibility of an indifferent owner effecting a quick sale to frustrate the land settlement plans of the Land Commission for a locality.  I have been a long time in this House hearing about the slowness to which I referred a while ago.  Under this section, senior inspectors in provincial headquarters will be empowered to determine the lands to be inspected and all that time will be saved, as I have already explained to the House.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, including the Leader of the main Opposition, in some queer way, tried to the tie up the recent appointment <Col N="591" /> of the Secretary of the Department of Lands to the position of Lay Commissioner with this Bill and to suggest there would be public misgivings because of that appointment.  I cannot see that point.  The Lay Commissioners are, in fact, just as is the Secretary under section 2 of the Land Act of 1933 and equally with the Secretary, subject to the responsible Minister in non-excepted matters.  In the interest of prompt despatch of work, I am making this inspection to which I have referred a non-excepted matter.  I could argue that I cannot find anything specifically in the Land Acts to say that this notice should be signed by the Lay Commissioners but I am removing doubt in order to get this expedition which I am sure every Deputy desires in relation to the Land Commission powers.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the inspection by itself decides nothing.  It is important to emphasise that the information gathered is not submitted to me as Minister at all.  The information on such an inspection passes and will continue to pass to the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission and it will then be for them to decide on the report whether these lands should be acquired or not.  I, as Minister or political head, have nothing whatsoever to do with it.</P>

      <P>Let me recapitulate for the Deputy in regard to the inspection notice to which I have referred.  All the inspection notice does is to notify a landowner that an inspector will call at a certain date for the purpose of inspecting his land.  It is proposed under the new scheme of things to give power to the divisional inspector of each province to sign that notice and that notice then goes out, without all this delay and frustration.  The local inspector inspects and reports not to me but to the Lay Commissioners. They decide that as an excepted matter which is the position under law.</P>

      <P>I want to put this on the records of the House because my recent appointment of the Secretary of my Department as a Lay Commissioner has been criticised.  It was not so much a matter of criticism as of doubts being expressed as to why it should be so.  The sole reason for my taking that action is the promotion of further efficiency.  On those lines, may I quote for the House a letter left behind by a former Secretary of the Land Commission who became a Commissioner. What I have done is nothing new but Commissioner Deegan, when going out in 1951, wrote this letter to the then Minister:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before leaving the Department, I want to place on record my most definite view that the Secretary of the Land Commission cannot do his work as satisfactorily as he would wish to do it or as he should do it, unless he is at the same time a Commissioner.  From my administrative experience in other Departments and from outside knowledge of the Land Commission, I held that view when I came here as Secretary in 1930; my years as Secretary and Commissioner from 1930 confirmed it; the past couple of years when I have been Commissioner without administrative responsibility have doubly confirmed it for me.  It is, or should be, an axiom that the Permanent Head and Accounting Officer of a Department should be effectively aware of everything that is happening in his Department and should be in a position to ensure administrative and financial efficiency and correctness.  Here in the Land Commission a Secretary who is not a Commissioner does not come in contact with large blocks of most important work until something goes wrong: the most troublesome and danger-holding items of our business (those matters related to the acquisition and distribution of land) are routed direct to Commissioners and <Col N="593" /> unless the Secretary is himself a Commissioner &ldquo;anything may happen&rdquo; without his knowledge, and, though Permanent Head of the Department, he has not the opportunity which he should have of controlling in good time, in the interests of efficiency, economy and financial correctness, the administration for which he is responsible.  It is definitely wrong that there should be work in progress in any Department in regard to which the Permanent Head and Accounting Officer has no effective say: and, as regards the Land Commission, I wish to state to you, with the certainty born of long experience inside and outside the Land Commission, that that position can be avoided only if the posts of Secretary and Commissioner are combined, and to emphasise once more my very definite view that the Secretary here should always be a Commissioner.  The fact that I held the two posts for so many years and during periods of exceptional stress shows that there is nothing impossible in the proposition&mdash;indeed each post makes the operation of the other easier for the holder.</P>
    <P>That is what has been left by a Secretary of the Department and a Commissioner with over 20 years' experience.</P>

      <P>It was.  I have to deal not alone with the day-to-day running of my Department, but I am responsible to the House and the taxpayers for the smooth and efficient running of that Department.  While the Lay Commissioners have their job to do by way of dealing with excepted matters and in deciding cases when they sit on the Bench, I have also my <Col N="594" /> job to do.  It is my job to ensure that they carry on the work of the Land Commission, that they hold courts in the different parts of the country to enable the acquisition machine to go on.</P>
      <P>The one effective way of keeping administrative control as far as their work is concerned is, in my view, to have the Secretary of the Department, the chief officer, a Commissioner so that I can keep track of the Lay Commissioners' work, to co-relate their work and set the Land Commission machine running smoothly in all its facets.  Let me say one of the most important parts of the Land Commission machine is the functions carried out by these Lay Commissioners. While they have these reserved powers, they are at law officials of the Land Commission and, if you like, officials of the Minister for Lands for the purpose of their other functions in the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is under a misapprehension when he thinks they are a body of men going about in outer space, with no responsibility to anybody. They are in fact at law servants of mine in the same relative way as the Secretary of the Department is. They are not a judicial body, exercising judicial powers and for those who are interested in that aspect of the matter, I shall refer to the dictum in <i>Lynam and Butler</i>, a very old case referred to by the late Chief Justice Hugh Kennedy:</P>
      <P>The Land Commissioners (other than the Judicial Commissioner) are, then, an administrative body of civil servants who are not Judges within the meaning of the Constitution and do not constitute a Court of Justice strictly so-called but who, in the performance of some of their duties, must act judicially and who are always subject, in respect of any justifiable controversy arising in the course of their business, to the exercise of the Judicial Power of the State for the determination of such controversy by one of the Judges of the High Court of the State assigned to act as Judicial Commissioner for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> The present man occupying that position is Mr. Justice Teevan.</P>
    <P>I may state in a very short way the fallacy, as I see it, in much of the discussion which has been directed to Articles 2 and 64 of the Constitution.  The word &ldquo;Power&rdquo; in the term &ldquo;Judicial Power&rdquo; is commonly ignored or does not receive its true significance.  In consequence, &ldquo;acting judicially&rdquo; is commonly confused with &ldquo;exercising the Judicial Power&rdquo;.  I have tried to make the distinction clear.</P>
    <P>The legal position of the Lay Commissioners is clearly set out there. They are a quasi-judicial body.  The assertion that they are a judicial body, which was made here, is completely wide of the mark and has in fact no foundation.</P>

      <P>In Mr. Deegan's time, the Minister had not the right to rearrange the lands of Ireland or to take lands beside them either, which was done by the Deputy's Party when they were supporting Deputy Blowick in the Coalition years.  I have explained that the only reason for having this section there is to provide the remedy for which Deputies on all sides of the House have been crying out, day in day out.  They have been asking for the speeding up of the work of the Land Commission and I have time and again pointed out to Deputies that in many of these cases the Land Commission were hamstrung by the archaic machinery under which they were operating.  When Deputies appreciate that, when they realise the aim of this section, they will appreciate that the inspection notice, about which so many fears were expressed, is issued without any reference to the political head of the Department and that the result obtained does not come near the political head.  That should be a <Col N="596" /> sufficient answer to those who have expressed a genuine anxiety about the provisions of this section.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan referred to Section 37, which reduces from seven to two years the period during which a newly vested holding is immune from compulsory acquisition. Far from opposing this reduction of time, I think the House should be in favour of further shortening it.  Deputy Flanagan suggested that where there was neglect, the holding should be taken over quickly, whether vested or not.  I was tempted to go the whole way and completely abolish this immunity, for which I see no necessity nowadays, but I am advised when lands are vested, there should be some period of immunity.  Deputy Donnellan has taken the view that two years was a little too short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me explain why I want to chop down this safe period, as I may call it, from seven years to two.  Even in the best regulated machinery, things may break down.  There may well be people who migrate and then somebody dies or he wants to sell or, for some other reason, wants to get rid of the land or is not properly working the land.  The cost of a new family farm, the new migrant's holding, would be very substantial when the new Land Commission house, which was on inspection here some time ago and to which some Deputies referred, is provided and when it is equipped with the services of a modern house for a migrant&mdash;and migrants are only one aspect of this question.  It will cost the Exchequer from £6,000 to £8,000 which is substantial even in these days for a family farm.  Is it not right that if something goes wrong and if some family circumstances arise in which these people want to sell the land, the Land Commission should have the power to <Col N="597" /> move in as quickly as possible and make the holding available for another migrant?</P>
    <P>Where holdings are rearranged, it entails a substantial amount of money nowadays in expenditure on improvements, because, as Deputies in congested areas know, where a rearrangement scheme takes place, first, in most cases very heavy grants are given for building of houses, building outoffices and in many cases also there is heavy expenditure on drainage and roadmaking and servicing the houses. These people, having got all these amenities and an addition of land as well, in some cases&mdash;they are a few where the holding may have been the wrong size or something like that&mdash; have turned the key in the door and let the holdings.  After all this expenditure, do Deputies think it reasonable that we in the Land Commission should sit back and let that misuse of public money continue?</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons I want to change the law and that is why I suggest cutting down from seven to two years.  Some Deputies have suggested it should be further cut down and I shall give consideration to that between now and Committee Stage. Deputies might also consider this question but I certainly feel that with what is involved here the old period of seven years should go and that the Land Commission should be able to move in quickly in cases where for some reason holdings are not used as they should be used, or are being let, or&mdash;worst of all&mdash;where there is an attempt made to sell them during that seven year period.</P>
    <P>The question of non-nationals has been mentioned and it appears that all Deputies who spoke on this issue did not appreciate the new powers in the Bill that can be used so effectively against non-nationals, just as they may be used against nationals who are not making proper use of the land or who are absentees.  When the Bill becomes law, it will mean that, in addition to the former defence of the &ldquo;adequates&rdquo;&mdash;adequate production and adequate employment&mdash;there will be a provision that such landowner will lose that <Col N="598" /> defence in law if the Land Commission try to take his land, unless he is resident on those lands or in the immediate vicinity.</P>
    <P>There was a decision of the Supreme Court to the effect that where lands were let to others who were producing sufficient from them, even though the owner was not doing so and was away from these lands, it would enable him to claim the protection of these &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; provisions of the Land Acts.  When this Bill becomes law, it will be necessary for such an owner to reside on or in the immediate vicinity of the land, in addition to fulfilling the &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; requirements. This will enable the Land Commission to move in where there is an absentee owner, whether he is a foreigner or a company.  There is provision that no company gimmick of referring to its registered office will get them out of this because the main shareholders of such a company will be subject to this clause and they will have to be resident and working on it.</P>
    <P>The power of quick action by the Land Commission in moving in, and these other powers to which I have referred, can all be used for this purpose. I am, and always have been, quite prepared to face squarely the position about the purchase of Irish land by non-nationals, but what I object to in dealing with this delicate question for our people is the exploitation of the people's fears about a situation which actually does not exist.  I have always said and I say now&mdash;and I shall give the House some information about certain action that has been taken by my Department and others in this matter&mdash;that at any time if it appeared to the Government that further action should be taken, we would be quite prepared to take it and that we will keep the matter under continuous review.</P>
    <P>Different views have been expressed in the debate.  Deputy T. F. O'Higgins dealing last night with this problem said: &ldquo;I know it has not yet become a problem but I feel the matter should be kept under review.&rdquo;  Deputy Blowick said the same thing in different words &mdash;that there was not a problem but that there might be one.  He suggested <Col N="599" /> the matter should be kept under review. That is fair enough, so far as it goes.</P>
    <P>What I think completely wrong is the scare raised by irresponsible organisations, by politicians and by people outside this House for their own purposes to exploit this very sensitive question and try to sell the idea to the land-hungry people of the congested areas that thousands and thousands of acres in other parts of the country are being taken over by foreigners and that these acres should be there for the relief of congestion.  That is the kind of irresponsible approach to this question which I deplore.</P>
    <P>Let me point out to the House on this question that this Government under one of its Finance Acts imposed a penal duty of 25 per cent on any non-national who purchased land in this country.  It was felt at that time that that imposition, which is a very, very heavy one, should be sufficient to discourage these people from acquiring any unusual amount of land and, indeed, it has been pointed out abroad that purchasers of agricultural land are not welcome here.  I should also like to point out and remind the House that when this Government was putting through this 25 per cent penal duty on foreign purchasers it was opposed strongly by Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, and by many of his colleagues.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out, too, that although complaints are now expressed by Deputy Dillon and others that there are take-over bids by foreigners for business premises in this city that it was Deputy Sweetman under the 1956 Finance Act who made that possible. Prior to Deputy Sweetman's Act of 1956 these dealings were also liable to the 25 per cent penal duty and he removed it in the case of purchases by foreigners including five acres of land or less.  I should put that on record for the benefit of the people who now express such concern at these professed take-over bids by foreigners of our land.</P>
    <P>The 1961 Finance Act established for the first time that the Land Commission <Col N="600" /> should keep a statutory register of all land purchased by non-nationals. Under the provisions of this Act the Revenue Commissioners must indicate to the Land Commission from every deed coming before them the amount of land concerned and those involved in the transaction.  This must be entered in the register so that we have a record of every square foot of agricultural land sold to non-nationals and in respect of which the 25 per cent duty was paid.  I have given the House figures from time to time and the pattern is running very much the same as when Deputy Blowick occupied my present position as Minister for Lands in this House.</P>
    <P>There have been allegations, wild allegations, that there is evasion of the law in some instances.  The Land Commission have this register as I pointed out and it is their statutory duty to keep it in an effort to ensure that the law is being obeyed and not evaded. I directed my inspectors some time ago to check up with the co-operation of the Guards on any local purchases they knew of in any part of the country so that we could compare their record on the spot with the record coming from the Revenue Commissioners as a cross check to see if the law were being evaded.</P>
    <P>It may be that lawyers in time will find a legal way of getting round the existing law.  If so&mdash;we have not so far discovered it&mdash;I can assure the House that it will be very quickly dealt with.  It may be that there are frauds, that some of these people have evaded the law, evaded the 25 per cent duty. You can evade any law by fraud if false declarations are made but if anyone is caught out in any such fraud, if it can be proved, the law provides for long terms of imprisonment as well as very heavy monetary penalties.</P>
    <P>I have got some information as a result of this cross check we have been making.  During the past week there has been one suspicious case.  I am having that fully investigated and any facts we can get which may lead to a prosecution will be immediately placed in the hands of the Attorney General.  I have invited Deputies before, when dealing with this question, to send me personally <Col N="601" /> or to send the Land Commission any information on any case where they even suspect that the law is being evaded and I and the Land Commission would be very happy to have that matter fully investigated.  I cannot say tonight what ultimate results the investigation will produce, but I want to give this information to the House so as to assure them that we are very carefully watching the situation.  So far as we can check the register against local information from inspectors and guards we are endeavouring to get any of these people who have evaded the law.</P>
    <P>I can also assure the House that if we find that the law is being evaded or that a way has been found of legally getting round the provisions of existing law, that will be very quickly dealt with by the Government and that is all I can usefully say on this issue. I have always been, we have always been, quite prepared to face this issue if there is an issue to be faced but the figures available to me over the past year do not indicate that there is any national danger in this matter.  If the position turns out to be otherwise the Government and I are quite prepared to take action on the matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Treacy and some others spoke of the depopulation of the countryside and others have mentioned declining numbers in churches and schools.  There are two answers to this problem as far as the Land Commission is involved.  One is the provision of viable farm units and the other the provision of decent modern housing.  Where there is depopulation it is because people have not got viable units.  Those who suggest that this Bill is going to close up homes or depopulate the west of Ireland could not be further from the truth.  What <Col N="602" /> we are concentrating on, getting powers under the Bill to buy out lands which have been let for a long period of years, aims at getting after houses which have been closed up for many years.  It is not this Bill or this policy which will depopulate rural Ireland. Indeed, unless some urgent measure of this kind is passed by the House and the people who are now on the land get an anchor there there will be very much more depopulation of these rural areas.</P>
      <P>Anybody who knows this problem and comes from my part of the country should now well realise that the people in rural Ireland are not prepared to accept the standards of living of their fathers' or grandfathers' times, and I would not blame them.  It is the height of absurdity, in my view, to have to listen to some armchair critics who will expect people in the congested districts in this day and age to live on those £3, £4 or £5 valuation holdings in so-called holy poverty.  These conditions are gone with one of the greatest labour markets in the world right on our doorstep, and anybody who expects that the present generation are prepared to put up with the standards of living that obtained in those western counties even 30 or 40 years ago is completely out of touch with the realities of rural Ireland to-day. I suggest that these provisions being made now and the existing powers of the Minister and the Land Commission should be adequate to tackle the problem of these holdings and to try to achieve the ideal of the 40 or 45 acre family farm, with the other scheme recently announced of housing assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of the problem fully covered by the Bill to which I would point.  Everybody concerned with the problem of rural depopulation must feel that we must take up the uneconomic holdings, put them into competent hands and try so that in future we will help to keep the remaining population secure and happy on the land.  Sections 34 and 41 of this Bill, which are heavily loaded against absentees, will contribute a great deal towards providing adequately for small holders who still put their trust in farming and who <Col N="603" /> wish to remain on the land.  Those people who have stated here that people do not want land any more in rural Ireland or have no further interest in land should come down with me some Saturday, or if I have not gone out of my house, early on Sunday morning, and see whether the people in the congested areas have any interest in land or not.  There has always been and always will be a tremendous attachment in our people to the land.  It is inherent in our people. But to expect them to eke out an existence with ten or 15 acres of snipe grass these days is being completely out of touch with the realities of the situation.  Some people seem to think that it can be done, and that in this day and age they will put up with the depressed standard of living existing in the way that their fathers or grandfathers did on these patchwork-quilt little farms, but that is simply trying to put back the hands of the clock.</P>
    <P>As far as housing is concerned, a number of Deputies dealt with it and this is a matter which my colleague, the Minister for Local Government, and I have been studying closely.  We recently issued a joint statement outlining a new deal for this group of the population as well as specifying the improved grants which small farmers will be able to get from the Land Commission of up to £500 where formerly they could get £100.  They will be available for reconstruction as well as for building.  This whole scheme will be effective as from 1st October this year.  The reason why this is not included in the Bill is simply that it can be carried into effect as far as the Land Commission are concerned under the existing law.  As Deputies are aware, the Department of Local Government propose up to £25 valuation to increase the existing grants by 50 per cent and then on a graduated scale, from that up to £45 valuation.  As far as the Land Commission are concerned, we propose to make a loan of up to £500 available for the rehousing of people on the land.  This of course is confined to farmers.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to make this available <Col N="604" /> to all farmers in any part of the country, irrespective of their valuation, both for erection and reconstruction, so that a farmer in rural Ireland who, with the increased grants and so on, is something short or has no capital of his own, can now come to the Land Commission and get, either for reconstruction or for building a new house, this £500 which will be repayable with his annuity.  As far as reconstruction is concerned, the difference between the amount of the grant and the total estimate can be covered by the loan.  Deputies who are familiar with this type of reconstruction will realise that an inspector comes from the Department of Local Government who makes an estimate of the authorised work.  Then, depending on the amount of the grant he will get from the Department of Local Government, the balance of that estimate up to £500 will be available by way of loan repayable with the annuity.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the terms of this loan and the financial details of the scheme.  As far as this loan is concerned, it will be made available at the prevailing Government rate of borrowing.  It is not the intention of my Department to charge any administrative fee, and the regulations for the making available of this loan are being worked out between my Department and the Department of Finance.  There may be some slight difficulty for a couple of months ahead because of a particular regulation, but that will be a temporary phase, and generally speaking, these loans should be available at the Government rate of borrowing.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that some Deputies including, I think, Deputy Gilhawley, wanted to know about the possibilities of repayment of these loans.  It is the intention to allow the applicant to repay the loan at any time or in instalments as he goes ahead.  There are, I understand, under existing regulations certain priorities including the repayment of land reclamation annuities charged on the holding that must be observed, but broadly speaking, anybody who avails of this Land Commission loan will be free, when his circumstances permit <Col N="605" /> and in his own time, to pay by instalments or wipe it out whenever he is in a financial position to do so.</P>
    <P>I should also say that the repayment periods will vary.  They must vary from case to case depending on the amount of the consolidated annuity and the length of time that the existing annuity has already been payable, because the repayment of the loan will have to be consolidated with the applicant's existing annuity.  Broadly speaking, it is a very long-term loan, and I think this particular loan will serve a very useful purpose in dealing with the housing conditions on the farms of rural Ireland to which Deputies have referred.</P>
    <P>One other factor is that it is intended so far as possible to eliminate any red tape in connection with this particular loan.  We know that our people in rural Ireland do not want other people to know their business and in many cases they were not prepared to avail of a county council loan because they had to get sureties and call in neighbours to help them.  In this particular loan, by simple application to the Land Commission, it will be possible for them to deal direct with the Land Commission.  Their sole security will be the security of their own land, the loan being repayable in the way I have mentioned along with their own annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with local authorities.  I am concerned with my own scheme.  In discussing this with my colleague the Minister for Local Government we visualised that where local authorities give supplementary grants they would <Col N="606" /> continue to do so in the way in which they are doing at the moment, even though the State is providing these increased grants.  I do not see anything against it.  One of the reasons I confined this loan to £500 was, in the first place, to discourage people in small farms taking on a burden which would be beyond their capacity to pay; secondly, to eliminate official time in investigating such things so that we could without more ado give the farmer this loan on his valuation. In answering Deputy Tully's question &mdash;I am just thinking as I go along&mdash; it occurs to me that there are different considerations with the local authority because their loans are really mortgages. You really apply to them for a mortgage on your property; you have to provide your sureties, pay your solicitor, have your title passed and so on.  It is really a legal mortgage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan referred to procedural delays and so forth, and I think I can reassure him on this matter.  Within the Bill we have sections 16 and 17 aimed at the speeding up of such matters in the Examiners' branch.  We have sections 31 and 36 aimed at speeding up the smaller cases in which undue formality would be specially inappropriate. Apart from the Bill, there has been a great deal of work done on general principles for simplifying procedures and next year solicitors, especially those who work in the provinces, will find great improvements introduced. I largely, if not fully, agree with complaints voiced by Deputy Seán Flanagan and some other Deputies about procedural matters in the legal side of my Department.</P>
      <P>I am glad to tell the House that I have already reached agreement in principle with the Incorporated Law Society on a new procedure designed to cut out red tape and expedite sales to the Land Commission.  It will be possible for country solicitors to deal directly with the Land Commission and to close sales with the Land Commission in just the same way as they would with some other client.  The rules are being prepared and are practically ready for the Rules Making Committee to sign and the frustrating delays and the amount of red tape referred to by Deputy Seán Flanagan will be eliminated.  This is an important aspect of the new concept of a speedier Land Commission on which we have been working for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter referred to by some Deputies was the fact that there were very good reasons for getting the goodwill of the auctioneering profession. Having made a study of the matter, I realised that there were two bodies whose goodwill and co-operation were vital to the working of the Land Commission if we were to speed up the acquisition of land, if we were <Col N="608" /> to build up a land pool, or make any impression, in our time, on this great national and social problem.  One of these groups were the auctioneers and I well understood the reasons why auctioneers down the years would, as some Deputies said, try to sell their clients' land to the devil before dealing with the Land Commission because the Land Commission was not prepared to pay them the commission provided for their profession.  Therefore, when the Land Commission tried to get land by agreement from any owner and an auctioneer was involved he immediately told him that the Land Commission were the wrong people to deal with, that he would never get his money, or that he would get inflated bonds, and he painted a picture of an ogre in Merrion Street and gave the impression that it would be just as much as his financial life was worth to become involved with the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The result was that the intake to the Land Commission was slowing down.  They had to rely on compulsory proceedings and by the time they had finished in the Appeal Court which fixes market value, there was much delay and tremendous expense.  I decided, with the Minister for Finance, to make this different approach to this fundamental element to increase the land available to the Land Commission pool by co-operation.</P>
    <P>The auctioneering profession have been informed that the Land Commission will now pay the normal commission which their profession enjoys and I have been assured by that body of their full co-operation. Indeed, in many cases I already have evidence that the old order and the old attitude has completely changed and that they now regard the Land Commission as their best customer and are prepared to give the Land Commission the first refusal.  I am quite satisfied that this is not only going to eliminate a lot of frustration on the part of the Land Commission but in the long run is going to save quite a lot of money and bring much more land into the Land Commission pool for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>It was also necessary to take the <Col N="609" /> view of the legal profession in this business.  There are some very old and archaic procedures for dealing with the Land Commission and the solicitors throughout the country, where they had a client whose lands were sold to the Land Commission, were subject to interminable delays and had real labour in dealing with these matters.  Country solicitors had to employ Dublin agents to work for them and the fees laid down were inadequate to cover all those people. The result, as far as a client was concerned, was that it was a very long time before he got his money.</P>
    <P>That gave people a bad impression of the Land Commission and the public impression of dealings with the Land Commission was that nobody could get paid for his land within a reasonable time.  In a great many cases the fault was not so much with the Land Commission as with many members of the legal profession who were not familiar with the procedure and who, because of that, had to employ agents and who did not think it worth their while to deal with Land Commission business when they had extensive practices to cope with.</P>
    <P>We have now eliminated the cause of many of these complaints and we have drawn up new rules and procedures for which we hope to have the full co-operation of the legal profession in dealing with the Land Commission in future.  These are the two bodies that I regard as being particularly important in co-operating with the work of the Land Commission rather than to have them as sworn enemies in negotiations over land as many of them formerly were.</P>

      <P>From about the beginning of this year.  Some Deputies have suggested that there should be a ceiling placed on the value or size of holdings but I am doubtful whether <Col N="610" /> any limitation placed on the size or value of holdings without regard to the use would be desirable.  One man can hold 500 acres and secure such production and give such employment that he is an asset to the nation while another can hold 50 acres and use it so badly that he is a disgrace to the community.</P>
      <P>It cannot be laid down that a married woman cannot hold land in addition to the land held by her husband nor can we deny a farmer with several sons the right to purchase land to provide for them.  One could not frame laws to stop that without resorting to extreme measures.  I do not think we should seek to retain the land of Ireland while we see that so much of it is now being used to the best advantage but we should take the positive step of taking up land that is under-used and see that it is put to the best advantage.  I cannot see that there is such a serious problem of land being retained in the hands of a few although some Deputies have made these allegations.</P>
      <P>There are small, medium and some large farms in this country.  Some of the larger holdings must be kept in order to provide conditions for the finishing of cattle and for the calves produced in the west of Ireland.  If there was to be an upper limit it would have to be in the region of £200 rateable valuation and we have only, according to the statistics I have been able to gather, about 2,000 holdings exceeding that level in the country. That is far from an excessive number. Indeed, it is a moderate number.</P>
      <P>The time may come in this country, as it has come on the Continent, when a new look will have to be taken at this question.  In many parts of the Continent only certain classes of people are allowed to hold land at all. There are many countries where a shopkeeper or a man engaged in a profession cannot hold land at all.  If we take the industrious Dutch who are reclaiming land from the sea in the Polders they have laid down strict provisions as to the kind of people who get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of people who are allowed to get land in Holland must not alone <Col N="611" /> be prepared to pay their share of the full cost of reclamation but they must have an agricultural degree or they must prove themselves to have expert agricultural knowledge and sufficient capital to be able to fully produce and work that land.  They must prove themselves to be agricultural experts.  That is the rule in Holland and the same rule is followed in Denmark.  Only a certain agricultural committee can give a person the authority to purchase land and nobody will be allowed to purchase it except an expert agriculturist who has no other employment.</P>
    <P>If things should come to this stage in this country in the future it will not be a new concept.  Whoever happened to be Minister for Lands when that occurred would have a tremendous pool of land available to him because, if user of the land was the only criterion, nobody could use the land unless he was an expert.  In many continental countries there are severe restrictions on the division of agricultural land. They make provisions against fragmentation. They make provision that those who inherit land will fully utilise it and they are not allowed to alienate it to people not engaged in the agricultural industry.  These are some of the matters that make it easier for some of these countries where you have more restrictive laws.  The time may come in this country when it would be accepted national policy that the people concerned with the land would be restricted to a certain acreage and that those getting that acreage would not be allowed to engage in any other type of economic activity.</P>
    <P>I feel that here we have a big problem to face up to first.  We have all this bad user of our land with which we must deal.  Under this form of user, we have inherited the 11-months system which is the worst form of user in the whole of western Europe.  The 11-months tenant is concerned solely with what he will get out of the land in the 11 months. Driving through the country, one can see how such lands have been mined. The temporary owner is not prepared to keep a fence, make a drain, put a <Col N="612" /> bush in a gap.  He is not concerned with putting the land back into good heart.  He is concerned solely with what he will get out of it and how quickly. That is one reason why we are taking power now to induce those who let their lands to get out of them so that they can be handed over to people who will work them and care for them.</P>
    <P>I knew, of course, that someone would trot out the story of the widow with the ten children.  Deputy Blowick shed a few crocodile tears for the widow with the ten children.  He alleged the sole purpose of the Bill was to get at her.  That, of course, is just so much nonsense to those who are familiar with facts.  Where economic circumstances and family reasons demand it there will be no interference by the Land Commission; as I pointed out already, 11 months lettings are not within the terms of this Bill.  Some Deputies are under a complete misconception as to what the law is.  Any letting for a period of 12 months, or over, is null and void, if the consent of the Land Commission to that letting has not been obtained.  That is the legal position established by our own courts.  That has been the position since the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>Power is being taken now to deal with cases where land was purchased before that Act because by the device of purchasing off the annuity people could escape the provision with regard to subdivision and so on.  Generally speaking, the law is that where lands are let for a period other than the traditional 11 months such a letting is void under existing laws.  The provision here which lays it down that the consent of the Land Commission will be necessary in all cases in future is nothing new.  If it is necessary for people, because of family circumstances, to let their lands for a temporary period of two or three years, then they would be very foolish, under the existing law, if they did not go to the trouble of securing the consent of the Land Commission to that letting.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies complained about overholding by the Land Commission.  The average length of time during which these estates are in the hands of the Land Commission is a period of two to three years.  That is the time it takes the Land Commission to prepare a scheme and allot the lands.  There are some exceptions to that, with which I shall deal in a moment.  Some years ago, due to retirals and so on, the inspectorate staff fell below the norm.  Deputies who understand this matter of land acquisition and division will realise the time and trouble it takes to prepare a scheme.  It was once said to me, and with some truth, that the best scheme is one in respect of which nobody is satisfied.</P>
      <P>There was a good deal of argument about limits.  At the moment the limit is one mile and every individual within that limit must be vested and assessed as to the size of his holding, his family circumstances, whether he had other employment, his agricultural ability and his suitability.  A scheme is prepared by the inspectorate.  A budget estimate is prepared as to improvements and so on.  That goes to the divisional inspector and finally to the Commissioners.  All that takes time. If the inspector, and I get a great deal of correspondence about these things, does not call on all the people in the area, there is an immediate complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspector has to be a very experienced man.  He has to be a valuer of land.  He has to be a psychologist. He has to have a fair knowledge of <Col N="614" /> agriculture.  He must be able to persuade one man to give up portion of his holding for the good of his neighbour. He must not allow himself to be influenced by threats, and threats are often uttered.  His is a very difficult and specialised task.  I can assure Deputies it takes an amount of training to make a Land Commission inspector.</P>
    <P>Some of the critics of this Bill show an abysmal ignorance of the issues involved in the acquisition and division of land.  Let me assure the House that it is completely untrue to suggest that lands are being let by the Land Commission for the purpose of revenue. Any Deputies who have the idea that the Land Commission have been letting lands for the purpose of making money out of it could not be further off the mark.  That aspect of the matter is more of a nuisance value to the Land Commission than anything else.  They often incur losses.  The longer they hold these lands the bigger the loss on a resale.  In some cases, while these lands are being let some person's stock is lost.  They are liable for all these things.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of cases, the average is from two to three years for the Land Commission to have a scheme put through.  As against that, you have the land taken for the purpose of rearrangement which, as I have already explained to the House, depends on the co-operation of the people.  If you cannot get the co-operation of the whole lot of them in most of these cases then the Land Commission must sit back and let that land.</P>
    <P>Take those cases where I have given answers to the House about lands being in the hands of the Land Commission for a very long time.  These cases, mainly, give you the statistical figure of land, over a very long period, being in the hands of the Land Commission. Broadly speaking, I have given a policy direction that where lands are in the hands of the Land Commission for more than three years I should be told about it and that an explanation be given as to the particular difficulties&mdash; and there must be particular local difficulties in that area.</P>
    <P>On occasion, too, I know from <Col N="615" /> experience that you will get this situation in an isolated instance.  You have one inspector who has been working on a scheme for perhaps a full year or 14 months and he has the work virtually completed.  He knows every individual with all the relations and all the implications.  Suddenly that man goes ill.  If he will be out for long or if that inspector goes to hospital it is a question for the senior inspector to decide to try to get a young man in there, who has no experience of these people, who will have to waste another six months or more in the same work or in collecting the same data, or to wait for the inspector who has spent so much time in the preparation or partial preparation of a scheme for that area.  It occurs on occasion. It is a matter over which neither I nor my inspectors have any control.  In the main, these are isolated incidents in delays.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies take an impartial view of this Bill.  I feel I shall have the full support of the vast majority of Deputies in getting it through, irrespective of the Party to which they belong.  It has been encouraging for me to find so much appreciation of some of the provisions in this Bill from Deputies from all sides of the House who come from congested areas. I know how difficult it is, from my long experience here, to get people with no experience of the congested areas to understand the arrangements there or to understand the land pattern there.  On many occasions, speaking in this House and speaking to Deputies of my own Party from the east and south of the country, I have felt that they had no idea as to the problems that confront Deputies representing west of Ireland constituencies and the problems confronting the people who are living in these particular areas.</P>
    <P>We are providing a new and effective machinery in this Bill that should give a tremendous fillip to the work of the Land Commission.  The new approaches which are tried out under this Bill are much more suited to this day and age to try to reconstitute our farm structural pattern.  The new approach must result in putting into <Col N="616" /> production thousands and thousands of acres all over the country that are now idle and badly used.  The ultimate effect of this Bill must be, with the co-operation of all Deputies, to provide a new sheet-anchor for a population on the land with better prospects both in the immediate future and in the long term.</P>
    <P>If we can make this approach and induce the people on the land who are not using it to leave it and if we put the land that is now going derelict and to waste into the hands of competent and energetic young landowners the effect on our economy and on the rural population should be apparent very quickly both to the House and to the country.  It would be more suitable to deal with much of this <i>in extenso</i> on the Committee Stage when we start to discuss it section by section.</P>
    <P>I commend the Leader of the main Opposition to read what I have said in connection with his fears dealing with Section 27 of this Bill.  I believe that when he studies what I have said in the record about the legal position the fears he expressed when speaking on the provisions of this Bill last night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the National Building Agency was established with the primary object of facilitating the provision of houses and ancillary services required in connection with industrial expansion where the need could not be met appropriately by local authorities or is not otherwise met by private enterprise.  Since its establishment the Agency has been financed under temporary arrangements and the main purpose of the present Bill is to put its finances on a more regular and firmer footing.</P>
      <P>At present the Building Agency, which is incorporated as a company under the Companies Acts, has a nominal capital of £100.  It has been financing the construction of houses for industrial personnel by means of temporary advances obtained from the Industrial Credit Company.  Expenditure of the Agency on housing for the Garda Síochána is recouped from the Vote for Public Works and Buildings, the day to day needs being met by temporary bank overdraft accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking in the House on 8th February, 1961, on the motion that the Agency be scheduled under the State Guarantees Act, I said that consideration might have to be given to making more adequate long term arrangements available for financing its operations.  Having regard to the present extent of those operations it is <Col N="618" /> not appropriate that the existing arrangements under which the Agency is financed on a temporary basis by the Industrial Credit Company should be continued and, accordingly, the Bill now before the House makes provision whereby it will be possible to provide finance direct from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill gives power to the Minister for Finance to take up shares in the Agency subject to a limit of £100,000 for investment in this form and section 6 provides for interest bearing repayable advances from the Central Fund to the Agency to enable it to finance its activities.  In its arrangements for providing housing for industrial workers the Agency normally operates on the basis of securing repayment of its expenditure over a period.  Accordingly, direct Exchequer assistance to it will normally be by way of repayable advances under section 6.  Section 2 is included to provide for increased share capital if financing in that form should be found at any time to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Power for the guarantee by the Minister for Local Government of borrowing is contained in section 7 of the Bill.  This power will replace the guarantee power available under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, which is being repealed by section 12.  I hope that the Agency will not have to depend entirely on the Exchequer and that borrowing under section 7 to meet needs will be feasible from time to time.  I have in mind that from now on the Agency will have available valuable and growing assets in the form of mortgages secured on houses for the construction of which it has advanced moneys.  Indeed, I feel that in due course these assets should constitute an acceptable security for the purpose of raising loans even without the backing of a State guarantee.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill provides that the total of amounts advanced from the Central Fund to the Agency and of amounts guaranteed by the Minister for Local Government with the consent of the Minister for Finance may not exceed £2 million at any <Col N="619" /> time.  The limit of £2 million is considered adequate to ensure that the Agency will be able to obtain sufficient funds to meet its needs in the sphere of industrial housing and related services for some time ahead.  Fresh legislation will, of course, be necessary before the limit can be exceeded.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill follow the general lines of corresponding legislation relating to the other comparable State-sponsored bodies such as the Industrial Credit Company and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  The provisions are of a varied and flexible nature as is considered suitable for a State-sponsored body of this kind.  I have now summarised the main provisions of the Bill.  The Bill also contains a number of provisions of a technical or routine nature, for example, provisions requiring the furnishing of accounts by the Agency, the accounts to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I think it right that I should end by giving a short summary of the work done by the Agency to date.  As I mentioned at the outset, the principal purpose of the establishment of the National Building Agency was to facilitate the provision of housing and ancillary services related to industrial expansion.  It has also the function of assisting to the extent required in the provision of housing for State employees whose duties involve a transfer of residence for them.  It may, too, assist in the provision of housing for the personnel of State-sponsored bodies.  Pursuant to its functions in this respect the Agency&mdash;as Deputies already know&mdash;is participating in the Garda housing programme.  As I indicated to the House in 1961, it is not the intention that the Agency would compete with any existing agencies or persons in the provision of houses generally, but rather that it should step in only in cases where the normal facilities for house building are not, for one reason or another, available.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side the Agency has undertaken to provide or assist the <Col N="620" /> provision of some 285 houses for industrial workers at various centres throughout the State.  Most of these workers consist of skilled technical and executive personnel whose services are essential for the development of the industries and for whom houses are required locally.  The total commitment involved to date is about £686,000.  Of the 285 houses, 82 have been completed or substantially completed, while construction work is in progress or contracts have been allocated in respect of a further 66 houses.</P>
    <P>The Agency is in a position to give a comprehensive service to industrialists anxious to provide housing accommodation for their workers.  In some cases the industrialists concerned arrange the contract and the Agency provides the necessary finance.  Recently the tendency has been for industrialists to make use of the full comprehensive services available.  This means that the Agency will complete all necessary arrangements including the purchase and development of site, design of houses, placing of contracts and supervision of building operations.  The industries which have availed themselves of the comprehensive services include both established companies wishing to expand and new companies setting up in business.  These firms find it an advantage to have an organisation which is prepared to relieve them of the trouble involved in providing houses for their workers.  They have expressed their appreciation of the services provided by the Agency.  It is clear that the Agency is assisting the industrial drive in a significant way.  Its success in this sphere suggests the possibility of its being able to assist in other housing operations in the future.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of Garda housing, the Agency has on hands the provision of some 530 houses.  So far sites are being or have been acquired for about 410 houses, tenders have been invited for the erection of 255 houses and contracts have been entered into for the erection of 219 of them.  About 80 are completed.  These houses are being provided in widely separated centres throughout the 26 Counties. <Col N="621" /> In many centres only one or two houses are being provided.</P>
    <P>I have recently had the opportunity of seeing some of the houses which are being built for the Gardaí.  The schemes which I visited were widely dispersed and the works in progress were at the various stages of construction. I was very much impressed with the results achieved both from the point of view of economy in cost, and, what is equally important, high standards of construction and design. It was evident to me that the Agency had given much consideration to these important aspects.</P>
    <P>I think that these remarks will give a general picture of the progress and activities of the Agency up to the present.  I feel that Deputies will agree that the new financial arrangements proposed in this Bill are justified. Accordingly, I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is, as the Minister says, to make better provision for aid for industrial housing in the State.  The Minister has paid tribute to the Agency for its work in that connection.  I have no doubt that industrialists are pleased to avail of the opportunities provided for them.</P>
      <P>I have not seen the memorandum and articles of association of the company set up to deal with this matter. I do not know whether they have been laid on the Table of the House or whether they are available to Deputies. If a copy were placed in the Library, Deputies might read it with interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Minister that he envisaged the Agency being used successfully in the future in regard to housing operations other than industrial housing, in view of its success in the latter field.  In reading about a National Building Agency, some people might be inclined to take it that the Agency would tackle the type of housing problem which was debated here recently and which will require the unremitting efforts of responsible persons if there is to be speedy provision of houses for those persons who are waiting to be housed.  In the Bill before the House, provision is being made for an entirely different type of <Col N="622" /> situation, namely, industrial housing. The industrialist who needs housing for key-workers will be dependent on this Agency in that respect.  That represents a further aid to industry.  I am sure that industrialists recognise that a very valuable and additional contribution is being made by this Bill to industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to hear from the Minister where the houses provided by the Agency are located, their number and whether they are centralised in selected areas or are provided in connection with small industries in small centres of population, and the future policy in this respect.</P>
    <P>According to the annual report of the Agency, which I have read with interest, there has been a growing demand for the type of activity in which it is engaged.  I wonder in regard to it whether the ordinary normal channels were fully availed of, whether there had been an appeal to the various building societies, whether the available limits of capital of various societies were being used, whether any approach had been made to them or whether, in this case, industrialists prefer to leave this problem at this stage to the National Building Agency. I understand that these companies have capital at the present time which is not being fully employed and which is available for the erection of housing of the type carried out by the Agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned that houses erected through the National Building Agency are constructed expeditiously and at a competitive price. The accounts of the Agency would give the impression that the price per house is somewhere in the region of £2,000.  I have made that calculation on the basis of the figures shown in the balance sheet.  I would ask the Minister to say if that estimate is correct and, if so, whether it represents the all-in cost, including acquisition of site and all expenses associated therewith, preparation of mortgage and plans and specifications.</P>
    <P>The report states that all types of housing have been catered for by the Agency, ranging in variety from a miner's house to a manager's house.  I presume the Agency are satisfied that <Col N="623" /> the houses being provided are suitable for ordinary housing needs in the event of their not being required at some future date in connection with an industry.</P>
    <P>The provision of housing for the Garda and for State personnel is one of the objects of the Agency.  The Minister has had an opportunity to inspect some of the houses provided for this purpose, and has expressed himself as being very impressed by the results achieved, from the point of view of economy in cost and high standard of construction and design.  In that respect it would be interesting to know whether these houses are, in the main, scattered in various areas or are concentrated in the larger centres of population, or whether, in the case of the transfer of the Garda Depot to Templemore, the houses are more concentrated than they are elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It struck me as peculiar in reading section 7, subsection (6), dealing with the repayment of moneys, that these may be recoverable as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.  The company in which the Minister for Finance is the majority shareholder, does not repay to the Central Fund what it owes, that is, presumably, because it cannot do so. I would invite the Minister's comment as to what interpretation is to be placed on that section because surely no court order will make any sum available after that if the company itself is unable to make the repayment.</P>
    <P>The provision of housing in the ordinary way is laudable It is agreed on this side of the House that that is necessary at all times and that every encouragement should be given to the better housing of personnel whether it be for those who are waiting to be provided with local authority housing or the type of housing which is envisaged here.  The Minister knows already what the priorities are in the provision of finance for housing and I am sure the type of housing which falls to be dealt with by a local authority has a high priority.  However, I do not know whether this limit to borrowings which ought to be guaranteed is an absolute limit.  I notice the Minister states that <Col N="624" /> the agency should be able to borrow on its own, perhaps, after a time. Naturally, it could not do it in the early stages because its financial pattern would not provide the necessary resources.  I would invite the Minister to indicate what he feels would be the limit of advances to the National Building Agency for this purpose and how much would be guaranteed in the long run.</P>
    <P>In so far as this measure will increase the number of houses available in any part of the State I welcome it. The one thing I would be concerned about in the aims of the National Building Agency is that it would apply itself to the smaller centres of population where there is a demand for this type of housing and which in the ordinary way has not yet been met. I am aware and I am sure the Minister is aware that some personnel&mdash; they may not be solely State personnel &mdash;are located in areas where they are finding difficulty in getting houses built for themselves.  They are not the responsibility of the local authority in this matter and very often it is difficult for them to obtain the necessary backing from the building agencies which are in existence at the moment because of the locality in which they live. There are others apart from Garda personnel who might fall to be dealt with by the National Building Agency and I would ask the Minister to indicate whether that type of housing would also be dealt with by the National Building Agency in respect of a person who might apply to them for help in the erection of a house in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would re-echo the sentiments of Deputy Jones.  It would be much more desirable if this Bill were catering for the appalling position which exists in this city at the moment in relation to housing.  Unfortunately, it is doing nothing on those lines.  I have considerable reservations about this Bill which is turning a £100 State company into a £100,000 State company, a Bill which can be said to bring to the forefront many of the considerations which would be discussed in this House on a debate on industrial grants policy.  Although the function <Col N="625" /> of this agency, as I see it, is very largely to provide assistance to industrialists in relation to the housing problems of their personnel, I do not propose to discuss industrial grants policy at this stage.  However, I should like to inquire of the Minister if he has a close liaison with the Industrial Development Authority in regard to the activities of the National Building Agency.</P>
      <P>In regard to the provision of finance for housing for industrialists I want to know what is wrong with the existing facilities which are available to these people for well-secured risks.  What is wrong with the building societies? Why should we create yet another State company, a £100,000 State company, which may in time develop into a £2 million State company&mdash;for £2 million is the limit to State participation in this company prescribed in Section 9 of the Bill&mdash;yet another State monster, very probably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will this body be accountable to this House?  It is a company registered under the Companies Acts which at no time envisaged or contemplated State companies the shares in which would be entirely held by Ministers of State. Company law includes many provisions for the protection of minority shareholders, many provisions which are inapplicable to State companies. To give a typical example, there was an investigation recently into one State company, Irish Estates Limited, which was held under the Companies Acts at the request of the main shareholder in this company.  Company law provides protection for minority interests.  In respect of any company owned not by the State but by members of the <Col N="626" /> general public, a 10 per cent minority may requisition an investigation into its affairs provided that 10 per cent minority is acting in good faith.  May 10 per cent of the members of this House, representative of 10 per cent of the public, requisition an inquiry into the National Building Agency Limited if at some future date that would seem to be a desirable thing to do?  It may not.  The Companies Acts as they stand at present are not the proper means for the promotion of State companies. We have not addressed ourselves to the problem of control of these companies. If the Minister for Local Government is questioned some years hence about the activities of this body will he take the attitude which the Minister for Transport and Power takes when queries are raised in this House about CIE or the ESB?  I should deplore such an approach.</P>
    <P>It is time we recognised the fact we have in this country many State companies which have come into existence on a hit or miss basis, as a result of a trend of events.  We have not taken into account in framing national policy what the first principles are to which we should have regard in relation to their administration.</P>
