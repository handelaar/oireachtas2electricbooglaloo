      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether there is any provision of the Treaty of Rome which lays down that an associate member, irrespective of the member's own views on the matter, must accept full membership at some date subsequent to its becoming an associate member.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such provision in the Rome Treaty.  The only Article of the Treaty which refers to association with the European Economic Community, namely, Article 238, is in general terms, and it is not possible to generalise on conditions of association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach give the Dáil any indication now as to when he will be in a position to make a statement to the Houses in regard to our application for membership of the EEC?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether during his recent talks with General de Gaulle any undertaking was given to him, or implied, that the General would favour the acceptance of Ireland as a full member of the EEC.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether in his recent talks with Dr. Conrad Adenaeur any undertaking was given to him, or implied, that Dr. Adenaeur would favour Ireland's acceptance as a full member of the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Questions on the 30th October last, the Heads of State and Heads of Government whom I met that month during my visits to members States of the European Economic Community expressed goodwill towards our application, and it will be recalled that, subsequently, the member States unanimously agreed to enter into negotiations on our application for membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is obviously &ldquo;No&rdquo; but could I ask the Taoiseach if it is not a fact that, because we have not a viable industrial or agricultural economy here independent of Britain, there was never any serious intention to grant us full membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy becomes more nonsensical every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the position has been over the years when we have tried to raise these matters. Could I further ask the Taoiseach is it not a fact that he was misled and in turn he misled the public by overlooking the simple truth that while the Ritz Hotel may be open to everybody, only the wealthy belong?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total numbers employed in industries which are at present protected by (a) tariffs and (b) quota restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The exact particulars requested by the Deputy are not available since protection by tariff or by quota relates to an individual product and not to an industry, while industrial employment statistics relate to industries and not to products.  Under such circumstances any computation must be of a tentative nature.  It is estimated that in the case of establishments in transportable goods industries covered by the Census of Industrial Production 149,000 people were engaged in September 1962 in industries any of whose products would, in the case of importation, be subject to a customs tariff (whether designed for protective purposes or not) and/or a quota.</P>

      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary say whether these figures are calculated on the same basis as those in the census of production or on the same basis as those contained in the <i>Economics Statistics</i> booklet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

While I appreciate the urgent need for this accommodation in the Tuam area, its provision is primarily a matter for the health authority.  However, I understand on inquiry from the health authority that they are now taking steps to acquire title to the proposed site and are arranging with their architect to begin the planning of the new building.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the operations of foreign banking, finance and hire purchase companies carrying on business in the State have led to any significant outflow of capital.  Indeed, so far as hire purchase companies are concerned, the annual Reports of the Central Bank of Ireland show that hire purchase debt in the State is being financed to a considerable extent by external capital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 to 28 together.</P>
      <P>There is no means test applicable to any of the insurance benefits provided under the Social Welfare Acts. Account has to be taken of a person's means in relation to non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The items of income which are taken into account and those which are excluded in the assessment of means are fixed by statute, and are not subject to alteration by Ministerial regulation. In so far as the pensions mentioned are concerned, the relevant provisions are contained in the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and in regard to unemployment assistance, in Section 13 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.</P>
      <P>In the case of pensions, voluntary or gratuitous payments whether from recognised charities or other sources, are not assessable except in so far as they exceed £52 5. 0. per year.  In assessing means from cash income the assessment is based on the amount which an applicant may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year.  Casual charitable payments are not, therefore, assessable.</P>
      <P>The application of the statutory provision in regard to the assessment of means from voluntary or gratuitous payments has not been the subject of instructions to officers of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of legislation for the purpose of altering the existing provisions relating to voluntary or <Col N="609" /> gratuitous payments is not at present contemplated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They possibly would in cases where they have reason to believe payments were made, but, as I said, it would only be in very exceptional cases, indeed, that such payments would affect the rate of pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have pointed out, in assessing means from cash incomes, the assessment is based on the amount the applicant can reasonably expect to obtain in the succeeding year, so normally casual payments from a charitable institution would not be assessable at all.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary <Col N="612" /> Secretary aware of the fact that the Land Commission endeavoured to offer these lands for letting in conacre last week?  Nobody made an offer to purchase any of the lands, preferring that the division of the lands should be expedited.  In view of that fact, which is evidence of the consensus of local opinion, will he take steps now to endeavour to ensure that these lands are divided this year?</P>

    <Title>Private Notice Question: - EEC Negotiations.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when he will make a statement of the Government's intentions having regard to the suspension of negotiations between Great Britain and the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of deep regret to the Irish Government that the negotiations for Britain's entry into the European Economic Community have had to be suspended.  The Irish Government earnestly hope that the impasse will not be prolonged and that a way will be found to enable all European countries, including Ireland, which share the ideals expressed in the Treaty of Rome, to participate fully in a wider Community.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances which have unfortunately arisen, re-consideration of the position in relation to our application for membership of the Community is inevitable.  We cannot, however, come to firm decisions until the situation becomes clearer and it is difficult to forecast when this may be possible.  Our trade arrangements with Britain are of basic importance, and in deciding what our policy should be, we must have regard to the relations which may evolve between Britain, the Community and other countries during the period immediately ahead, as well as other developments likely to affect conditions in our principal export markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Government believe that <Col N="618" /> the historical forces making for European unity are so strong that they must eventually prevail.  In this belief, we shall continue to prepare and plan for our entry to an enlarged Community, taking every step which will further this objective and avoiding any that might make it more difficult to attain.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, given the importance of trade with Britain in our external economic relations, the concern of the Irish Government will be to explore the possibility of widening our export openings in Europe and elsewhere while developing further our trade with Britain.  We will be prepared to consider participating in any negotiations for collective arrangements for freer trade involving our principal trading partners.  In any negotiations, whether multilateral or bilateral, it must be expected that better export opportunities for agricultural and industrial products will be obtainable only in consideration of continued reduction of protection.</P>
    <P>We must adhere firmly to our principal objective, which is the reshaping of the Irish economy to enable us to hold our place in a world that is moving towards freer trade and to maintain the rate of economic growth achieved in recent years.  Indeed, the situation which has arisen calls for a redoubling of our efforts to reach maximum economic efficiency.  This is no time for either relaxation or discouragement. Competition in world markets will become progressively more acute.  Exports are the key to <Col N="619" /> Ireland's economic progress, the only real basis for higher living standards, more employment and reduced emigration.  Industrial expansion and increased industrial exports are becoming more important than ever as a condition of economic growth. Increased efficiency is also more necessary for the wellbeing of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The great national need is to complete as soon as possible the comprehensive survey of agriculture and industry now in progresss and carry through the requisite reorganisation and adjustment in order to bring every sector of our economy to a state of competitive efficiency.  Everything we have already done in preparation for membership of the European Economic Community has been worth doing for its own sake.  We must continue, and strengthen where necessary, the measures adopted and planned in contemplation of our assuming by 1970 all the obligations of free trade which membership of the Community will then entail.  In this way, a general level of economic efficiency will be established which will accelerate sound national development and also facilitate our entry to the Community when the time comes.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, it may be assumed that there will be a further general reduction of our industrial protective tariffs on 1st January, 1964.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the preparation of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will be pressed forward so that, even if the circumstances should be less favourable, we will find means of maintaining the impetus of our economic advance over the period to 1970 and reach by then the target of a 50 per cent. increase in gross national product by comparison with 1960 which the OECD countries have collectively set themselves.</P>
    <P>If, notwithstanding all the uncertainties of the situation and the unlikelihood that they will be removed in the very early future, there is a general desire in the Dáil for its discussion, I would be prepared to move the adjournment of the Dáil after Questions on Tuesday next for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order &mdash;I am sorry to interrupt Deputy Dillon&mdash;is the Taoiseach's statement an answer to a question or is it a statement on which members of the House may now comment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Any discussion on this must be in the form of interrogatories to the Taoiseach?</P>

      <P>Interrogatories to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to get the position clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While emphasising our share in the regret expressed by the Taoiseach at the failure of the negotiations to produce a truly united Europe and the prospect of an Atlantic Union envisaged by President Kennedy in his November Day address, I feel that the country here will expect an opportunity of hearing from the Government their intentions in certain specific matters.</P>
      <P>I put down this question today in order to find out when the Taoiseach would be prepared to meet the Dáil to discuss these matters.  He has gone into them in some detail today but there are certain specific queries which require to be answered categorically if a serious atmosphere of uncertainty is not to develop in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest one of them is, what do the Government propose to do in regard to the outstanding application by Ireland to join the European Economic Community which is at present registered in Brussels and, so far as I know, still is outstanding?  The people will want to know whether the Government intend to pursue that or to withdraw it.  I think the country will want to know what the Government propose to do in respect of potential European <Col N="621" /> markets and whether we have any plans or whether we propose to concoct plans to deal with bilateral negotiation with individual European countries to protect or expand such European outlets as may still be available to us.  Lastly, I think the Government would be expected to make some statement on whether, in view of the developments at Brussels, it is proposed to take any step for strengthening or expanding our trade relations with Great Britain.  I would be glad to know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we take it the reply the Taoiseach has given is, in fact, a statement or does he propose to make a further statement on next Tuesday and, further, does it necessarily mean that the Taoiseach intends to make this statement on Tuesday and to have a general debate in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not anticipate that the situation will have cleared sufficiently by Tuesday to permit of final decisions being taken on the matters mentioned by Deputy Dillon, or, indeed, on other aspects of this question.  However, I think the House might wish to have a general discussion and, if so, I am prepared to facilitate it, although it will be appreciated that it will have to be on a very tentative and provisional basis because many of the factors which will be important in the formation of our own policy will certainly not be clarified by then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that unless the Opposition ask for a discussion on Tuesday, the Taoiseach does not intend to make a statement, pending the emergence of what he describes as a clearer picture?  Would it be right, therefore, to say that the Taoiseach will not be prepared to make a statement until there is a decision on this situation by the British Government as it affects them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  I said I would make a statement regarding Government policy as soon as the situation was clear enough to permit of decisions bearing upon these policy matters being reached.</P>

    <Col N="622" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being taken to-day in the British House of Commons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite possible that it could be some time before there will be sufficient clarification of the situation to justify final decisions.  I doubt very much if that situation will be reached by Tuesday next.  It is extremely unlikely, but I would be prepared to give the House all the information available to the Government as to the course of events and as to the possible alternative courses that may have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, the Taoiseach does not think he will be able to say by Tuesday next whether Ireland's application is to be continued, withdrawn or suspended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government think it unlikely that a position will develop by Tuesday next which would make it wise to decide that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the fact that a statement made about a week ago by General de Gaulle indicating his concept of the European Common Market looks more like an effort to establish French hegemony in Europe than to promote an outward-looking comprehensive European Economic Community to which, in the first instance at all events, we were prepared to give sympathetic consideration and that the statement by General de Gaulle has completely changed the French point of view on that situation?</P>
      <P>Secondly, is he aware of the fact that there is a wide conflict between his conception of what a European Economic Community is which was indicated by the American Ambassador in his speech last night and the first concept of the European Economic Community, and a still wider conflict between what the French have in mind and what the Americans have in mind as a means of co-operation in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, would the Taoiseach endeavour to obtain before Tuesday next, if possible, some indication from <Col N="623" /> General de Gaulle as to whether we could, if we so desire, on our own, secure admission to the European Economic Community, now that his Foreign Minister has said that it is unthinkable that a new person could be admitted to an unfinished community?</P>
    <P>Lastly, Sir, have we still got the Taoiseach's assurance that before it is committed in any way, economically or politically, to join some concept of the European Economic Community, the House will have an opportunity of considering all these matters in detail, recognising that in the long run what are called the ideals of the Rome Treaty may have to be translated in Ireland to the mundane task of making sure that every man, woman and child gets a decent living and shelter and will not be driven on to the breadlines whilst so-called idealism is taking shape in certain parts of Europe?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this answer which we have just heard from the Taoiseach not just yet another instalment of the misleading and fraudulent rigmarole which the Taoiseach has put out here over the past 18 months, attempting to mislead the public into believing that Ireland has an independent industrial and agricultural economy and may be capable of accepting full membership of the Common Market? Is it not further a fact that what the Taoiseach is waiting for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Norton, the position is that we have made an application for membership to the Community of Six.  I have said that because of the circumstances which have now arisen, it is quite obvious that we have to reconsider the position of that application.  This process of reconsideration will be going on for some time but the point <Col N="624" /> at which it would be wise to take a decision will be when we have all the knowledge that it is possible to get to permit it.  I do not think we should rush to take a decision until we have that knowledge.  We are dealing mainly with the question of devising a policy which in the new circumstances will promote the continued economic growth of our country and there is no such element of urgency in this situation which would justify us rushing to a decision until we have the knowledge which would give us the firm basis for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the announcement which was made last night that it is proposed to convene a meeting of the Five and a British representative in Geneva in February, would the Taoiseach consider that this country might be either represented at that meeting or have observer status to ensure that we will be fully informed of what steps are being taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Mr. Heath said that the breakdown was due to political rather than economic reasons, would the Taoiseach undertake to try to discover what these reasons were?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many people in the world trying to discover these reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach propose to have any contact with the British Government on this?  It seems clear that we have to consider our position because Britain finds herself in the position in which she is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what would be important, before coming to a final conclusion, is to know how British commercial policy is going to develop <i>vis-à-vis</i> the European Economic Community, the European Free Trade Association, or the world generally, because British trade is such a large factor in our economy that it is something we would want to know before we could take a decision which would be any way final.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach state what are the concise and prompt decisions the Government intend to take when the present situation is clarified, as per his speech last night, and would he clearly co-relate that statement with the possibility whether the Government intend to withdraw the application for full membership in light of what happened in Brussels yesterday?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our decisions must cover all aspects of the matter, including those mentioned by Deputy Dillon. I do not intend to rush these decisions until we have at least a general picture of the situation which we would need to have, but as soon as that picture does emerge from the dust of the conflict, then we will take our decisions.  When I spoke of making a statement in the Dáil, that is the type of statement I had in mind, but because I could not hold out the possibility that it might be possible to make such a statement for some weeks, I thought it might be desirable to have a free-for-all discussion on Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not now quite manifest from the exchanges that have taken place here that in the interests of settling the public mind and of ventilating the whole question, we should have, albeit, a preliminary kind of discussion on Tuesday.  Nobody in any part of the House desires to rush the Taoiseach into a premature decision but it is manifest that the House and the country want a discussion for the purpose of clarification.</P>

      <P>I think the House will appreciate the Taoiseach's difficulty in making a statement and trying to clarify our position with regard to the European Economic Community when the whole position is clouded.  It would probably be better if the statement were made when the Taoiseach is in a position to have close regard to what has happened elsewhere.  At the same time, I think there is some advantage for the Taoiseach and the Government in having a discussion so that the Government may learn the viewpoints of other Parties in the House, certainly before they make up their own minds as to what way they are going to come down in the likelihood of changed circumstances.</P>
      <P>Some of the discussions may be academic if General de Gaulle persists in his desire to exclude certain people. It has been indicated on his behalf that it is in his view illogical to admit a new member to an unfinished community, although he has told the Danes that they would be welcome to come in.  Whether that is because the General now wants a geographically compact union or not, nobody can say.  I should like the Taoiseach to find out between now and the debate whether in fact, if we want to go ahead on our own, which I hope we do not, we could secure admission. It is quite fruitless from the point of view of the Dáil and general policy to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night, I was speaking about my constituency and how it had fared under the original Act.  It was no harm to say that the Act had proved itself another Fianna Fáil failure.  This report of the CIO&mdash;this Bible&mdash;tells us that the centralisation of industry in Dublin was all wrong. I have heard Deputies for the past eight years thundering that in this House but the Government took no notice of it at all.  Ministers would reply: &ldquo;Well, we have not the siting of the factories.  We cannot help this. If industrialists come along and say they want to put up a factory in Dublin, that is all right.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was pointed out to the Minister that concessions should have been given to industrialists with the suggestion that they establish their industries in various centres in the country.  It was suggested also to the Minister and to his predecessor that the proper thing was that the Department should actually give a direction to the people concerned.  That was scoffed at by the Minister's predecessor, who is now the Taoiseach, and by the Minister himself.</P>
      <P>However, here we have it in this report, which is to be our Bible, that now the best thing we could do would be to select areas down the country for industrial expansion.  That is all to the good.  However, we have been eating the lotus about this for the past seven or eight years.  If anything emerges from our application for membership of the Common Market, at least that emerges and at least some kind of consciousness was hammered into the Government and the Government's officers that it was not a case of sentiment but that industrial development should be in the areas and in the places which suited industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt, and I do not want to be told it again, that Dublin is the most suitable place but there are other parts of the country almost as <Col N="629" /> suitable.  That is what I want to put on the records of this House.  I have heard criticism in this House and outside it, and it was uttered in the most venomous way by the supporters of the Government, when Great Britain or British industrialists were mentioned or if a British product were coming into this country which might be a detriment to an Irish product. Deputies would not come in here to try to defend the Irish product but to cast venom on the British product, on the British and on the ancient enemy.</P>
    <P>Today, I heard the Taoiseach on this very important Parliamentary Question say: &ldquo;Our trade arrangements with Great Britain are of basic importance.&rdquo;  I wrote it down as he said it.  I welcome it.  I was beaten and physically assaulted by supporters of Fianna Fáil for saying that.  I am glad now that it took all this running after the Common Market to bring the Government to their senses. The Government have come to their senses and this Bill says that the Government have come to their senses. Deputies from other constituencies as well as from my constituency can tell the Minister that we had our unemployment problems, that our people experienced great hardship and that we had people with great skills leaving this country, from our eastern and southern seaboards, for Great Britain or the United States&mdash;and there seemed to be no meas on them in this House and nobody seemed to care.</P>
    <P>If <i>entrepreneurs</i> came in&mdash;and our information was that they wanted to come to places outside Dublin on the eastern or southern seaboard &mdash; they were directed to the western seaboard I have been trying to get information about <i>entrepreneurs</i> who came in here and who when they found that they would have to locate the factory in a part of Ireland which did not suit them at all &mdash; they would have taken Drogheda or Dundalk, Wexford or Waterford&mdash;decided against it.  Their factory is now being built in Northern Ireland because they got the concessions there.  It is a good thing that now we are giving the concessions and <Col N="630" /> that these concessions are available.  It would be well if British industrialists were amongst the industrialists asked or even enticed to come over here.  It was strange &mdash; there must have been some reason for it&mdash;that, in all this industrial drive in the past year or two, British industrialists did not seem to come in.  We had Continental industrialists and even Oriental industrialists.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to make a statement about the industrial area at Shannon.  I hope it is doing well. Is it a fact that some of the industries there closed and that the people concerned turned to something else and, for the purpose of statistics, they are shown as opening a new industry?  If that is right, I should be glad if the Minister would say so and if it is not right, I should be glad if he would tell me it is not right.</P>
    <P>Deputies should speak for their constituencies and I am speaking for mine as regards industrialisation.  About 15 years ago, the stir came in Waterford after many years and a new industry came there, Waterford glass.  That is one of the our greatest industries now. It did not come through any Government action; it did not come to Waterford because they liked the colour of our hair.  It came because Waterford has a great tradition in glassmaking and because Waterford is known all over the world for the quality of its glass and therefore Waterford was the right place to open a crystal cutglass factory. That was done and done well by the promoters.  The present Chairman of Hospitals Trust, Mr. Joe McGrath became Chairman of the Waterford glass factory which is setting a headline to Irish industry in its promotion, the way it sells its products and because of its great rule and great policy of high quality.</P>
    <P>There are no &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; in Waterford glass or in the glass factory.  If any of their products is not perfect, it is neither sold nor offered for sale but destroyed.  That is a headline for Irish industry in a country where many industrialists have the idea that anything will do, more especially when they are behind tariff walls and when <Col N="631" /> they have the protection of the Government.</P>
    <P>There was another promotion in Waterford which was not due to Fianna Fáil but to the inter-Party Government.  The paper mills were established in Waterford and later the metal industries were set up there. Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time.  Then ACEC was established.  These are great exporting industries, paying top wages and with splendid working conditions. We have some industries which were established before that, Allied Iron Founders, for instance, and I am proud to say that instead of coming up here and begging with their hats in their hands for tariffs, crawling for protection and begging for grants, we have there an industry making enamel ranges and although one of the greatest manufacturers of these is the Carron Iron Founders in Glasgow&mdash;one of the oldest, if not one of the greatest iron founders in Britain&mdash;the Waterford factory is exporting its products to Glasgow.  That is a headline for Irish industry at a time when all the starry-eyed young men were going about to bring us into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>We had addresses at chambers of commerce meetings and at various public functions in Dublin about all the production we were to have and how that production was to be stepped up and what they would do about it. I suggest to the Minister there is just a little more to it than production; there is the selling of it.  I draw the Minister's attention to these Waterford factories that have salesmen able to go out and sell their production, and who have been selling it before ever there was a Common Market, in all the countries of the world.  We have many of these young salesmen in Ireland who would almost need to be called in and told or even trained&mdash; although some of them have been salesmen for years&mdash;how to do their job because they have never sold in competitive markets.  It is necessary for the Minister's Department and the Minister himself to bend to that task.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> ACEC in Waterford make electric transformers, even monsters in size&mdash; it is not one of these small, piffling back-yard industries&mdash;and these transformers are sent to the ends of the earth, to India, South Africa and South America.  Because of all this, years passed by and no industry was established in Waterford except one just recently.  Anything that we moved to do was snapped away from us.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister of the treatment Waterford got.  I shall go back a few years, not too many.  People from various constituencies and centres of population used to come to Dublin agitating for industries in their areas.  We had to put up with industries being pilfered out of Waterford.  An industry was established in Drogheda, the oil and cake mills in the 1930's.  They went in for refining edible oils.  That seemed all right.  They were established under heavy tariff.  I was farming at the time and my attention was first drawn to this factory because the price of dairy cakes and oil cakes doubled.  I hope that will not be a headline for the nitrogen factory.  When the war ended, a factory that had been established in Waterford in the early years of this century, McDonnell's margarine factory, was just transferred from Waterford up beside the oil and cake mills in Drogheda.  No protest we could make would stop this.</P>
    <P>I have discovered that when protests are made by Waterford people to the Fianna Fáil Government, they are not listened to.  Fianna Fáil prefer to destroy anything that is there. There was another factory in Waterford, the HMV company, which was doing well.  That did not close down but was transferred to Dublin.  Afterwards, I heard that one of the principal reasons for the transfer was that the two golf courses available in Waterford were not up to the standard of the management who wanted to be near the golf courses in Dublin. Any protests made by the local authority, by Deputies or by the unions in Waterford were not heard by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I think if there was a factory in a western area or perhaps in certain other portions of <Col N="633" /> the country and it was doing well, the management would not be allowed to take it away from the provinces and set it up in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We have heard something about the forgotten men in an industry and it reminds me of the treatment of my constituency by Fianna Fáil.  We had a great industry in Waterford&mdash;an industry of buying live pigs, slaughtering them at home and exporting them.</P>

      <P>I am not clear as to the relevancy of this.  The Deputy is going back into the industrial history of Waterford.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time to talk about it.  We had a Minister representing it on the Fianna Fáil benches for many years and, if you look up the index, you will find he never said anything about it at all.  I have to listen to other Deputies speaking, and rightly so, for their constituencies.  This is the kind of industry we should establish. Industry that can export, that is not looking for protection, for grants and for handouts.  The live pig industry I was talking about did not need any handouts but it was destroyed by two Acts of Parliament here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having said that, will the Deputy please come to the two Bills and their provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the amount of money that could be given in grants.  I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of January 30th:</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he would give grants in excess of either 50 per cent. of the fixed assets or a sum calculated at the rate of £1,000 per worker, the number of whom would be estimated by the Board on the basis of full production.  The grant would be calculated on whichever of these sums was the lesser. Should the proposed grant exceed £500,000, the Board would require the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assumed from that, that if the Minister gave £500,000 towards the establishment of an industry, he would expect 500 people to be employed in it.  Some time ago, the Minister said in respect of the nitrogen factory that 300 men would be employed in it.  Yet this factory is to cost £7,000,000. According to the Minister's figures <Col N="635" /> yesterday, 7,000 people should be employed in that factory.  I call the Minister's attention to that because perhaps I will be asking him to meet local <i>entrepreneurs</i> from Waterford and I would hope he will have these figures in his mind and be generous.</P>
    <P>There is another very important matter I wish to draw to the Minister's attention.  It has been repeatedly said in the lobbies of this House and, as our friend Shakespeare would say, &ldquo;upon the Rialto&rdquo;, that the people promoting smaller projects are not well received by the IDA.  It is said that if you come with a small but reasonably good project for a small town or village, a project which would not cost more than £40,000 or £50,000, such schemes are not duly considered.  I should like the Minister to make a firm statement on that.  From my own experience, and that of other Deputies on both sides, small projects do not seem to be welcome to the powers that be in the Department and in the IDA.</P>
    <P>Some of the greatest industries have started in a small way.  It is better economics that a small industry be set up in a village at the end of the Shannon power line.  That kind of industry only requires Shannon power to run it. These small industries, with men of tenacity behind them, have been known to spread and to make their towns big.  In the town of Campile, I have seen a small creamery extend, turning the place from a village into a small town.  I refer, of course, to the Shelbourne Co-op.  I have seen also, as many other Deputies have seen, the growth of an industry attached to a creamery in Mitchelstown.  Now they are making cheese and sending it all over the world.</P>
    <P>If the committees, or the owners, or the managers of small businesses such as the two I have just mentioned approached the Department for grants or other forms of assistance, I have no doubt they would be turned down. For that reason, I should like the Minister to give this matter his personal attention.  I should like him to consider all applications, no matter how ridiculous some of them may <Col N="636" /> seem, to examine them and reject them if they seem to be of no use.  They cannot all be that bad.  There is an opinion abroad that nobody who comes to the Department with a proposition in respect of a small industry is ever listened to.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Esmonde that Deputies from all sides of the House who ask questions in the Dáil relating to proposed industries for which grants are being sought should be given proper replies by the Minister instead of being referred to Foras Tionscal.  All Deputies should have some say in the matter and if we think fit to put down Parliamentary Questions seeking information from the Minister as to why the promoters of prospective industries were refused assistance, the Minister should give us the information because after all Foras Tionscal are operating on moneys voted to his Department.  I would point out to the Minister that when we ask for such information, in all politeness and deference, we should be given the required information instead of being treated with the brush-off we have been in the habit of getting from his colleague in the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation and wish to say that, in Limerick, we have been agitating since the introduction of the Undeveloped Areas Act to get Limerick city scheduled under its provisions.  Local organisations such as the Limerick City Council, the Harbour Commissioners and the Limerick Chamber of Commerce have for years been advocating this treatment for Limerick.  In the city, we have a first-class harbour, rail and road transport facilities and are deprived of the benefits which people living two or three miles away across the Shannon are enjoying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of all that, to kill any chance we might have had of getting industrialists to come to Limerick, the Government set up an area at Shannon Airport giving authority to certain people to start an industrial zone.  That industrial zone received, by way of grant from the Government, up to 31st March, 1962, a sum <Col N="637" /> of £614,500.  Industrialists were encouraged to come in there because they could avail of ready-made factory premises with offices laid on, as well as a subvention towards the installation of plant and machinery.  The people at the head of this industrial zone had no qualifications whatsoever. I am not decrying Shannon.  The day Shannon closes down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Heavens above, are these people not receiving grants to the extent of £614,000, and surely to goodness we must be allowed to make a comparison between Shannon and Limerick which is only 11 miles away? I want to point out to the Minister the mistakes that have been made and to advise him on them.  I come here only to help him and my constituency.  I am not decrying Shannon but I want to see that people in authority at Shannon are properly qualified for their jobs and that people who are unqualified&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is coming down to administration at Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming down to the placing of industries.  If money is to be spent on industry, it is our business and the Government's duty to see the industries are placed in proper locations.  That is what I am coming to and if you will allow me, I shall.  These people set themselves up as the Shannon Development Authority.  They have done good work without being qualified for it and we fired out £614,000 to them to spend on foreigners coming in without any security for workers and with all juvenile and female labour.  These people who have come over to Shannon can turn the key in the door of any factory and wave us goodbye in Limerick and there can be no more about it.</P>
      <P>The factories I want to see developed in Limerick, now that we are included in the provisions of this legislation, are the old traditional industries associated with the city.  I know instances of industrialists in Limerick desirous of expanding their businesses and incidentally creating more employment in the city, applying for grants and being turned down.  These people all gave good employment to male adult labour which is more than can be said for Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> I want to point out to the Minister that the most important point in this Bill is the placing of factories.  The reasons for that are very simple and I will give the Minister one or two examples.  A particularly reputable world-famed manufacturing company came here and wanted to be supplied with the raw material, milk, for the manufacture of their product.  Of all places, where were they sent?  They were sent, and forced to go if they wanted to start in Ireland, away down to Rathmore in the Kerry mountains. That factory is still in Rathmore but this is the position: as a result of the Government forcing those people to go there, milk has to be transported now, and since that day, to Rathmore from all parts of Counties Limerick, Tipperary and Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And West Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, West Cork certainly.  It is sent down to the village of Rathmore and from Rathmore, when it has been processed, it is sent back to the city of Dublin to be manufactured into the company's article. There is no sense, but absolute stupidity, in the action of the Government of that day.  Another case in point is a cheese factory which was set up in County Wexford.  One would not get as much milk in County Wexford as would colour the tea of the people of Limerick.  The milk has to be drawn into County Wexford from Kilkenny and the neighbouring counties. If people had any commonsense in the placing of these industries, the insistence would be on the locality where the milk, labour and the transport facilities are available.  We in the city of Limerick have a population of something like 53,000 or 54,000 people, plenty of labour and plenty of facilities by way of transport, and I want to impress on and to appeal to the Minister now that the city of Limerick should be one of the main centres under this industrial drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made recommendations long ago for the development of the condensed milk factory in Limerick.  The Condensed Milk Company are sending <Col N="640" /> milk all over Ireland.  There is a cheese factory there at the moment, but Limerick, being the second largest-milk-producing county in Ireland, I think deserves the consideration of any dairying industry that might be started as a result of the grants being made available by the Minister now.</P>
    <P>As I said, we in Limerick have received nothing, or very little, in the past by way of any industrial progress as a result of the special treatment that has been given to Shannon Airport. The people of Limerick are glad, and I am glad, that the Minister has taken the action he has taken.  I submit to him now, before anything pertaining to dairying is considered, in the light of transport into and out of the centre, that there is no reason in the world why Limerick should not get priority over any other city in the area covered by the Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be fairly brief in my comments on the two measures now being discussed.  I should say, first of all, whatever the merits of the two Bills may be with regard to the country generally, there is not the slightest doubt, and it is clearly to be seen in the measures that the death-knell of the west of Ireland will be sounded when the two measures are passed by this House.</P>
      <P>We have had the situation over a period of years where this underdeveloped areas measure, which was introduced some years ago, has proved to be almost completely ineffective in stabilising the population west of the Shannon.  I shall not bore the House with comments I made here when the first measure of this nature came into the House.  I pointed out that the type of legislation that was introduced was insufficient and would not give the results which were expected.  I challenge any Deputy to deny the truth of those statements, made in this House as far back as 1953-54.  The flow of emigrants has not been reduced by a fraction as a result of any industrial development in the west.  The type of industries which have come to the west are, to my mind, ones which are on shaky foundations and their staying power is very suspect indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> In addition to that, there was no over-all plan in the minds of either Foras Tionscal or the Industrial Development Authority to create some sensible pattern with regard to industrial planning.  The type of industrial development which has taken place, not alone in the west, but in the country generally, can be described as a crazy patchwork of industries set up haphazardly in areas purely from pressure of local committees or by persuasive methods used on politicians by people in high position.  The situation has been that in Merrion Square and in the other head offices where the grants are sanctioned, we have had nothing but queues of deputations from every little town in the west of Ireland, each begging for an industry for their particular locality.</P>
    <P>I must say I was sorry for the officials who had to suffer the embarrasment of pointing out repeatedly to these deputations that the officials hands were tied, and that they could do nothing to help.  When we consider the situation, can anybody justify the handing out of public money for the setting up of what can be described as assembly industries, miles away from good distributing centres and miles away from the raw materials, and subsidising these industries and giving them protection for unlimited periods&mdash;and not alone giving them protection but giving to the groups which set them up profits not subject to taxation for a very long period.  I think the situation is disgraceful up to the present so far as the working of the previous grant Acts is concerned.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put forward that a considerable amount of employment has been given in the undeveloped areas.  Deputy Coughlan pointed out the situation in County Limerick.  It cannot be denied that the majority of these free-wheeling industrial adventurers who come in here are on the make so far as this country is concerned. They have no ties with this country; they have read our advertisements abroad and have been told that this is a wonderful place to come to and dig their two arms into the kitty.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the wages paid are a disgrace in what is described as a <Col N="642" /> Christian community.  We hear announcements made by the Minister week after week, at the opening of these tinpot factories, that the factory has 30 employees at the moment and that it is hoped to build this figure up to 300.  In regard to the factories which were opened in the past eight years and which started with 25 or 30 employees, with a promise of building up to 100, I should like the Minister to tell me how many of them ever reached that figure over a period of three or four years.  That is the true test of the progress made by any of these industries.  If the Minister cares to trace the history and go back to the opening ceremony of any of these factories and count the number employed the day they opened and the number employed to-day, he will find that in the majority of cases there is very little&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that I do not accept the Minister's intervention that all the industries started in the west of Ireland have not reached 97 per cent. of their potential employment figures.  If that is the situation, I should like him, without mentioning the names of the industries&mdash;unless he wishes to do so &mdash;to explain how a number of factories in the west of Ireland are still employing the same number in 1962 as they employed in 1957 or 1958.  I should also like him to explain how it is that the type of labour being <Col N="643" /> employed can, to a great extent, be described as juvenile or female labour. I know of a particular factory in the west of Ireland which has been established for quite a number of years now.  I wish to refer to the case of a mother and daughter who are working in that factory.  They have to travel by CIE&mdash;by bus&mdash;into the town in which the factory operates.  The wages of the young girl, who is now 17 years of age, are £3 2s. 6d. per week, out of which she pays 12/- to CIE for her fare.  Her mother's wages are £4 per week and she pays a fare of 18/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those two individuals have to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to get into work by 8.30 a.m.  That factory is lauded to the skies today by the Minister and this Government.  The gentlemen who run it can drive around in a Mercedes and can make any profit they like. It is considered Christian and right to pay people who work eight to ten hours per day in those dumps £3 to £4 per week.  We do not want that type of industry developed here.  It is clear that in all these factories you have a very big turnover of labour. Each year, a number of young girls are recruited&mdash;say, 20 young girls are brought in.  Out of those 20, perhaps 18 disappear after 12 months.  They go off to Birmingham or Liverpool and another group is brought in.  That management are getting away with profits they are not entitled to because what is really alleged to be skilled work is being done by unskilled labour, on the ground that these employees are trainees.  The position all along is that these trainees are doing the work the whole time.  They leave before completing the full two or three year period of training, when they would reach what the trade unions claim is a living wage, because they are disillusioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These factories get away with low wages, bad conditions for the workers, big profits and a good time generally, <Col N="644" /> so far as the State is concerned.  What do these Bills propose to do?  They propose to extend to the rest of the country the facilities which have been available in the west of Ireland.  I do not care what type of equivocation the Minister indulges in or what statement he makes to suggest that there is still an extra attraction in the west of Ireland. I want to make it quite clear that there is no attraction left in the west of Ireland from the moment this Bill passes.</P>
    <P>I was on a deputation before Christmas to the IDA in connection with an industry for the town of Boyle. There was a very representative gathering of the local citizens from the town of Boyle.  They came to Dublin and, to give them their due, they went to a lot of trouble to prepare information for the officials.  They asked for help for an industry.  It was pointed out to them that the officials did not consider it their duty to direct an industry, that they had no power to do so.  So far as they were concerned, every town got equal treatment.  I accepted that personally.  That deputation left Dublin fully aware of the fact that their chances of having an industry in Boyle were practically negligible under the existing legislation.  Would the Minister tell me if their chances will improve one degree as a result of this new legislation ?  Is it not a fact that if there was a possibility of an industry coming to Boyle in December last, attracted by the existing grants, the individual who was likely to set up that industry was wavering or balancing other areas against Boyle.  The result of this measure now is that the scales are tipped in favour of the eastern parts of the country.  No longer is there an incentive to a business group to come to a place west of the Shannon, if they can get the attractive facilities offered in this measure on the east coast.</P>
    <P>It is admitted in the EEC <i>bloc</i> that the really industrialised region is based on a triangle between three of the major cities of countries which are members of the EEC and that the tendency for industry even in Britain at the present time, in spite of Government <Col N="645" /> persuasion, grants and otherwise, is to establish itself in the south and east of the country.  If that is the tendency in Britain, can it be logically suggested that in Ireland there will be any tendency to move to the west of Ireland, Donegal, Clare, Kerry, Roscommon, Galway or Mayo?</P>
    <P>In relation to the facilities now being given by the Government to industrial concerns, it must be faced that advantage will be taken of those attractive propositions on the east coast.  If the Government persist in their outlook with regard to Europe and wish to pursue their application for admission&mdash;I do not want to say anything about that on this particular measure&mdash;is it not logical to suggest that the east coast will get practically all of these new industries which may appear on the horizon?</P>
    <P>We have to take into account shipping facilities, port facilities and the transport difficulties involved.  Here is a Government which have over the years expressed their dismay at the fact that there is a dwindling population in the west of Ireland.  Here is a Government deliberately by legislation taking steps to reduce further the population of the west of Ireland at a time when it is absolutely essential to stabilise that population if it is not to disappear altogether.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, as a result of those two measures, that the Government's idea for the west of Ireland is to use it as a tourist centre and that as far as they are concerned an Irishman will be a rare sight in the west of Ireland in another generation.  I think it is regrettable that Deputies who have spoken in this House, who are alleged to look on the attractions offered by the Government from a national point of view, should actually from this side of the House congratulate the Government for giving the same facilities on the east coast for the development of industries as are given in the west.  I do not accept that that is in the national interest.  It is not in the national interest to make a bigger colossus of Dublin than it is today at the expense of the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Will any Deputy tell me that any industrialist will go down to Athlone, <Col N="646" /> Castlerea, Castlebar, Tubbercurry and set up an industry there, if he now can establish it right in the heart of County Dublin and get the same grants for so doing?  I would not blame him.  I have never met any philanthropist amongst this industrialist class.  It is money and profits which motivate them in any decisions they take.  The decision with regard to the welfare of the west of Ireland must not be left in the hands of such private individuals.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude all along has been: &ldquo;We will make the grants available; we are sorry if advantage is not taken of them.&rdquo;  That is the Pontius Pilate attitude: wash your hands of them.  The Government are afraid all along the line to take steps which would direct industries into the areas where employment is needed.  When I say &ldquo;direct industry&rdquo;, I mean the proper type of industry and not what is happening at the present time, leaving it to every Tom, Dick and Harry to establish what he thinks he can make a quick profit on.  There has been no over-all plan.  The idea which is mooted in the CIO report is something which was advocated in this House 10 years ago.  The Government should pick centres like Galway, Limerick, Sligo, Athlone and set up State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should set up State-run industries in those areas.  If you spend the money on the proper major industry in a particular locality, you can leave the development of the ancillary industries to private enterprise.  It is an established fact that if there is a first-class industry, a healthy, solid one, based in a locality and that, as a result, industry flourishes, ancillary or other smaller industries will build themselves up in the adjoining towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> For instance, if Athlone were properly developed, there is nothing to prevent a town like Roscommon or Castlerea being used then as a location for smaller industries which would feed the major factory in the town of Athlone.  The same would apply to the city of Galway.  It would mean that small towns within a radius of 25 to 30 miles of Galway would improve and be strengthened as a result of the first-class development of Galway. What have we in Galway?  We have no real effort made even to develop the port which is absolutely essential.  Instead of that, the services which should be provided by the State are even being curtailed.  I refer to rail services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to pursue it.  I am trying to paint the picture of the shortsighted manner in which the Government are looking on this development business.  If the Minister suggests that he does not follow my line of reasoning, I refer him to what took place in Wales and Scotland when the Labour Party went into power.  I refer to the way the State&mdash; it was a Socialist Government; a Labour Government were in power&mdash; was responsible for the redevelopment of areas in Wales and Scotland which were up to that centres of desperation and despair and where work had not been available for 15 or 20 years before.  It was through the State setting up new industries in those areas that hope was given and employment provided for the unfortunate people. It was not left to private enterprise. If it had been left to private enterprise, they would be empty today.  I admit there is a serious situation there now but it is nothing to what the situation would have been if that action had not been taken by the Government. Similar action should have been taken by this Government ten years ago, instead of saying: &ldquo;We are about to contemplate the setting up of development centres.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least one good thing has come out of the Government's application <Col N="648" /> for membership of EEC, that is, the investigation being carried out by the CIO people into existing industry.  I do not accept that that investigation is a complete and thorough one at all. Even though it is incomplete and lackadaisical in many ways, its reports give the hint of the danger signal to the community of the conditions in which certain industries find themselves and what is likely to happen to them if membership of EEC is thrust upon them.</P>
    <P>It is an established fact that according to all the reports available, the industries referred to are in anything but a healthy state.  Anybody who reads them can have nothing but a feeling of the deepest concern for the welfare of the workers in all those industries.  Most of the industries are assembly industries in one way or another dependent on raw materials from abroad and dependent on the importation of raw materials over the price of which they can exercise no control.  Apart, therefore, from being at the mercy of outsiders, who run the industries, you are also at the mercy of those who supply the raw materials.  It has been a disaster for this country to base its industrial development on the type of assembly industry to which I have referred, a type of industry which is owned and controlled in a great number of cases outside the State.</P>
    <P>What will future development be? Will it be a further rash of these assembly industries?  What real efforts will be made under this measure to provide industries based on native raw materials?  When I speak of developing group areas and industrial centres, I think that what has been suggested for Limerick by Deputy Coughlan is the ideal.  Where you have milk, stick to the processing of that commodity, together with whatever ancillary agricultural industries come from the production of milk.  There are other areas which are excellent for horticulture, the production of fruit and vegetables.  These should be encouraged and developed.  It is in these areas the processing centres should be set up.  Areas that have a <Col N="649" /> tradition for pig breeding should be developed.  Centres should be set up on a scientific basis.</P>
    <P>All that will cost plenty.  I read a report about ten years ago, a report submitted by a very prominent individual close to Government circles.  He made the case to the Government that they should spend in one county £1,000,000 for the development of the pig industry, with a view to capturing the huge market then available in America for canned hams and other products.  The Danes have since moved into that market and, inside of five years, they have raised their exports from £111,000 to over £11 million.  We simply sat down on that.  No effort was made to spend money on that project. Yet that is exactly the type of industry the Irish farmer needs.  It is one of his traditional types of production.  It is one that would give first-class employment. It is one that would give us the exports we need.</P>
    <P>This Government talk about &ldquo;export, or we die&rdquo;.  What we are doing is exporting our people to work in these industries in other countries.  I have no illusions left with regard to the two measures we are discussing. So far as the west of Ireland is concerned, these measures spell the death knell of industrial development there. These measures will only help to speed up depopulation in the west of Ireland. The Deputies who support this Government cannot hide behind the Government in regard to these. Deputies from the west who are members of the Fianna Fáil Party have a responsibility to state publicly that they believe some alternative steps must be taken by the Government to help the people in the west and in the undeveloped areas generally.  If they do not do that, then I believe they are betraying the people who put them into this House.  Not only that, but they are helping to cut their own throats politically because the numbers of their supporters will be reduced as a result of these measures.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to believe that men who can only be described as decent, upright men have not got sufficient courage to make their presence felt in <Col N="650" /> the Party meetings by demanding protection in the true sense for those people who have waited so long for a plan from the Government which would enable them to live on their small holdings and in the towns and villages of the west of Ireland.  I know I am wasting my time speaking here; I know I have wasted my time speaking here over the years.  I know, however, that these measures will not be long in operation before the country is given an opportunity, through the medium of a general election, of saying what it thinks of measures such as these.  It will not be long until the country is given an opportunity of telling this Government: &ldquo;You have led us up the garden path for the past five years.  You have walked the country into nothing but trouble since you came in.&rdquo;  Before any measure passed by this House can have a serious effect on the west of Ireland, and on other parts of the country, we ask that you go to the country and let the people decide the fate they wish to bestow on you.</P>

      <P>Had I not gone down to the Library before luncheon and read the debate on the Undeveloped Areas Bill when it was being piloted through this House, I might be inclined, having listened to Deputy McQuillan, to sympathise with him.  But Deputy McQuillan cannot have it both ways.  He said on the earlier occasion that the Bill was no good.  He says the same thing today. He then proceeds to lament the taking away of the powers conferred by that earlier measure.  It is very difficult to follow that type of reasoning.</P>
      <P>We all know that the parent Bill was brought in for a specific purpose, namely, to try to stem the flight from the western areas.  That legislation has done a great deal of good in certain areas during the ten years.  There were some disadvantages; there were some drawbacks.  There were periods when very little was done.  In the first few years, practically nothing was done. But the lifetime of the Bill has been comparatively short and, perhaps, not much could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I view these two Bills with a certain amount of misgiving.  I should be a <Col N="651" /> hypocrite if I said anything else.  If, however, the Government believe they can establish industries in the rest of the country, I should be doing a bad day's work were I to try to stand in their way.  I believe the Minister and the Government will take steps to ensure that this measure will not have a bad effect on the undeveloped areas. From that point of view, I think the terms of the loans are too short.  Five years is too short a period to allow an industry to set up and, at the end of the five years, do what it likes.  The term should be extended to ten years at least.  That would give the industry time to get properly on its feet.  The Minister should keep a very close eye on the position to ensure that there will be no walking out after five years.</P>
    <P>Some speakers commented that money was being given to foreign investors to come in here, establish an industry, and fly by night.  My experience is that the foreign investors coming into Sligo have been a great deal better than some of the Irish industrialists. They are giving very good employment and paying very good wages.  I sincerely hope there will not be an end to that.</P>
    <P>I have very little further to say about this Bill except that I have great doubts about its effects.  I should, however, like to point out to the Minister that in areas where industries are set up, the local councils have many commitments in regard to housing.  If an industry is allowed to leave that area, these councils find that they have many empty houses on their hands and much unemployment.  I would appeal to the Minister to see that some steps are taken to prevent that happening. The rest of the country wants industries and nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of places getting industries.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience that the setting up of an industry is a very difficult task and from the pattern which is emerging, I see that industries are inclined to set up along the coast.  I do not think this Bill will help the rest of the country because industries will be setting up along the <Col N="652" /> east and south coasts and where there are ports and other facilities.  Some of the western towns like Galway, Sligo and Killybegs, will still attract industries but the change in this Bill will have no effect on the midland and other counties.  I would also appeal to the Minister to ensure that no group of investors will have power to step out of an area in which they have established an industry, walk off and take advantage of this Bill to set up in another part of the country, leaving behind them what is practically a ghost town.</P>

I am not going to be diverted into social thinking or a socialist concept in dealing with the matter that is <i>ad rem.</i> I think Deputy Gilbride had his tongue in his cheek to some extent.  He is perfectly aware of the fact that this simple measure could have devastating effects on the undeveloped areas, unless, as I believe, and the Minister will be able to tell me, the Government envisage, outside this legislation, a different type of plan for the encouragement of industry suited to the areas on the western seaboard, right around the Kerry coast and back to West Cork, the kind of re-organisation envisaged by the Government's decision to set up these local committees under the chief agricultural officer to see what can be done.  I take it that I can say fairly, that that type of development, in connection with rural areas about which so many laments and dirges have been sung, would be extern to any concept of grant legislation under the industrial pattern such as this Bill conceives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that many an industry has been lost because, where private enterprise is concerned, you cannot direct industry.  People who found that advantages were available to them in difficult circumstances of intake of material and ultimate distribution, did not go into those areas.  If the help envisaged in this new legislation had been available to them in more accessible areas, we might have many a worthwhile industry established <Col N="653" /> here now.  I want to say to Deputy Gilbride, and to the Minister, that if there is not what I feel there must be behind this, a plan of financing in a different way the kind of area development, processing and increased production methods which may be conceived on the western seaboard areas, then this Bill could well be the last nail in the coffin of the hope of any industry being attracted into the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of reservation about this Bill for another reason.  I have a great objection to the growing complexity of companies under State auspices which we are getting in relation to development.  Apparently we had an organisation built up under Foras Tionscal and we had an investigating scheme which, according to some people, was over-assiduous. However, generally speaking, people had created at least a certain amount of confidence here in the Oireachtas that their investigations were thorough and their approach to grants was as far as possible unbiassed and not activated by any political motives or by any particular influence.</P>
    <P>It now seems queer to me that we are to set up a new company.  A new company always envisages new directors, new administration groups and an increasing phalanx of civil servants. I have reached the stage where I am flabbergasted at the enormous numbers of people, civil servants and local authority officials, who have to be employed to guard and protect, tax and collect from the now dwindling population of under 3,000,000. In order to give industry an impetus, it is not cumbersome machinery we require but something that can be effective and useful, particularly now that we are running into a situation which the Government did not envisage, even though they were constantly warned by some of us that in the ultimate analysis the European economic situation might be fraught with tremendous hazards.</P>
    <P>In the situation we now have to face, for whatever period, it may be impracticable for us to proceed with any further efforts to join the enlarged community and we shall have to try <Col N="654" /> to get something that will give employment and, above all, stimulate exports. I do not know whether Deputies take the balance of trade index figures seriously but the Minister will agree with me that there is one immediate urgency, that is, the stimulation of exports.  I can conceive that with this Bill, acting as a fund supplier, certain people could have certain types of industry ready fairly quickly to do a substantial export trade.  I have been staggered by investigating some of the exports that we now have to find what a short period it took some of them to become established in the export market.  I feel that we have only been clawing and fiddling at an industrial plan for a long time.  It may be&mdash;and I readily concede that there are reasons for it, in view of the overall mantle of the economic drive towards membership of the EEC &mdash; that we were stultified and atrophied in the consideration of certain industries because we felt that we might only be encouraging a subsidiary or a rival to some of the monster industries that they would have to compete against in the general Community.  But for the present anyway, that particular concept must be put aside and the immediate problem faced.  We should use this breathing space, this interregnum, to do something about the uneconomic industries we have behind tariff walls.</P>
    <P>That is my objection to this type of measure: it is not broad enough in its concept to do some of the things the Minister in his post-prandial speeches strongly referred to recently, not broad enough to try to direct what were assembly industries or what were purely knock-down and put-together industries protected by tariff walls and which heaped on to the users' back, an extra charge.  It is time we got somebody like the Minister, or his senior staff, directing their minds to the problem of getting these industries into economic shape because, even though I believe the Minister is fundamentally honest and earnest in his appeal and exhortation to the people in this type of industry, they will shed crocodile tears for his trouble and will not give a twopenny damn about what cessation <Col N="655" /> of employment there may be if their plants go out of operation.  They have had their chips and they know it.</P>
    <P>I want to see the machinery of assistance simplified, not complicated as I believe will happen as a result of this measure.  I want to see the encouragement of Irish technicians and Irish experts into Irish industry. In cases where technical staff and technical knowledge are required, and where the Minister is giving very substantial grants to industries for development here, the Minister should direct them to try to procure the return of an Irish emigrant suitably qualified in their expert field or the employment of an Irishman at home who is so qualified before they go to the far-flung corners of the world for all types of nationals to make up their expert team.  It would be a tremendous encouragement to the drive the Minister had in mind in his recently-announced industrial scholarships and to the drive for getting more and more highly-skilled and technically-trained officers in all branches of productivity.</P>
    <P>I do not mean, in saying that, that the Minister should get us any further involved in an extraordinary modern phenomenon.  I remember a time when we lawyers were regarded as the people who bedevilled the scene of Irish industrial development; nowadays, we have time-and-motion study, work-study experts, cost accountants and so on, to the extent that by the time you get through the administration of an industry, you wonder how our forefathers were able to make industries successful in past generations.</P>
    <P>I am not seeking that type of complication but I think the Minister might bear this consideration in mind, not making it an absolute condition but certainly getting it established in a very positive way in the manner of application and the basis of support so that there would be a very substantial chance that Irish experts or highly-trained Irish technical staff would have preferential treatment for appointment in industries supported as they may be under the terms of <Col N="656" /> these Bills by a very high degree of grant.</P>
    <P>I am not terribly enamoured of a grant policy unless there is some basic reason why the industry needs to be stimulated.  The only real purpose, in many of these industries at the moment, that I can see, is to be able to produce substantial, marketable and highly-competitive products for the general world market.  I cannot see in any subsection of, or emanating from these two measures, any directive towards developing industry to fill the lacuna in the market that is available to us generally in England.  I cannot see in this measure anything that will encourage the type of industry for which we have the raw material.  No matter what experts may say or committees may say, no matter what kind of verbosity is used about it, there is no practicality in an industry for which you bring in the raw material to be processed and then send back the product ultimately to compete against manufactured products in the country of origin of the raw material. We have too many such industries here.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should use what power he has in these Bills to try to ensure that the types of industry that will be substantially helped will not be industries which will be facing the ultimate prospect of competition against the country producing the raw material or which might find themselves in the position that the country supplying the raw material might, for competitive purposes, withhold supply at a vital stage in the company's development.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to get the Minister's perspective as to what the over-all picture is in relation to industry. I cannot see bonfires burning in Macroom, Skibbereen, Bantry or Clonakilty because of this measure, unless there is behind it a well of hope that, outside this concept of the undeveloped areas and aid to industry, the Government have a plan to finance food-processing plants, fruit-growing, box-making and to develop the timber potential in the forests in that area. Unless that is there, this legislation is crazy, because it is defeating the purpose <Col N="657" /> of the original Undeveloped Areas Act.  It is removing any carrot the Undeveloped Areas Act might have had to attract industrialists into that area.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy McQuillan, I do not believe the Government&mdash;particularly since their announcement yesterday about accepting the plan for developing the western areas, Kerry and West Cork&mdash;intend to abandon the search for a solution of the economic difficulties there.</P>

      <P>The Minister is well aware that the carrot has not been big enough to bring anybody into some of the areas the Minister and I would like to see them in.  I am not taking the Minister to task.  I do not blame the Minister for certain things not happening.  A tremendous effort has been made by the Minister's Department and other organisations to get industries in this area.  I would not blame the Minister for the failure because of economic circumstances, the difficulty of transport and the intake of raw materials.  The circumstances in relation to the earning capacity of an industry are the deciding factors in regard to the establishment of a factory anywhere by private enterprise.  I do not want the Minister to feel I am trying to needle him.  I am not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason I intervened was that so many Deputies seemed to suggest in their speeches that the differential between grants in the undeveloped areas and the rest of the country was gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I never thought that.  These measures will enable people to get grants more readily outside the undeveloped areas.  However, their industries may be very valuable and I would not like to stop them being developed.  The point I was making was this.  No matter what criticism we might make of these Bills, the Minister should be in a position to tell <Col N="658" /> us that, apart altogether from aid for the undeveloped areas, the Government had a plan to make money available for development there as distinct from any legislation by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I want to disabuse Deputy McQuillan's mind of the idea that this Bill, <i>per se</i>, could be the death knell of any district.  We would be doing the dog in the manager if we were to tell our people in the undeveloped areas: &ldquo;All is gone,&rdquo; when we know that, as a consequence of the Government's decision, be it for good or evil, there is a plan to try to pull together the potential of the western seaboard and places like Kerry and West Cork into some practical type of rural economy, to develop it and provide the people with a living in industries suited to their own districts.</P>
      <P>I would welcome without any equivocation whatever any development in industry that would provide employment. On reflection, the Minister might consider that the setting up of a separate company may not be the most expeditious way of dealing with the increased type of grant he wants to make available.  Inordinate delay can be caused through the establishment of the company.  If this Bill is to give assistance to industry, and if the employment potential is to be quickly increased, then the less cumbersome the machinery is made, the better it will be and the more effective will be the result.  Any effort of the Government to put one extra person into gainful employment is worthy of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading the Minister's speech, I was amazed to see his concept of employment potential <i>vis-à-vis</i> the legislation that went through here in connection with the fertiliser factory. There does not seem to be any reality in the number of people he expects to be employed for the expenditure of £1,000,000 under this Bill and the number to be employed for an expenditure of £7,000,000 on the nitrogen factory.  But there may be problems involved there in respect of machinery, technicalities and chemicals which are <Col N="659" /> not involved in the case of other industries.  Therefore, I shall not try to present the Minister with that type of analogy because it may not be sound.</P>
    <P>We hope the Bills will achieve the purposes the Minister has set out in his speech.  But he would want to be wary that some of the results of Foras Tionscal grants in the past will not emerge again and that we will not have factories for making bowling alleys taking up their tents and disappearing like Arabs into the night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some misgivings about this Bill and consequently I cannot welcome it in so far as I am a Deputy from an undeveloped area.  The implications contained in it lead me to believe that the Government have in mind the idea of abandoning the establishment of further worthwhile industries in the undeveloped areas, especially in the west of Ireland.  Some of the statements made by the Minister when introducing this legislation need clarification. Such statements as that which suggests that a two-thirds grant may be made available in exceptional circumstances need to be better defined, as would this statement: &ldquo;Where the board are of opinion that there are sound economic reasons why the industry could not be established in the undeveloped areas....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To my mind, that leaves a loophole affecting towns like Ballymote, my home town, where there is a population of 1,000 people and where the only industry is probably the railway station for exporting our youth to England.  I can be told, of course, there are sound economic reasons why a certain firm should not establish a factory there and that consequently the same firm may be given a higher grant, up to two-thirds of the cost, to establish an industry in an area other than an undeveloped area.  There is a loophole also in another statement by the Minister that Foras Tionscal have power to give higher grants in certain circumstances outside the undeveloped areas without any action on the part of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> I believe these statements will militate against the west of Ireland.  I agree there is a differential, but it may not work in favour of the western counties or the undeveloped areas as a whole.  For a start, the benefits available under this legislation are not big enough to entice industrialists into the undeveloped areas, since they might qualify for better facilities in other areas.  If the same concessions and advantages as were given to the undeveloped areas in the past are envisaged for other areas, including the east coast, it spells doom for the prospects of establishing any further worthwhile industries in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is logical to expect that if the Government are sincere about establishing industries in undeveloped areas, or even maintaining existing ones, grants for the undeveloped areas should be increased.  I have no objection at all to the giving of grants in respect of industries outside the undeveloped areas, but I think the differential should be greater, and in order to achieve that, the grants to the undeveloped areas should be increased. I have mentioned the problem of maintaining existing industries. As the Minister knows very well, our largest industry in Sligo is in jeopardy at the moment.  I do not intend to be critical about this because, as a member of the chamber of commerce in Sligo, I know the Minister has taken a particular interest and will do all he can in the matter.  However, if this Bill should have anything to do with the closing of that factory, in which the people of Sligo invested £40,000, I think the Minister will agree with me that it would be bad news for the west of Ireland.  On the wireless today I am given to understand, the closing of another west of Ireland industry was announced.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied the Minister knows all about the difficulty in Sligo.  Some hundreds of families will be thrown out of work and others in the town find themselves in a state of uncertainty.  I hope this Bill will not create more uncertainty in the west of Ireland where the people thought they had secure employment and now find they have not.  I know the Minister is doing his best in that matter but I must say I cannot welcome this Bill because I think it is a bit nebulous in relation to what will happen in the west of Ireland in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Undeveloped Areas Act was introduced with a view to giving employment to people in the west of Ireland and with the hope of stemming emigration.  It did some good, even if in some parts of the west emigration has not been stemmed to any great extent.  Particularly in my constituency of South Leitrim and North Roscommon, where there are a number of farmers living on small, uneconomic holdings, if something is not done to supplement their incomes by the provision of some form of industrial employment, they cannot hope to exist.  I must say I was surprised some months ago when the Minister for Industry and Commerce made an announcement that three other counties, Cavan, Longford and Monaghan, were being scheduled as undeveloped areas.  I could understand that action if something more had been done for the west of Ireland.  This Bill goes even further than the Minister's announcement in respect of the three counties mentioned.  It makes available to the whole country the same financial advantages as the undeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> People who live outside the underdeveloped areas seem to be of the opinion that there is an industry or a factory of some type or other in every town in the underdeveloped areas.  I want to emphasise here and now that that theory is completely wrong. Towns like Mohill, Rooskey, and others, all within a short radius of each other, have not as much as one industry.  The development committees of these towns were hoping to get industries and they felt that their turn had not come until the larger towns, such as Roscommon town and Carrick-on-Shannon, had got some industries.  I might mention that Carrick-on-Shannon has a rather small industry which is doing reasonably well and giving some employment.  We had experience of having an industry opened in Roscommon town last year and it, again, is doing well.</P>
    <P>The development committees of both those towns, and all other towns of that size, were hoping to get more industries.  This Bill, in my opinion, tends to crush their hopes somewhat. We certainly cannot hope to satisfy ourselves, despite what we are told, that this Bill will go any way further in giving those towns I have mentioned, which have no industry, an industry.  The only people who, in my opinion, will benefit from the Bill are those who live in coastal and other industrial areas.  Let us be quite honest with each other.  If an industrialist from within the country goes into the Department of Finance and examines the advantages to be got in the underdeveloped area and compares them with the advantages he would get outside that area from this Bill, you will find that his industry will move in the direction of Dublin, or as near as possible to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I honestly think that it will ultimately be of no advantage.  Like other Deputies from the Roscommon constituency, I was a member of the deputation who visited An Foras Tionscal during the month of November. We were members of a deputation from the Boyle Development Committee.  I must say we were received courteously by the officials, <Col N="663" /> and they explained the development measures in detail.  In my opinion, under this Bill, their chances of getting an industry have become less than before the Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say to the Minister at this stage that unless he makes a greater differential between the areas in the underdeveloped area and those outside it he will not tempt any more industries into that area.</P>

      <P>I think it would be wrong of me as a Corkman, and particularly as a Fermoyman, not to say how pleased I am that some commonsense has been brought to bear on this whole industrial problem.  I am a member of the Fermoy Industrial Improvement Committee.  We have for a long time been agitating that Fermoy and other towns in Cork should be brought within the scope of the Undeveloped Areas Act to the extent set out in this measure.  I think it only right and proper for me to say, on behalf of the Fermoy people who have for years and years been looking for industries of major importance, that we welcome the Bill.  While I sympathise with Deputy Gilhawley from Sligo-Leitrim, as one who worked in that county for four or five years and knows all the towns he mentioned and knows, as he does, that there is no industry of any importance in any of them, I thing the whole country should be on the same basis in this regard.  The people in towns like Fermoy are just as entitled to industrial projects as towns like Mohill or Boyle. It is for that reason I believe the Minister is looking at this whole problem at least in a more commonsense and broader way than previous Ministers for Industry and Commerce. I hope and trust that what he has in mind in the wider scope of this Bill will have the effects he suggests in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Before the debate adjourned last evening, two Deputies said something to the effect that the changed conditions in relation to the British application for membership of the European Economic Community should now cause me to think again about the introduction of this Bill. One of the purposes of the introduction of this Bill is to introduce, or should I say, legislate for a system of grants for adaptation purposes to enable existing industries to become more competitive in freer trade conditions. In so far as these two Bills provide for such grant assistance, I want to assure the House that, first, there was no question of rushing into a decision to provide such assistance, and, secondly, and more important, that there can be no question of relaxing the implementation of these Bills and the application of these adaptations because of the suspension of the negotiations for British entry to the Common Market. On the contrary, it is my belief now that there is even greater need to press forward with all our preparatory activities for freer trade.</P>
      <P>I am glad that, by and large, the Bills have received a welcome from both sides of the House.  In so far as there have been misgivings, they have come mainly from Deputies who represent constituencies in the areas that had been designated in this legislation as underdeveloped areas.  I want to say here and now that the main differential in favour of underdeveloped areas is not being removed. In cases where the maximum grants amount to £250,000, that maximum would have covered almost every grant that has been hitherto given to new industries established in the underdeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>I did not like to intervene in the course of remarks made by Deputy McQuillan and others while they were developing their arguments on the lines that this differential was wiped out. Having said that categorically, I hope that no further misconception of what these two Bills will do will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> A variety of minor criticisms of our grants policy, many of them completely unsustainable, were made during the course of the debate.  One of them was from a few sources, that the policy outlined in the Undeveloped Areas Act had completely failed.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  The recent reports, to which I referred when I resumed this debate, of An Foras Tionscal indicate clearly that the policy of the Undeveloped Areas Act has met with reasonable success. That the Government and everybody concerned would have wished for a greater degree of success is only natural.  We hope that the inducement of industrialists to those areas will continue under the amended Undeveloped Areas Bill now before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking yesterday evening on this motion, I referred to the fact that, as Deputy Tierney had pointed out, the Government, although now in office, are opposing the motion, when they were in opposition considered it was a very fine motion.  An almost similar one was introduced by Deputy McQuillan in 1956 and it was seconded by the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  When the vote took place Deputy Aiken, Deputy Blaney, Deputy Brennan, Deputy de Valera, Deputy Lemass, Deputy J. Lynch, the Tánaiste, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Smith all voted in favour of the motion.  During the course of the discussion, they made it very clear that they considered that the time had arrived to do away with special <Col N="666" /> charges for rural consumers who were being asked to pay these special charges.  In particular, the Taoiseach was very definite about it.  I do not think that this can be altered&mdash;or as was suggested yesterday evening&mdash;misquoted in any way.  His statement in the debate of 8th February, 1956, at Column 169, was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;So far as I am concerned I will give an undertaking that if ever again I become Minister for Industry and Commerce I will abolish it forthwith as unjustifiable and immoral.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was talking about the special service charge which the Minister for Transport and Power now tells us cannot be done away with.  He suggested that after the Taoiseach made that statement, he had another look at it and when he saw the ramifications it would have, he thought he was entitled to change his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That has all been dealt with.  The subsidies had gone at the time the Taoiseach &mdash; then Deputy Lemass&mdash;made the point.  It was a valid point.  Put back the subsidies and you can do away with the special service charge.  If the Taoiseach was right, then the special service charge should never have been put on, because when it was put on and while it was operating, subsidies were being paid and the Minister is aware of that.  Since the change of Government took place, there was nothing to stop the Taoiseach or his Government from changing the situation and saying: &ldquo;Now everything is as it was and we will do away with the special service charge.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course they did not do that.  The Minister for Transport and Power stated that a number of us voted against the motion at the time.  That is quite correct.  I want to get the facts straight.  It was a Government decision and whether we agreed or not, as the Minister is well aware, the Party decided how we would vote.  Since the Minister objects to that procedure, will <Col N="667" /> he remove the Party Whip tonight and allow a free vote so that we can see how the people in his Party, in favour of this action in 1956, will vote this evening, whether they will be consistent in that they, unlike other people in the House, will vote for something they think is right, or whether the Party Whip will come on and an effort be made by the Government to divide on the motion?</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister would have accepted the motion since it was not alone supported by the members of his Party but in fact was supported in such a way by the present Taoiseach that there was no other way out of it except to say: &ldquo;We cannot get out of this; we have got to abolish the special service charge&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points I wish to make.  I do not want to hold up the proceedings.  This has been discussed fairly fully.  First of all, while the Minister has stated that the ESB must see to it that the service given is paid for, that there is a reasonable return, I wonder how he or the ESB would justify somebody who has to get three or four poles and the necessary amount of wire put up to connect him with the line having to pay anything up to £2 bi-monthly charge over the ordinary charge?  Not alone will it be paid until the wires and the poles are paid for, the interest on the money spent paid off, labour and all the rest, but as long as that house exists and as long as ESB current is supplied to it, that charge must be paid.  If that is not, as the Taoiseach said, unjustifiable and immoral, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>The other important point is that the ESB officials&mdash;as has been said by a number of speakers&mdash;have been very courteous.  They discuss the matter and explain their point of view.  They write a very nice letter to you.  We have no complaint about that.  They always come back to the suggestion that this is how things stand, that there is nothing they can do about it.  It immediately goes back to the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister referred to the fact that the taxpayers were not <Col N="668" /> paying anything.  I do not know exactly what he meant because there is a State subsidy for rural electrification. Possibly the Minister has a private income from which he takes money which is passed along to the ESB and if he does not do that, it is taken in general taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstood me.  There was no subsidy for the current operating service of the ESB.  The subsidy covered interest and principal on the establishment of rural electrification, the capital service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that what you did say was that there was no payment from the taxpayer to the ESB.  You possibly might not have meant that but that is what you said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the script&mdash;I may not have spoken clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the script. The notetakers are very accurate.  We do not always get exactly what is said.  Perhaps it is just as well.  The position about the whole matter is that time and again over the years, this matter has been referred to by Deputies and in every case the Deputies speaking to the motion are able to make separate points and to refer to instances which they themselves know of people who have to pay charges which they should not have to pay.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that, as a result of legislation passed last year, everybody, with the exception of about 12,000 people&mdash;and again let me remark on a comment which the Minister made &mdash; because of how 12,000 people lived&mdash;I assume he meant because of where they lived&mdash; would be unable to get current at a reasonable charge and that, therefore, it was assumed they would not have a connection with the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not entirely agree with the Minister.  I can understand in the case of somebody who lives ten, 15 or 20 miles across the mountain away from the ordinary ESB connections, that it may be difficult to justify connection <Col N="669" /> at a reasonable charge, despite the fact that the then Deputy Lemass said that it was right that they should have these connections.  Even though I agree it might be difficult to connect them to the ordinary services, I still cannot see how the fact that those people, who are living almost beside the ordinary ESB connections, the people, across whose land the ESB lines are running, who live within half a mile of a village which is lighted by electricity, cannot have ESB current without a special service charge.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister seems to have got the idea that all those who are being left out are people who live in the back of beyond.  That is a matter which he and his Department must look into, and look into quickly.  There is a growing feeling of resentment that the people who live in the centre of an area which is serviced will find they cannot get a supply unless they pay an exorbitant charge.</P>
    <P>There is another type of person also left out&mdash;and I think it is one of the greatest scandals of the whole lot&mdash; that is, the person who builds a house in an area which is serviced by the ESB.  If that house had been in existence when it was originally being serviced, the owner would have got current at the normal charge, as all his neighbours did.  He builds a house in that area.  In spite of the fact that everybody else in the area has got the current at the normal charge, he is told he cannot have it unless he pays an exorbitant service charge.</P>
    <P>I have been reminded of the position of council cottage tenants, people who have had new houses built for them. The county council take sites where they can get them in a reasonably suitable place, and it is only after the houses have been built, after some of them have been wired at a cost either to the local authority or to the tenants themselves, that the ESB say they cannot have current unless they pay something which may appear small but which is in fact a high proportion of the wages paid to the people living in those houses.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression when <Col N="670" /> the motion was being introduced that we were pushing an open door, that the Minister would see the virtue of it because it had got not alone support in the lobbies but a volume of support from members of his Party and the Government before that and that we would have no difficulty at all in having the motion accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.  This is something which as stated by the present Taoiseach in 1956 must be a matter which would cost the ESB very little.  The reference was made again and again during that debate to the fact that it would cost only a fraction of the subsidy of £250,000.  This was stated by the Taoiseach who must have had his figures correct&mdash;a fraction of that figure.  If it were only a fraction of that amount, then the amount would be less now because the Government have included very many people then left out.  Would the Minister not consider that these people should now be protected?</P>
    <P>Reference has been made again and again by the Minister and indeed by the ESB to the fact that those who were &ldquo;outside the Pale,&rdquo; those who could not get current, could apply for a £10 subsidy for bottled gas.  That has been discussed at various levels and I have had communications from one of the agents of bottled gas pointing out what can be done.  I am aware that the bottled gas at the present time is a very economical way of lighting, heating and cooking.  I am also aware that if the present system of bottled gas had been introduced before rural electricity was introduced, we would not have rural electricity being developed in the way it is today.  You cannot run a radio or television on bottled gas.  For that reason, people will, if it is suitable, have everything else.  They will still want those amenities and they will be entitled to ask for them.  Is it unreasonable, in view of the fact that the ESB can now, at a nominal charge go to £75 towards the cost of the installation of electricity in a house, to ask why should the bottled gas subsidy be confined to a grant of £10?  If you are already using <Col N="671" /> bottled gas, you cannot take advantage of the £10 subsidy and if at some future date, you decide to instal electricity, you must return the £10.  If that is not a grant with strings tied on it in every direction, I do not know what it is.  Therefore, before the Minister <Col N="672" /> takes a hasty decision on this, he should go into the matter with the ESB and see to it that, perhaps, if not all, at least most of the people who could be connected at a reasonable cost will have that connection made as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In view of the far-reaching changes implicit in Ireland's proposed membership of EEC, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the conditions of membership, before being accepted, should be submitted for decision by the people by way of referendum.</P>
      <P>For many years now, the position here in Ireland has been that the Taoiseach has tried to lord it over political affairs generally and to suggest that he is the infallible, final arbiter of all matters relating to industry and business and political affairs generally.  In recent years, as his power has grown, so has his arrogance and so has his virtual claim to infallibility. Whenever he makes any statement now, it has virtually to be accepted, or else he brings into action all the overt and covert weapons at his disposal in order to eliminate opposition to his views.  In the past 18 months, he has attempted to steamroll through the country an attitude or a policy in relation to the economic pattern here which is a complete reversal of the policy which he has advocated for over 30 years, the policy of protectionism.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that he was forced to take this decision to advocate the removal of protection, the removal of tariffs which had been his favourite policy for so long, because it had been impossible for him to conceal from the public that far from being a competent or efficient or able administrator, or architect of a viable industrial arm for Ireland, he had in fact been a most disastrous failure and had been unable to conceal this fact from the public by virtue of two simple devices.  One was his failure to create an efficient industrial arm.  This has resulted in approximately eight per cent. to 11 per cent. people unemployed on an average over all those years.  In addition to that, anything up to between 750,000 people and 1,000,000 people have had to get out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the measure of his failure over the years but the failure was concealed from the public and for that reason he was able to go on as if in <Col N="674" /> fact he had been a successful Minister for Industry and Commerce and had created a viable industrial arm in this country.  Now the moment of truth for the Taoiseach came when he was faced with the decision of whether he would look for full membership or associate membership of the EEC, whether he would go in with the big boys or go into the junior school, as he saw it.  When the time came to look for membership of the EEC, it was quite clear to him that full membership was the important justification of his political virility.  It became that in his mind and for that reason he rejected any suggestion that he might consider the desirablility of associate membership with certain advantages &mdash;which I hope to outline later on &mdash;as opposed to full membership and the great dangers involved for our people, particularly in respect of the creation of avoidable unemployment which would follow from insisting on becoming a full member.  To him, our becoming a full member clearly would establish that Ireland had become an independent country, with an independent viable economy which could sustain any industrial or business opposition from even the most powerful concerns in Europe.</P>
    <P>In volume 197, No. 6, of the Official Reports, at column 923, we asked the Taoiseach whether we would look for associate rather than full membership of EEC and we suggested that Ireland was not economically ready for full membership.  The Taoiseach replied:</P>
    <P>I reject the implication in the Question that Ireland is an economically backward country, unable to assume the obligations of membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>This is the first question I ask the Taoiseach: does he still believe that to be true?  Does he still believe that we are economically able to assume the obligations of membership of the European Economic Community?  If he believes that, all right; let him get on with it and pursue his application in Brussels.  It is standing there in our name and it is an application for full membership.  He thinks we are capable of membership; he did only a <Col N="675" /> couple of months ago on 30th November, 1962.  I suggest he was bluffing then and I suggest he knew he was bluffing and that he was trying to mislead this House and the people.  The best proof of that is now that the British application has been completed. That was another line which he had, the undertaking he gave us that:</P>
    <P>When the negotiations with Britain have been concluded, it is expected that the negotiations with the other three applicants for membership will be disposed of quickly and will be completed about the same time.</P>
    <P>What is the present position?  What is the Taoiseach going to do about our application for full membership?  The British application has been dealt with and now it is up to the Taoiseach to show the country that he was genuine in his belief that we could seek full membership as soon as the British application was dealt with.  I suggest that that again was part of the Taoiseach's bluff which over the years he has succeeded in getting away with by creating a suggestion of efficiency.  Of course, he happened to be the one-eyed king in the land of the blind.  That was his position, but all the time he has been operating on the assumption that he would not be faced with this particular predicament and that he would be able to get in under cover of the British application, it having been accepted.</P>
    <P>It is rather like the story of the wren and the eagle and the wren saying that he could fly higher than the eagle and when it came to the test, the eagle to his amazement found the wren was a few feet above him.  How did it happen?  The wren went up in the tail-feathers of the eagle and that is what the Taoiseach hoped would happen, that he would be spirited in quietly behind the British application and that he would then be accepted as part of the whole British economic unit.  Now, he is faced with this moment of truth and in spite of the fact that the British eagle did not become airborne, he is faced with the position of either repudiating his former statement that <Col N="676" /> we were fit for full membership or looking for some alternative from of membership.  His difficulty now is that he cannot look even for associate membership because he was so short-tempered with the whole idea of associate membership that he does not appear to us to have given it any serious consideration.</P>
    <P>We have brought this motion before the House because it is quite clear from the Taoiseach's statement to the House that he intends to carry on with this bluff and continue with this idea that we should be in a position to seek full membership.  Quite obviously, he is hoping that the people's memory of his application and of his assertions about our ability to go in will fade away and that in time the people will forget that we ever looked for full membership and by manipulation of the communications system here which he so regidly controls, radio and television and newspapers and other media that he has at his disposal, he will be able to create the idea that he never in fact intended to look for full membership, and any arrangement that the British come to for their own salvation he will accept and become part of it and then the whole thing will be forgotten.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing factors in this whole campaign by the Taoiseach has been his remarkable success in hypnotising virtually all the political commentators, these self-styled and so-called economists with very few exceptions, the newspapers, the radio writers, the business men, chambers of commerce, European economic movements and all these organisations all over the country into believing this great mirage built up by the Taoiseach through his public relations officers that we were in a position to decide when we would go in, what we would do and so on.  We had to make, of course, some adaptations and then we would be readily accepted by General de Gaulle.  I do not think it rested finally with de Gaulle as far as we were concerned.  I do not think the decision would rest with him but would rest rather on the simple case of our position of political ineptitude and the fact that we could not be <Col N="677" /> accepted into a cartelised society of this kind with very high-level, highly-efficient industries and survive and, in our own interests, they would find it impossible to give us admission.</P>
    <P>We have only to look at the present position of trade to see what that position is: our decreasing exports, the decrease in national output, the fact that we still have a declining employment figure and substantial emigration. This is not a picture that we believe could fool anybody into accepting this community and saying: &ldquo;This is an efficient society which is ready to measure itself against, say, Belgium, West Germany, France or Italy.&rdquo;  I can only say it is the dream of a madman.  Anybody who faces those realities and says we could measure up on equal terms to these communities is obviously a person who lives in a fanciful world of his own.  It is, of course, an end-product of the Taoiseach's living in the virtually closed society which we have, an uncritical society, a society in which the person who does object is immediately slandered, hounded down or generally blackguarded by those whose actions he is merely questioning.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing things is the fact that the Taoiseach has been allowed to get away with this in a completely uncritical way by the main Opposition Party.  I can appreciate that Deputy Dillon has always wanted European association and so on but I believe, in the interests of democracy, he had a responsibility to put the other side of the question to the public and let them decide on its merits.  I cannot really expect the Taoiseach to do that.  It was not his job but I think the Leader of the Opposition had a responsibility to say: &ldquo;While what the Taoiseach says has certain merits, we believe there is another side to the picture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a good case for showing that, in fact, there would be very considerable unemployment as a result of seeking full membership, that is, seeking dismantlement of tariffs by 1967 or whatever it might be, rather than seeking associate membership and getting between 12 and 22 years for <Col N="678" /> tariff dismantlement and so allowing Irish industry to adapt itself.  I do not give two snaps of the fingers for Irish industry&mdash;I do not believe in private enterprise industry&mdash;but I believe there would be very great hardship imposed on the people if there were this sudden throwing open of our industries to this overwhelming competition from Europe.</P>
    <P>I believe this to be true.  This idea has been reinforced by the Government's findings in the CIO reports which I think make very gloomy reading but which, I think, expose better than anything else&mdash;even though they are not carried out as efficiently as they might be for reasons which do not enter into consideration now-the fact that Irish industry is very unprepared as it is at the moment for competition from Europe.  Two out of three of the reports so far published disclose that about 40 per cent. of those engaged in manufacturing industries will be declared redundant as a result of closures.  The various CIO reports tell this story.  In the boot and shoe industry, about 1,000 will go and in the pulp and paperboard industry, about another 1,000.  In the motor-car industry, there will be about 2,000, plus another couple of thousand in ancillary or feeder industries.</P>
    <P>While, as I say, two out of three reports show 40 per cent. redundancy, the third shows a closure altogether so that the figure of 40 per cent. was reasonable.  It could amount to anything up to 100,000 disemployed as a result of this decision.  That would cause fantastic hardship for many people and their families and I think it was an irresponsible action on the part of the Taoiseach to take that decision without trying to ameliorate it in some way.  That could have been done by seeking associate rather than full membership.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying, as Ministers have been saying: &ldquo;We will find work for these people or we shall have work for them.&rdquo;  If the Government believe that to be the truth&mdash;I do not think they do; it is a further part of their bluff&mdash;why not start practising? There are 63,000 unemployed at present and 23,000 had to emigrate last year.  The Government could start <Col N="679" /> practising finding work or alternative employment for those 86,000 people. Surely the Government cannot continue to believe they will get away with it and confound Abraham Lincoln's dictum: &ldquo;You cannot fool all the people all the time.&rdquo;  Do the Government believe that they can fool all the people the whole time?  I believe they have come to the end of that era of misleading people and miscalculating on their continued credulity.</P>
    <P>It can be demonstrated, and I shall take the opportunity of doing it in the fuller debate, that the Taoiseach has been concealing facts from the public, misleading the public, serving the people half-truths and giving them generally a mish-mash of wishful thinking which bears no relation at all to the facts.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the most shocking betrayals on the part of the Taoiseach was the decision to abandon military neutrality.  The first information we had of this decision was given in a New York paper, that as a result of our application for full membership, according to the Taoiseach, it was essential.  He had abandoned the policy we had over the past 40 years, a policy which had brought us prestige in the United Nations.  Indeed, it was the only time we had any kind of reputation in world politics.  But, suddenly, neutrality became a dirty word to the Taoiseach.  While the Minister for External Affairs, at one end of New York was advocating that we should not take sides in the Cold War and should not look for Polaris or any other kind of missiles, at the other end of New York, the Taoiseach was offering Ireland for all these appalling installations concerned with the extension of the Cold War.  This is the kind of hypocrisy that has done so much damage to the Irish cause.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to suggest at that time, in making this departure from our accepted policy over the years&mdash;a policy which had paid wonderful dividends and had given us a measure of prestige in the world&mdash;that he saw no signs of public opinion opposed to this departure.  This is not true.  At one meeting I attended, at <Col N="680" /> which there was a non-party type of platform, only half a dozen people in a room of 500 or 600 believed we should depart from neutrality.  We have the declaration of the Taoiseach's former leader, Mr. de Valera, an extraordinarily sane sort of comment at Col. 930, Vol. 122 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear to the House that so long as Partition exists there is no use talking to the Irish people about crusading for anybody.</P>
    <P>There were various other similar remarks to the effect that, so far as we were concerned, we were neutral, and that neutrality is and continues to be a national policy.</P>
    <P>In addition to that statement, there was a motion passed by the Trade Union Congress in Galway last June. In this they advocated two things: (1) that associate membership should be examined by the Government and, (2) that the Government should not take any other stand in regard to military commitments other than those involved in our membership of UNO.  These two statements are important&mdash;Mr. de Valera's from the prestige point of view and that of the Trade Union Congress from the point of view of its membership and its representation in the country.  But the Taoiseach simply pushes this aside and makes it appear as if there were no body of opinion at all opposed to his view.  In addition, he indulged in one of the most scurrilous witch-hunting campaigns I have ever known here in attacking people like myself and Deputy McQuillan because we oppose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Have you wakened up? Sorry to disturb your sleep.  Go back again.  He attacked us because we opposed this policy of the betrayal of our national policy over the years.  He then took up this stand that, because we were a 99 per cent.  Christian country and anti-Communist, we had to take this side.  O.K.  We have been a 99 per cent. Christian country since 1916.  Why did we not take sides in the Cold War?  It has been going on for 15 years.  Why did we <Col N="681" /> not join in the 1939-45 War?  Why did we not take sides with Hitler when he went into Russia to fight Communism? What have we been doing all these years?  Why did we suddenly waken up to this Christian mission we had in order to liberate Europe from this menace of Communism?</P>
      <P>What is your position now in this new departure by General de Gaulle with this suggested plan from the Atlantic to the Urals between himself and Mr. Khrushchev?  What are you going to do?  Are you still going into Europe?  General de Gaulle is the boss now.  It is he who will determine the future pattern.  Will you still look for full membership of an organisation which recognises as part of the organisation the USSR and all the satellites?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The Taoiseach has made the point that there is no need for a referendum because he discussed this matter in the last election.  That is not true; or if it is true, what did he discuss? He discussed full membership presumably, because that is what he had in mind.  He got a mandate from the people to go for full membership. Will he go for full membership?  What is stopping him?  He says we are economically and financially ready for it.  He says that he has a mandate to look for it.  The British negotiations are concluded.  What is holding up the continuation of the Irish application for full membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if the Taoiseach did not get his mandate for full membership, what did he get?  In fact, did he at any time in the general election &mdash;and I should be glad to hear any quotations he has&mdash;suggest that in addition to looking for full membership, he would look for the abandonment of neutrality?  Has he got a mandate for that?  We do not think he has.  We do not think he is right in most of his decisions, and we are in the very fortunate position of being able to prove him wrong on many occasions in the past 18 months.  He is not infallible.  He has made very <Col N="682" /> grave mistakes.  The only word to describe him is an international mug. He went to all these countries and he said these people received him with open arms.  They did nothing of the kind.  They were just being polite.  It was a case of ambassadors being polite to one another, of heads of State saying nice things to one another.  As I said earlier, the Ritz Hotel is open to anybody, but only the wealthy can afford to go in.  You can look for full membership if you like, and they would have no objection to our looking for full membership; but there is all the difference in the world between looking for full membership and getting it.  There is all the difference in the world in the Taoiseach conveying to the public, by this suggestion that he had been received with open arms, that we would in fact get full membership.</P>
    <P>He said here at Col. 1440, Vol. 197:</P>
    <P>Negotiations on our application have not yet taken place.</P>
    <P>  Then follows:</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne: Yet the Taoiseach is reasonably certain that we are getting in?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: That is right.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mullen: Without negotiations?</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne: When the Taoiseach talks about membership in relation to Ireland, is he talking about full membership?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: Yes, of course. That is all we are interested in.</P>
    <P>We would like to know if he is still going to look for full membership.  He tells us he has got the authority of the people to look for full membership, that he has got the country fully geared up to meet the stresses and strains of full membership when it comes.  It is his belief that it will not mean any great dislocation of employment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach attempted to create the idea in the public mind that this new EEC is going to remove trade barriers and to create a new Jerusalem <Col N="683" /> in Europe of which we should all be members.  There is no doubt that barriers are going to be removed by the member countries, but they are also going to be erected between the member countries and the third parties.  This is not an extrovert society; this is not an outward-looking society.  This is merely a re-grouping of the Belgian, French and, to some extent, German cartels, who want to have a good captive market in Europe in which to sell their goods at any price they like.  That is all this is.</P>
    <P>It is not a first step towards a World Government with which, of course, I would be in complete agreement. It is a cartelisation of European society directed against the poorer countries, the former colonial countries, the primary-producing countries who will not be able to send in their food and their raw materials in future.  The cartel is directed against the EFTA countries.  They tried to make an agreement with the cartel and they were told: &ldquo;No go; we want to keep this little ring to ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the British are excluded and I am quite satisfied we are excluded. Perhaps now we will not be too ready to praise them as we once did when we thought it would make life very hard indeed to be excluded from it. It will not now get such high praise from all the members of the Government or from the Opposition as it got when we thought we would get in, that we would become a member of this wealthy men's club.  Now we go to join the countries against which this cartel is directed, the primary-producing countries of Africa and the Middle East, countries which depended on Europe to buy their raw materials and with which they were building some sort of association for themselves.</P>
    <P>We, the movers of this motion, thought it was possible and more desirable that we should look for associate membership under which it would be possible for us to get the advantages the Greeks have got from such form of association.  There is no strict protocol about associate membership.  The <Col N="684" /> Greeks have been allowed access to the European Investment Bank to the extent of 25 million dollars, repayable over a 25-year period.  They have access to the advantages of the free movement of capital and of labour. They have also got special concessions for their growing industries so that it will be possible for them to give these industries protection which they would not normally get.  They also have access to such machinery as allows them, if they find themselves getting into any difficulties, to get help, should those difficulties arise.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear there could have been no objection whatever to Ireland looking for associate membership if we had to look for membership of the European Economic Community at all.  The only case Deputy Dillon strangely put up, and which was exploded today, was the suggestion that one must ultimately take full membership. That is not true and I think it is quite scandalous for the Leader of the Opposition to purvey that.  It is just not true.  There is no compulsion on a country to look for full membership at any time if it does not want to become a full member.  The great advantage we then saw from associate membership was the extension of the period for tariff dismantling from between five and seven years to a period of between 12 and 22 years and the added advantage of associate membership of not being forced to abandon our neutrality.</P>
    <P>As the Swedes foresaw, it is possible for a country to get associate membership and remain politically and militarily uncommitted.  One of the suggestions as to why we should look for full membership was that we wanted to make a contribution towards the Christianisation of Europe.  I should like to know what the Taoiseach now proposes when Europe has pretty bluntly told him they can get on very well without him and that they do not want his type of witch-hunting mentality in their organisation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said this was a wonderful opportunity for us to get into a colossal market, that if we could get into it, all our problems would be solved, as in the 30s, when he said: <Col N="685" />&ldquo;Raise the tariff barriers and all our problems will be solved&rdquo;.  Now he is saying: &ldquo;Pull the barriers into Europe down and all our problems will be solved; there will be unlimited prosperity, untold markets&rdquo;.  That is completely fallacious, because while the market in Europe represents a population of 170,000,000 the market which was available to us in various ways in the Commonwealth and in Great Britain represented 220,000,000.  If it were a simple matter of having a big market in order to create a lot of wealth, then the market was there to be exploited.  In fact, very few countries made any substantial inroads into this colossal Commonwealth market, despite the fact that they expanded their imports from time to time, as in the case of Pakistan and Australia, by nearly 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Again, there was not any doubt at all that while Britain and the Commonwealth found it important to get into that very big market, we must take Ireland with its population of 3,000,000 to Britain's 57,000,000.  We had access, with Commonwealth preference, to a market sufficient for our needs.  What did we do about it?  We have not made any serious attempts to drive the Danes out of the British dairy produce market and it is quite clear that where some of our industries are subsidiaries, we shall never succeed in driving out the parent companies in Britain.  It will be the same in relation to the other foreign countries who have started here.</P>
    <P>On this question of the greater market, the Taoiseach's solution is as untrue as was his suggestion in the 30s, that all we had to do was put up the tariff barriers and that all our problems would be solved.  There are many countries with small home markets who have created industries and, as in the cases of Switzerland, Sweden and Holland, have been able to solve the problem of the small home market. The basic weakness of our position over the past 30 years was the Taoiseach's partiality for the private enterprise capital system which as a result of exploiting the workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot <Col N="686" /> go into the question of private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a basic miscalculation and I am suggesting that again the Taoiseach is guilty of a basic miscalculation.  Whatever decisions he takes, as long as he retains this idea that it is possible to create a dynamic industrial arm here, using private enterprise capitalism, it will be bound to fail, no matter whether there are tariff barriers or not.  If the Taoiseach intends going ahead with his proposals in relation to the Common Market, we who are responsible for this motion submit that the proposal should be put to the public for their consideration. We say the public should be asked whether we should go into the Common Market, whether we should go in as a full member, involving the abandonment of our neutrality, or whether they consider we should look for associate membership.  We feel this should be the subject of a national plebiscite.  It would be possible for both sides of the question to be put and we would have a decision taken by the public rather than by a minority here in this House.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear, looking at the Taoiseach and his behaviour over the years, and recently it has been more exemplified by his arrogant impatience of any kind of questioning, that he completely dominates his own Cabinet. Consequently, what we really get here is the decision of an individual.  That is a very unhealthy development of democracy here, and if the Taoiseach or Deputy Dillon were seriously interested in the promotion of the whole idea of democracy in the country, then they themselves would be very disturbed by the fact that the country as a whole has been virtually shown that its political leaders were unanimously wrong in their gross miscalculation of the position facing us in Europe and the attitude of the Europeans to our application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be very brief.  It does seem to me that the value of Private Members' Time in this House is that Private Members, no matter how crackbrained their ideas may appear to be to the Taoiseach, or Government, will have an opportunity of bringing their views before the House and an opportunity of getting the responsible Minister to give the views of the Government with regard to those ideas.  Consequently, I feel that it is deplorable for any Minister or Government and, in particular, for the Taoiseach to adopt the attitude in relation to a Private Member's motion that he does not intend intervening or indicating the Government's views.</P>
      <P>So far as the motion itself is concerned, it is a great pity that Deputy Dr. Browne did not argue on its terms. He took the opportunity presented by this motion in the particular circumstances which exist at the moment of making a speech generally with regard to the Common Market and our position of preparedness or otherwise for it.  It does not seem to me that that is all the kernel of the motion.  The motion proposed is that the House should take the view that it is a question which should be submitted to the people in a referendum.  I just want to say briefly that so far as my Party are concerned, we have considered the terms of this motion and we feel that it is not a motion which should command the support of the House.</P>
      <P>I feel that if parliamentary democracy is to function here, it must function on the basis of Deputies representing their constituencies, representing the people and being prepared to shoulder the responsibility of coming to decisions with regard to matters of this sort that come before them.  It is true, whether Deputy Dr. Browne recognises it or not, that this country's application for Common Market membership was in existence at the time of the last general election.  It is true, whether Deputy Dr. Browne recognises it or not, that the views both of the present Government and of the Fine Gael Party with regard to that question were known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> I do not intend to say much more except that I was somewhat amazed at Deputy Dr. Browne's reasoning that when he was slating the Taoiseach about all sorts of things&mdash;and do not take me as defending the Taoiseach&mdash; he should say, in effect, that the tragedy of the position was that the Taoiseach was allowed to get away with it and that there was responsibility on the Leader of the Opposition to put the other side.  He gave an example of what the Leader of the Opposition should say&mdash;that we believe this, that and the other.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Dr. Browne is overlooking is that the Party, of which I am a member, would not believe the various things Deputy Dr. Browne suggested should be said by us.  The fact of the matter is that Deputy Dr. Browne is quite right in indicating that one of the major factors in Irish politics recently has been the moving away by the present Government Party from their old doctrine of isolation.  In doing that, they have to a very great extent become converted to the views preached from the Fine Gael Party consistently over the years, and I do not accept at all Deputy Dr. Browne's point of view that because the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party have suddenly decided that Fine Gael were right all over the years, Fine Gael should in turn turn turtle and start arguing on the premises which Fianna Fáil have now decided were false premises over the years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne has given voice to criticism of the Opposition for not tackling the Government more sternly with regard to this question of Common Market membership.  Our attitude&mdash;when I say &ldquo;our&rdquo;, I am speaking for the Fine Gael Party&mdash;has been made clear by Deputy Dillon, both inside this House and outside it. We believe that it is the duty of a responsible Opposition to act in the way the Fine Gael Party have acted and that so long as the Government were doing what we thought it was right they should do, there was certainly no obligation&mdash;anything but an obligation&mdash;on the Fine Gael Party to harass or embarrass them while we considered them to be on the right <Col N="689" /> road.  I do not want to initiate any other discussion in this House, as Deputy Dr. Browne has, to a certain extent, but I should like to finish as I started, by saying I do feel there is some responsibility on the Taoiseach to make, at least, a contribution to this discussion.</P>

      <P>In view of the seriousness the Taoiseach has helped to allow to develop, he should at this stage at least make an opening statement. Yesterday, during Question Time, I asked the Taoiseach if he was prepared to make a statement to the House on Ireland's position at the moment, arising from what had happened in connection with Britain's application for membership of the European Economic Community.  He told me that he would make a statement as soon as possible.  I questioned him further on whether such a statement would be made in this House. He refused to answer.  He took the opportunity last night, away from this House, to fire the opening shots in a campaign that would lead the public to assume that he has not learned any lesson as a result of what has happened in Europe over the past few months. He repeated in this House today his sneering and contemptible references to de Gaulle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is highlighted in two particular places in the daily papers, when the Taoiseach referred to the stratospherical politics that were being discussed and that he had no place in these.  There was only one intention in the Taoiseach's mind at that stage: to suggest that de Gaulle was up in orbit in the stratosphere in connection with the whole question of the Common Market.  I want to put it clearly to the Taoiseach that if de Gaulle was in that position, the Taoiseach was on the moon for the past 18 months and it is time that he came down to earth.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear now that, in so far as the Taoiseach is concerned, the entire blame for the collapse of the British case will be pinned on the President of the French nation.  That is the intention.  However, the Taoiseach must remember that at no stage did Britain really accept the full terms of the Treaty of Rome; at no stage was the question of the position of the EFTA countries clarified; at no stage did Britain get a guarantee that the EFTA countries would be brought into the Common Market, if Britain were accepted, although Britain had given a solemn promise to her partners in EFTA that she would not join unless they came in.  That has not been resolved.  No vital decision was taken in regard to the farming interests, to the farmers' position in England on the freeing of the European market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, Britain had got no guarantees for New Zealand, India or the other members of the Commonwealth, and when de Gaulle said, as I think he was entitled to&mdash;I am sure he said it privately to Mr. Macmillan&mdash;&ldquo;You have not got a mandate from the British people; you have lost five by-elections; it is quite clear the British <Col N="691" /> people are not behind the British Government&rdquo;, here we have a leader who, with 20 or 30 years' of shrewd political experience behind him, was not able to look across the water at Britain and see that there was no certainty at all that Britain was going in.  If we assume that he was studying the situation in Britain and that he had made a fair assessment, we can only assume that he, like Mr. Macmillan, was taking a gamble, too.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I believe this Government have been completely irresponsible in the indecent haste with which they pursued their application for admission to the Common Market.  Our application was in before the British application. I wonder do the public remember that our Taoiseach did not even wait for the neighbouring State, which he suggests at the moment takes over 75 per cent. of our produce, to make their formal application.  The Irish application was in beforehand.</P>
    <P>I think it must be brought home to the public, in spite of what Deputy M. J. O'Higgins said here now, that Fianna Fáil have come over to the Fine Gael way of thinking.  Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have argued that, so far as the farmer in Ireland is concerned, the European market is going to provide a wonderful opening for Irish produce and that it is necessary for the Irish farmer to get into the open market in Europe for agriculture where he will have, as they said, an open door for the produce of the Irish land.</P>
    <P>Let us see the position in 1938. Fianna Fáil went over to London and they made a trade agreement.  They came back here and blew trumpets about the wonderful bargains they got for the Irish farmer.  Fine Gael, here in this House, suggested that they would have done better and, in 1948, the inter-Party Government, led by Deputy Dillon, went over to London. They came back with a wonderful guaranteed market for Irish agricultural produce.  In 1958, we had the Fianna Fáil Government going over again and making a trade agreement <Col N="692" /> which affected Irish agriculture.  On each occasion&mdash;this is the point I want to make&mdash;the Irish farmer was told: &ldquo;We have brought back a wonderful bargain from Britain for you.  We believe the British market is a first class market and we ask you to support us as a political Party for the wonderful negotiations which we have made on your behalf and for the achievements we have won.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the position today?  Those two political Parties that competed with each other on the hustings in Ireland for the support of the Irish farmer, on the basis of the wonderful opening they got in Britain for Irish agricultural produce, are now saying that owing to depressed prices in Britain, we must get into Europe or the Irish farmer is lost.  We have, to-day, in Britain a market of 50,000,000 people.  In spite of the fact that in that market we have preferential treatment over the Danes, we are yet able to supply less than five per cent. of their requirements in pig meat and byproducts. The Danes are able to walk into Britain and beat us in that market. How are we going to beat the Danes in a European market when the barriers are down, if we are not able to supply more than five per cent. in a market that is wide open?  Where are we going to bring the drive and initiative to help us to get into an inward-looking community in Europe, and inward-looking they are.  There can be no doubt about it.  If the Government are in doubt about it, I shall give Deputy MacEntee's views on this inward-looking group.  Speaking on Saturday, 19th January, as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of January 21st, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Great opportunities are offered to those who are privileged to be members of the new European polity.  The events of the past week had demonstrated the majestic range of those opportunities by the very jealousy with which they were guarded and the extreme reluctance of some to share them with those who had come late to seek them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an assumption by the <Col N="693" /> Tánaiste that it is a tightly-knit group and that the cold, keen businessmen of Europe will not be impressed by the blue eyes of Deputy Lemass or the big smile of Deputy Dillon.  There was a market available to us in Britain for which we could not, in pig meats alone, produce more than five per cent. and we were trying to get into Europe where there was an open door.  The door might be open in Europe but the house was full because the European nations are almost completely self-sufficient in the products that Irish farmers produce.  The entrance was open but the room was full.</P>

Whether we agree or disagree with all their recommendations, we must all agree that they certainly did go out of their way to encompass as widely as they possibly could the various details of income tax law in so far as it affects not merely the nation as a whole, but the taxpayers individually. I appreciate the volume of work it threw on them and the volume of work it threw on the Revenue Commissioners, particularly at a time when PAYE was suffering, as any system just introduced was bound to suffer, from pretty substantial teething troubles.</P>

    <P>Apart from the broad principles dealt with in the Seventh Report of the Commission, there are an enormous number of small points of procedure, the clarification and the simplification of which would, without costing anything of any consequence in terms of revenue, ease the burden on the taxpayer and certainly oil the wheels by which the whole process is dealt with.  I do not propose at this stage to say any more on the general <Col N="695" /> headings in that report because I assume that either in the general Budget debate or on the Vote on Account, if the White Paper is published before the Vote, there will be adequate opportunity of discussing the taxation policy the Government will put before the Dáil in the light of that undertaking and those reports.</P>
    <P>Apart from the revenue, there are a couple of other matters in relation to other individual Votes about which I should like a little information.  The Valuation Office methods are not understood at all by the ordinary person.  The methods on which revisions of valuation take place may be entirely clear to the initiated but to those whom those decisions and revisions affect they are a completely closed book.  There should be a great deal more clarification and less hugger-mugger in relation to the revision of valuations.  It would be far better if the Valuation Office came out into the open in relation to their rent valuations and made the basis upon which they were justifying their decision much clearer rather than adopting their &ldquo;I do not like&rdquo; formula which nobody appears to understand. I want to make it clear I am saying that in relation to rent and not in relation to stamp duty or death duty purposes.  Under the two headings, stamp duty and death duty, the matters are perfectly understandable.</P>
    <P>I want to put it on record that I consider it, to say the least of it, unfortunate that when an undertaking is given in certain circumstances by a responsible official, that steps are not taken by the Minister to stand over that undertaking and to provide the means by which it can be implemented. When a responsible official gives an undertaking in good faith and when it is accepted in good faith by taxpayers, they have the right to expect that the undertaking will be implemented and that if the existing law does not allow of its implementation, the good faith will be adopted by the Minister concerned in that he will find a way of saying that justice is done in the individual case. <Col N="696" /> I regret to say that I am aware of a case in which that was not done, and which affected many people.</P>
    <P>Considerable anxiety has also been expressed by the farming community in relation to the Agricultural Grant as to whether the reduction made in that Vote this current year, 1962-63 is a permanent reduction or whether it was for one year only.  As I understand the legislation, it was for one year alone, but as against that, it may well be that while that was the form of the legislation, it was likely that in subsequent years it would be put in the original Book of Estimates and would not require the additional legislation of last year.</P>
    <P>The original Book of Estimates, I know, will be out some time soon but how soon none of us on this side of the House is able to tell.  In fact, when I asked the Minister the other day, he and the Taoiseach both reminded me of certain discussions that always take place at this time of the year before the publication of the book.</P>
    <P>The Votes we are discussing include not merely No. 6 itself, about which I will come back and say something in a minute, but No. 18 as well.  In relation to that Vote, I made my position and the position of my Party reasonably clear when this matter was discussed on 20th July, 1961.  We felt, and we are clear that the country felt, that in relation to the Shanahan Stamp affair, there had been bad bungling by the administration in that regard.  We felt, without in any way attempting to retry or rehear an issue in Dáil Éireann, which, I think, would be most undesirable, that the courts were not given the proper opportunity of expressing a verdict on the occurrences that had taken place because the framework of the position had been grossly mishandled.</P>
    <P>We all know that what occurred at that time was that the charges were not brought before the court in proper form and that, because they were not brought before the court in proper form by the Executive, acting through its appropriate officer, the courts were never given the opportunity they should have had fully and completely to pass <Col N="697" /> a verdict on these charges.  Many people in this country, and in other countries, who suffered because of what occurred in relation to that company, feel, and are entitled to feel, a deep sense of grievance against the Government, against the Executive that failed to provide that our courts here would be able adequately to judge, and to pass judgment, on the events that took place.</P>
    <P>I do not propose tonight to go back on the individual circumstances to which I referred on 20th July, 1961, except to say that, when speaking on the Law Charges Vote then for the previous year, the matters had not been fully completed.  Reading back over that debate now, and looking back now, and knowing now what we did not know then, it seems clear to me that the charges made by me, speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party at that time, were absolutely justified and it is the Government who must be held accountable for the fact they failed to fulfil their duty as the Executive in ensuring that the matter was properly before the courts.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to another matter, and to refer to it especially because of the power of the Minister for Finance, the function that is vested in the Minister for Finance under Section 112 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908.  Under Section 112, it is provided in subsection (1):</P>
    <P>Every company shall at each annual general meeting appoint an auditor or auditors to hold office until the next annual general meeting.</P>
    <P>The section goes on to provide in subsection (7):</P>
    <P>The remuneration of the auditors of a company shall be fixed by the company in general meeting....</P>
    <P>In the Adjournment Debate which, in the events that happened, took place before this debate was resumed, the Leader of the Opposition referred to an appointment that had been made of an auditor to one of the State-sponsored companies.  The State-sponsored company <Col N="698" /> is, of course, Irish Shipping, which has a capital of £11,000,000 in £1 shares; of these 11,000,000 shares, all but, I think, 11 are vested in the Minister for Finance.  Even the 11 that are not vested in him are vested in his nominees.  It is therefore clear beyond question, clear beyond challenge, beyond doubt, and beyond contradiction, having regard to the section of the Companies Act to which I have referred, that the appointment of the auditor to Irish Shipping lies and vests ultimately in the Minister for Finance, and in no one else.  The directors can, of course, of their own volition, if they so desire, bring to the general meeting of the company a recommendation that X, or Y, or Z be appointed auditors. But it is the shareholders at that meeting who vote on that issue and who decide, and it is the Minister for Finance himself who will be represented at that meeting and who will be asked at that meeting to cast his 10,900,000 odd votes for or against the proposition that may be put up.</P>
    <P>What has occurred?  I want to deal with this matter as dispassionately as I possibly can.  Some people take the view that when a professional person becomes a Minister, he should take his name off the notepaper of his firm. I want to make it clear now that I do not subscribe to that view.  In my view, a professional person is entitled, whilst severing his connection with the firm during the period in which he is a Minister, to retain his connection with the firm so that his business will be there for him to go back to after his term of office as Minister has terminated. I, therefore, want to make it perfectly clear that, so far as I am concerned, I make no charge whatsoever against the Minister for Justice for retaining his name as a partner on the notepaper of the firm of which he was a member prior to the time he was appointed Minister.  But, if a member of a professional firm does that, it is by his own volition that he does it and he is equally bound to ensure, when he does it, that certain other things are done.  He is equally bound to ensure that, by retaining his name there for the purpose of ensuring that he has a business to go back to, that retention of that name not merely is <Col N="699" /> not used for the purpose of getting Government business but that his firm will not, in the public interest, take any Government business during the period in question.</P>
    <P>The option and the choice that was made in relation to this matter was an option and a choice that was made alone by Deputy Haughey when he became Minister for Justice; and he was, if he so wished, entitled not merely to sever himself from the work of the firm but to sever himself additionally from all possible connection with the firm.  Of his own choice and of his own volition, he decided not to do that.  He, of his own choice and of his own volition, decided that he would retain his name, even though he was a Minister, on the notepaper as a partner in the firm.</P>
    <P>When a person does that, there is a strict obligation on him not merely to do his utmost, and on his colleagues equally, as members of the Government, not merely to do their utmost, but to ensure that in the national interest and in the interest of public life as a whole, that firm does no Government business and is not remunerated for the doing of Government business.  As I said, I do not know what transpired between the Minister for Justice and his colleague partners.  That is his affair; that is their affair.  But I do know that the Minister for Finance is the person who holds the key in his own hand, because of that section of the 1908 Act which I have quoted, because of the fact that he has over 10,000,000 votes out of the 11,000,000 votes that must be cast at the general meeting of the company, and if there is anything wrong&mdash;and I suggest that it is wrong for a firm that holds out a member of the Government as being one partner &mdash;the blame must rest on one person, and one person alone; the blame must rest on the Minister for Finance as the responsible member of the Government who has not taken the appropriate steps to ensure that abuse will not occur.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping will be holding another general meeting.  The directors of Irish Shipping know that they are <Col N="700" /> the creatures of the Minister&mdash;and I use that word in company parlance, not in any other way.  They know they have to account to him, that he has the right to remove them at will.  They know that he has the voting power to use at the general meeting of the company, and they know, or must know, that they could only go ahead with such course of action&mdash;which has shocked the business community living in Dublin&mdash;if and because he, as Minister for Finance, stands over it and approves it.  It is clear, therefore, that the excuse given by the Taoiseach before Christmas will not wash.</P>
    <P>The excuse made by the Taoiseach that the directors did this on their own, without reference to anyone, is not true, or if it is true, can be corrected at any minute by the Minister for Finance.  It is well known to the Minister and he will, I am sure, have it confirmed, and I suppose from his own business knowledge equally he knows that it is not an uncommon thing for shareholders in special circumstances to reverse the decision of directors, if they feel their directors made a wrong one.  It is therefore for the Minister and the Minister alone at this stage to deal with the matter and to assume and to act on the responsibility that is vested in him.</P>
    <P>We are coming very near to the time at which there will be a Vote on Account and in the circumstances therefore a debate on the Office of the Minister for Finance at this time is perhaps not quite the same as it would be, say, if this had been taken up as originally planned in October.  But we must, now that we are discussing this, advert to certain economic signs which we can see around us.  It is only ten days or so since the first provisional trade figures for 1962 were announced, announced showing a deficit for the first time in history of £100,000,000 as a balance of trade deficit in an ordinary situation.</P>
    <P>One would perhaps not mind a deficit of that size if one could point to a specific cause or reason for it during the course of the year, but perhaps the worst feature of that trade deficit was the fact that it was being accentuated so much in the last three <Col N="701" /> months of the year, October, November and December.  It was that trend that was then showing, of heavily increased import excess, that makes us wonder at the present time whether it is one that is likely to persist in 1963, and if so, to see exactly where it is likely to lead us.</P>
    <P>We have not got the up-to-date figures of the breakdown of those trade figures for the latter months of the year and therefore we do not know how much of that increased import excess is due entirely to the import of capital goods or whether it is an excess that arises because consumption has outrun production.  One of the difficulties with which we are faced here is that, with the best will in the world, the statistics we receive are to some extent pretty old by the time we get them. That is not in any way a criticism of individuals or the system that exists.  It may be because Ministers for Finance in the past&mdash;and I accept responsibility with the present Minister, if that is the case&mdash;have not given them sufficient staff.  It may be that traders do not get in the details of their invoices as quickly as they might, but the result is that the breakdown of the causes of our trade deficit is not known to us as quickly as we might wish.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is one thing that is perfectly clear, that is, that the debt creation by the Government in the past nine and a half months has been running at a higher rate than ever before. Such a high rate of debt creation as there has been is bound to create some import excess.  When it is of the rate at which it is now running, and when the import excess is of the rate which we have seen, there is a very special responsibility on everyone to ensure that the debt being created is being created for worthwhile productive projects.</P>
    <P>In the period from 1st April, 1962, to 19th January, 1963, the above-the-line deficit this year is just £20 million &mdash;£19,889,000 to be exact.  Last year, it was just over £13 million.  The below-the-line issues this year, after deducting receipts, show a deficit of some £15 million or something over £1 million more than last year.  When <Col N="702" /> we add these two together, it is clear that the total net debt creation by the Government in the period from 1st April, 1962, to 19th January, 1963, this year, is £35 million and last year it was £27 million, an increase of some £8 million.  In addition to that, there is some £3 million less in the Exchequer. We can therefore see clearly that in so far as the trade deficit is concerned, the Government have added fuel to the flames to the extent of £11 million this year.</P>
    <P>Without a breakdown of how that has been expended in relation to productive enterprise and without, on the other hand, the breakdown of how the import excess has been created, by capital or consumer goods, it is not possible to pass judgment on whether the action taken was wise or not, but it is quite clear the action that has been taken certainly has had the result of pushing up the import trade excess. It is a peculiar thing that in the heightening trade excess in 1962, our net external currency reserves have, over the whole system, been increasing and it must therefore be a matter for some conjecture at least as to how two things that are in themselves diametrically opposed have been operating and running at the same time.</P>
    <P>We have not yet received the January bulletin of the Central Bank, but by and large, taking it that the trend in our external reserves evidenced in the October issue will remain the same, we are bound to come to the conclusion that there is something here which needs very much explaining indeed.  In the ordinary way, with a rise in the excess of the trade balance, one would expect a reduction on external account to pay for that excess. The reduction in external balance might perhaps be made on the Departmental side, on the Central Bank side or on the commercial banks side, but taking all three as one unit, an import trade excess rise such as has taken place would normally mean that there would be some reduction in our external assets.  It might not be so if our invisible receipts were increasing, but so far as current invisible receipts during 1962 were concerned, I do not think anybody will <Col N="703" /> maintain they were substantially higher than in the preceding year.  Some people may maintain they were slightly more; most people, I think, will say that they ran about the same figure or perhaps even tourist trade last year might show some decrease in net return.  But it is quite clear that it cannot be on the ordinary invisible current receipts that the explanation can arise in respect of this curious phenomenon of an increase in external assets at the same time, apparently, as we have to pay more for external trade imports.</P>
    <P>There are a certain number of reasons which might account for the phenomenon and I invite the Minister for Finance either to affirm that the reasons I give are correct or to demolish them, if he disagrees with them, and provide himself instead the reasons which he thinks account for this quite extraordinary situation.</P>
    <P>One explanation would be that a large sum of money had come into the country for the purchase of land by foreigners.  The Government say they are aware of the amount that has been so introduced into the banking system and that they are therefore aware of the amount that would be available under that heading.  A second source of this additional supply of external assets would be the underwriting and financing of hire-purchase concerns in Ireland in so far as that would be done by external companies.  I think it is undoubtedly evident from the Central Bank reports that there has been some substantial inflow in that respect but nothing like enough to explain the increase on its own.</P>
    <P>There would be, in addition, the money that might have come in from the industry started here by foreigners, industry that has started here because of the drive for foreign industrial participation initiated in 1956 and carried on since then.  Again, in that respect, while the amount would be noticeable, it would be nothing like the amount required to explain the discrepancy.  Also, perhaps, there would be some possibility of a sale abroad of the external assets held by private citizens.  Private citizens who <Col N="704" /> hold sterling assets in the shape, shall we say, of British industrials or other industrial shares in the sterling area can dispose of those without specific permission.  In the dollar area, of course, that permission is required from the Minister's Department, either direct or delegated through the banks.  Therefore, for sales in the dollar area, there would be no difficulty in knowing the exact details.  Even in relation to sales of sterling securities held privately abroad, I imagine it would be possible for the banks to give the Minister information that they saw evidence&mdash; not individual cases, as they would not be allowed under any circumstances to divulge these&mdash;of a trend that would suggest there had been some inflow of external reserves in that way.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask the Minister does he feel that there has been any such inflow?  If I might digress completely for a moment to return to the Income Tax Commission report in one aspect, may I say that although we are all agreed that income tax evasion may be stopped, we want to be quite sure that in stopping it, in relation to the section which deals with disclosure of bank deposits, we do not merely drive deposits out of the country to another country where individuals can place money on deposit without disclosure. The remedy in that case would be far worse than the disease and, personally, I would take issue with the Commission's report on that subject because we would undoubtedly get the worst of both worlds if that recommendation about bank disclosures in that case was adopted.</P>
    <P>If all the reasons I have given do not appear to the Minister as adequate reasons or if the Minister feels that, even added together, they are not enough, there remains one other possibility.  Personally, I have not, and nobody has except the Minister himself, access to the confidential information upon which is is possible to form a final judgment but it seems quite clear that the combination of all those headings is not enough to account for the increase in reserves at the same time as there has been this heavy increase in our import trading excess.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> I believe that there is a fifth cause and that the fifth cause is hot money. There has been, I believe, during the past year a substantial inflow of hot money.  External subscriptions last year and this year to the national loans are, perhaps, some evidence of the existence of that hot money and of its being brought here.  If that explanation exists, if there is that inflow of hot money to any substantial degree, we must face the fact that what we have been doing in the past year is existing for current consumption needs on capital moneys placed here fortuitously and which might go at any time.  If that is so, those moneys might move out at any time without notice and, let me add, without justification.  Then we would be building an import trade excess of the size which we built in 1960 on a foundation of sand that would one day vanish completely and we would find ourselves in a far worse position than we had ever been in before.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister alone, with the confidential information available to him, who must be in the position of being able to make the final judgment in that respect.  But those who are endeavouring to assess the evaluation of these two opposites&mdash;the rise in trade excess and the rise in trade reserves&mdash;want to hear from the Minister some authoritative explanation of what has occurred, so that they may know exactly where we stand and may be assured that the trend is not one that could vanish overnight and that could mean that we would find we had been living on capital without appearing to, for the purpose merely of ordinary consumer needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention a matter I have referred to previously.  It states here that the Taoiseach's salary is £3,000 and that his secretary's salary is £3,011.  We have that type of contrast right down along the line.  The Minister for Finance has £2,000 but his secretary has £3,668.  I cannot understand how a secretary can get nearly double that of the man himself.  I suppose I would be justified also in making some reference to the salaries of Deputies.  Looking around the House, one sees a <Col N="706" /> handful of people.  The main reason for that is that the average TD knows his salary is equal to £9 a week.</P>

It was made an order of the House, but it was made before Christmas and nobody could expect you to remember it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies make £1,000 a year and the income tax people have agreed that the first £520 should not be taken into account in assessing income tax and that a TD needed £450 to keep himself and his family; in other words, £9 a week.  It is as well that the public should know of this.  Fortunately, 99 per cent. of Deputies have other means.  That is the reason there is such a poor attendance here.  The average TD puts his own business first and the business of the State second, whereas it should be the other way around.  It is as well for everyone to know why they will not attend.  It is because they cannot subsist on £9 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that when a TD gets his £20, he has to pay a lot out of it.  He has to pay phone bills. He may be knocked up a hundred times a week, but he cannot ask the person for 3d. for the phone bill.  If he did, he would not get a vote.  He also has to travel around a good deal. He has to attend functions and give subscriptions.  He is bawled at everywhere he goes.  He is obliged to pay for entertainments.  It is not a question of his desiring them; he is obliged <Col N="707" /> to pay for a certain amount of entertainment.</P>
    <P>I want to bring it home to the Minister that, unless Deputies had other means, they could not carry on.  If the Minister wants to have a decent attendance, he will have to try to interest people to come along and devote their time to the business here. A suggestion has been made that the quorum be reduced in order to save appearances.  All last year we had bells ringing because there was no quorum.  If the Minister considers the payment of people who have not a business or additional income but who want to devote their time to the work here, then he may get a respectable number to attend; but so long as he takes the view that a smaller quorum is the answer, the numbers present will become fewer.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants these people to come in, he should not expect them to live on £9 a week.  The average labourer has that and the average tradesman can make up to £20 a week. The great difference between a TD and the average citizen is this: What the TD gets is not his own, while the other citizen can pocket his money and does not have to give a smoke to anyone. There is a cowardly approach to this matter.  The public are ignorant of the facts.  I think the attitude of the Minister and of some of the leaders of the Opposition is: &ldquo;We are all right. We will not create any awkward points.  Let the small fellows fry.&rdquo; I am not suggesting that the House should be all professional; but it should be half and half.  I do not want about a dozen professionals and 120 business people, who only show up when there is a division and they are tipped off to be here.</P>
    <P>I know I can be misrepresented. Even though it is difficult for me to do so, I am making this case on behalf of those who may yet be TDs.  I want to see poor people coming in here and giving their time without doing what Murphy had to do: pack it in and go back on the dole, where at least he knew the little he got would be his own.  I made this protest before and I now make it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that No. 18 relates to law charges, and law charges cover the salary of the Attorney-General from his part-time work on behalf of the State.  This is not the first time I have made reference here to the work of, and the terms of appointment of, the Attorney-General. I dislike very much doing so.  It is not a pleasant matter at any time to have to criticise the activities of any individual who is not in this House.</P>
      <P>However, back in 1957, when the former Taoiseach, who is now President, took over the office of Taoiseach and when the Cabinet was being formed, he nominated and had appointed by this House an Attorney General in a part-time capacity at £3,000 a year.  I raised the question of the part-time appointment with the then Taoiseach and suggested that a high and responsible office like that of Attorney General should not be on a part-time basis.  I said I had no doubts whatsoever about the integrity, ability and character of the individual he had appointed but that I felt, in principle, it was wrong that such an important office should be part-time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The then Taoiseach agreed with me that it would be highly desirable to have the occupant of that important post on a full-time basis.  He agreed also with me that he had an arrangement with previous Attorneys General that they would not do private part-time practice while occupying that post.  In 1957, the person who was appointed had already, on a previous occasion, held the office of Attorney General and on that occasion the Taoiseach admitted in the House that he had carried out his appointment and the functions appertaining to it on a full-time basis, that he did not engage in private practice during that <Col N="709" /> former period of office.  But when he was reappointed in 1957, the Taoiseach informed me in the House that the Attorney General was no longer prepared to act on a full-time basis and that in those circumstances the Taoiseach decided the office would carry an emolument of £3,000 and the work would be part-time.</P>
    <P>It was agreed it was not a desirable situation that a man who was to act on behalf of the public, as a public watchdog, who would, in the public mind, be there to protect their rights and interests, should spend part of his time in an official capacity and part of it in private practice.  The position is that when members of the Government are appointed, if they happen in their private capacities to be members of the legal profession or to hold any sort of big appointment, they must sever their connections with whatever offices they had prior to becoming Ministers, the reason being to avoid even the suspicion or the danger that Ministers could be pressurised into taking steps or engaging in activities which might be considered incompatible with high offices of State.</P>
    <P>If it is considered undesirable, or illegal, I might say, for a Minister to take part in private practice outside the House while he is a Minister, I cannot understand why the same conditions should not apply to the Attorney General who has an equally responsible job and who is appointed on equally high terms by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons given by the then Taoiseach to me as to why he did not appoint the holder of that office on a full-time basis was that he could not get anybody to take the job at the salary offered on a full-time basis; in other words, that there was no man of standing in the profession in the country who was prepared to accept it at a salary of £3,000 a year.  If that were true, this House would be only too anxious to facilitate the Taoiseach and give the increased salary the applicant demanded and considered right for him to get in his office as Attorney General on a full-time basis.  I do not think this House would raise any difficulties at all, in <Col N="710" /> view of the importance attached to that high office.</P>
    <P>The object of this House in demanding that Ministers sever their connections with private practice is that they will be kept out of temptation through not engaging in lucrative private practice, if they are in the law, but unfortunately, so far as this House is concerned, rightly or wrongly, we have the position that a man who occupies the part-time post of Attorney General can engage in private practice, can spend perhaps the greater part of his time in private practice and can, in the eyes of the public, appear to spend most of his time in private practice, with consequent deterioration of affairs over which he is alleged to have control as Attorney General.</P>
    <P>There would appear to be evidence sufficient to justify my criticism when we see the number of occasions when the State have failed in efforts to prosecute people in the courts, prosecutions that were brought through the Taoiseach's nominee, the Attorney General, and it has been stated publicly, and has not been denied, that the cases concerned were badly presented, badly prepared.  If those cases were badly presented and badly prepared, where does the blame lie?</P>
    <P>There is only one person responsible for the initiation of the prosecution to which I wish, above all, to refer&mdash;the Singer case&mdash;and the cost of that to the country was fantastic.  We all know that the individual concerned is sunning himself in far distant places while an unfortunate who was drawn into his web was sent to jail.  It is openly stated that that case was badly presented. I put it to the House, and I want an answer, that one of the reasons for that state of affairs was that the man who should have presented that case and prepared it carefully, the Attorney General, was too busy in his private lucrative practice to do his job as Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer in any detail to matters that have come to our notice through the courts, but I mention the Singer case in passing and shall leave it at that.  There is another case which, in my opinion, is of far greater importance, one which I <Col N="711" /> already raised here on a number of occasions during the past 12 months.  I refer now to the case of an insurance company which deals in the selling of industrial policies; in other words, what are known down the country among the rural population as burial policies, where the son or daughter in a house takes out a policy on a father or mother in order to cover the funeral expenses when he or she dies.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of thousands of such policies in existence all over Ireland and last year an individual down in County Galway had a number of such industrial policies with a certain company.  He found that after paying in approximately £1,200, all he could get out when the policies were paid was £600 in settlement.  He felt there was something unjust in the insurance business, that there appeared to be what to him was a case of a company taking money under false pretences and that man went to court. The case went to the High Court and the President of the High Court found that the insurance company in question was guilty of illegal practices.</P>
    <P>The House may ask what this has to do with the Attorney General.  This is the point: one of the senior counsel defending that insurance company was the Attorney General in his private capacity.  Here we had the case about which I expressed fear in 1957, the danger that the Attorney General, being part-time in such a high office, might bring that high office into discredit if he engaged in private practice.</P>
    <P>In this House, a question was asked of the Minister for Industry and Commerce about this particular company which had been found guilty in the High Court of illegal gambling practices.  On 24th May, 1961, Deputy Dr. Browne and I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce:</P>
    <P>Whether he is aware that a great number of people, particularly amongst the poorer sections of the community, are victims of exploitation in the assessing of payments from industrial assurance policies and, if so, whether he proposes to take any action to stop this most <Col N="712" /> reprehensible practice on the part of the insurance companies so engaged.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, Dr. Hillery, replied:</P>
    <P>I do not know what practice the Deputies have in mind.  If they will furnish me with particulars, I will have the matter examined.</P>
    <P>I do not want to quote or detain the House.  The Minister went on to say after cross-examination and pressure by Deputy Dr. Browne and myself that he had information about a certain case and that he was pursuing inquiries.  He could not give any further information on 24th May.  To remind him, he was further questioned on 30th May, 1961.  I quote from column 1022, Volume 189.  He was asked if he had</P>
    <P>completed his consideration of the individual case of industrial assurance referred to by him on 24th May, 1961, and, if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    <P>He replied:</P>
    <P>I have not yet completed my consideration of this matter.</P>
    <P>He went on to say it was the only case of its kind.  The Minister was further questioned on 7th June and on this occasion the Minister for Transport and Power replied.  The question of 7th June is as follows:</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne and Mr. McQuillan asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has completed his consideration of the individual case of industrial assurance referred to by him on 24th May, 1961, and again on 30th May, 1961, in which the President of the High Court, on Monday, 15th May, 1961, held that a number of industrial policies issued by the New Ireland Assurance Company, Limited, were illegal and in a reserved judgment directed the repayment of the premiums paid on eight of the policies; and, if so, what action he proposed to take in the matter.</P>
    <P>Mr. Childers replied:</P>
    <P>I have completed my consideration of the matter.  The Insurance <Col N="713" /> Acts provide that an Assurance Company which contravenes or fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Acts shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Then he went on to say the significant thing:</P>
    <P>There is, however, a time limit for the prosecution of offences. Proceedings for an offence may not be commenced more than six years after its commission.  It would appear from the particulars reported in the case referred to by the Deputies that the policies in respect of which the High Court made a declaration rendering them null and void were effected outside the time limit.</P>
    <P>There is no statement there that the policies were not illegal.  The Minister accepted that the company acted wrongly, but added that &ldquo;the time limit was such that we are barred in law from taking action.&rdquo;  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>I am taking steps to secure that the seriousness of effecting policies which do not comply with the provisions of the Insurance Acts will be brought to the notice of the insurers.</P>
    <P>There was a bit of a hubbub on that and in order to clarify the matter, the Taoiseach was asked whether he would do anything about it.  The Taoiseach of course refused to accept the implication in the charges I made, that it was wrong for the Attorney General in his private capacity to defend a company where there was the slightest doubt about the company's integrity.  He said there was no imputation on the company at all and that so far as the company was involved, it was the company's servants who were concerned and that the company itself, moryah, could do nothing about it. The judge pointed out that it was the responsibility of the company to know what its servants were doing.  We know that no insurance agent carries insurance policies or conducts business unless the O.K. comes from the people who run the company.  That is all I wish to say about the insurance company itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> Here we had a case where the Minister agreed that if this time lag of six years were not there, that company was liable to prosecution for a breach of the law.  I would like to ask the House who would initiate the prosecution. Is it not a fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would, through the Attorney General, take the necessary steps to prosecute this company for its illegal practices or for breaking the Insurance Companies Acts.  Could anybody tell me then how the Attorney General could reconcile himself to the position that on the one hand, in his private capacity, he would be defending that company and in his public capacity, paid by the State, would be prosecuting that company?</P>
    <P>Is that not a Jekyll and Hyde position for the unfortunate Attorney General to find himself in?  I think it is unfair to the holder of that office to put him in that position.  I am not making any charges whatever against the Attorney General and am not questioning probity or anything, but I think it is irregular to put the Attorney General in the position that he is defending in court a company, or a group of people, who are found to be guilty of breaking the law, when he should be the very man who, in the public interest, should be pursuing them and keeping an eye open to see that the rights of the people are protected.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of thousands of people all over Ireland hold insurance policies.  I have had thousands of letters from people who paid £40, £50 and £90 for these policies and got back £15, £20 and £25.  These are not big business people but unfortunate people in rural areas who have nobody to protect their rights and who are depending on the Attorney General in his official capacity to stand up for them.  They see him in his private capacity defending a company which was robbing them.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell me that the company in question appealed the decision of Mr. Justice Davitt in the High Court to the Supreme Court.  I know the Minister's defence and he will say that the decision of the High <Col N="715" /> Court was reversed.  I want to make it clear that in the Supreme Court a number of decisions made in the High Court were reversed but not all of them.  There were about eleven charges and on six or seven, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the High Court.  That does not take away from the fact that on a number of policies the Supreme Court upheld the verdict of the High Court. In my opinion, even though they did not uphold it, there were strong doubts about the whole affair, especially when a High Court could find as it did, and there was a strong doubt everything was not in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Surely the Attorney General should not find himself on the doubtful side when the public interest is at stake? I feel strongly, and a number of people in this House and outside it also feel strongly about it.  They decided that the only way to deal with it was to put down a motion on the Order Paper calling on the Government to restrict the Attorney General from supporting this company in its appeal to the Supreme Court.  That motion has been on the Order Paper since the time the first case went to the High Court.  The motion was put on the Order Paper and in spite of that, the Attorney General, in his private capacity, went along and spoke for and defended this company again in its appeal to the Supreme Court.  The only possible way to handle a case of that kind is for the Government to put the occupant of that post on a full-time basis and prevent any holder of the post from acting in a private capacity.  I am not going to question or criticise the individual himself.  I do criticise the Government who allowed that position to happen and allowed such an office of high trust to be left under a cloud of suspicion.  We have, on the one hand, his lack of interest, his lack of determination, his lack of work in the pursuit of major cases in court on behalf of the State and on the other, his wonderful interest in his own private practice where he is able to help to make ends meet in a big way.</P>
    <P>The reason the motion to refer back <Col N="716" /> this Estimate was tabled was to give the House an opportunity of expressing its opinion on this issue: Is it right for the Attorney General, in his private capacity, to be allowed to appear in cases where it is quite clear that, in the public interest, he should not be seen except on the side of the State? I think that the only possible way we can help to prevent this arising where future appointments are made is to have an expression of opinion in this House disapproving of what has taken place.  I propose, when this debate concludes, to put this matter before the House for consideration.</P>

      <P>As well as the matters of detail raised by Deputy McQuillan here, this Estimate gives an opportunity to discuss some of the broader aspects of Government financial policy.  I wish to do so very briefly. The first matter to which I wish to refer is the problem&mdash;and I believe it is a real problem&mdash;of the relationship between the Government and the commercial banks, in particular the power of the Government to influence the lending policy of the commercial banks.

      <P>That will be taken separately.  I should like to deal, first of all, with the matter raised by Deputy McQuillan because he may go away before I am finished.  I am sure Deputy McQuillan is aware&mdash;other Deputies may not be aware&mdash;that I was a director of the New Ireland Assurance Company until I became a Minister.  That company was started after Easter Week, 1916, by six of us when we were prisoners.  It has done a lot for the economy of this country. It was started in conditions that are repugnant to Deputy McQuillan and all belonging to him.  He has attacked that company ever since he came into this House.  He has never attacked an English company&mdash;why, I do not know.  I do not know why he should be hostile to this company.  Perhaps it is part of his make-up.  Would you not think he should have the manliness to admit he was wrong when the findings of the High Court were rejected?  He makes out that the Supreme Court only agreed in certain things.  They agreed on all the major issues.  There were minor issues, it is true, as the costs will prove.</P>

If the Deputy comes in here to throw dirt around, which he is competent to do, especially against anything Irish, he should have the manliness to say: &ldquo;I have made a mistake; the thing is all over and done with.&rdquo;  Of course, he will not do that because he lives by throwing dirt.  He says that people get £300 who paid in £600.  I do not know whether that is true or not.  He can make any assertions he likes because nobody is in a position to contradict him.  I never interrupted the Deputy at all&mdash;I let him go on with his dirt-throwing and mud-slinging, his only interest in this, as far as I can see.  There are many people who paid in £1 and got back £600.  I do not know whether a company could do that sort of business unless some people paid more and some others less.</P>

      <P>When speaking before Christmas, Deputy Sweetman asked about Ordnance Survey maps for sale to the ordinary individual.  An enormous number of maps were produced by the Ordnance Survey and it would be absolutely impossible to keep a stock of all of them.  They try to keep a stock of the maps which are usually asked for.  They are fairly successful as far as it goes and if a person goes in and asks for a map which is not readily available, they order it and they will have it within a few days.  I think that is all they could reasonably be asked to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked about the bound volumes of debates.  I am afraid I have nothing to do with the bound volumes.  Standing Order 79 lays down that the Ceann Comhairle is responsible for them.  The only responsibility that could be put on me is in relation to the Stationery Office which arranges for publication.  The preparation of the bound volumes is done by the Dáil Office and the indexing, I believe, is the chief difficulty. The indexing has become far more difficult over the last years because of the number of Parliamentary Questions. Every Question has an index <Col N="720" /> number and refers back to other index numbers.  This has made indexing very onerous.  As well as that, the Editor of Debates was ill for a long time and the Assistant Editor, who is responsible for indexing the bound volumes, had to take his place.  The bound volumes have been issued up to the end of March, 1962.  We are only 12 months behind at the moment so we are not too bad in all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I did not blame him.  I said he was responsible.  As to the publication of the register of electors, they were all brought out in time, on the 24th November, with the exception of three.  Galway and Wexford were a bit late.  Galway came out on 26th November and Wexford on 27th November.  The one that was later still came out on 10th December.  This was due to two causes, I believe.  Of the two printers responsible, one printer came across a very unfortunate amount of sickness amongst his staff and the second had more than his share of Government printing of other kinds.  They were late but they came out eventually and no great harm has been done.  They were out in time.</P>

      <P>I would like to have that.  The next point the Deputy spoke about is the progress in Ordnance Survey mapping and so on.  There is a great deal of arrears of work in the mapping of the country.  They are many years behind and it would be very much better if we could have a <Col N="721" /> revision every 15 or 20 years.  We have not anything like that, nor, with the present staff, could we achieve anything like that.  It is a matter which must be considered.  I do not think I need say anything more about it.  It is going to be a big matter of organisation, of cost and of training of staff, if we are going to do very much better than we are doing at the present time but I think it will have to be done.  If we had our revision done here at a reasonable interval of, say, 15 or 20 years, if we could do it during&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any definite time.  Some have not been done for 80 years; others have been done much more frequently.  There is no such thing as a complete run over the whole country.  It is only done haphazardly, as required.</P>
      <P>I now come to Deputy Sweetman's speech today.  First of all, I welcome his tribute to the Income Tax Commission. I know he has paid a tribute to them before and so have I.  They did a wonderful job and they produced very useful reports, some of which I do not agree with, and perhaps some of which Deputy Sweetman does not agree with, either.  They are very well done.  One thing they have done is that they have produced their reports in such a way that any ordinary citizen can read them, and understand what is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, I did promise to have a White Paper issued before the Budget of this year dealing with the remaining recommendations of this Commission.  We had a White Paper issued last year dealing with a number of their recommendations we expect to finish.  Now the Government will consider in time the issuing of a White Paper before the Budget.  I will try to have it issued some time before then, as requested by Deputy Sweetman, if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman went on to say in relation to the Valuation Office that <Col N="722" /> their methods are not understood by the ordinary citizen.  There again there are difficulties owing to the very long lapse of time since there was a real valuation just as there was no real survey.  I am afraid that our valuation methods are going to be very involved until there is a complete revaluation of the whole country.  I do not know how the Government are going to face that but I am afraid it will have to be faced before we can have an equitable and an intelligent valuation of property generally.</P>
    <P>The principle laid down in the Valuation Acts generally was that the net letting value of the property should be the valuation.  Land is out because land was valued over 110 years ago or so and not touched since.  Even buildings have been revalued on their own since then, here and there but not everywhere.  The fact that it is not done everywhere makes it impossible for the valuer to bring it up to the present value because it would be too much out of line and the formula to be followed is rather involved.</P>
    <P>As far as the agricultural grant is concerned, I can assure the Deputy that we intend that that will continue and that the amount voted plus the amount already there will be the amount to be voted for the coming years also.  I do not think any Government ,,will ever reduce the agricultural grant so I do not think there is any need for Deputies to worry on that point at all.</P>
    <P>The next point we come to is in relation to the Attorney General. Deputy Sweetman has said that in the Shanahan case the criticism was that the courts were not given an opportunity of giving a complete and full verdict on the case.  With regard to that and the criticism by Deputy McQuillan, I am not saying whether the Deputy is right or wrong in this case because I am not in a position to say so.  It is easy to make an accusation of that kind but it is impossible for me to refuse it because I am not competent to deal with it.  If I were competent, I suppose I would take a long time to study the whole thing in order to be able to say to the Deputy: &ldquo;I think you are wrong.&rdquo; All I can ask the Dáil, therefore, is not to accept <Col N="723" /> allegations of this kind unless we have an opportunity, as I say, of getting a competent person to deal with the whole matter, with ample time to carry out his investigation.</P>
    <P>As far as Deputy McQuillan is concerned, I think the same argument applies to his remarks with regard to the Attorney General.  The Attorney General may be accused of not giving sufficient time to the cases that come before him.  He may be accused of not having prepared the Singer case properly.  It is Deputy McQuillan's allegation that it was neither properly prepared nor presented. I do not know, but I certainly do not accept Deputy McQuillan's allegation.  I should like to have the assurance of someone competent to talk on these matters that that allegation is largely true before I would be prepared to accept it.  I do not accept it.  I reject it <i>in toto.</i></P>
    <P>Neither do I believe that the Taoiseach used the words Deputy McQuillan alleged he used when he asked him about the appointment of the Attorney General back in 1957.  I do not think it is true that the Taoiseach said then that he could not get a lawyer to accept the position on a full-time basis.  I think what really happened was that there was a change in the practice when the Coalition Government took office.  For many years, under Fianna Fáil Governments, Attorneys General did in fact accept that the position was full-time and did not seek to practise outside.  Other Governments adopted a different practice and it was very difficult to expect Attorneys General under subsequent Fianna Fáil Governments to go back to the old practice.  In fact, it would have been an admission that they were in some way inferior to the Attorneys General under other Governments.  As far as I understand the position, the present Attorney General wanted to have the principle accepted that he was free to practise outside, but he has not in fact availed of that privilege in the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>The next point raised by Deputy <Col N="724" /> Sweetman was in relation to the auditor appointed to the Irish Shipping Company.  Since I became Minister for Finance, I have been criticised for keeping the auditing of State companies under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  One Fine Gael speaker took this matter up every year for the past four or five years.  I considered the matter.  Last year, the Comptroller and Auditor General had so much work to do he had to employ outside firms to do the auditing for some of these State companies.  Some of these State companies complained that the outside firms did the audit and the Comptroller and Auditor General signed the report, as well as the outside firm, and, from their point of view, it looked very bad; it looked as if they were under some sort of Government examination, and they objected to this method.  The Comptroller and Auditor General could not help it; he had not enough staff.  I decided eventually that it was better, perhaps, to agree that some of these companies should be released from the obligation to employ the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A number of them were told they could appoint outside auditors, if they wished.</P>
    <P>In the Acts setting up these companies, it is laid down, in some cases, that the Comptroller and Auditor General is the auditor.  That must continue until the Acts are changed.  In other cases, it is laid down that they may appoint an auditor, with the sanction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance, as the case may be.  In this particular case, the clause in the particular Act provides that they may appoint an auditor with the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  They appointed the firm of Haughey and Boland and I was asked for my sanction. Now I could only refuse if I thought that the firm was not a fit and proper firm to do this work.  I did not feel I could say that and I, therefore, gave my sanction.</P>
    <P>I did not know this proposal was coming before me.  It is true, as Deputy Sweetman said, that an officer of my Department represents me at the <Col N="725" /> annual meeting.  That is certainly the practice.  But that officer had no instruction from me about the appointment of an auditor and, if a particular auditor was proposed, I suppose he did not feel he had any obligation either to object or agree.  At any rate, he did not report back to me that such and such an auditor had been appointed.  A number of other companies which were given the same permission have also appointed outside auditors.  They appear to have got away without any criticism.</P>
    <P>With regard to the firm, when Deputy Haughey became Minister for Justice, he took leave of absence from the firm and he does not intend to return to it until his term as Minister expires.  As far as I can see, he has nothing to do with the firm at the moment.</P>

      <P>The next point raised by Deputy Sweetman was the deficit in our balance of payments.  It is a matter for close examination and for vigilance but there is, as was mentioned by Deputy Sweetman&mdash;he may not have mentioned it in this way&mdash; the fact that our external assets are remaining healthy and that is some consolation in itself.  I am not in a position to explain the contradiction between these two facts, that the deficit in our balance of payments is increasing to a very substantial sum and, at the same time, our external assets are increasing.  Deputy Sweetman offered some suggestions as to places where mistakes might be made in the figures.  It is possible mistakes are made, of course&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  The Central Statistics Office have information but we cannot, of course, guarantee that it is complete information.  They have information on capital inflow through land purchase and the purchase of property here of various kinds, or even the purchase of part of businesses here, people coming in to start factories and so on, and that would include foreign industrialists.  These figures are available but, as I say, we can never guarantee they are fully available but as far as they can be made out, they are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I do not know about &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; but I am doubtful about that. I would like to think more about that, especially the mechanics of income for such money, but I do not think it is a big factor in this calculation.  We may, of course, and probably will, have better figures available by the time we issue our Tables before the Budget because there will be a better opportunity <Col N="728" /> of examining all these figures and trying to assess them as fully as possible and as correctly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin spoke about the position in regard to salaries and said that we had a cowardly approach, that we were afraid to vote ourselves adequate salaries, whether as Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, or Deputies. He is probably right in that but I suppose it is the sort of cowardice that we are not likely to get over.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for a Grant (Grant-in-Aid) to An Comhairle Ealaíon (No. 9 of 1951).</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware that the provision for An Comhairle Ealaíon was increased in 1961 by 50 per cent. to £30,000 and remained at that level during the present financial year.  The term of office of the Council came to an end during the year and the present Council was then appointed as provided by the Act, that is to say, six members were appointed by the Government and five further members Co-opted by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil will have learned with regret of the decision of Sir Chester Beatty to resign his membership in order to lighten his burden of work. The Government had no option but to accept his resignation.  I am sure, however, I speak for every member of the Dáil when I say it is recognised that the nation owes an immense debt <Col N="731" /> of gratitude to Sir Chester for his exceedingly generous benefactions.  I wish we had some more permanent method of showing it than by words. Perhaps some day we will have.  In the meantime, we can do nothing more than express our thanks and express the hope that he will enjoy many more years of useful activity.</P>
    <P>The vacancy amongst the appointed members of An Comhairle Ealaíon caused by Sir Chester's resignation was filled by the appointment of Mr. John Hunt, M.A., who is perhaps well known to members of the House as the curator at Bunratty.</P>
    <P>I presume it is not necessary for me to recount the activities of the Board during the year as they are set out in very great detail in their published report. I mentioned in previous years that I had set up an interdepartmental committee to consider the whole question of the scope and control of all the cultural activities financed from public funds.  That committee has not yet submitted its main report, but I am told that they hope to find it possible to do so during the coming year. Arising out of its consideration, some more specific proposals may be formulated to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with the words the Taoiseach has just announced in connection with the resignation of Sir Chester Beatty and to express my complete concurrence in the tribute he has paid to Sir Chester.  I had the privilege of being in an official position when Sir Chester made the magnificent contribution he made to our National Gallery of the priceless pictures which now grace the Gallery and which are an effective lure to all art-lovers coming to this country and generally to those people who are interested in art and come here visiting the country as tourists or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sir Chester Beatty's liberality was unbounded.  His example to the rest of the country was something we would hope would be equalled if not emulated, by those in a position to give gifts to the nation.  I have on many occasions, both in this House <Col N="732" /> and outside it, expressed my disappointment that many of our citizens, who perhaps would be in a financial position to make donations to artistic objects and towards the advancement of our cultural objectives, have not so far done so.  There is some little sign at the moment of an opening up in that direction and I hope these few remarks on the subject of Sir Chester Beatty will further encourage people who are able to do it to endow our galleries or our universities with funds for the advancement of the arts and for general cultural objectives.</P>
    <P>As far as the general Estimate is concerned, I should like to express my own personal appreciation of the efforts of the Arts Council during the year under review.  Under the direction of the present Director, very great progress has been made.  The review in their report shows they are active. Although one may criticise some parts of it, on the whole, they are active in the proper ways&mdash;certainly in the ways that appeal to me.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I spoke on this Estimate, I asked the Taoiseach why it was that the Government had not opened their purse strings a little more to the Arts Council.  He gave me the rather surprising reply that the Arts Council had not asked for any more.  I thought that perhaps the question I put to the Taoiseach and the answer I got would have encouraged the Arts Council during the year we are discussing at the moment to make a tentative request for a little more money.  I do not know whether they have done so or not, or whether they are still giving the Taoiseach what I believe is the false impression that they are quite satisfied with the amount of money they have, including the addition he gave them since he came into office.</P>
    <P>I think it would be money well spent to give them more.  They are hampered in their activities.  When we find a good Arts Council under very good directors doing an excellent job, it would be good business not merely for the objectives imposed upon them by the statute but for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach one important question on a matter <Col N="733" /> that it not very vital before I move on to make a few observations on the Arts Council in general.  In January, 1963, we have now the report of the Arts Council for 1961-62 in stencil. I do not know what the reason for it is, but there seems to be some unnecessary delay in the production of the Arts Council report, for not only do we get it nearly a year after the end of the period which it covers but the report is merely in stencil and not in the proper format.  It is something which I think requires some explanation.  What is the cause of the delay?  It is not a very important matter but it is of some importance from the point of view of people interested in our activities, particularly in connection with their views as to the scope and duties of the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is a matter minor in its own way but of some importance. It looks sloppy; it looks inefficient; and it is certainly not any great credit that nearly ten months after the end of the year with which the report deals, we get, and I believe not very easily, a stencilled copy of the report. It is a matter I should like the Taoiseach to consider to see what can be done about it.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council have done very good work in the past 12 months, but I should like to express my personal regret that they have been hampered and hindered in their statutory objectives and duties.  Perhaps I am overstating or exaggerating the position when I say they have been hampered, but one of the statutory duties imposed on the Council by the Arts Act of 1951 was to stimulate an interest in design in industry, the fine arts and applied arts generally.  We all know, or perhaps many of us have forgotten, the report of the experts from Scandinavian countries on our industries and our industrial design in this country. It is a very provocative report and a very good one.  I should have thought that as part of their statutory objectives and duties, it would have been the aim of the Arts Council to see something was done, following that report.</P>
    <P>I have expressed views here on several occasions on the subject of the <Col N="734" /> application of art to industry and particularly to design in industry.  It is a matter that has been very close to my heart and one that the late Dr. Bodkin, in his report to the Government, stressed very much.  Deputies who have listened to me before on this subject may perhaps tire of it, but they will realise the importance of the application of design to industry and of the practical application of art to industry.</P>
    <P>In this matter, I am not dealing with something which is high in the cultural atmosphere.  I am dealing with something which is of very practical importance and, in my submission here, of even more vital importance in the conditions in which we find ourselves now.  I hope, therefore, Deputies will excuse me if I repeat very shortly what I said on other occasions. I think the Taoiseach will agree with me it is of vital importance to this country that we should expand our export trade to the utmost.  There is no doubt that Irish industrialists, Irish manufacturers, will not sell their goods abroad merely because they are Irish.  You will get no purchaser, even in our best market from the point of view of sentimentality&mdash;the USA&mdash;to take goods, unless they are good value.</P>
    <P>You will get no foreigner to buy Irish goods, unless they are not merely good value but distinctive in design, and what I have urged here as a matter of purely practical politics was that we should get into this country the best designers available and give them the biggest salaries, not merely as good as we can afford but as good as they demand.  We should get these experts to advise our industrialists and insist on our industrialists accepting their advice and acting on it, because I have the impression that many of our industrialists dealing in goods in the categories of crafts and arts, goods where design is of the utmost importance, are quite satisfied and smug about the position in the home market.</P>
    <P>As I have said, you will not get Irish goods sold unless they are of distinctive quality and design and of artistic character.  It would not be proper for me to concentrate too much on any particular manufacturer.  Some <Col N="735" /> of them have succeeded and some of them nearly succeeded.  I have already stated my experience, and I am sure the Taoiseach saw the same thing, in New York.  In a big store, there is a man in charge who is very favourably disposed to this country.  He has Irish goods displayed in that store in Fifth Avenue, but nothing will go on his table unless it is of first-class quality and design.</P>
    <P>That is the headline we have to teach to our industrialists.  We have a serious situation here at the moment in regard to external markets and if we are to compete, we must have experts and we must have our goods manufactured in such a way that our markets will keep expanding so as to have an expanding economy.  We cannot have that if we are to be satisfied with the commonplace.  We must not merely get away from the commonplace, we must pass away from the good and go into the realm where we can compete favourably with such things as Belleek glass and china in France and other European countries.  We cannot beat those by smugness and self-satisfaction, with the position in Europe as it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>I accordingly urge on the Taoiseach to use all resolution to stimulate in our manufacturers and our industrialists an interest not merely in art and the application of art to industry but in the vital necessity to get the best possible advice from anywhere it can be got and at the highest price necessary, because our goods must be not merely good but better than the best in European countries.  I have always believed we have great scope in that field.  I have preached that for years, even in the time when I was a voice crying in the wilderness, when the only other voice raised in this connection was that of Dr. Bodkin.</P>
    <P>When I was in Government, I got the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, to try to get the officers of his Department to arrange a meeting of industrialists and impress on them the necessity of seeing what had to be done if we were <Col N="736" /> to get an export trade and if we were to beat our competitors in Holland, France, Italy and other countries where manufacturers have artistic training.</P>
    <P>That was the position some years ago.  I do not know what the position is now.  Since that time we have had the report of the Northern European experts.  I understand functions in connection with that have been taken away from the Arts Council and given to the Department of Education, but the Taoiseach can correct me if I am wrong.  I should like to know what progress has been made.  At the risk of repetition, and I am speaking with all sincerity on a topic which I have been preaching for many years, it is absolutely essential for this country to get out of the commonplace, to get away from the best or the excellent, to get into the best of the best, unless we are to waive any hope of meeting serious competition which we have always had to meet and which will be more and more keen in the future, having regard to recent developments. That is really the particular matter I want to mention in connection with this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I notice occasionally that the Arts Council appear in print expressing their views.  While I am a firm believer in this, I have in no circumstances and no matter what the provocation, written a letter to the newspapers. Nevertheless, I commend most of their activities in that connection.  It is one of the ways in which they can stimulate public interest and get public opinion to bear upon something that has been done contrary to the best interests of the country from the point of view of our cultural life.</P>
    <P>There is one matter on which I should like assurance from the Taoiseach. Of course, the Arts Council are in a sense a Government institution in that they are set up and developed and, to a large extent, dominated by the Government.  The directors are appointed by the President, on the advice of the Government: five members are appointed directly by the Government and then the nomination of the other six is by the Arts Council themselves.  It might <Col N="737" /> be said that they are a sort of Government institution and that, therefore, they should not criticise anything in connection with Government activities. I would hope that the Taoiseach, as the Minister responsible for the Arts Council to the Dáil, would see that the Arts Council have the fullest freedom to express their views and their opinions, even if they want to express views or opinions on activities in relation to the duties imposed on the Council by the Government and even though the views are directed towards Government activities or Government Departments' activities.</P>
    <P>I will take an example, if I may, and this is merely an example, and not any particular grievance or matter of criticism of the Post Office.  Supposing the Arts Council were not, as they ought to be, consulted by the Post Office when a new stamp is being issued.  The Arts Council should have the fullest freedom to criticise that stamp, even though it emanates from a Government Department.  I should like the Taoiseach to give an assurance on that point, that their liberty of criticism and their liberty of expressing their views will be completely uncontrolled by him or his Department or any other Department, which may be the source from which some of the members hold their appointment. There is also the point that in a sense the Arts Council depend on Government subsidies as a Government Department.</P>
    <P>I think the Arts Council have stimulated interest in many ways which in the period under review commend themselves to me and should commend themselves to the House.  I notice they have helped in some little way an interest in art by school children.  There are some indications that they have given grants to some of these bodies interested in bringing an appreciation of art, the teaching and a proper approach to art, to schoolchildren.  They have apparently given grants to buy sets of prints for the purpose of a picture circulating scheme for technical, secondary and primary schools throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is only a small item in their report but it does enable me to urge <Col N="738" /> upon them, through the Taoiseach, the necessity for seeing, if possible, that pressure is brought to bear on secondary schools of all kinds and all denominations to see that the children in these schools are taught an appreciation of art, the way to approach art and thereby allow for cultural activities in the visual arts and all other categories of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is of great importance that our children should know and appreciate the art treasures we have here in this country.  I commend the activities of the Director of the Municipal Gallery in connection with that because he has done good work in recent times in bringing schoolchildren to the Municipal Gallery and in giving them lectures on how to draw, thereby bringing them to a proper approach towards the appreciation of art, particularly the visual arts.  I should like to see the Arts Council in their next report give an indication that they have taken more active steps than are shown in the present report to see that schoolchildren, in the secondary schools particularly, and possibly the younger children in the national schools, are brought periodically and systematically to art lectures, if possible, and certainly to see the pictures and get to know the pictures we have.  In this country we have a unique collection of art works and we are very fortunate in our National Gallery and in our Municipal Gallery.</P>
    <P>That leads me to this passing remark, that the Municipal Gallery appears to be losing its character and that the Arts Council, perhaps, according to one section of the present report, are doing what really the Municipal Gallery should be doing.  They are doing good work.  They have apparently started on a policy of buying pictures by modern Irish artists and exhibiting them in their own gallery. That is a very good purpose but the Municipal Gallery has got to the stage where it is nearly on a par with the National Gallery and has ceased to be what it originally was&mdash;the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art.</P>
    <P>I see in the report that the Council co-operated with the College Gallery, Trinity College, Dublin in the purchase of original paintings by Irish artists. <Col N="739" /> Would I be treading on academic corns if I say I hope to see in the next report of the Arts Council that they co-operated with University College, Dublin, or University College, Cork, or University College, Galway, in somewhat similar activities or other artistic efforts.  I am not deviating from the strict rules of order in saying I would hope that the Arts Council would impress upon the authorities of these three colleges the necessity of having a lecturer, or a professor, or at least a part-time professor in art and the history of art.  It would be a very good thing, not merely for our cultural life but also for the very practical purpose of interesting our students in the universities in art and the application of art to industry and design in industry.</P>
    <P>May I conclude with one, perhaps, parochial point?  A man from Cork was on the Arts Council.  He resigned, or died&mdash;I forget which&mdash; and no Corkman was appointed in his place.  That was a slip-up on the part of the Government which should be rectified at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy J. A. Costello in everything he said.  I was going to disagree with a little of what he said.  The House could hardly conceive of any reason to refer the Vote back except on grounds of insufficiency.  The Vote does acknowledge that there are other things outside bread and circuses.  I do not think anything has given such enduring value, much more than is obvious at first glance, because what it does grows and sheds light through the future.  It initiates and encourages desirable activities.  Over the years, since this Arts Council was established, it has been a great enricher of the whole fabric of Irish life.  Its results will, of necessity, be slow and Deputy J. A. Costello is, perhaps, too impatient.  However, from my own knowledge, the only fault of the Arts Council at the moment is excessive modesty in public relations.  I learned tonight from Deputy Costello's words that they are also modest in their <Col N="740" /> demands.  That is probably a good sign, although the job wants all they have got and perhaps a bit more.</P>
      <P>They are certainly, as Deputy D. Costello mentioned, very modest in the way they publish their annual report.  It could be done more attractively and circulated more widely.  I should like to see every Deputy getting the annual report of the Arts Council from now on because I have spoken to a number of them today, and I was shocked to find that very few had read these reports.  It contains some amazing facts.  People should know what has been done and is being done on a veritable shoestring. For instance, the Macaulay Foundation came here because there was an organisation like the Arts Council which could be trusted to do what the beneficiaries intended.</P>
      <P>There are certain other sources which might be inclined to follow that patriotic and enlightened lead.  People do not know that there is a fellowship this year of £1,000 being given through that machinery to a young painter to proceed with his work.  People do not know that there is a sum of £1,000 being made available for a musical composition this year.  The existence of the Arts Council has made this kind of assistance, this practical and applied generosity, possible.  The Council makes many other awards from their funds other than the Macaulay Fellowship Fund.  However, this particular example shows what a well-designed organisation can help to have done, if it is there to administer such grants of money.  I hope that the very generous Macaulay example will be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the Council is much wider than dealing with money or handing out money.  We have all noticed in recent years that there is an atmosphere here in which critical discussion arises on many matters in this era, matters of design.  We have the Fitzwilliam Street argument and the new concert hall, and we all know that there is a very rapidly growing public in the country at last, thank God, for fine music.  Even matters like town planning and the tidy towns competition show the upsurge of interest in the graces of living.  They <Col N="741" /> have all been gently stimulated by the activity of the Arts Council since it was established.</P>
    <P>Even the Church which has always been a notable repository of bad taste is on the move.  We might see an end in our time to the hideous plaster statues and the distempered architecture. In fact, it seems quite possible that the work of the Irish artists in stone, metal or glass, and the work of forward architects in this country, may have a reasonably rich future.  At any rate, there is an upward move in standards.</P>
    <P>There is one particular example&mdash; and I think the majority of members will agree with me&mdash;and that is the monuments to the great men of our own time, particularly the local ones in towns and villages.  The deceased leader is generally depicted on the memorial.  There is evidence of great enthusiasm but very bad taste.  That is a generalisation but it is reasonably accurate.  The guidance of the Arts Council could be of great value here.</P>
    <P>As Deputy J. Costello said, business men are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of good design. Whether we get into the European Community or not, this is very important. It will be of even greater importance if we do not.  Occasionally industrial architecture here is quite good but less frequently our domestic architecture is good.  Far too often our domestic architecture is drab and box-like and monotonous.  Working-class houses should and could be better; suburban housing of the middle-class type is generally hideous, and it is not helped by my old enemies, the ESB, in what they do to the landscape.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad that things would want to be improved.  It is a very tender plant, but it is growing, and this is due to the gentle activity of the Arts Council.  The personnel are excellent.  All the chairmen have been remarkably good men and the membership alone is of a reassuring calibre.  I should like to join in the tribute paid to Sir Chester Beatty.  He belonged to the renaissance and there is a patrician colouring to his activities. <Col N="742" /> We are very fortunate in Ireland that he is with us.  I believe it must be due to what the Arts Council have done, even though they have done it without any drum-thumping.</P>
    <P>All the arts&mdash;what I would call the visual arts, music and the theatre&mdash; seem to be moving on.  I notice an improvement in the local or domestic scene.  In Cork, for instance, we can get an audience of practically 2,000 people at a symphony concert twice a year.  That could not have happened 20 years ago.  A young painter in Cork, a very promising young man, held an exhibition during the past few weeks.  He sold all the canvases he exhibited.  That could not have happened 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>We have a ballet company in Cork, which is helped by the Arts Council. It was a desperate struggle to keep it going but it is being kept going.  They have a growing audience and they do a remarkable thing: they tour the country and give performances in the small towns.  None of us can ever measure the value of this.  They even went to the Six Counties and had remarkable success there.  All that was possible because of the Art Council's help.  I think all those things are on the move and this is the time to encourage them.</P>
    <P>I would certainly join with Deputy J. A. Costello in proposing to the Taoiseach that he should overcome the Art Council's modesty in spending money and encourage them to spend more money than they are spending. It is very heartening to read the report and I am impressed by many things in it.  I am impressed particularly by their proposals to have art collections given to schools and even to hoteliers at half price.  I think they should be fully publicised.  It is a most valued service and I hope sculpture will be included.  It is desirable to have sculpture as part of the interior and exterior decoration emphasised amongst the people who could use sculpture.  Large organisations should use sculpture and architects should be encouraged to use sculpture in the buildings they set up.  There are large firms, industrialists, who should realise the little more appearance which contemporary <Col N="743" /> sculpture will give to the buildings they erect.  Airports and such places should provide work for Irish sculptors and certainly the hotels could do so.</P>
    <P>I have seen in a few hotels exhibitions of pictures at a very reasonable reduction in price with the help of the Arts Council.  It is remarkable how foreigners talk about good contemporary Irish paintings.  There is one hotel in South Kerry where I listened to a group of English people examining four or five pictures on the wall.  They were extremely well done by a young Dublin girl.  They said in my hearing: &ldquo;You would not get that in any hotel in England&rdquo;&mdash;and you would not, I think.</P>
    <P>If the Arts Council could get this collection together which they mention in their report, we should make quite sure that it will be perambulated around the country.  In the report they mention the very impressive exhibition of German church architecture which they arranged in Dublin and Cork last year.  Thousands saw that exhibition.  It was very remarkable and some of it was startling.  We would never have seen it but for the Arts Council.  It meant, of the many thousands of the public who saw it in Dublin and Cork, a great percentage began to see beauty&mdash;I am not talking about completely contemporary forms of decoration but the more interesting forms.  The public will appreciate that and encourage young architects to proceed in those directions and not to be so afraid.  That is one of the great values of the work being done by the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>There is a list of the exhibitions, which have been sponsored and encouraged by the Arts Council, in their annual report, which is very remarkable.  I think the public just do not know how much good this Council are doing.  There are very many groups getting help from them and it is a matter for regret that the public do not pay more attention to undertakings they have supported. The list is very varied and very widespread covering every part of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> The actual arranging of these exhibitions by the Arts Council must influence the public taste.  It might take a little time but it is time worth spending.  It is like throwing stones into a pool and circles grow wider and wider.  Our people have very considerable intelligence and have good taste instinctively.  They have put up with the worst up to this because they have not seen better than the worst.  I think from this on, with the help of the Arts Council and the State, the whole standard of taste should be raised.  One thing which is very important, and which is not realised, is that advice may be obtained from the Arts Council and activities of all kinds can get guidance from them that would prevent many of the grievous things which have been done in this country with a great deal of enthusiasm but without any taste.</P>
    <P>This is very important in relation to local monuments.  Future generations could be saved many a shudder, if advice were sought now.  I have in mind the national monument in Cork, erected as a result of a very large fund collected about the time of my birth.  It was collected with very great enthusiasm all over the country and in America, too.  The money was spent but the result was deplorable.  One of the greatest regrets of my life is that when the Black and Tans were damaging things all over the country they did not do that monument in.  It is a horrible monument on a splendid site but it is a source of intense pain to observers.  If the Arts Council had been there then, they could have advised the people who were spending this very large sum of money.  They would probably have advised them to have a look at some of the pieces which can be seen in Continental countries, particularly in France.</P>
    <P>All I have said so far has been said to emphasise the benefits that flow from this kind of expenditure.  You cannot measure the results.  The climate is growing which will encourage the arts, the musician, the dramatist, the architect and, above all, the businessman to realise that the graces are as important as the utilities.  We cannot, <Col N="745" /> as a nation, do many things in a big way, but as an imaginative people, we can do those kind of things very well if we are given initial guidance and direction.</P>
    <P>I consider every encouragement should be given to all to see that everything is done to raise our standards in such matters.  That is the important thing.  The Government did increase the Vote two years ago and I have already asked the Taoiseach to consider enlarging the activities of the Arts Council by enlarging their revenue.  This would really be throwing our bread upon the waters.  I think most other expenditure achieves less.  This is the smallest Vote this House will have before it but it could easily be the richest in potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, the fact must be faced that every civilised nation now subsidises the Arts.  The days of the rich patrons are fast disappearing and, in their place, the public authorities have undertaken the responsibility, readily undertaken it, of assisting, by subsidies and other forms of encouragement, artistic development inside the State.</P>
      <P>The Arts Council has been a means by which artistic development in our country has been assisted and encouraged and I believe the public would readily accept the suggestion that the State should be prepared to spend more than it is spending at the moment in giving assistance to the Arts.  Other countries see fit, not merely for cultural but also for economic reasons, heavily to subsidise their cultural activities.  Whilst this country does to a very limited extent help our native culture in all its aspects and our artists, the fact remains that we are still very backward in assisting cultural matters.  It is of considerable importance that we should endeavour to improve public taste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We endeavour to assist artists, many of whom need support in their activities, and I believe the Government would have the support not only of this House but of the country in general if, in the coming year, they saw fit to increase the moneys given to <Col N="746" /> the Arts Council.  Not a great deal is involved taken in absolute terms, or relatively to the annual payments undertaken by the State.  This is an investment which, as Deputy Barry has said, returns a dividend in many directions.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another aspect of the activities at the Governmental level and the level generally of the public authority to which I wish to refer.  I stress the need for co-ordination in the assistance given to the Arts in this country.  Any person who is involved in artistic development of one kind or another, who is engaged in the formation of local groups of a cultural nature, who is engaged in promoting festivals of one kind or another, knows the great difficulties involved.  Those interested have to go to the local authority, to Bord Fáilte, to the Arts Council, and to any other place to which their ingenuity can bring them in order to get the necessary financial assistance to support their endeavours.  Organisations like the Wexford and Waterford Festivals, and festivals in other parts of the country, spend a great deal of their time going from one body to another in search of the support they need so much. Ultimately that support all comes from the same source.</P>
    <P>I think we should face facts.  We should decide that the Arts Council should be the means by which all our cultural activities on the level of subvention from the State are canalised. Instead of Bord Fáilte giving grants and the Arts Council giving grants to the same organisation, the support generally for artistic endeavour should come through the Arts Council.  That would, of course, mean giving a great deal more support to it but it would not in the ultimate, perhaps, mean that the overall figure would be greatly increased because, instead of coming from one Government Department or one State body, it would all come from the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer is the need for a concert hall in this city.  The Government's decision supporting the efforts made to have a concert hall in Dublin is to be welcomed. Here, again, the difficulty is <Col N="747" /> encountered that the organisations must now try to discover if assistance can be obtained from the Dublin Corporation. It is a matter of considerable interest and concern for the citizens of Dublin that an adequate concert hall be erected.  The Arts Council is the obvious means by which support could be given.  Whilst the Government's decision is to be welcomed, even though it comes rather tardily perhaps, nonetheless it is, I think, the sort of case in which, if we had an Arts Council adequately supported and active in the way I have suggested it could be active, we would long since have achieved considerable progress.</P>
    <P>It would be of interest to know how often the advice of the Arts Council is sought and accepted.  The Report refers to the fact that it has made recommendations to various organisations, but one is left rather with the impression that this advice is, perhaps, not always taken.  It would be of considerable help, I think, if public and private bodies were to consult the Arts Council in much greater measure and if its advice were taken much more frequently.</P>
    <P>I agree thoroughly with the view that the Arts Council should not be afraid to speak up for itself and should not be afraid to criticise, if necessary, Government organisations or Government Departments where it thinks fit. One of the statutory obligations, indeed, might necessitate it doing so. Where its advice is not taken, its suggestions accepted on any given matter, I should like to see the reasons stated. In that way the organisation will be known and, if it has acted incorrectly, then its activities can be the subject of criticism.  All we know at the moment is that various recommendations are made.  Whether or not these recommendations have been accepted has <Col N="748" /> been left unanswered.  It would be an excellent development if the Arts Council were to become more frequently consulted by not only public authorities but private organisations as well.</P>
    <P>One final aspect to which I wish to refer is the statement made some time ago that some of our cultural activities, like the Wexford Festival, would have to become self-supporting in a certain number of years.  The House must face the fact that these festivals cannot become self-supporting if they wish to attain the international standards which they should attain. In Dublin, we have many cultural activities which have to be supported out of public funds.  Throughout the country most laudable efforts are being made by local committees and organisations to run festivals.  If the standards which have to be maintained nowadays are to be reached, we must face the fact that these festivals cannot hope to operate on a business basis and either show a profit or, at least, break even.  That being so, I think it is wrong for us to approach the future activities in this field on the basis that these festivals will have to become self-supporting within a given period.  Recent experience indicates that when prices are raised above a certain level the public are not able to meet the prices.  It seems to me, therefore, that we simply must ensure that these festivals are maintained because of the tremendous amount of good they do the country, not just economically but in many other ways as well.  They must be maintained, I assert, by means of subventions, and these subventions must come from the Government.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
