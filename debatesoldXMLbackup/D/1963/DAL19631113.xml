      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been drawn to the statement in Paper No. 12 of the Economic Research Institute that Irish wages are still distinctly low by European standards; and that by British standards they were even lower in 1961 than in 1953, despite a roughly equal rise in <Col N="1386" /> the <i>per capita</i> product in the two countries in recent years; whether the Central Statistics Office have statistics relative to this matter; and whether they can confirm the position stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statements referred to.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office have statistics in relation to this matter but they advise me that the calculations made in the paper referred to do not reliably measure quantitatively the relationship between the purchasing power of earnings in comparable occupations in different countries. Indeed, the author himself of the paper warns that the data from which he derives his comparison between Ireland and European countries should be treated with a great deal of reserve. The paper is on surer ground when dealing with this country, and the Deputies will, no doubt, have noticed the mention of the fact that real earnings here rose by 50 per cent between 1946 and 1961.</P>
      <P>Wage rates in the United States of America, in Canada and in Australia are well known to be much higher than they are here.  Yet, although there is no restriction on emigration from this country, the net passenger balances outwards by sea and air have fallen considerably in recent years &mdash; from 43,800 in the year ended the 28th February, 1961, to 22,300 in the year ended the 28th February, 1962, and to 12,226 in the year ended the 28th February, 1963.  It is clear that our people generally appreciate that it is not the wages but what the wages can buy that counts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Taoiseach can deny the statement by the Economic Research Institute that Irish wages are distinctly lower than in other European countries and Britain.  Therefore, in view of the fact that the Taoiseach is constantly saying that our industries are competitive with those of Great Britain and in view of the Common Market, would he not agree that the norm of pay for work done here should equal that in Great Britain and in European factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1387" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true we are not yet as wealthy as some of these European countries but we are proceeding in that direction and as we do proceed, it is inevitable that wages paid to workers will increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in this whole question the Taoiseach appears to accept that there is some disparity and that this disparity should continue?  Why is it the Taoiseach does not suggest that there should be such disparity with regard to the amount of profits which are taken out of Irish industry?  That is not so easy to answer, is it?</P>

      <P>On the advertising of cigarettes and tobacco, I have nothing to add to what I told the Deputy in reply to a question on similar lines on 14th March, 1962 &mdash; Dáil Debates, Volume 193, columns 1491-1492.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the educational and publicity campaign of the Minister's Department is greatly overwhelmed by the power and the cost of the campaign carried out by the tobacco companies?  In view of the very grave findings of research groups in other countries, would the Minister not feel justified in taking more positive action to restrict the advertisement of these drugs, as they certainly are?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Government take, and rightly take, stringent precautions against the advertisement of other noxious drugs on television, on the radio and in the newspapers?  In view of the fact that cigarette smoking is such a very serious hazard to the public, surely the Government have a responsibility to act in this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when he expects to be in a position to make a decision on the eighth round increases of salary for senior medical staff, anaesthetists and clerical officers for which the Dublin Health Authority have given their consent as far back as June, 1962, and April and June, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions have been conveyed to the health authority on all <Col N="1389" /> their proposals for the application of the eighth round of increases to officers on their senior medical staff except in the case of one officer.  In that instance the decision involves, in addition to consideration of the grant of the increased rate of salary proposed, an alteration in his status and a restatement of his duties.  The matter is at present in correspondence with the health authority.  I am informed that the needs of the service in which the officer is employed have recently been the subject of review by the authority. I expect to be in a position to issue a decision on the proposal in relation to the remuneration of the officer when the report on the review referred to is made available to me.</P>
      <P>Proposals received from the health authority for revision of the rates of sessional fees payable to anaesthetists are being considered in relation to the rates of fees payable to anaesthetists holding part-time appointments under other local authorities; my decision in this matter will be conveyed to the health authority as soon as possible. In the case of those anaesthetists who are employed on the basis of a salary, plus fees for additional services, the proposal for an increase in the salary element has already been approved.</P>
      <P>With regard to clerical officers, the position is that a uniform salary scale applies on a national basis to such officers employed in the local service. My functions extend only to the minority who are employed in the unified health authorities and in mental hospitals.  I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to take unilateral action on an isolated proposal which would have the effect of upsetting the salary scale which applies on a national basis to a large body of staff in respect of the majority of whom I am not the appropriate Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <P>With regard to the delay in the filling of the permanent post, I informed the Deputy on 31st October, 1962, in reply to a previous question on this matter, that a proposal of the local authority to amalgamate the Ramelton and Rathmullan dispensary districts was under consideration.  It was subsequently decided that amalgamation should not be proceeded with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel called upon to comment on statements in non-official publications particularly where, as in the present instance, the statement <Col N="1391" /> is based not on facts but on the assumption that the wages/output ratio is changing at the same rate here and abroad.  I can, however, assure the Deputies that all relevant factors, including the movements of incomes and productivity here and elsewhere, have been taken into account in formulating the Government's policy in relation to incomes.  I would also draw the Deputies' attention to paragraph 104 of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, the final sentence of which reads &mdash;</P>
      <P>Because of the leeway we have to make up, the argument that a rise in money incomes must at least be matched by increases in productivity would still hold good even if inflationary wage increases were taking place in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) of Section 19 of the Coinage Act, 1950, provides that it shall not be lawful for any person (other than the Central Bank), except under a licence issued by the Minister for Finance, to use any coin otherwise than as currency.

In the light of these figures and in view of the fact that since 1960 the picture has changed completely with regard to the proportion of what was spent in the undeveloped areas as against the rest of the country, would the Minister now say what steps he proposes to take to balance that situation in view of the necessity for development in the west of Ireland?</P>

      <P>I can only repeat that the number of industries established in the west of Ireland far exceeds the number of industries established outside it with the aid of grants.  In relation to the grants I may say that intensive capitalisation industries are not so much attracted to the west but to areas where there is a congregation of other industries from which they can draw kindred services. The type of industry that is attracted there is the labour-intensive industry and therein is an explanation of the fact that there may be more money by way of grants voted for industries in eastern parts of the country.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the statements referred to in the questions.  It is, of course, the case that production costs of some products are higher here than in the United Kingdom.  This is due to a variety of causes including, in particular, the small scale and diversity of production of many Irish firms.  As the Deputies are aware, the Committee on Industrial Organisation were established with a view to formulating the measures necessary to adapt Irish industry to conditions of more intensive competition in home and export markets.  Industry is being urged to carry out the adaptation process with all possible speed.</P>
      <P>Other practical steps taken by the Government to promote increased efficiency in Irish industry include the active encouragement and financial assistance given to the Irish National Productivity Committee and the Irish Management Institute, the generous grants available under the Technical Assistance Scheme for industry, and the special grants and loans available to assist industry to adapt itself to conditions of freer trade.</P>

It is regrettable that there was a walk-out of staff at Meevagh Boatyard in August last but I am satisfied that no blame attaches to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the handling of the matter.  As to the future, I am hopeful that the various incentives in the Government's Programme of Sea Fisheries Development will lead to increasing demand for new boats and expansion of boatbuilding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his Writ for the election of a member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the death of Deputy John Galvin, a member for the Borough Constituency of Cork.</P>
      <P>In doing so, I am exercising my right as a Deputy and, although it may not be in accordance with tradition or precedent, I do it for these reasons.  It has been suggested in various quarters that it may not be convenient for one reason or another, either convenient for the Government or the other Parties contesting the election, that the election should be held at this particular time before Christmas.  However, we cannot be too worried about our own convenience.  What really matters is the convenience of the electorate and if I am interpreting the wishes of the people in my constituency properly, they are clamouring for an opportunity of expressing their opinions at the poll immediately and do not want to wait until after Christmas to do it.</P>
      <P>It is significant that on his return from America the first public statement made by the Taoiseach was one which expressed views which coincide exactly with the sentiments I am now endeavouring to express here.  In the <i>Cork Examiner</i> he was reported as saying when interviewed at Dublin Airport &mdash;and this has not been contradicted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A defeat for the Government in the forthcoming Cork by-election&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>He had good sense enough to be able to anticipate that anyway.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would not necessarily mean that there would be a general election. Stating that the Cork by-election would probably be held before Christmas Mr. Lemass said: &ldquo;Surely the fate of the Government does not depend on one by-election.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> He thought the most important consideration regarding the moving of the writ was the convenience of the electorate in the area but it was good democratic practice that the vacancy should be filled without undue delay.</P>
    <P>He said that he saw definitely the possibility of a by-election in Cork before Christmas.  Therefore, it is my duty as a Deputy for that constituency to draw your attention Sir, to the fact that this vacancy does exist in the present Dáil and I am quite sure that my colleagues representing Cork city and the adjoining constituency, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Lord Mayor, Deputy MacCarthy, will be able to convey to the Taoiseach that what I say is correct.</P>

I do not think it is any sharp practice on our part.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy MacCarthy may disagree with me but I am prepared to put it to the test.  I do not think it should be dependent on a debate across the House between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself or the Lord Mayor of Cork and myself.  I am prepared to put it to the test of the people of Cork and with the democratic set-up which fortunately we have in this country, nobody can resist that.</P>

      <P>There are some established decencies in our public life which I suggest should not be put aside and there are also certain traditional procedures of this Dáil which should not be lightly disregarded.  These considerations have involved the acceptance heretofore by all political Parties in this House of the practice that a motion to fill a vacancy in the Dáil caused by the death of one of our colleagues should be moved only by a member of the Party to which the deceased Deputy belonged and when that Party so decided.  There has been no exception heretofore in the whole history of the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Casey may not be able to understand that Fianna Fáil Deputies have at least as much respect for the memory of our dead colleague, Deputy John Galvin, as the Fine Gael Deputies had for the late Deputy Belton.  In the case of Deputy Belton, a period of about ten weeks passed between the creation of the vacancy and the submission by a Fine Gael Deputy to the Dáil of a motion for the issue of a writ for the by-election.  We might have considered it to be to the advantage of our Party to have that election held earlier but the Fine Gael Party, however, decided that they wanted to have the election in May and they had a right to take that decision.  Because of the considerations of decency and the traditions to which I have referred, it did not enter our minds to move the motion for the issue of the writ ourselves although we could possibly have carried such a motion against the opposition of the Fine Gael Party.  The submission of this motion by a Deputy of the Labour Party in the case of the vacancy caused by the death of one of our members, Deputy <Col N="1429" /> John Galvin, has introduced a new and, I think, deplorable element in the procedure of the Dáil which we can only regret.  This cannot be undone now but I think many Deputies will wish to dissociate themselves from it.</P>
      <P>Whatever our views as to the date on which the Cork by-election should be held or as to any Party advantage thought to be involved, I would ask all members of the Dáil, outside the members of the Labour Party, who wish to have our traditional procedure and the decencies of public life maintained to reject Deputy Casey's motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This sanctimonious declaration on the part of the Taoiseach is not becoming and does not serve the purpose of maintaining the respect for our parliamentary institutions which should be the concern of all of us.  This House operates under its Standing Orders which it is your function, Sir, to enforce but also it functions under certain conventions which in our wish for the preservation of parliamentary institutions, we have, in common, accepted.  That fact means the agreement of all of us to accept the rough with the smooth.  If we dissent from a ruling made by you, Sir, under Standing Orders we must accept that ruling, unless we propose by the appropriate censure of your conduct to do otherwise.</P>
      <P>Similarly, there is a convention in this House since I have been a member of it.  That convention is that if one of our colleagues should die, there should be a suitable period of respectful mourning, which I always understood to be measured as one month, and thereafter it is open to the Party to which that member belonged to move the writ with all the respect due to a deceased colleague and to his family.  Circumstances such as holiday periods and other considerations have forced us from time to time to postpone the moving of a writ but it is surely manifest that where issues of a critical character are joined between the Government of the day and the Parties in Opposition, after the suitable period has passed, the Government should move the writ for the by-election at the earliest possible occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> Note the danger of departing from that observance.  If we are to vary our conventions to the point of saying that no delay on the part of the Party whose member has died will ever justify the moving of the writ by anyone else, it comes within the power of the Government of the day never to move a writ.  Surely no one will say that is a situation that anything could justify?  If the writ had been moved within the time of mourning, I would have demurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will not irritate me into participating in any unseemly behaviour.  The appropriate period having elapsed, and I believe it has elapsed, the Government were faced with notice that a Labour member of the city of Cork had decided to have the matter put to the test of a popular vote of the people of the city of Cork.  Had the writ been moved before the customary period had elapsed, I would have demurred and I am quite convinced that Deputy Casey and no other Deputy would have sought to move it within that period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not move it because up to yesterday it would not have been seemly to move it and I had the right to expect that a member of the Government Party would have moved it.  I am well aware that anyone who tries to maintain the standard of <Col N="1431" /> decent relationship that should exist between the Opposition and the Government is likely to be faced with nothing but scurrilous abuse and insolence by the present Government. If we are to preserve parliament in this country as an effective system of Government there must be some amongst us who are prepared to make sacrifices to ensure that.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, put it to the House that when the Government did not move the writ in the special circumstances which obtain and when they gave no indication of their intention of moving it in the early future, it is required, bearing in mind the acute issue joined in the country at the present time as to whether it is just to raise the revenue of this State from a tax on the essential food, fuel and clothing of the people, that an early opportunity should be taken to submit that question to the electors of Cork as it has already been submitted to the electors of Dublin who have given a clear and vigorous verdict.  I believe that it is the failure of the Government readily to face that issue with the people that has made the course adopted by Deputy Casey justifiable today.  I said myself in Cork that the Government had a duty to come out and face the people. They have that duty.  They should have discharged it themselves, and if they are not prepared to come willingly to the people, we will do all in our power to drag them there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Casey submitted this motion on the 28th day after the death of Deputy Galvin.  I think it was unseemly, and if there was haste, the necessity for that haste should be in the judgment of the Party of which Deputy Galvin was a member, of his colleagues who would be familiar with his family circumstances, and therefore, to that extent, I suggest that the putting of this motion by a member of this House who is not so familiar was unseemly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Casey gave it as one of the reasons for moving for the issue of this writ that the electors of Cork needed this further representation in Dáil Éireann.  There are at the present time four surviving Deputies of Dáil Éireann representing Cork city.  The Lord Mayor represents an adjoining constituency and lives within the environs of the city.  There are four Senators living in Cork or in the city suburbs.  Therefore, I submit that to advance this as a reason for haste in bringing about this election is a completely spurious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Dáil reassembled, there was unseemly haste on the part of Fine Gael in bringing forward a motion, which they expected to win because of the death of Deputy Galvin within a matter of days of his death, <Col N="1434" /> and when you, Sir, ruled out that motion and it was obvious to the Labour Party that you would have to rule it out under the Standing Orders, the Labour Party acted then as the Fine Gael catspaw in putting forward a motion that would be debated here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain something more if the Deputy will listen to me.  Deputy Dillon stated in Cork last Saturday night, and I believed him, that he would propose to move this writ if the Government did not do so after Christmas.  It is the Government's intention to move the writ after Christmas.  I deduced from that statement by Deputy Dillon that he had a decent regard for the conventions of this House and respect for deceased members.  His performance here today is nauseating.  Deputy Casey having moved his motion for the issue of the writ, it was seconded by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.  Deputy Casey's Party have put up a candidate and they know well that they have not the slightest hope of winning the seat on behalf of the Party.  Therefore to that extent again I accuse Deputy Casey and his Party of being the catspaw in this motion as well, for Fine Gael.  The normal time that it would take to have an election, assuming the writ is moved today, would be not less than 21 days.  Therefore, the by-election would inevitably be held within two weeks of Christmas.  Cork city is a busy city.  There is a tremendous degree of business activity in the city.  I have canvassed the opinion of business people and of ordinary citizens and I assure this House that the people in Cork in so far as I can ascertain their wishes do not want the inconvenience of a by-election within a fortnight of Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last precedent we have is the one the Taoiseach quoted when the Fine Gael Party delayed some three months.  The nearest precedent we have to this occasion was the death of <Col N="1435" /> the late Deputy Dr. Tom O'Higgins who died at the end of October, 1953. It was within the power of this Party to move the writ at that time, if we were to adopt this precedent here to-day, but the writ was not moved until the next succeeding session of the House in the spring.  The election took place towards the end of February.  At that time there was no concern about leaving Cork without a Deputy.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this matter only because the Taoiseach put on one of these unctuous, silky, humbugging performances in connection with this business and he did so to give the impression that everybody in the House&mdash;certainly everybody except those under Fianna Fáil control&mdash;was engaged in the exercise of insulting the memory of the Deputy who represented Fianna Fáil in Cork city, the late Deputy Galvin.  That is not so and the Taoiseach knows it.  It is quite unfair and untrue and indeed quite reprehensible and unscrupulous to suggest here that any Deputy on these benches is engaged in insulting the memory of the late Deputy Galvin.  The people who make that criticism should say: &ldquo;Let him who is above criticism cast the first stone&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position?  Are we all children, or is it just that this rot of humbugging has penetrated so deeply <Col N="1437" /> into the membership of this House that nobody can distinguish the truth from the fraud in this matter?  What does the electoral law say?  It should determine when we hold by-elections. The electoral law says that you may have a by-election in 15 days, excluding Sundays.  That is the law on how early by-elections can be held. Yet this motion is moved almost five weeks after the Deputy's death so that we have complied almost to the extent of twice as much as the electoral law on the subject requires.  In this case the Deputy has been dead four weeks last Friday so that as far as hurting his memory by dates is concerned, that charge carries no weight and has no foundation whatever.</P>
    <P>Does everybody not know that the question of a by-election is always a matter of political tactics for whatever Party is vitally concerned?  Does everybody not know that holding a by-election is always a question of buying time?  It is purely a political stratagem.  It is a question of whether the memory of the late Deputy is so good that you should catch it quickly and get more votes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the immediate future the most suitable time for a by-election?The Labour Party think there ought to be a by-election as soon as possible so as to restore the normal representation for Cork constituency. When I say that the Labour Party believe that the immediate future is the best time in order to restore the democratic representation to the fullest level in Cork, I am in goodly company.  I know of the Minister for Industry and Commerce repudiating the Taoiseach when he was speaking but when the Taoiseach came back from America full of wisdom, with the air of liberty blowing in a refreshing manner all round, he was asked to express himself on the question of the writ for the Cork by-election.  This is not the Labour Party's action; it is that of the Taoiseach.  This is what he said:</P>
      <P>A defeat for the Government in the forthcoming Cork by-election would not necessarily mean that there would be a general election.</P>
      <P>Stating that the Cork by-election would probably be held before Christmas, he said that surely the fate of the Government did not depend on one by-election.  He thought the most important issue regarding the moving of the writ was the convenience of the electorate in the area, but it was good democratic practice that the vacancy should be filled, and filled without undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> There is the Taoiseach.  The election should be held and the convenience of the electorate should be considered. The Taoiseach comes down firmly on the over-riding consideration that there should be an election before Christmas. That is what this motion in the name of the Labour Party seeks to achieve. Is there anything wrong with that? There is nothing wrong with it except that an early by-election will not suit the Fianna Fáil Government.  Why? Because an early by-election is going to rekindle all the bitterness, all the opposition and all the detestation of the Government's turnover tax.  That will be fought in Cork during the period of the by-election.  It will be fought in the Press reports in the national papers.  The Government, knowing what they have done on the people by the imposition of this tax&mdash; the seriousness of it can only be measured when you let the Tánaiste out to talk about it&mdash;hope that if in the period of good cheer and peace on earth to men of goodwill they can get something of that kind injected into the people, many of them might have forgotten about the turnover tax by the time they come to vote in January or February next.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the protestations by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the applause from the wings, the plain fact is that there is no question of insulting the memory of the late Deputy Galvin or no question of breaking any previous practice in this House.  We are more than complying with the law which was passed on the initiative of Fianna Fáil.  The simple issue is: is it better to have the election now or is it better to wait until after Christmas? The Taoiseach says it is better to have it now and that we should have it by Christmas.  In the first blush of his return from America he gave that advice to the people.  We say with him &ldquo;You are right.  We ought to have it now.&rdquo;  The people ought to have a chance of pronouncing on the turnover tax.  They were not told about it in the last election.  It was not in operation when the by-election was fought.  It is now in operation and the people of Cork city should be given an opportunity of interpreting the feelings of the people of the country on the question of the turnover tax.  That is why we want the by-election, so that the people can, in fact, express their views on the turnover tax.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said there were certain things he wanted to preserve in Irish life.  One of these things he said &mdash;with a gulp in his speech&mdash;was the kind of decency we had known and practised here without interruption for nearly 40 years.  The Taoiseach ought to remember that decency in Irish public life was very seriously injured in the vote which took place in this House a fortnight ago, and the Taoiseach played a prominent and unworthy part in that odd transaction.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of intervening in the debate until the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1450" /> had the temerity to rise and announce on behalf of the electorate of Cork that they, the electorate, did not wish to have a by-election as soon as possible.  I know that in his inner self the Minister is as convinced as Deputy Casey of the fact that the electorate of Cork are most anxious for an election. I rise mainly to corroborate Deputy Casey's statement that the electorate of Cork are most anxious to get at the throats of the Government, and I know the Taoiseach knows in his heart that is so.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has spoken in this House on many occasions and also from public platforms on our economic policy and has underlined that we must be prepared to take risks.  I wonder why this sudden access of prudence on this occasion, because this appears to be the one risk the Taoiseach is not prepared to take.  I should like to know why.  If the Taoiseach is as convinced as the Minister for Industry and Commerce professes himself to be that the electorate do not want the election, why did he speak in the way he has done today?</P>
      <P>There is one other matter arising out of the performance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he took on the garment of order and spoke of ordinary decencies, suggesting that the Parties on this side were outraging these decencies.  As Deputy Casey and Deputy Norton have pointed out, the first person to moot the by-election before Christmas is the person who does not now want it.  The Taoiseach said that there would most likely be a by-election before Christmas.  Unless he wants to have my constituents voting on Christmas Eve, he should be ready to move the writ now being moved by Deputy Casey.  Since the Taoiseach has already spoken, perhaps some member of his Party will tell us why there has been this change of mind?  Further arising out of this question of the ordinary decencies, I should like to recall that when the late Deputy Frank Fahy died, on 12th July, 1953, the writ was moved on 31st July.</P>

      <P>They would conspire and they have conspired.  The evidence is that the people have not complained about the 2½ per cent in the past two weeks.  They accepted a tax of only 6d. in the pound.  They accepted that they were getting certain reliefs.  Their complaint and the complaint of the ladies who will march around tomorrow is not the 2½ per cent but the profiteering which has been alleged here today.</P>
      <P>It was stated by one Deputy on the Opposition Benches that there was profiteering of up to 16 per cent.  All people who did not constitute the backbone of the Opposition in north-east Dublin or who were not the pals of the Opposition would be against profiteering to that extent which is purely to inflame the people and to influence the way they vote.  We want the election when the people know what they are doing, when they can vote in accordance with the truth and not in accordance with lies and artificially inflated prices encouraged by the Opposition.</P>

The people have a right to decide when they have heard both sides, with everybody's cards on the table.  They have a right to know <Col N="1453" /> what the Opposition taxation policy would be.  They have as much right to decide as a jury would in a court.  A jury before they make a decision, are entitled to hear the evidence from both sides and they also can expect a learned judge to point out the relevant facts, what is material and what is immaterial.  The Opposition do not want that kind of decision.</P>
      <P>Oppositions live on misery; they live on calamities.  I read a short time ago that when an American countryside was struck by a cyclone, the Opposition in Miami were clapping their hands.  The Opposition here would be delighted if the tax jumped to 50 per cent.  They want the people to decide while one side has the cards on the table and they have their cards up their sleeves.  Such an election would be a fraud, equal to the fraud perpetrated in the old rotten boroughs where candidates made people drunk. The Opposition here want to set the electorate drunk with lies.  If the election is held in February or March, people will know what wages they are getting and what prices they have to pay.  An election in any other circumstances, in the circumstances the Opposition want would be a lie and a fraud and would not do justice to anyone.</P>

      <P>I would not have intervened in this debate but for the statement made by Deputy Desmond.  I got up to refute that statement which I consider one that should not have been <Col N="1456" /> made here.  I have been a member of the Fianna Fáil Party for a long time and I am aware of all the facts.  I attended the funeral of the late Deputy Murphy as I would attend the funeral of any other Deputy who was a friend of mine.  We may have our rows in here but when we go outside the House, we are all friends again.  I think the scramble going on between Deputy Dillon and Deputy Corish as to who will get the most kudos out of the unfortunate death of Deputy Galvin is a scandal and a disgrace and is no credit to any member of the House, no matter what his feelings may be.</P>

      <P>When I hear the Taoiseach and other members of his Party lecturing here about decency and dignity, I remember that there are Deputies on these benches whose close relatives laid down their lives in helping the establishment of parliamentary democracy in this country.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, true to say that for us democracy is now a right, but in present circumstances it is not going to be a fact until we drag the Fianna Fáil Party before the electorate.</P>

      <P>I found it very difficult to suppress my indignation when I heard the Taoiseach in his first few <Col N="1458" /> sentences replying to the speech made by Deputy Casey.  I believe that the allegations and insinuations of the Taoiseach were not alone scandalous but fraudulent, but it seems to me that no matter when the Cork by-election is fought, the main plank in the political platform of the Fianna Fáil Party will be the allegation that disrespect has been shown to the late Deputy Galvin. The Taoiseach has talked about precedent and convention.  I want to assure him and the House that in making their decision to move for the issue of the writ, the Labour Party and particularly Deputy Casey were conscious all the time of the respect due to Deputy Galvin and to any Deputy who died.  The Labour Party were very careful to observe all the conventions as far as respect to a late Deputy was concerned.</P>
      <P>We handed in notice of motion in relation to the issue of this writ on last Saturday morning.  Deliberately, we did not do it for Wednesday morning, Thursday morning or Friday morning because we wanted to observe the usual conventions.  We realised that to have it moved here on Wednesday, it would have to be in by Saturday.  Now the month has passed during which it is usual to pay respect to a Deputy who has died.</P>
      <P>I want to say frankly that we decided to break with precedent.  The Minister for External Affairs in a speech in which he had a lot of gesticulations talked about the right of the Taoiseach as Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party to move for the issue of the writ in respect of a vacancy caused by the death of a member of his Party. Despite what the Taoiseach said at the Airport about having the election before Christmas, we knew that the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party had no intention in the wide earthly world of having this election before Christmas.  It was precisely for that reason that we decided to break with precedent and, if we could by putting this motion to the House and having it accepted by the House, force the Government and every other Party in the House to face the Cork electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned by some Deputy, and I think it is the perfect <Col N="1459" /> answer to the Taoiseach, that we are becoming a bit fed up with the fraudulent attitude of the Taoiseach when he talks about the decorum of the House and about precedent and convention.  But does he remember so well to examine his conscience now in relation to the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party when, 19 days after his death, they decided to move the writ to fill the vacancy created by the death of one who had been Ceann Comhairle, the late Deputy Frank Fahy?  Therefore on that score there is no question of precedent.  On the contrary, if precedent was broken, it was broken by the Fianna Fáil Party of which the Taoiseach is a member, when he or they moved to have the vacancy filled 19 days after the death of Deputy Fahy.</P>

If he compares our attitude in moving for this writ with the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in moving the writ to fill the vacancy created by the death of the late Deputy Frank Fahy, he must agree that we certainly showed respect to the memory of the late Deputy Galvin.  He ought to examine his own conscience about the respect shown by the Fianna Fáil Party to the late Deputy Frank Fahy.  We moved this deliberately because, frankly, we want to put the issue of the turnover tax to the people.</P>

      <P>The usual interruption we have had from the Taoiseach lately, and the general one from other members of his Party, is typical of what has been said today: &ldquo;Do you want to make a present of the seat to the Fine Gael Party?&rdquo; We are not concerned with either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Does the Taoiseach want us to disappear from the fight in all these by-elections?We certainly will not leave this by-election to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  We have our own policy to pursue.  Whether we win or lose the election, the important thing for us is to build the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I suggest the Taoiseach is hanging on to office.  He will hang on even with half a vote.  He and the Minister for External Affairs ask us what we will do in the event of no Party receiving an overall majority.  They think they are clever in that.  The Taoiseach forecast in his speech on the No Confidence motion that a time would come when no Party would receive an overall majority.  The Taoiseach is afraid to face up to that sort of situation, where we could say to him: &ldquo;What will you do?  Will you face up to your responsibility as a minority Party?&rdquo; Fine Gael will have the same responsibility; but you are trying now to put that sort of responsibility on to the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>We are interested neither in Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael.  You ask us if we will join a coalition.  I think we make it abundantly clear, prior to the last election, on 6th October, 1961&mdash;and we behaved according to that statement&mdash;that we would not join a coalition.  The Minister for Social Welfare can give up asking us questions of that kind.  Our concern is for the Labour Party and not for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.</P>

One thing clear in all the controversy being created by the Opposition Parties is that they are determined <Col N="1464" /> to go to every extreme not to let the people see what is the alternative to the present Government and what is the alternative method of financing the programmes of the Government.  The more these stunts are tried in the House, the clearer it is becoming to the people that the alternative is what they had before: a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.  That is the circumstance which caused the people to return Fianna Fáil in 1957 with the largest majority any Party ever got in this House.</P>
      <P>It is now becoming clearer to the people that if by any chance they should be misled into creating another indeterminate position as a result of the next general election, the only alternative is a return to the type of government which brought the country to its knees on two previous occasions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton had the honesty to say that this motion was proposed because they had decided this was the most suitable time for them to have this election.  I concede that to them. It is the most suitable time.  They are likely to get in the foreseeable future no more suitable time to have an election.They are afraid to wait until such time as the people have had reasonable experience of the operation of the Government's methods of financing their economic and social programmes. This is a comparatively suitable time for the Opposition, when they have by every conceivable means arranged for themselves a temporary set of favourable circumstances.  It is well know that, as a result of Fine Gael and Labour propaganda and intrigue, they have inspired a certain amount of profiteering, which they are ascribing to Government taxation.</P>

Secondly we always prefer that people should be able to make up their minds on the facts and should be given a fair chance to do so.  That is all we ever ask.  I know this is not going to influence the Opposition Parties in the least because they are incapable of having respect for the intelligence of the people.

It is because of the fact that you also have contempt for the intelligence of the people you purport to represent here.  We are the people for whom the trade unionists of this country vote.  They have sufficient intelligence to realise that here again the Labour Party are attempting to use them as a catspaw; the attempt is to get them to vote for Fine Gael, which is a thing they have never done, and never will do.</P>

They are afraid of their lives to face the public.  It is as simple as that.  The Taoiseach, exercising his usual ghoulish intrigue, may try to interweave a suggestion of bad taste for alleged breach of precedent, but that is just poppycock.  The late Deputy John Galvin was respected by most people in this House and if some of those who were interrupting here to-day had been in Cork city on the morning we buried him, they would have seen a very fine tribute paid to a <Col N="1471" /> man who had done his honest share according to his lights in this House. To suggest that there is some impropriety or some lack of decency in moving for this writ 30 days after his being buried is just so much nonsense. Because of the exigencies of the national situation, we want to challenge the Government in a very large constituency where a diverse cross-section of opinion is available.  To suggest there is some satirical motive or some insult to the sanctity of a man's memory, or even a breach of precedent, is just so much rubbish because, God knows, the Party who preach that now are the very Party who themselves refused to accept the will of the Irish people when they were asked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Sherwin accused the Opposition of enticing people to profiteer.  I notice he accused only the Opposition and I regard that as an admission that he is no longer in the Opposition or independent, that he is now officially Fianna Fáil.  If there has been profiteering, surely it is the fault of Deputy Sherwin and his Minister for Industry and Commerce. Repeatedly, the Labour Party have advocated price control but what did we get by way of reply?  All we got was sidestepping, and Fianna Fáil promises that in all probability cannot be fulfilled.  Certainly these promises will be useless to the people if they have to wait and see.</P>
      <P>We know there has been a huge increase in prices and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has failed in his duty to do something about it. For that reason, the people should be given the opportunity to say whether the Government are right or wrong, and there is no better place in which the people can do that than in Cork city, the constituency which the Minister for Industry and Commerce represents.He should not be afraid to face Cork to determine whether he was right or whether he was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare suggested the election should be held at what he called a suitable time.  He suggested arrangements should be made to have the issue presented clearly. I would be rather interested to ascertain what the Minister meant by &ldquo;a little time&rdquo;.  Surely it is not unreasonable <Col N="1474" /> to take serious notice of the Taoiseach's statement when he indicated after his rest in America that the by-election would be held before Christmas?</P>
    <P>It is apparently suggested now it should be held over until April or May. What will happen in the interim? What has happened up to the present time, since the turnover tax was imposed?What relief will be extended to the people who are being exploited by the effects of this turnover tax?  What will happen to the people about whom Deputy Sherwin purports to be so concerned&mdash;the old age pensioners, who will not get their increase until 1st January?  Is Deputy Sherwin's Minister not prepared to do something about that before 1st January?  I seriously suggest he should.  There have been all sorts of statements, some before the turnover tax was imposed and some since, in the Fianna Fáil attempt to take the people's mind off the turnover tax.  Some of these statements were made deliberately to misrepresent.  We had the Tánaiste over the weekend saying there was an argument going on between Fine Gael and the Labour Party about who should be Taoiseach. That is a deliberate untruth.</P>

Another thing I have to complain about is that there is in this House a Deputy who continues to mumble and very frequently use bad language, but unfortunately it does not reach your ears, Sir, despite the microphones.  That gentleman earlier today said that I was an unknown snob, or an unaccounted for son of a policeman.  My father was a labourer and I am not ashamed to say it.  I do not think that is funny. When I told him that, he invited me outside.  I hold that statements of that kind should not be made.  Perhaps there is something wrong with things here.

      <P>I think the Fianna Fáil Party will be as quick as anybody to agree that there is a strong objection among the people to the turnover tax. Fianna Fáil should bear that in mind. They did not ask the people about it beforehand; they had no mandate for it.  They have now been given the opportunity to ascertain whether the people agree or not.  Prior to its introduction, the people in Dublin North-East had an opportunity of saying how they felt about its proposed introduction and we know what happened.  It is only democratic now to afford the <Col N="1476" /> people of Cork an opportunity of saying how exactly they feel about the tax.  Promises, letters to employers and trade unions do not answer this.  The people should be consulted.  It was they who sent Deputies to this Chamber and it is most unfair for the Taoiseach and his Party to disfranchise the people of Cork as they are now doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of contributing to this debate one way or the other.  However, one has to examine one's conscience on occasions of this sort.  Two weeks ago, I voted in this House on a vote of confidence in relation to the manner in which the Taoiseach was conducting the affairs of this country.  With the exception of the 2½ per cent turnover tax, I said I was satisfied and that I felt the people were satisfied.  However, may I say that looking into the matter and resorting to every bit of moral courage I had, I subsequently voted with the Government?I had voted against the Government in the space of two or three months.</P>
      <P>Various references have been made this afternoon which do not affect me very much because I am not quite so over-sensitive, and when one Deputy refers, as Deputy Collins does, to the four feathers of the Government, as long as he does not suggest one of them is white, I do not mind.  I have listened very carefully and, after the Taoiseach's statement, lest he or anyone else should infer that I am afraid of a general election, I have decided to support the motion in the name of Deputy Casey.  I am supporting the motion because I cannot conceive why the Taoiseach has any hesitation in going to Cork.  If the seat is to be lost, there will be another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do think that your remarks, Sir, a few moments ago were true and that the conduct of the majority of the House this afternoon was reprehensible.  I do claim that in the past, whether as chairman of a football team meeting or anything else, I demanded respect from those who were at the meeting and if I did not get it, I adjourned the meeting. It is deplorable when Deputies who ordinarily carry themselves with dignity can so lose their sense of dignity, <Col N="1477" /> because they have the privilege of this House, as to speak in relation to other Deputies about cheque books and the like.  Is there any Deputy who could honestly imply that a cheque book would make any difference to me?  It did not 40 years ago and it will not now.</P>
    <P>It was said in the debate a few weeks ago that I was supposed to be Fianna Fáil in disguise.  It was never suggested that I was inclined towards Fine Gael.  I did come in here under the caption of Independent, honestly Independent, and if it is to be suggested that my vote with the Government two weeks ago lessened my independence, perhaps tonight's vote will offset that.  I am not motivated by that but I cannot see why the Taoiseach will not say: &ldquo;Yes; we will have the by-election in Cork before Christmas.&rdquo;  It is not too much to ask.  He knows when he is going to have it.  I am satisfied he does not want to put it off.  Personally, I would not like to be contesting an election in December or January.  It is not the ideal time.  I am not a member of a Party and no Party in this House can insinuate that I am partisan.</P>
    <P>I am on the official records as stating two weeks ago in regard to the turnover tax that I was influenced by the assurance of the Taoiseach that any privation caused to the people would be remedied.  I am disappointed that there are not sufficient inspectors going around the shops in Dublin trying to prevent what is gross racketeering.We had <i>Dublin Opinion</i> and other such magazines depicting Government inspectors looking over hedges checking on the farmers.  They are not checking on the shopkeepers who are not adhering to the 2½ per cent.  I have stated that I believe that a purchase tax of some sort is a very good thing, if it is not imposed on food. Why cannot we decide on units of 5/-, 10/-, or 20/- and thus facilitate putting a tax on each item?</P>
    <P>I reiterate my confidence in the Taoiseach in his general approach but certainly not in the manner of his approach to the House this evening.  I believe&mdash;and I am on the official record as having said this&mdash;it was not the <Col N="1478" /> Opposition who won North-East Dublin, that it was the 2½ per cent tax that won it.  If the same thing happens in Cork, the Government will then realise it was a mistake to tax food.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputies will not continue to approach this matter in the unfair manner which they have adopted so far.  I had great respect for the late Deputy Galvin.  He was a very good friend of mine.  I did think&mdash;I have somewhat changed in my opinion now &mdash;that there was a type of indecent haste, a rush to capitalise on the death of a person, but today we have evidence that it is not indecent.  I trust that before we adjourn tonight, the Taoiseach will accede to the appeal I made to him to set a date for the by-election, to go out and win.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one simple issue at stake here now.  Are we to turn our backs completely on tradition?  The Taoiseach has opposed Deputy Casey's motion on the ground that since this Dáil was founded, it was always the Party to which the late Deputy belonged who moved the motion.  The question before the House is not the turnover tax but whether we are to throw this tradition to the wind.  That is the sole issue we are concerned with.</P>
      <P>When the by-election is held&mdash;this week, next week or the week after&mdash; does not matter all that much to people who have been in public life for a long time.  We are here to-day and may not be back again.  After every election, about 25 per cent of Deputies do not come back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that our traditional procedure should be observed.  It is a dangerous precedent that is being established here tonight.  While I may be guilty of some heat in the interruptions, I have never been guilty of personal abuse of any of my opponents but I would like to say that while it may be the Labour Party's turn tonight to introduce this motion, it may be our turn in less than two years' time.  You are establishing a precedent now that may be used against any other Party here.  I am a great believer in tradition and in the procedures that have grown up in this Assembly since it was established by the will of the Irish people and, while <Col N="1479" /> it may be good political practice for the Labour Party to get Deputy Casey to introduce this motion now, it might be equally good tactics for Fianna Fáil to do the same to the Labour Party in a year's time.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Casey had moved the motion, he sat down and the Ceann Comhairle asked who was seconding the motion and the Leader of the Opposition did so.</P>

      <P>It was the Leader of the Opposition who seconded it. Deputy Dillon got up and said he seconded the motion.  Whether it had been seconded before that, I did not hear.  What Deputy Dillon has done here tonight is to establish another dangerous precedent.  What he has done here tonight may be used as a precedent by some other political Party to take political advantage of him.  In political life, the wind blows very frequently from one way to the other but it frequently blows to the advantage of the Opposition.  I hope we will never come to the condition in which we would do what has been done here tonight and I am sorry that we are breaking a tradition in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for my Party to say whether the election will be held now or at some future date, but I want to reply to some of the statements that have been made here.  We have had a lot of talk about going to the country and having a decision from the people on the turnover tax, but let anyone in Ireland with any political savvy ask himself why Fianna Fáil introduced that turnover tax.  I am a politician, as is the Taoiseach and all the other members of this Party.  We are alert enough to know that when we increase taxation on the people, we are going to lose favour.  Do you think we are doing this out of spite?  That is the <Col N="1480" /> way in which it has been misrepresented to the people.</P>
    <P>I admit that temporarily our political stock may have suffered as a result of this but we are a national Party and as a Party concerned with the well-being of our people, we are putting the national interest before our own interests.  Every one of us is a politician and it would be easy for us to go before the people and say that everything in the garden is lovely. Every member of the Opposition knows that it is not in our interest politically to increase taxation, but what are we to do?  We are putting the national interests before our own interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker expressed his concern with precedent and his concern for tradition.This House has been functioning here for over 40 years.  The Party of which Deputy Burke is a member stayed outside the House for a number of years and did their utmost to be-little it in the minds of the public. They came in eventually in 1927 and when, in 1927, there was a vacancy in the House because of the death of a Deputy, they moved a motion of No Confidence in the then Government. They did not wait for the filling of that vacancy because they knew that when it was filled, there would be a vote against their motion.  That motion was defeated by the casting vote of the Chair and the then President of the Executive Council held a by-election and won it.  He then dissolved the Dáil and went to the country and got a majority from the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the time when Ministers and leaders of Government were concerned with the views of the people and were never willing to shelter behind any kind of a majority in this House in order to avoid consulting the people.  They talk about precedent. Forty years of Parliamentary history have passed inside this chamber.  By-elections have occurred from time to time and once a vacancy has occurred, the motion to move the writ has been tabled.  This is the first time a motion to move a writ has been opposed. Here tonight a precedent of many years' standing is being broken by the Fianna Fáil Party. <Col N="1481" /> They have decided to oppose a motion for the issue of a writ for the holding of a by-election.  I do not suppose that anywhere where there is constitutional parliamentary government, such an example as this exists, that a Government Party or indeed any Party should suggest that a vacancy in the Dáil should not be filled.  To me, it is incomprehensible.  Never before have we witnessed a Party inside this House endeavouring to use a majority to prevent a vacancy being filled.  That is a most dangerous precedent.  Why is it being done?  All pretence is swept away now.  The Taoiseach started off by saying that he was concerned with decency and respect for the dead.  Still as the debate went on, it began to emerge that the real reason Fianna Fáil are opposing this motion is that it is politically inopportune for them to have an election.  In other words, they would lose it.  If that is carried to a logical conclusion, no writs for by-elections might be moved ever in the life of a particular Dáil.  If a Party with a majority feel that the political winds are blowing against them, they can prevent the safety valve of public opinion being used.</P>
    <P>By-elections are important.  If we are to ensure that the Irish people continue to respect our institutions, we must avail of the constitutional means which are there, that is, that from time to time if a vacancy occurs, the people are consulted and allowed to express their opinion.  If we are to have what clearly Fianna Fáil would desire to have, a situation in which, because they have a majority, they may follow any policy they decide should be followed and at the same time prevent the people being consulted when a by-election is possible, then the danger may be that a move will take place outside and against this House itself. The House was strong enough 35 years ago to resist such a move when a concerted effort was made at one time to tear it down.  It is important that those who may have at that time been party to that move and are now inside the House should not, by blundering and indeed by cowardice, create a similar situation.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that a motion for the <Col N="1482" /> issue of a by-election writ should be opposed, and the people who oppose it are certainly not serving proper democratic and parliamentary government.</P>
    <P>May I refer to one other thing?  It is part of the Fianna Fáil technique.  I know it well myself, and from bitter experience.  They are inclined to say something whether it is true or false and by dint of repeating it, get people to accept what is said.  The Minister for Social Welfare in the course of this debate stated that the Opposition &mdash;and I think he said both the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party&mdash;had induced or been party to profiteering by traders and shopkeepers.  The Labour Party have spoken for themselves.I want to say on behalf of the Fine Gael Party that there is not one word of truth in that charge.  On the contrary, here in this House when the Budget Statement was read by the Minister for Finance last April, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the current leader of Fine Gael and the next leader of this country.  In the course of the Budget discussion, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party foretold that one effect of the turnover tax would be to induce an upward spiral of prices. He was faced by the statement made on behalf of the Government by the Taoiseach and subsequently by the Minister for Finance that competition would keep prices down and in fact the turnover tax would be absorbed by shopkeepers and traders themselves. We know that not to be so and we foretold that what has happened would happen.  If ever anyone or any political Party had warning of the errors they were committing, this Government and this Party had warning of those errors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke says that the Taoiseach and the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party are all politicians.  Of course they are.  It does not take any oratory from Deputy Burke to convince us that Fianna Fáil did not bring in the turnover tax for the sake of making themselves popular.  Of course they did <Col N="1483" /> not.  It was a mistake, a cardinal error, made by them.  They did not think it out clearly.  It appealed to them as being a cute political move at the time and they did not see its ramifications. Now Pandora's box has been opened. The Taoiseach has given the green light for everything.  We are to have an upward spiral of prices and all the rest of it, just because of the error made in the last Budget.</P>
    <P>In any event, here we have tonight the regrettable spectacle of a Government Party breaking all precedent in the parliamentary life of this House and opposing a writ for a by-election. That is unheard of.  It never happened before.  I remember well some years after I came into this House when the late Deputy Mongan died.  He had been for many years a revered and respected member of this House.  I do not deny in the slightest that the particular by-election that was caused by his death could not have been won at that time by the Fine Gael Party and it was not convenient for us to move the writ to have the vacancy filled. Indeed, we would have liked, if we could, to have avoided the necessity, but the Fianna Fáil Party were out for the seat and declared when a month had scarcely passed that if we did not table that writ, they were going to do it and of course we moved the writ.  The by-election was held and a new Fianna Fáil Deputy came into this House.</P>
    <P>Political expediency served their book at that time.  There was no tut-tutting from the Taoiseach about convention and respectability and regard for the dead Deputy.  There was no talk about important parliamentary precedents or anything of that kind.  As long as it suited Fianna Fáil, that writ was going to be moved either by us or, if we did not, by them. Now here is a queer kettle of fish. The Taoiseach who loves elections, the man who learned rough stuff in America, has come back here full of fight and will not fight.  The Government Party are going to win every election.  They always win according to Deputy Burke.  They are bored winning.  But they will not have an election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" /> For the first time, the writ in this democratic Parliament is opposed by a Government who feel they have a majority.  I do not know what the people will think.  I know it would be wise to use the safety valve there at the moment and allow the people to give an expression of their opinion in Cork.  If the Government succeed in doing the undemocratic thing they are trying to do by preventing this writ being moved, it will serve them no good.  I prophesy it will cause more annoyance in Cork and elsewhere.They will not stave off an election.  Inevitably, this Dáil is becoming unrepresentative, and once that happens, it is time for a general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion.  It is significant that the Taoiseach interrupted one Deputy to point out that, if this motion were carried, it would mean a general election.  That was meant as a threat to the Independent Deputies who, in their wisdom or otherwise, are keeping the Government in office. It was a deliberate attempt at political blackmail in order to hold on to office.  The unfortunate Independents who are keeping the Government in office should realise that the Taoiseach's sole ambition at this stage is to hang on as long as possible in the hope that the fortunes of Fianna Fáil will improve sufficiently to allow him have an election next May or June and to jettison the Independents on whom he depends for his political life at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politically speaking, the Taoiseach's arguments here this evening can only be described as a bag of eels.  He sought to extract the last ounce of sympathy from the public because of the death of a Deputy in Cork and to say it was a desecration to suggest the by-election should be held so soon. That was his opening gambit.  But when it was brought home to him that in 1953, when a member of his own Party died, the by-election was held within 19 days, he changed his course and said he did not mean that at all.  His argument now was that only the Party to which the deceased Deputy belonged could move the writ. <Col N="1485" /> On that basis, the question of time no longer arises.  The by-election writ would be moved within 24 hours if the deceased Deputy belonged to Fianna Fáil and it suited them to move it.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in this raiméis and humbug about the so-called traditions of this House.  If that is the type of tradition to be held up to the public in the future, it is time an end was put to it.  It is sheer hypocrisy to suggest there is a tradition that only the Party to which the deceased Deputy belonged is entitled to move the writ. There is nothing in the Constitution about it or about Party politics.  If an Independent Deputy dies, who is to move the writ?  He is here with as much right and prestige as the member of any of the major Parties.  It is the right of any Deputy after a certain period to move the writ.  That is envisaged in the Constitution, which was quoted by the Minister for External Affairs.  If he goes up to the Park, he will get six slaps for his lack of knowledge at present.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of profiteering. Interestingly enough, it came mainly from the Fianna Fáil benches.  They admit now that a spate of profiteering is rife in the country.  They suggest it is going on because of inspiration from the Opposition Parties.  Did anybody ever hear a more ridiculous proposition?Who are the people profiteering, according to Fianna Fáil?  I have here a list of the biggest companies in this city&mdash;insurance companies, industrial companies and big firms&mdash;all of whom subscribed to a petition to the public for funds for Fianna Fáil.</P>

I have them all there on a list issued by the Fianna Fáil General Election Finance Committee.Is it not true that the majority of the industrialists in this country, with the protection and featherbedding given to them by Fianna Fáil over the years, have been in the Taoiseach's pocket since these industries were started?  Is it not true to say that they have now stabbed their protector <Col N="1486" /> in the back by overcharging and profiteering?Have they not kept Fianna Fáil in office by their big subscriptions over the years?  Now they have betrayed the man who protected them. It is sad for the Taoiseach to find that the very people to whom he gave an opportunity to batten on the Irish public, who have overcharged over the years without even waiting for a turnover tax, are the very people who have let him down.</P>
      <P>I know for a fact that Fianna Fáil are as sore as can be with their business friends who have let them down. The argument put to these people by Fianna Fáil over the past two months has been: &ldquo;Why did you not wait until the turnover tax was in operation a while before putting up your prices in order to have your own crack out of it?  Why did you do it at present?&rdquo; That is the line of approach Fianna Fáil have made to their business associates in this city and throughout the country: &ldquo;You let us down; you should have waited until the coast was clear before profiteering.&rdquo;  These people give no thanks.  There is no mercy in politics.  They were protected by Fianna Fáil in the past, but they have now decided they have got the most they can and that they will overcharge while they have the opportunity before Nemesis overtakes them.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, the Taoiseach has sworn confidence in competition as the best means of keeping down prices.  I do not know how many times he has told Deputy Dr. Browne and myself, when we suggested price control machinery, that we were wild men trying to do something wrong, trying to bring in dangerous practices that were in operation behind the Iron Curtain.  His answer always was that the only way to prevent profiteering was healthy competition.  Now he has found there is no competition. He is on record as saying that price control machinery will not work. Therefore, all avenues of escape are closed to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons why I want to see the people getting an opportunity of passing judgment on this Government is to prevent the idea circulating that the Minister for Industry and <Col N="1487" /> Commerce is serious in setting up price control machinery.  The Government have said they do not believe in the efficacy of price control machinery. Therefore, when the Minister says he will set up such machinery, we know it is only for the purpose of gulling the public.  You must believe in something in order to operate it efficiently. The public should be made aware of that and given an opportunity of expressing their decision on it without delay.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach arrived back at Shannon, with his chest out and full of American corn, he said he would possibly have the by-election before Christmas.  Now it is a crime for anybody else to suggest it should be held before Christmas.  He has decided he does not want to face the public on this issue.  To my mind, it is not a question of being fair to the public; it is a question of deceiving the public. This Government are a minority Government.They are not there with the good wishes of the majority of the people.  Tonight we have seen the Taoiseach show the iron fist when he said: &ldquo;If this motion is carried, there will be a general election.&rdquo;  He sought to put a shiver of fear down the backs of every Independent in the House.  I should like to congratulate Deputy Carroll on his honesty in saying that he was not going to be intimidated by the Taoiseach's blackmailing tactics. Deputy Carroll said he would vote for this motion tonight.  It is a terrible comment on public life when the only way a Government can stay in office is by political blackmail.  The Taoiseach would be doing a service to the community &mdash; perhaps not to Fianna Fáil&mdash;by going to the country tonight rather than having a by-election.  If he does that, he would give the general public the most welcome Christmas box I can think of.</P>

      <P>My remarks on the motion will be brief.  I rise mainly to contradict one or two statements made by Government speakers earlier.  The Taoiseach himself opened his attack on the motion, moving from one foot to the other.  He said first that it was <Col N="1488" /> not right that a motion should be moved in so short a space of time after a Deputy's death.  When it was subsequently pointed out that the Fianna Fáil Party had, in fact, moved the motion on the death of the late Deputy Frank Fahy inside 19 days, he changed his tactics and said it was the prerogative of the Party to which the deceased Deputy belonged to move the writ.</P>

      <P>I have been here practically all the afternoon and heard practically all the speeches made.  The Taoiseach started on that theme and it was echoed by the people behind him who spoke.  One of the remarkable things in this House is that when a debate such as this is taking place, a number of people come and perch themselves on those benches opposite, people who have never spoken from the time they came here, and in unison, they hurl insults at speakers on this side.  Is it not extraordinary that if they want to speak, they do not stand up and do it like men instead of keeping up this crying and caterwauling behind the Taoiseach?</P>

      <P>There are a few exceptions, I admit, but it is nearly all from the benches behind the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach's second point was that the moving of the writ was the prerogative of the Party to which the deceased Deputy belonged.  Up to now, apparently, it has almost been that way; but there is this point, and it has been made on at least two occasions: if we follow that to its logical conclusion, there would be no onus on them to move the writ at all.</P>

      <P>Our bush telegraph is fairly effective and we are told that Fianna Fáil have no intention of moving the writ as long as they can get away with it.  The jibe was also hurled by the Taoiseach that we were trying to present the late Deputy's shoes to the Fine Gael Party.  Let me remind the Taoiseach&mdash;he will not forget this in a hurry&mdash;that in the 1957 general election, Fianna Fáil got 15,000 first preference votes in County Meath and in 1959 when they fought a by-election, they scraped home only by the skin of their teeth, and not over Fine Gael but over a Labour candidate.I should like to tell the Taoiseach that if he watches what is going to happen in Cork, he will probably see a repetition of that there, except that it will be a question of Labour scraping home over Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the turnover tax has been mentioned and we had the man in shining armour riding out in front of the Taoiseach prepared to slay all his enemies, the Independent Deputy from Dublin city.  He made a statement that is so ridiculous that it hardly merits an answer at all, that the people in the Labour Party&mdash;he particularly mentioned the Labour Party&mdash;tried to incite shopkeepers to raise prices. Obviously, he does not read the papers because even the <i>Irish Press</i> has given credit to Labour speakers again and again in this House and all over the country in condemning any attempt by anybody wrongly to raise prices.  If that is supposed to be encouragement <Col N="1490" /> to raise prices, I do not know where Deputy Sherwin gets his idea.  He obviously wanted to say something which would tie him up with the Party and I suppose that was the best line he could take.  Let me make clear that we in the Labour Party are determined to oppose, on any occasion, every attempt to extort money from the public, whether that is done by the Government or by the shopkeepers at the behest of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am not a great believer in tradition because there are a great many traditions here and in many other countries that are not what they are supposed to be.  If everybody adhered to them, we would still be walking and would have no roads and no means of transport.  We would probably be cooking our food at a turf fire or a wood fire.  There is such a thing as evolution and as the years go by, changes have been made, changes for the better.  After tonight's debate, the Taoiseach will probably be very much wiser and will probably realise that this business of trying to maintain that there is only one way to do anything, that is, as it has always been done, is all cod.  In fact, no harm can be done at all in having a change.  I am prepared on behalf of the Labour Party, if the Taoiseach is so concerned about this division, and if it hurts him so much to feel that someone, other than Fianna Fáil, should propose to move the writ, to withdraw the motion for the issue of the writ if the Fianna Fáil Party will move it in this House tonight.</P>

      <P>No, Sir.  I think none of us can be very pleased with the manner in which my motion has been debated here this evening.  The Taoiseach set the climate, and a very bad climate it was, as the first speaker on behalf of the Government in reply to my motion.  Apparently he was not prepared to discuss the motion, or to invite the House to consider the motion, on its merits alone.  Rather did he see fit to indulge in a personal <Col N="1491" /> attack on me; he pretended, indeed, that he was in a position to lecture me on the decencies of public life.</P>
      <P>None of us here is, I think, over-sensitive, but anybody in public life is sensitive to the extent that, if he feels there is a genuine criticism of and an allegation against his conduct, privately and publicly, he gets a bit worried about it.  I can tell the Taoiseach that the value I place on his criticism is to disregard it entirely.  I have been in this House for the past ten years.  I have been in public life in Cork for the past 13 or 14 years. I should be worried what the people of Cork thought of me and about my conduct, publicly and privately, and I am prepared to put it to the test in Cork, but I am not particularly worried about the opinion expressed by the Taoiseach, with his tongue in his cheek, shedding crocodile tears for the late Deputy Galvin.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy was a personal friend of mine and I am prepared to put that to the test.  I would be worried about what the relatives, family and personal friends of the late Deputy would think of me if I were, as alleged, guilty of any misdemeanour in moving this motion here.  I am satisfied in my own mind that that is not so and the Taoiseach then cannot assume the role of the person who should attack me and say I have ulterior motives in doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My motion tabled here today was simply a reiteration of the point of view expressed by the Taoiseach on his return from America.  None of us knew until we read in the paper what point of view he might have regarding the Cork by-election.  When he was interviewed at Dublin Airport, on his return, he said that he felt that the ordinary democratic process should take its course, that he was not a bit worried whether he won or lost the seat in Cork.  He expressed the view actually that he would lose it, and rightly so; but, irrespective of that, he thought the election should be held, and there would not be a general election.  Subsequently, of course, he was pulled by the coat and his colleague, the Minister for External <Col N="1492" /> Affairs, who dreads a by-election in Cork, and his colleague, the Tánaiste, must have said to him: &ldquo;You must be daft to make a statement like that at Dublin Airport&rdquo;.  It was then the Taoiseach proceeded to mend his hand.</P>
    <P>I well appreciate the difficulties of the Taoiseach in this matter.  First of all, he does not want an election anywhere at the moment, particularly not in Cork.  He does not want a by-election in Cork and there is a political advantage for him in postponing it. Over and above that consideration, all of us are aware of the difficulty he has in selecting the candidate to carry the banner of Fianna Fáil for the constituency.I shall not delve into that. Indeed I would not attempt to increase the worries of the Taoiseach in that respect but, quite obviously, there is no first-class candidate willing to put his head on the old chopping block to get it knocked off in a by-election in Cork before Christmas.  We know the jockeying that is going on at the moment.  We know the intrigues within the Party regarding who should be the candidate, or the fall guy.  Indeed the Taoiseach has worries in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce made an unworthy contribution here, unworthy of Deputy Jack Lynch, and unworthy of the office he holds at the moment.  He also has his worries. All we are saying here is that we believe there should be a by-election in Cork.  The people demand it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce challenged my authority to say that on behalf of the people of Cork and reminded me that I was a Deputy with 6,000 votes.  Deputy Barrett and Deputy Anthony Barry also represent Cork.  Surely the three of us represent some major section of the electorate of Cork and all of us say that the people of Cork demand that there should be a by-election.</P>
    <P>I challenged the Lord Mayor of Cork, Deputy MacCarthy, to get up here and say the people do not want it. Did we hear from him?  I was here most of the evening and he certainly did not say anything while I was here. Of course, he is too clever.  He knows well the view expressed by Deputy Barrett, Deputy Barry and myself is <Col N="1493" /> the correct view: the people want an election; they want an opportunity of expressing their opinion on the turnover tax and on the activities of the Government generally.  They want that and they should have it.  It is no answer to that public demand for the Taoiseach to endeavour to engage in the niceties of the situation, to exercise himself with some old outworn precedent and tradition to be debated across the floor of the House because somebody did such a thing on such a date and someone else did something else on another date.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the people of Gurranebraher and Spangle Hill are not interested in traditions and precedents in this House. What they are interested in is the fact that they are paying more for their bread, for their butter, for their tea, for their sugar, for their boots, for their shoes, for their clothing.  That is what they are interested in and, if the law of this country and the Standing Orders of this House permit me, as a Deputy representing the city of Cork, to move the writ and to express the view of the people of Cork that there should be an election, then I should be failing in my duty if I failed to do so.</P>
    <P>Our Party Whip has made an offer: we will certainly not force a vote if the Taoiseach accepts the offer.  If he is so concerned about the niceties of the situation, with which, frankly, we are not concerned, and if it will salve his conscience, we will withdraw our motion, on condition that he forthwith tonight tables a motion moving the writ for the by-election in Cork before Christmas so that the people in the city of Cork will have an opportunity of expressing their views.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody has been led astray by the arguments put forward by spokesmen on the Government benches.  We all know that at the moment, up and down the country, in every constituency, the matter of the <Col N="1494" /> turnover tax is the issue to which people are addressing their minds and on which they are expressing their opinions.  It so happens that, through the unfortunate and deeply lamented death of Deputy Galvin, it falls to the people of the city of Cork to exercise their vote in that regard, and I think the Taoiseach, if he believes in what he says, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is a Deputy for Cork city, should decide to hold the election immediately and send down clients like our friend, the Minister for Transport and Power, to make in Patrick Street some of the statements and the claptrap we have been hearing at meetings of chambers of commerce and elsewhere where they cannot be challenged.</P>

They might instead go through the whole democratic process of putting the issue before the people who are, after all, responsible for sending us here.  I invite them to come to Cork to hold this election now and I think I can guarantee them if they do that they will get a Christmas box in Cork they will not forget for a while.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last night, we had begun to discuss the situation in relation to grain.  Everybody who knows anything about agriculture will agree that we want a high level of grain as well as a high cattle population, that one can run with the other, that the farm with a high level of grain can also have a high population of cattle, that you will not get a proportionate increase in the number of cattle that can be maintained in each year if you drop the grain acreage.</P>
      <P>The grain acreage last year dropped, as a result, in my submission, of the bad management of the Minister for Agriculture, by 6.4 per cent.  Worse than that, the highest priced grain that we in this country sell is wheat.  It is high priced because, presumably, it is charged in to the industrial wage structure to produce a price for flour for home consumption.  There was a reduction of 26.3 per cent in the acreage in the wheat, or 82,700 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider what Fianna Fáil said about a similar reduction in wheat-growing in the days gone by.  I quote from the front page of the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 23rd October, 1955, when the late Deputy Tom Walsh produced an article which got banner headlines: &ldquo;Wheat, beet, potatoes incentive has gone.  The drop in wheat production of 100,000 tons in last year represents a loss of about £2,800,000 to wheat growers.&rdquo;  The present position is that we have a greater drop than that.  It is logical for me to say now to the Minister of Agriculture that <Col N="1498" /> the incentive is gone and that there has been a loss to the farmers of up to £3 million in respect of the reduction in the acreage of wheat.  Let us add to that the fact that potatoes at the moment are virtually unsaleable. The position may have improved in the past few weeks but during the entire harvesting period, they have sold at not as much as would provide the cost of harvesting much less the high cost of sowing, spraying and generally maintaining the crop in the ground.</P>
    <P>If I say the Minister for Agriculture is responsible for this reduction, it is only fair that I should give my reasoning.Before the 1962 harvest, the Minister lauded the fact that there had been discussion, and to some extent agreement, with the millers in relation to wheat and between the millers and the farmers' organisations. While they did get together and while they did set up the Central Cereal Laboratory, I want to make it quite clear that the responsibility still devolves on the Minister for Agriculture to see to it that the wheat farmer or producer of any sort of agricultural produce gets the highest price possible for the greatest amount of his goods.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Minister in doing as he did and said he would do, wiping his hands completely of this issue, created the situation in the harvest of 1962 where the results of this Central Cereal Laboratory were followed strictly and rigidly with too high a rejection rate in 1962.  I do not submit that the wheat grown in 1962 was 100 per cent fit for milling but I do submit that a greater proportion could have been used for flour.  As a result, the low price that pertained, even though the Government did give some little help, meant that the farmer was so disappointed with what he received that he sowed 82,700 acres less at a loss of about £25 an acre.  If we take the old rule of thumb measure of one ton to a statute acre and the price at £3 a barrel, it means a loss of about £25 an acre.  The Minister, in wiping his hands of the whole operation, left the farmer in the position that he reduced his sowing of high-priced grain by 82,700 acres or 26.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> The Minister had an agreement in relation to grain whereby he gave to a particular group the right to import all the offals free of any binding clause and also to import 180,000 tons of coarse grain.  In return, they undertook to take up the barley crop.  All that is passed now and I do not propose to go into the rights or wrongs, but it is wrong that this situation should exist as it did.  It was only the views of people who matter in the agricultural industry that caused the Minister to change the position this year.  When he did change it, he created a situation in which An Board Gráin are charged with the taking over of the barley crop but what will happen on 1st January is that they will not get that much of it because a great measure will by then be taken over by other interests.  Pollard imports and wheat offal imports mounted to an extraordinary degree in the past three months.</P>
    <P>The Minister had not placed restrictions on the import of Russian offals up to 31st March next and as a result of inordinate importation, the price of Irish pollard has fallen.  I know the idea is that the farmer is entitled to get his feeding stuffs at world prices but I deliberately use the words &ldquo;inordinate imports&rdquo; at low prices in this connection.  This is the reason the price of Irish flour has increased and the price of Irish offals has decreased.</P>
    <P>It was a Fianna Fáil Government who, in 1953, set up an inter-departmental committee that produced a figure of 300,000 tons of Irish wheat to be grown each year.  Due to the mismanagement of the Minister and the Government, that figure has now fallen to 265,000 tons and the slipshod methods of the Minister over the past few years have resulted in a situation in which that figure could be further reduced.  Our policy here is to use the maximum quantity of Irish wheat and it will be the policy of the Fine Gael Government, when they attain office, to make every effort to see that the maximum quantity of Irish wheat is included in the grist.</P>
    <P>To say that we should have a 100 per cent Irish wheat loaf is saying <Col N="1500" /> something that is wrong because we have good years and bad years, but when you reduce the quantity of Irish wheat in the loaf below 75 per cent, it should be possible also to drop your quality standards and allow the Irish farmer to benefit from increased industrial wages and to sell his produce at a price which will be charged to the Irish consumer in the price of the loaf.</P>
    <P>We believe that there is a necessity for a relatively small sum in subsidisation of the transport of barley from places such as East Cork, where they have a surplus, to the feeding areas in the west of Ireland and in Monaghan and Cavan, so that the farmer in these areas will not have to pay too high a price for his compound feeding stuffs.  The Minister, in not facing up to that matter, has let down the farmers and a change would not be out of place.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to horticultural products has come to the fore over the past 12 or 18 months. In this connection, one must immediately consider the efforts of Lt.-General Costello to process Irish vegetables by the accelerated freeze dry system and to market them in Britain and on overseas markets. There is a feeling growing up in the country over the past few months that things are not going as they should go and that the grandiose statements made up to that time have had a brake put on them as far as the Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>It has come to the point that we had in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> of 19th October a cartoon by that very clever artist, Warner, in which we had vege-table factories being put up as a poster show on the right and another poster being put up across that by a person very like the Minister.  In another corner, there is a person carrying something very like a crozier and in another corner we have a person like Lt.-General Costello smoking his pipe as usual and smiling at the whole business.</P>
    <P>We want to know what the Government intend to do about these factories and we want to know why a grant was refused to the Glencolumbkille Co-operative in County Donegal.  What was the speech made by a member of <Col N="1501" /> the Hierarchy as a result of which there were consultations with the Taoiseach and the Minister as a further result of which a certain undertaking was given?  Is it true that a grant has been given for the setting up of a small, one-unit, experimental factory which will not use Irish vegetables?  If that is so, what is the purpose of the whole operation?</P>
    <P>We do not know on this side of the House, but we know this much, that the quota figure for the amount of labour on the farm is seven hours in relation to those projects for every hour in the factory.  A figure has been mentioned also of 240 people employed in each factory.  We know that the figures in relation to the expenditure involved when presented in the public press compare far better than with some of the industrial efforts&mdash;I should say solely industrial efforts&mdash;using no farm produce that is available in large quantity in this country and produced by Irish hands&mdash;which have the enthusiastic support of the Government.</P>
    <P>There is also in relation to these horticultural products the fact that we on the east coast are right opposite the north-western ports of Britain.  We have Manchester, Liverpool, Bradford and all those cities where there is a standing market for fresh vegetables. In Drogheda town during the last winter, an ordinary citizen who happened to have a contact through marriage in Manchester exported in containers sizeable quantities of vegetables&mdash;carrots, parsnips, and even cabbage&mdash;to those markets, and paid higher prices to the farmers than had been obtaining up to that time.</P>
    <P>Within three miles of where I live, there is a Dutchman who every day at six o'clock in the morning rings up the various markets in Manchester, Belfast and even in Dublin.  Before 10 o'clock, his lorry has left for where the best prices are.  He can sell his carrots, his brussels sprouts, his celery and his parsnips and other vegetables at enhanced prices, live well and have a figure of between 50 and 100 acres in this production and a higher level of employment per acre than I have seen anywhere else in the country.  If <Col N="1502" /> this is possible, I asked the Minister if he was wide awake as to the cost of transferring from eastern ports here to the north west of Britain this sort of vegetable but I could not be answered. The packing was so different and there were all those variations so that he could not indicate the cost of transfer.</P>
    <P>The complaint at the moment is that there is too high a cost of transport.  If the Minister wants a figure, I will quote as high as £7 a ton for some of these commodities.  I want to ask the Minister if there is an answer to that, whether there should be an effort to have some service, perhaps subsidised in the initial years, to give a volume of goods which would mean a reduced cost of transport and a market for our farmers which is not now available to them.  These are things which perhaps should be done and are not being done.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister on Tuesday, 12th November, what capital was invested in the past five years by commercial interests and co-operative societies in undertakings to process, pack or market agricultural products. The answer he gave me was that the information requested was not available.I wonder if I asked the same sort of question of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Taoiseach in respect of purely industrial undertakings, would they say that that information was not available?  I submit it would be readily available.  The Minister has now alerted his Department as to the awareness they should have of these developments and the necessity for them.  Does the world not know that more and more goods are being bought in a package and that the name on the outside signifies the standard of quality?  When I began my remarks last evening, I said that constancy of supply and certainly of quality was the keynote of agricultural production.  What effort is the Minister making to have this done?</P>
    <P>The small farms of the west have been the subject of reports, but there are small farms everywhere.  These horticultural products are commodities that could help wonderfully there. There are other things that could be a help.  I had hoped the Minister would make his contribution this year as a <Col N="1503" /> result of the report produced on the small western farms and that he would have something to say about them, but he had nothing of any consequence that I could see.  There were things that could have been done.  One of them was something that was announced before the last inter-Party Government left office, which was legislation that we would have passed to enable small farmers who had a charge on their holdings which had been defunct or not claimed for a certain number of years to remove those charges without great legal cost, so placing them in the position of being able to go to the bank manager or to the Agricultural Credit Corporation to get a small loan. Those financial interests are not interested in a second charge because a second charge interferes with their opportunities to collect.  We know that the vast amount of capital that has to be injected into agriculture will bear hardest on those in the small farms. If the Minister had announced this policy which we had decided to provide and had put it into practice, he could have helped.</P>
    <P>If he had said that he was prepared to set up, as has happened in two places in this country already, communal pig-fattening stations from which sows of good quality could be given out to small farmers who could feed them and get them to farrow and sell back the bonhams to those communal stations at a fixed price per lb., it would have been a great help.  In one instance that I know of, you can get a sow for £35 and when she has farrowed, you can come back with the bonham and get 2/- a lb.  A good bonham is 50 lbs. weight so you are guaranteed a minimum of £5 per bonham.  That can be continued on the second and third farrowing and you can find out if she is going to have a large number of bonhams in each litter or not, of the right sort or not, and as you must bring back the sow then, there can be culling.  The bad one can be pushed aside and the good one used again, and as the mating is done with boars that are available at the communal pig-fattening stations and they are proven stock, you will get your pig quality up and the small farmer <Col N="1504" /> can earn good money by doing a job that cannot be done well in a big unit. There is only one big unit I know of in the British Isles where they farrow all their own sows, that is, McGuckians of Cloughmills.  All the others like Jordans of Lisburn let their sows out to have them farrowed where individual attention could be given to them on small farms.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had only said that he would do this in the west and that there would be perhaps increased grants in respect of housing for those sows, he could have done something. If he had said that he would free those holdings from the old charge of 10/- a week for the sister in America who never had claimed for 20 years, and would so allow the people to have some borrowing power, he could have done something.  These are the things the Minister has not said he will do.</P>
    <P>It is also quite true that as far as the small farmers are concerned, two businesses set up by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Agriculture, namely Eggsports and the five county co-operative which he set up for the marketing of poultry flesh, are two of the main ways in which he could give a contribution towards easing the lot of the small farmer. The small farmer who produces turkeys finds that there is a glut at Christmas.  There must be somebody who could take his birds, regulate the supply, put them in cold storage and market them over a period.  That is a simple thing.  It is being done in malting barley and various agricultural commodities.  He could be paid a minimum figure and get the balance when his goods have been marketed over a period.  It is only in this way that you will get a constant balanced production.  The Minister does not seem to feel that there is anything there.  He has not indicated that an extension of the dairying system to the west of Ireland is contemplated by him.  It is absolutely necessary to give those people a cash crop.  The cash products that could assist would be the farrowing of sows from fattening stations, the production of poultry through a communal selling agency, which would give extra profits, and an extension of <Col N="1505" /> the dairying system, so that they could have their monthly big cheque.  All this could help, but we have not got it.</P>
    <P>We have a reduction in the number of pigs.  Comparing our pig population of 1,094,500 with that of the European countries, we must admit that ours is a pretty miserable figure.  The day is gone of the pig in the cot beside the cottage.  The profit on rearing a pig varies from 30/- to £2.  I do not know anybody who wants to feed two or three pigs over three or three and a half months for 30/- or £2.  That does not pay.  It is just as easy to feed 40, 50 or 100 pigs.</P>
    <P>While grants are available, there does not seem to be the necessary drive for an extension of pig breeding and fattening.  For instance, nobody has pointed out that the Jordan type of pig house is so much cheaper in capital outlay and feeding cost than anything else.  No grants have been given for those.  The capital cost is given as £4 per pig, whereas the Danes pay up to £28 and the Solari unit runs as high as £18.</P>
    <P>Let us get down to the basic points of policy on which we differ from the Government.  The report of the bacon industry survey recommended a levy of 5/- per pig over the next two and a half years.  This money is to be used to compensate the owners of uneconomic bacon factories that have to go out of production.  We have stated our mind openly on this proposal.  We reject it, and if we become the Government of this country, we will not implement it.  I have never heard silence speak so loud as it has from the Government side.  I want the Minister to say if the Government will extract this levy of 5/- per pig.</P>
    <P>We have grants and loans for bacon factories.  We intend to extend them, but the person who receives them must naturally be responsible for their repayment.A factory owner will not take a grant or loan for a factory that is fading out.  If we can get our pig production up, these people will take grant and loans in respect of viable units.  If they are not viable, let us forget about them.  They should not be a charge on the farmer.  Surely it is not the farmer's business to compensate <Col N="1506" /> a businessman with a bad unit of production?  We have said quite clearly we will not implement this recommendation; the Government have said nothing.</P>
    <P>There is another proposal whereby the Pigs and Bacon Commission would buy all the pigs.  We have no objection to this, but we think it would be a mistake and an interruption of free trade if pig dealers were to be excluded from getting a little more.  My own experience is that the pig dealer can often give more than you would get for a grade A pig going to the factory. The reason is obvious.  Our pork trade with Britain has improved year by year and pigs for pork very often make more than pigs for bacon.  I do not like the situation whereby the big business man will pay the minimum for all the pigs.  It is clear to anyone who ever saw a pig being graded that the fat difference between grade A and a lower grade is the breadth of one's nail.  When you come to grade a pig, in many cases it is the difference between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The pig dealer has a place in this operation.  If he brings 100 pigs to the factory gate and the factory needs them, they get the maximum gradings and he earns his profit because he is getting a higher price for the farmer than the farmer could get himself. That has been the experience of all our pig producers.  I have asked large and small producers what has happened.Once, they send to the factory and twice they sell to dealers.  It would be a mistake if this element of competition were removed from the trade.  Fine Gael have no objection to stating their policy on the matter.  We feel there should be a continuance of the dealer system as well as the present proposal that the Pigs and Bacon Commission buy all the pigs and that they be directed towards the various factories.</P>
    <P>Removing the L grade of pigs for those who go to bacon factories was a mistake.  This is the third time the Government have interfered with the guaranteed price of pigs and while it would be quite impossible in public debate to go into the niceties of this, I am well aware that so far as pigs produced for grading are concerned, <Col N="1507" /> this meant on every occasion a reduction in the price the farmer could get for pigs.</P>
    <P>We have had talk in Britain in the last few weeks: we had our quota of bacon fixed and it seems as if the rationalisation of purchases of agricultural produce on the British market which was done in the case of butter is now being extended to bacon.  I suggest the present system of grading should be reviewed with a view to improving the lot of the farmer.  We all want better grade pigs but over the past six months fat pigs have been making as much as lean pigs.  A cartoon, also by Warner, in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> another week, gave a pretty ludicrous idea of the situation. It showed the great, fat pigs smoking cigars and walking into the factories at the same price as the lean ones. The statistics of pig production show what happened.  The number of pigs produced, comparing the 12 months up to the end of September in both cases, in 1961, for fresh pork and suasages, was 138,201.  In 1962, we had improved to 261,136; in 1963, we were not running as good an average, with 249,399.  It is still about 20 per cent of the number of pigs being produced for bacon.</P>
    <P>We all know why.  We have a preferential system as far as the veterinary regulations are concerned in Britain because of our complete freedom from disease and our island situation.  This is something we should exploit to the maximum.  So far as I know, we have about 95 per cent of the pork trade into Britain.  I hope Britain will continue to eat more and more pork and my information is that such a trend is there and if so, it will help us considerably.</P>
    <P>I think the arrangement made in relation to bacon will improve matters because the dumping of food on the British market had to end and it seems as if Britain has faced that situation and, through GATT, has decided in respect of all products as well as milk products, she must have this rationalisation.  I propose to examine almost immediately the situation in regard to milk products and the increase in prices that came in respect <Col N="1508" /> of butter as a result of this rationalisation which was viewed by us in Ireland as perhaps not a good thing at the start.  It was spectacular and it was quite a tremendous price increase.  If we get an increase in the price of bacon in Britain, we are on to a good thing. But the numbers of pigs have dropped and the hopes of our farmers have not been encouraged.</P>
    <P>The advisory services that could have led him to proper production and housing of pigs and the grants and the loans&mdash;surely he is entitled to his share of the National Loan as it fills, just as every other section of the community is, for productive purposes&mdash;have not been provided.  Perhaps they are, on paper, but the volume of money going to them is not sufficient to have created this upsurge in the pig population which is needed. In view of our special situation in regard to pork and the present trend in British policy as regards, agricultural produce from abroad, the Minister should indicate that there should be a great increase in the number of pigs here and, through his advisory services, set about the injection of capital by loan and grant to achieve that aim.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister interrupted me in regard to the price paid for milk when I had indicated the prices paid in the various countries in Europe.  I had said that I quoted from the Government publication, <i>The European Economic Community</i>, laid before both House of the Oireachtas on 13th June, 1961.  In fact, I was a halfpenny out.  The Minister's interruption was to the effect that skimmed milk had not been taken into account.  I can now tell the Minister it was and if he wants any confirmation of these prices, I advise him that there seems to be no difference at all except perhaps a halfpenny here and there between the figures produced by the Government in 1961 and the figures produced by Mr. Raymond Crotty, the economist, who did the survey of our dairying industry for the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association.  They agree almost completely, apart from this odd halfpenny which led me astray.  I do not think the Minister can make <Col N="1509" /> much point of the halfpenny.  We accept that our price for milk is the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>This brings me to perhaps one of the most important items that Fine Gael have considered in relation to this Agricultural Estimate, the price of milk.  I dealt with the Minister's scheme for the subsidisation and the increase of heifer numbers in herds. Therefore, it is not proper for me to go over it again, except to say we regard it as a very small contribution, albeit a contribution, towards increasing our cattle numbers.  But over the past month and before that, the Fine Gael Front Bench have considered the change in the situation as regards marketing butter abroad.  I put down Parliamentary Question No. 18 on Wednesday, 30th October, to ascertain from the Minister for Agriculture the current prices obtainable in the British market for Irish butter and the comparative average prices for each one of the past five years.  We find that in 1958 the price you could get for butter in Britain was 218/4d per cwt. and, in the Six Counties, where we always enjoyed a premium, 256/4d per cwt.  But in 1963, up to 31st August we were getting 340/- per cwt. in Britain and 351/11 per cwt. in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Although this is true, if I were to quote the <i>Farm Bulletin</i>, September issue, on the subsidies that are estimated for butter and milk production in this year, it is found that the estimated figure of £6,418,000 is by far the highest yet.  It must be remembered&mdash; and in this publication it is not adverted to&mdash;that we received a figure of 12,600 tons of butter as our quota for Britain and that we then received, because of a shortage of butter in Britain, an extra 5,000 tons which will virtually remove all our butter in cold storage.  That brings us to the position of exporting far more butter to Britain this year and therefore bearing far greater losses than average production over the years would carry.  Production this year is estimated to increase by only 10,000 cwt. from a figure of creamery butter at 985,000 cwt. to 995,000 cwt. as indicated in reply to a question by me on Wednesday, 6th November.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> We have therefore reached this decision in Fine Gael, that we were right when we opposed&mdash;I was not here at the time&mdash;the Dairy Produce Marketing Bill, 1961, on the Second Reading, and that when Fine Gael put down amendments in the Seanad in an attempt to remove the obnoxious provision in a section of that Bill whereby the farmers had to pay one-third of the losses on all exports of creamery produce, we were also right.  Having examined the figures and the improvement of 122/- per cwt., on the average, in prices and the fact that the loss&mdash; the price at which An Bord Bainne takes up butter is 469/- &mdash;is now less than half, we have decided to make this statement on behalf of the Fine Gael Party: that if we are elected now or at any future time and if the situation is then the same in relation to these prices, whether they be the same prices or prices in the same ratio, we will immediately remove the levy of one and three-eighths of a penny and thereby increase the price to the farmers by that amount.  This levy was put on in two slices by the present Administration.</P>
    <P>We believe this is the best way to get our cattle population up to the figure of two million which was the policy adumbrated by the last inter-Party Government and should be done as our first aim for agriculture.  That price undertaking stands.  It has been passed by the Front Bench of the Fine Gael Party and will be implemented. We want every farmer to know that we think this is the best way to get an increase in cattle numbers.  We believe our farmers are entitled to a fair share just as their counterparts are in the rest of Europe.  We believe the British policy at present of rationalisation in relation to agricultural exports will see to it that this will occur.</P>
    <P>I mentioned briefly last night the success of &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo;.  Over the years, we have been telling you to put a brand name on your butter.  You had, first of all, an investigatory committee. Then you had an advisory team, and the devil and all, but you never put a brand name on your butter.  When you did put &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; on it, inside months you were getting a premium <Col N="1511" /> of £22 per ton.  I know the cost of advertising was probably half that sum, but I regard that half as something to be regarded as a capital investment for the future and not as something to be charged against each lot of butter going out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I think, covered that point last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reduction of almost 350,000 in the herds in Europe.  This indicates that the milking of cows, which is a seven-day job&mdash; we have not yet got a five-day cow&mdash; is moving away from the affluent countries.  Here we have a labour force ready and willing, if paid, to do the job.  Here we have the opportunity of cashing in.  It is our ambition to see that done.</P>
      <P>The Minister produced a figure of £380,000 profits as a result of the increase in the price of butter since he first introduced the levy.  That indicates that our reasoning is correct.  We have no worries at all about this decision and we are prepared to implement it. If we get this increase in the cattle industry, a vast sum will be necessary for the industry itself.  The Minister did not advert to this.  At the present moment there are losses on cheese, chocolate crumb and milk powder.  A very small amount of our production is going into these products.  These processes have not been rationalised as British butter has been rationalised through GATT.  There is need for diversification because, having rationalised butter, they will proceed to rationalise other products.  We will have to turn more and more of our milk into cheese and chocolate crumb, which may seem illogical as losses mount, but, at the same time, diversification is necessary.  We must look ahead to the time when we will get into the Common Market and these will be highly profitable occupations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two directions in which vast sums will have to be expended, namely, in the creameries, for the proper processing of the product, and on the farms.  There is no standard cowhouse.  Many are built where there <Col N="1512" /> is not a plentiful supply of water. Farmers will have to be given the opportunity of producing high quality milk in hygienic manner.  If water is not available, there will have to be a freeze unit and electricity.  We are prepared to go the whole way on this. We are extremely doubtful that the present Government would go with us.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has indicated that he expects us to be in the Common Market by 1970.  By 1967, there will be a dearth of 380,000 tons of beef in the Common Market.  Is it not good business to bring our cattle population up?  No tuppenny-ha'penny scheme, such as the Minister has announced, will do the job.  We believe our proposition is the correct way in which to approach the situation.</P>
    <P>The 1961 volume produced by the Government gives interesting figures in relation to various agricultural products in relation to our joining the Common Market.  By 1967-68, the Common Market partners hope to have 83 per cent of their requirements of wheat, 87 per cent of their requirements of barley, 69 per cent of their requirements of sugar and 89 per cent of their requirements of butter.  They seem to be plentifully supplied with cheese and pork.  While everything will not go as smoothly as the Taoiseach often suggests, it has to be remembered that this will be itself a free trade area but, as far as anybody else is concerned, it will be a highly restricted area.  It will have its troubles and its difficulties.  Nevertheless we must move towards it.  We must take a chance. Irish agriculture cannot wait to make every decision that is completely right. There will have to be a crash policy, a policy that will make an odd mistake, but, if it makes an odd one, it will make many that will be right. We must bring up our 12 million acres of arable land to a state at which they can support a decent number of people with a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the reduction in the number of sheep.  It is small&mdash; 0.8 per cent.  Our lamb trade has been good and sheep require less capital per acre than cattle do.  I do not know how this drop occurred.  Very soon I <Col N="1513" /> believe we shall have to get around to grading lamb carcases by size.  I do not know if the business interests handling them are getting around to that.  Other exporting countries are grading their lamb and using a trade name.  Either by number or name, the housewife is assured that into her oven will go lamb of good quality.  I know there are many different sizes of lamb and many different varieties&mdash; Galway lamb, Crossbred lamb and, the best of all, Scotch lamb.  Some sizes are suitable for restaurants and hotels, some for small families.  Grading will require some promotional work.  If the Minister sees to it that grants are readily available, and availed of, and if we grade, then we are bound to improve our lamb trade.</P>
    <P>In the Agricultural Institute at the moment, there are two people engaged on sheep breeding.  The Minister will say that this is not a matter for him, that there is a board, and a chairman, and all the rest of it.  I am very keen on horticultural production, but it seems odd to me that there should be two people looking after such an important facet of the industry as sheep, remembering we have a sheep population of 4,634,300, while there are 11 or 12 people with degrees looking after horticulture.  That seems to me to be wrong, because a lot can be done in the matter of sheep-breeding.I do not wish to criticise the Agricultural Institute, but this is something that bears looking into.</P>
    <P>The Minister covered his Supplementary Estimate in his statement and I have touched on various points relating to it.  I am delighted to see it includes a grant-in-aid to the National Farmers Association towards the expenses of the world congress held in this country.  I am pleased to see he feels more money is needed for lime and fertiliser subsidies, pleased also to see such things as the contribution towards administrative costs in respect of the Irish national project in Tanganyika.  I have dealt with the situation in relation to extra money needed towards butter exports.</P>
    <P>There is a figure of £330,000 for the erection of commercial grain storage facilities.  It is the first step forward <Col N="1514" /> since the Leader of this Party instituted the Grain Storage (Loans) Act in 1961. It would be churlish of me to offer criticism of that provision at this stage: I availed of a couple of grants myself and perhaps I should keep my mouth shut.  However, we need to consider which was the better system&mdash;the provision of capital over a long period in loans directly serviced from national funds or the dishing out in a hurried fashion of these grants at the rate of 35/- per ton.  It created 195,000 tons of extra storage, but it was a rushed business over a short period.  It was a right good thing but I put it to the Minister that he should now look at the situation and consider the various people left behind who could not get their legal situation in relation to premises fixed up.</P>
    <P>Most of all in these things, the Minister should consider the farmer because any farmer producing a volume of grain should have a drier of his own.  I am not suggesting he should have a drier to cater for all his grain, but I suggest he needs some sort of insurance policy, some sort of small drier whenever grain which has a certain moisture content will not stand.  If the farmer is of the opinion that wheat of a certain moisture content is submitted, there is a scare and millers believe all wheat has gone bad.  That is why the farmer needs his insurance policy, his small drier to cater for a small volume of grain, so that he can hold it without deterioration.  I would be foolish to suggest he should have a large drier because the capital involved would hardly warrant it, but he does need that insurance policy, and for that reason there is a need for specific loans for storage and drying.</P>
    <P>In general, I should like to say that no sops to gain votes, handed out here or outside the House, will be of much use to the agricultural industry.  What is needed is a progressive outlook, better selling methods.  The extension of credit will lead our farmers to a stage at which we shall have a constancy of supply.  The strongest foundation for these things is a belief in agriculture, a conviction that it is a good thing to support agriculture, that we can have more people profitably <Col N="1515" /> employed on the land.  This can be done through an integration of our advisory services with an extension of credit.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are prepared to meet that bill.  Without going into all details of the bill, I should like to give a few of the points that immediately come to mind.  If we are to have a population of two million cows, in round figures that means an increase of 500,000.  To produce or buy that extra number, at £50 per head, gives a figure of £25 million.  If we are to have a population of two million pigs&mdash;and that should be our target&mdash;we must produce an extra million pigs which, at an average price of £8 each, would require £8 million.  If we are to house the extra 500,000 cows, I believe it will cost £20 each if we are to provide proper housing for them, with all the necessary facilities for the production of clean milk.  That would mean an extra expenditure of £10 million.  If we are to house the extra pigs, even if we do it by Jordan pighouses, when we have availed of all grants, it will cost another £4 million.If we are to carry these extra cows, we will have to improve our grasslands.</P>
    <P>The potential is there, the mine is there to be tapped.  Taking the figure of nine million acres of grassland in the country&mdash;it is small in proportion to the 12 million acres of arable land only one million acres of which are devoted to tillage&mdash;I suggest a figure of £3 an acre, which comes to £27 million.  Then we come to the rationalisation of our dairy processing industry and must consider the produce of the extra 500,000 cows, so we must improve the processing methods and completely rationalise our creameries. I put that at a figure of somewhere in the order of £10 million.</P>
    <P>In all this, I have taken the bare fundamentals and we get a figure of £84 million.  Adding items I have not mentioned, and without going into the major ones, certainly in order to bring the agricultural industry to a stage where it will prosper and provide a good standard of living for those who <Col N="1516" /> work in it, we will need an extra expenditure in the region of £100 million in the next five years.  However, we must remember that we are investing in a capital asset which, if we take machinery, housing, arable land and all the rest of it, is valued at something like £1,000 million, so the figure I suggest in extra expenditure is only about ten per cent.  The methods of providing that money are the commercial banks, the Agricultural Credit Company, recourse to below-the-line expenditure by grant and loan from the Exchequer.  We on this side of the House, as we have indicated, are prepared to meet this. We doubt if the Government are, and we shall welcome the day when we are given the opportunity of completing a very hard task but one in which we will be strengthened by a belief in the land of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened for a reasonable time to the man who, we believe, is the projected Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture, if and when that Party ever succeed in forming a Government.  It is a fairly big &ldquo;if&rdquo;. However, Deputy Donegan did speak to us as a Front Bench Fine Gael man on agriculture and I must concede that the long speech he made did require a great deal of research, concentration and hard work on his part.  His speech, however, showed that there appears to be a complete absence of constructive ideas on agriculture in the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan in all the things he has said did not say anything we have not heard in this House for 20 years or more.  Deputy Donegan is a very generous man and for that reason I was very surprised to hear him describe the heifer scheme announced by the Minister as a tuppence-half-penny scheme.  It may be that he did not wish to let down the Leader of the Fine Gael Party who criticised this great scheme on which I congratulate the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition saw fit to jeer publicly at this scheme in the cheaper Sunday papers that revel in the kind of criticism that appeals to people of low intelligence.  The Leader <Col N="1517" /> of the Fine Gael Party jeeringly said that it was a hare-brained scheme and that the cows of the country would have to start producing triplets if the target laid down by the Government in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> were to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The arithmetic of the plan laid down by the Government for cattle expansion was simple enough.  It is plain enough even for the Fine Gael Party with their very few farmer members. When it is considered that we have about half a million heifers annually in this country between one and two years old, it is easy to see that, if the major portion of these heifers are put to breeding, after the passage of a couple of years, the target we have set ourselves will be achieved with ease.</P>
    <P>I might mention in passing that at a committee of agriculture meeting in Kilkenny last Monday our chief agricultural officer was asked some specific questions about this cattle expansion programme.  He said publicly that without any difficulty at all the annual increase figure laid down by the Government plan could easily be achieved in our county and I have no doubt at all that it will be achieved over the country as a whole.  It is a very attractive scheme.  The £15 a head bonus on every new heifer coming to farmers' herds will mean that no potential breeding stock will be wasted.  Deputy Donegan implied last night &mdash; it sounded odd coming from a Fine Gael Deputy, especially a Fine Gael Front Bench Deputy &mdash; that this was a rancher's scheme, that it was only the larger farmer or the man in a position to buy fairly big numbers of heifers and collect the £15 bounty who could avail of this scheme.  If they stopped to think a minute or two, it would surely be plain enough to the Fine Gael Party and to everybody else who would have doubts in this regard that from the day the £15 bounty was announced, every heifer became considerably more valuable.  If this precious rancher, as he is described by Deputy Donegan, is to go out and stock his land with breeding heifers, it will certainly create a big stir in the heifer market and obviously the man from whom he will buy his stock will <Col N="1518" /> more than likely be the small dairy man.  If that dairy man decides not to keep his heifers, he can sell them at a very much increased price.  The benefits of this scheme will reach right down to the very smallest herd in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced into this House and made available to the coun try some years ago a fertiliser scheme, a scheme that did more good for agriculture than most other schemes that have come up since then.  This new heifer scheme is in the same category. It shows the Government have imagination.It shows the Government have a realisation of the needs of the country and are prepared to do something about it and to put worthwhile schemes like this into operation.</P>
    <P>I have never stood up in this House very much to congratulate Ministers about anything in particular.  I always feel that coming from the Minister's Party, it sounds a bit stupid, that it sounds as if a Deputy is going out of his way to please.  However, I can say with great conviction that I believe this to be a very sound scheme and, whatever criticism the Opposition may make and however they may shout at us that we will fail, that we will not achieve our objective, I feel certain we will succeed.  Speaking from these benches as a farmer, I realise the handicap that Fine Gael are under because they have practically no farmers over there at all.</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on the spectacular rise in the sheep population which has taken place since 1956.  It has increased from less than 3,500,000 to a good deal more than 4,500,000 and the available lamb population has gone up by considerably more than 500,000 per annum. Bearing in mind that our share of the lamb market in Britain is about 4 per cent and also the amount of room there is for expansion in this branch of farming, it appears to me to contain more promise than a great many other agricultural enterprises, except possibly beef.  This is a very satisfactory trend&mdash; in fact, a remarkable trend&mdash;and I would like to see every possible help given to sheep farmers, especially in regard to sheep diseases.</P>
      <P>Anybody who will take a walk into the Dublin market or any other sheep sale in the country cannot help but notice there is considerable infestation in our flocks of sheep in the form of fluke and foot-rot.  That must cost sheep owners in the country a considerable amount of money every year and I should like to see the Department providing sheep farmers with all the advice and help possible to correct that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to what he described as the serious situation with regard to wheat and he surprised me considerably because it appears from what he said that the Fine Gael policy as regards wheat growing has undergone a quite revolution.  I can remember the time when the farmers were advised to spare their land the abuse of growing wheat and when the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, in his own inimitable manner, said that he would not be found dead in a field of wheat.  Deputy Donegan complains that the acreage of wheat has shown a drop since last year.  I come from what is practically the biggest wheatgrowing constituency in the country.  There is more wheat grown in that constituency <Col N="1520" /> to the square mile than in any other constituency in the country.</P>
    <P>I believe the wheat growers in my constituency are quite prepared to face facts and recognise that our problem is not a deficiency in the acreage of wheat but the very reverse.  We realise that the country is able to meet its requirements of native wheat from a comparatively small acreage.  It has been the policy of our Party to make wheatgrowing an attractive proposition.Within that condition of avoiding over-production, we have given farmers a very attractive price for their wheat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the 1962 harvest in particular and his version of what happened and mine are quite different.  When we were discussing the Estimate for 1962 in July of that year, I expressed my anxiety and fear that the understanding that had been arrived at between the NFA and the Flour Millers Association was a cause for anxiety to the country.  I felt it would lead to grave dissatisfaction and, as the event proved, what I said was an under-statement.</P>
    <P>Briefly, what happened was this: the four principal organisations representing the farmers met early in 1962&mdash; these were the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, the Wheat Growers Association, the ICMSA and the NFA&mdash;and discussed the question of wheat standards.  Each party agreed to meet again and also agreed that no party would negotiate with the Flour Millers Association until a common policy had been worked out and agreement reached between the four organisations.  A short time afterwards, members of the three organisations other than the NFA saw in the papers that an agreement had been reached between the NFA and the Irish Flour Millers Association and that the agreement accepted the Hagberg test, accepted the colour standard and accepted the institution of an independent laboratory for the testing of disputed samples. That was that, as far as the wheat-producing farmers were concerned.</P>
    <P>During the harvest of that year, the weather conditions were very unsatisfactory <Col N="1521" /> and a fairly big proportion of the grain was not up to the quality standard of other years.  Samples as they went into the intake points were tested by the Hagberg method and a considerable number of them passed it. When the millers discovered that this was the case, without reference to the NFA or anybody else, they threw the Hagberg test overboard and instituted instead the maltose test.  Samples that had passed the Hagberg test were retested and many of the samples that had passed the Hagberg test were shot down as a result.  The NFA were left, like the bridegroom in Lochinvar, dangling their bonnets.</P>
    <P>The utterly ruthless and unscrupulous behaviour of the millers in dealing with that harvest should not be forgotten and should not be let go without the utmost condemnation from anybody who represents a wheatgrowing constituency.  I was looking at a discussion on Telefís Éireann about two weeks ago in which three parties took part.  There were farmers' representatives, a Flour Millers Association man, Mr. Glynn from Co. Clare, and Dr. Spillane from the Kinsealy Laboratory.  Dr. Spillane, without any reservation or qualification, said that the Hagberg test was a far better one.  What the flour millers are after when they apply these tests is to ascertain the activity of alfa amylase in the wheat.  Dr. Spillane, who probably knows more about this subject than anyone else and certainly more about it than the flour millers, who is a scientist with no axe to grind, said that the maltose test which the millers used in 1962 was most unreliable and that the Hagberg test was better than the maltose test and far less subject to error.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute found that of the rejected samples of the 1962 wheat more than half should have been accepted as millable.  The only thing that the maltose test did show of itself was that it is completely unreliable.I think the wheat farmers of this country are well able to face facts. These facts have not been any too pleasant in the past few years due to the weather conditions.  The wheat farmers are well able to take their <Col N="1522" /> medicine but, in the light of what I have just said about the unscrupulous imposition of the Flour Millers' Association, I think it is fair to say that neither the flour millers nor anybody else have any right to impose a standard that is not properly applicable.</P>
    <P>My personal belief is that it is possible to determine with enough accuracy the quality of wheat by bushel weight and moisture content. It has been done here in this country for years and experiments on other lines have not proved to be satisfactory.They are being imposed on farmers rather than being accepted by them.  Certainly the wheat farmers suspect the 1962 harvest.  I know that the flour millers are not against Irish wheat as such.  What they are really against is millable Irish wheat.  They would prefer to see it unmillable so that they could make more profit per barrel out of it.  There is a serious suspicion that wheat that was purchased as unmillable in 1962 at something in the region of 45/- a barrel was sold back the following spring to the same farmers for £6 10s. a barrel as seed. I should like to be assured by the Minister that such things could not happen.  I can certainly tell him that there is very grave uneasiness among the wheat farmers that such things are possible.</P>
    <P>When I started speaking, I mentioned that I was disappointed that Deputy Donegan speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party did not seem to have any new departure of any kind. Apart from the normal Fine Gael practice of promising increased prices for bacon and for crops, increased loans and low taxation, there was nothing new.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about co-operatives, on this question of the farmer and the organisation of production.I spoke about this here before. I said at that time, and some others did, too, that the ordinary creamery unit as we know it in the south of Ireland is too small to be able to mount an economic effort of sufficient size to be of adequate importance in modern practice.  I advocated then that <Col N="1523" /> creameries should consider amalgamation into large units.  The pattern I took as a possible type would be the amalgamation of the 22 creameries at present in County Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I do not mean in any way to criticise the operations of all creameries. I am quite well aware that many of even the smallest creameries handling the smallest amount of milk have given very remarkable service to their shareholders.I know one particular creamery which is quite a small concern.It has a fertiliser subsidy scheme of its own and the creamery society takes an active interest in the farmers' cattle breeding programme and their grass fertilisation and provides assistance of that kind.  We must, however, envisage the chain of production literally from the grass roots in the farmer's field until the produce of his work finds its ultimate end on the housewife's table in this country, in England, or wherever it is.  All the factors that make up that chain of production must be brought together like the strands of a rope or else they will not bear the strength they should, or give the support to the members they ought to.</P>
    <P>Since we discussed that last, the idea of amalgamation has certainly become more discussed, and I gather that in County Waterford a project for the amalgamation of creameries is well under way.  I wish that enterprise all the success it deserves.  Amalgamation of this kind must be accomplished for the good of the dairying industry as a whole.  A big amalgamated group may, however, fall into the same type of error, the same pattern of relative inactivity, as some of the constituent creameries fell into earlier on.  The worst type of creamery was built by the farmers' efforts and money and all the farmer got out of it was a place where he could go with his ass and cart or his pony and cart or his tractor with his milk every day, sell his milk there and that was the end of it.  The co-operative society never inquired about his cows or how he fed them, never gave him any advice or told him how the market situation <Col N="1524" /> was.  That was a creamery of the worst type.</P>
    <P>As I said, I know quite well that there are very many creameries of very high standard, much higher than that, but there is a danger that the big amalgamated society might centre all its thoughts on the mere matter of manufacturing whatever product they go in for.  Ideally, the function of an organisation of this kind is to start at the grass roots, to advise all their constituent farmers as to the amount of milk it can take from them, how to produce it, how to feed the cattle and how to breed them, and the whole production operation should be planned on that basis right from the field to the consumer's table.</P>
    <P>If a big project of that kind of county size were viable, to use a popular word nowadays, it is in a place like that that the advisory service would best be based.  It would be necessary, of course, to have a general advisory service for people who do not participate in an operation of this kind.  If you assume that you have established the thing and decided how you are going to produce, the job of an agricultural adviser would be far more interesting and satisfactory to the adviser, since he would know fairly precisely the quantity of stuff the farmer was going to produce; he would know quite precisely the number of cattle he had working, and would be able to give very detailed and specific advice to all his farmers as to how to keep the flow of production going at the maximum rate and how best it could be expanded.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this is beyond the bounds of achievement or possibility. The survival of the co-operative creameries in the south depends on a big operation of this kind.  I think that the farmers whose money built the creamery in the first place would support and maintain the bigger unit and will understand it when it is discussed.  I would like to see the dairy industry and the farmers who compose it at least discussing this matter and seeing what they think of it.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a large section of the dairy industry could be organised on <Col N="1525" /> this basis.  Every farmer in the provinces of Munster and south Leinster &mdash;and in the west as the dairy industry expands&mdash;would then become a producer in this planned agricultural economy.  When I say &ldquo;planned agricultural economy&rdquo;, I shudder to think that anybody would understand from that that there would be any sort of direction or that the farmer would be required to do this or that.  If they did not do it by their own free will, it would not be worth attempting it at all.</P>
    <P>This is something I would envisage for the general uplifting of standards everywhere.  There has been some uplifting already, principally through the efforts of the farmers themselves and with the assistance of the schemes I have mentioned, particularly the phosphate fertiliser subsidy.  You can give nobody any help as good as the help they can give themselves.  The development of this spirit of self-reliance is a bigger need amongst us than we realise. Possibly when Deputy Donegan is Minister for Agriculture, he will do twice as well.  I believe any Irish Government will be ready and willing to provide every possible State aid to improve agriculture here.  I do not contend that Fine Gael or anybody else are so baleful or lazy that they will not do what is best, but I do contend that we can do it better than they can.  Without this determination on the part of the farmers to help themselves, we will not be as successful as we ought to be.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is a very large and expanding meat factory.  Like the creamery we spoke of that merely provides a little factory for separating milk and manufacturing it into butter, this big concern&mdash;built on the small contributions of thousands of farmers from Waterford, Kilkenny, Wexford and South Tipperary&mdash;gives a little dividend, and the people who provided the original share capital hear nothing more about this big co-operative meat factory.  In a scheme of the kind I have been describing a co-operatively-owned factory like this could be integrated with great advantage to the shareholders.  Every creamery supplier is a meat producer also.  Probably <Col N="1526" /> thousands of the shareholders in this factory produce beef and pigmeat, but they never get any indication from the factory when they are in the market for lamb, beef, or special qualities of meat. They operate like any privately-owned factory.  They go to their own sources of supply and get their requirements at the cheapest rate.</P>
    <P>That is not what co-operative enterprises were designed for.  They have a duty first to their members.  Their constitutions require that they serve their members first.  The day is coming when this integration will be brought about.  I hope the Minister will encourage it to come faster.  The IAOS, who get a fairly large and increasing vote from this House, have not achieved it.  I do not like to criticise the IAOS too much.  Whether it is because of a defect in their constitution or because of some other reason, they have not done anything really constructive, as far as I know, since their establishment.  Either the Minister should make a suggestion to them, or they should do it themselves.  It is easy to see how a big meat processing factory such as I have mentioned could be integrated into the scheme I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Some experiments have been carried out over the past 12 months in the Carlow part of my constituency in regard to the fertilising of mountain grazings.  These experiments, carried out on the side of Mount Leinster, have produced spectacular results. The Minister is probably aware of the high importance of sheep grazing to the economy of Carlow.  Many of these grazings are at present very inferior, because until recently it was not possible to get fertiliser up to where you wanted it, or, if you did get it up, to get it spread, but there are various means available to us now that were not available heretofore.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to examine this general question of mountain grazings, not only in Carlow but in all the mountain areas of the country.  There must be a very large untapped resource of middling quality grazing to be had on some mountains, merely by the addition of lime and fertilisers.  A big expansion in the <Col N="1527" /> carrying capacity of these mountain grazings would mean a revolution in the domestic economy of the people we hear so much about in this House, the small farmers, especially on the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the serious problem confronting the small farmers, the Minister has already pointed out that thousands of small farmers here do achieve an acceptable standard of living.  In my opinion, these men deserve great credit because they achieve this acceptable standard of living by specialising in some way and almost invariably they are very intelligent, active people who would make a living anywhere you put them. You have small farmers not of that kind and it must be accepted, whether pleasant or not, that the position of many thousands of smallholders is brutally simple.  If they do not get a very high production per acre, they have not an acceptable standard of living.  It is just simple arithmetic: when you multiply the produce per acre by the number of acres, will you have enough to keep you going for 12 months?</P>
    <P>Many people have thrown up their hands about this question and perhaps inadvertently they do great harm.  They are the type who say: &ldquo;We are betrayed; there is no future here for small farmers.&rdquo;  People of some eminence have said this without making any proposal to correct the situation if it exists.  Loose, misguided talk of that kind can do great harm by destroying morale and affecting the will to survive and prosper as many thousands of these people have done.</P>
    <P>Some experiments should be made by the Minister in the development of co-operative farming in, say, congested areas in the west, in Connacht, where it should be reasonably easy to select an area for the purpose.  The economies that could be achieved by this method are easy to see&mdash;no obligation on individual farmers to maintain unnecessary machinery or work-animals. By organisation, they would be able to cut costs considerably.  A high income per acre crop, such as the Sugar Company have been developing <Col N="1528" /> recently, should be concentrated in small-farm localities, not alone in the west of Ireland.  The splendid pioneering work of the Sugar Company in vegetable and food processing should be channelled towards small farms. This seems to offer a very solid hope not only of survival but of achieving a modicum of prosperity on such farms.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company deserve the congratulations and support of everybody in the country.  Their projects, I suggest should be confined as much as possible to small-farm areas.  I have often heard Deputies say that the extensive type of farming attempted by some small farmers could not possibly give the return per acre that would give a man an acceptable standard of living.  Therefore he must specialise in some way.</P>
    <P>Another method by which incomes of such farmers could be supplemented is to give them special assistance for pig enterprises.  Deputy Donegan referred to this.  You can maintain a fairly big number of pigs on very little land if you have the wherewithal to feed them and the co-operative system would be the best means by which small farmers could attempt such a project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who heard the Deputy from Kilkenny would certainly not accuse him of making a vindictive speech.  I enjoyed it, and I envy his casual approach and his spontaneity.  I am sorry, therefore, to have to take him to task on one or two details.  In the aftermath of this afternoon, it is not surprising that any Deputy would wander from the straight and narrow path.  He prefaced his remarks by accusing Deputy Donegan of repeating what had been repeated here for 25 years.  I accuse him of repeating what has been repeated for the past 40 years.  I know it was with regret he advised the House that it was his duty to praise the Minister.  He was creating no precedent&mdash;that was the operative word this afternoon.  In fact, only when I saw Deputy Burke attending to his outside duties did I realise that Deputy Gibbons was deputising for Deputy Burke in praising the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> I am not going to praise the Minister or say anything personal.  Remove him from his office as Minister, remove from him his political Party and he is a fine fellow in many respects, but I have not much respect for his politics or the way he is running his Department.I must criticise his Department and consequently the Minister.  Anything I have to say is not personal but general.  The difference&mdash;and let me emphasise it&mdash;between my address and that of Deputy Gibbons is that he spoke as the representative of the big farmers and I as the representative of the small farmers.  I think the Deputy will concede that the difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is that they believe in industry and chose as leader of the Party the Taoiseach, a man bred, born and reared with no interest but industry; we elected as our Leader a man who was a former Minister for Agriculture and we believe the economy of this country depends on agriculture.</P>
    <P>I represent farmers here: I live among small farmers and they are the best workers in the country.  I will tell a little story now.  A migrant was migrated from my constituency to County Meath.  He was given a 40-acre farm there on which to earn a livelihood.  I think all Deputies will concede that even on a 40-acre farm in County Meath today you have to work hard.  He worked every inch of that 40 acres.  In fact, he went out to the long acres to graze an extra cow.  On the far side of the road outside his house he was grazing the long acre.  A neighbour, when he saw this going on, said to him after some weeks: &ldquo;Is it not a wonder you do not graze the far side of the road like you are grazing the opposite side.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; he said, very humbly, &ldquo;I am keeping that for meadow.&rdquo;  The moral of my story is that he had been so trained to utilise every inch of his land in County Mayo, having got a 40-acre farm in County Meath, he still had to go outside the boundaries to keep going.</P>
    <P>The farmers whom I represent employ practically no labour.  They themselves, in fact, for the greater part of the year look for employment from public authorities.  They are what I <Col N="1530" /> might describe as working men.  The regrettable feature is that their income has remained practically static for the past number of years.  It is agreed that in the past five years the cost of living has increased 23 points, approximately 17 per cent since 1957, but there has been no increase in the incomes of the farming community.  In fact, the incomes of most farmers have been effectively reduced by about one-sixth since 1957.  These are the appalling facts. The result is that a great many small farmers with large families have thrown in their lot and emigrated.  It would be just as well if some of our city-minded Deputies and our city-minded Taoiseach woke up to the fact that a regrettable trend is developing in Ireland today, a trend which, if not checked at an early stage, will lead somewhere I should hate to describe.</P>
    <P>I want to devote my remarks now to the small farmer.  The big farmer is able to look after himself.  The big farmer will survive much longer than the small farmer will in bad times.  Not so long ago I was speaking to a young boy who emigrated to England from my constituency.  He was home on holiday.I asked him: &ldquo;Is it not a wonder you would not come home to stay with your mother and father on the farm?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I have no intention of returning to the sort of existence my father has.  I am now earning a living and I have no intention of bringing home a wife to be a slave like my mother was.&rdquo;  That is a regrettable situation.</P>
    <P>We have just heard the Taoiseach announce the green light to the trade unions.  What green light did we get last night from the Minister for the small farmers of Ireland?  This is the light I got; I got a red light.  The only solution he had for the problems of the small farmers in the west of Ireland was (1) a heifer scheme for the big farmers and (2) he had found another new disease for the vets in the country.  They are finished with the bovine tuberculosis and someone has now come up with another disease. We will be eradicating all over again for the next five years.  Mark you, the farmer is not gaining anything in the process.  I can visualise a period again <Col N="1531" /> in which the farmer will not be allowed to move his cattle as he was not allowed to move them during the period of tuberculosis testing.</P>
    <P>What solution had the Minister's speech last night to offer the people who stood in the fair at Ballina last Friday wringing their hands because they could not dispose of their cattle? What light was there for the people of Crossmolina who stood in the fair last Monday wringing their hands because thy could not sell their stock? My yardstick as to whether or not a farmer is well off is the same yardstick that the pension officer uses when he is going around assessing eligibility for the old age pension: you can determine a man's position by the number of stock he has on his land.</P>
    <P>In the west of Ireland, cattle stocks are dropping rapidly.  One of the most alarming features at present of the situation obtaining here is that that rot does not seem to be confined just to the west of Ireland.  It is widespread. If there is one thing urgently necessary to enable our people to increase the output of stock on the soil it is the improvement of their grasslands.  There is not much point, however, in growing grass if you have not got something to eat it.</P>
    <P>I come now to a very important aspect of the Minister's speech.  He came in here, briefed, in my opinion, by the officials of his Department, to criticise our proposal that capital must be made available to the farmers.  He gave us figures of costs but he omitted to mention that it was quite in order for a Government-sponsored body, like the Tourist Board, to make available vast sums of capital to foreigners, in many cases, by way of interest free loans; it was all right to give money to hoteliers and foreigners, but it is apparently all wrong to give it to the farmer to help him to stock his land.</P>
    <P>When the former heifer scheme was initiated by the Government, did not the Government advise the banks to give money for heifers on production of a receipt showing one had bought a heifer?  Is it not true that many farmers availed of the credit given by <Col N="1532" /> the banks to increase their stocks?  Is it not true that today, as a result of the prices obtaining for stock, interest has not been paid?  Any bank manager will tell you that that is the position. What farmer could afford to pay 6 per cent or 5¾ per cent interest at the rate of profit he is getting for what he produces on the land?  I am no economist but I have a practical approach to these things.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House urgently to the disastrous development of the reduction of the small farmers' incomes which not only leaves rural areas derelict but will react on towns and villages as well. Business people in these towns and villages are suffering through the growing flood of emigration of their best customers.  We will all concede that the real customers are the young boys and girls between 18 and 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>If one travels throughout rural Ireland today, one will see it denuded of young boys and girls.  They have all gone and the land is left in the hands of bachelors and old maids.  I do not wish to be misconstrued in the statement I am about to make.  I yearn for the day Partition will go.  I do not approve of Partition but it amuses me to hear important substantial people talking about bringing in the Six Counties and letting the five counties down in the west of Ireland disappear. Tomorrow the newspapers will be full of the controversy that took place here tonight on the turnover tax and the by-election and I am worried lest in the midst of all that turmoil, the minds of Deputies and of the public will be directed away from the terrible problem in the west.</P>
    <P>I can tell the House emphatically that we are a dying race in the west and I shall introduce some figures which will be a lot more factual for the newspapers than some of the things said here earlier today.  The population of Mayo in 1936 was 161,347.  In 1961, it was 123,180, a loss of 38,300 who left during that period, a drop of 25 per cent.  Let me emphasise the gravity of the problem by saying that if this decline continues at this rate, Mayo will become extinct in a very short time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> Is that not a terrible state of affairs and is it without reason that the people down there are highly amused when they hear people talking about taking in these six counties outside our jurisdiction while at the same time permitting Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal to disappear?</P>
    <P>However, I see in the darkness a little light.  In fact, I have tremendous respect for the statement made by Lt.-General Costello.  Speaking in my constituency recently, he said there was hope for the west of Ireland yet if they worked harder and if proposals now before the Government were brought into operation.  We have heard quite a lot about the inter-departmental committee set up to inquire into the problems of the west of Ireland.  No special committee was needed to tell the House about the west and its problems, but not one iota was done to implement any of the recommendations of that committee. We are no further advanced than we were before that committee was established.We are poorer in money, poorer in population.</P>
    <P>Do not forget that we survived hard times in the west of Ireland.  We lived through a famine; we survived Cromwell; and we will survive the Department of Agriculture as well. The inter-departmental committee attributed the problems of the west to four main factors: young people did not want to stay on the land; the general run of farmers were not in a position to benefit from fixed-price crops; there was loss of farmyard income from pigs, poultry and eggs; and a lack of industrialisation.  What has been done to replace those things that have disappeared?</P>
    <P>I do not want to drag the egg around this House.  Everybody knows the housewife in the west of Ireland kept the house going on the income she got from the eggs.  That has gone, disappeared forever.  At Christmas, the small farmer had a few turkeys and geese and the Christmas spending money came from the poultry.  That has gone.  I do not blame the Minister entirely for this.  The pig has gone and with it the last straw from the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> Some years ago, the west was the real pig-producing area of the country. That has changed.  I am not sure there is no hope for the pig industry in the west still.  The Minister comes from Cavan, a county similar to my own, and many a good bonham we got from that county to be matured in Mayo.  I believe the problem created by the disappearance of the pig from the west of Ireland is something that can be remedied, even at this eleventh hour.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Minister should consider providing a scheme whereby small farmers in the west could keep two or three sows each.  There would be no problem for them at farrowing time.  The problems would arise afterwards in the matter of feeding costs and of stabling.  The Minister might therefore seriously consider the possibility of setting up a big pig-feeding station in the west to cater for all the bonhams produced from the sows kept on the small farms.</P>
    <P>I hope we will become a member of the Common Market, but if we do, we shall be faced with three features, the free movement of men, money and goods.  I can foresee that when we become members, we will have the prospect of small farmers coming in from Germany and elsewhere and buying up holdings from which our people have been forced by a careless Government.  We must remember that land of medium quality in Germany costs £400 or £500 an acre.  It will be a desperate state of affairs if we force our own people off the land to seek an industrial livelihood in foreign lands and if the investment of these people in homes, outoffices and lands is to be for the benefit of people who come in here and who do not share our aspirations, national or otherwise.</P>
    <P>As the leader of my Party has said, there is a great opportunity on the continent for the lamb trade.  Every farmer knows that you can stock land with sheep for much less capital than you need for cattle.  Of course, there is a limit to the number of sheep, unless you are going in for extensive sheep farming, but it does appear that sheep farmers are doing well at the moment, and I should like to see more <Col N="1535" /> encouragement given to those who are prepared to go into this form of agricultural activity.  If we had better marketing facilities for mutton and lamb and if other markets were explored, we would not be, as we are at present, confined to the French market.  The Department should be assiduous in seeking such markets because a farmer with small capital can keep his land well stocked with sheep.</P>
    <P>I must ask the Minister in his reply to this debate to tell us something more about his intentions with regard to the west of Ireland.  I have emphasised that we in the west are a dying race, that we are neglected.  The small farmer is the backbone of this country and every farmer's homestead is a little industry in itself.  In an area where you had 400 or 500 small farms, you had 400 or 500 little industries but now you have only 30 or 40 houses occupied in such areas.  In their efforts to improve their standards of living after the war, farmers who had some little capital invested it in developing their homes but even with the Government grant and the local authority grant, it took the greater part of £1,000 extra capital to provide suitable accommodation for the small farmer's wife and family.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about increased grants for piggeries, cowbyres and the various other buildings. What is the use of giving the small farmer a fine business without the money to run it?  What would be the use of giving me Guineys if I did not have the capital to run it?  What is the point in throwing grants at the farmers for all these buildings if you do not make capital available to them to run the business?  Without capital you cannot succeed and the farmer is short of capital today because his income has not been increased.  We are now ready to take on the ninth round of wage increases but the farmer is as static in his income as he was in 1947.  What the farmer needs is an injection of capital.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to ridicule our proposal to advance interest-free loans up to £1,000.  I do not say that every <Col N="1536" /> farmer in the west of Ireland will look for those loans.  He has the Agricultural Credit Corporation to go to but the trouble about that is that his income is not able to stand up to the rate of interest.  If you make capital available to the farmer, you are increasing the national income.  You are giving him capital to invest in something that can be exported.  We all know that 70 per cent of our exports are agricultural exports.  The Minister has at his hands a readymade system of investigation in the Agricultural Credit Corporation and every grant would be given only on its merits. Give the money to the people who require it.  That is the only way you will keep the farmers on the land.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced the heifer scheme he said he was giving something to the farmers.  I am afraid he was ill-advised by his officials.</P>

      <P>With due respect to the Minister, I think he has forgotten all about the small farmer.  The Minister brought in a heifer scheme and it is the big rancher who will benefit from it.  The small farmer in Mayo did not benefit from the rate reduction scheme. It was the big farmer in Kilkenny and elsewhere who benefited from it and it is the big farmer who will benefit from this scheme.  The small farmer will be lucky if he gets £15 a year out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farmer would do better if he got £5 for every calf born.  Deputy Gibbons mentioned that the demand for heifers is going to jump so high that it will not be possible to get them. In that event, what is to happen to the bullock?  You are giving a boost to the heifer trade and neglecting the bullock trade.  I would like the Minister <Col N="1537" /> to point out who will benefit from the heifer scheme but I am afraid that the small farmer is being neglected again.  He does not count.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to deprecate anybody trying to drive a wedge between any section of farmers, whether they be big, middle or small farmers.  As far as I am concerned, they are all farmers.  We are dealing with an Estimate which covers a large variety of matters.  I shall start with the educational and advisory services of the Department.  I note that the Estimate for this Department is increasing every year and this year has reached the grand total of approximately £39 million.  If we really want &mdash;as I think we all do&mdash;a better return from agriculture, we should realise that the keystone is agricultural education and advisory services from people educated in a manner in which agriculturists should receive education.  Certainly, the Department has done wonderful work regarding its system of agricultural education.  I do not suggest that the limit of efficiency has been reached but I appreciate that there are marked improvements year by year.</P>
      <P>Agricultural education, in the first instance, caters for and fits boys and girls to become agricultural advisers of one kind or another.  Our advisory service is very important in relation to agriculture.  I have an idea that its importance is not as well appreciated as it should be by our farmers and perhaps even by some members of county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is pleasing to note that the work of the Agricultural Institute is starting to show its benefits to agriculture.  I congratulate the Minister on making available more agricultural advisers for congested areas.  I appreciate more fully the fact that those advisers will be under the Department's committees of agriculture.  I firmly believe that we have not yet anything like enough agricultural advisory services.  I pay tribute to the Minister and his Department for what has been done but I do not think this should be anything like the end.  I am convinced that the need <Col N="1538" /> for agricultural advisory services will become greater day by day.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Thomas Walsh, when Minister for Agriculture, agreed to an intensive advisory service in a creamery district adjacent to where I live.  At the time I was chairman of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture and I accompanied a deputation to the Minister, who agreed to give us an intensive advisory service on certain conditions.  One was that it would cater for all the farmers in that area, whether or not they were sending their milk to that creamery.  Another condition was that the service would have to be under the supervision of the local county committee, acting for the Department of Agriculture.  Incidentally, the county committee were paying 50 per cent of the cost of that service, the local creamery were paying the other 50 per cent.  A third condition was that this service was not to be regarded as a precedent but as an experiment.</P>
    <P>The professors of University College, Cork, went around the area and made a survey of the production for the previous year.  They called to each house.  They were helped in that survey by the members of a local committee and portion of the cost was defrayed from the local co-operative society's funds.  Five years passed and in that time a casual observer could see that the face of the countryside had changed.  We had early grass.  It was not really a tillage area.</P>
    <P>University College people again went to work on another survey: that is a good many years ago now.  However, the result of that survey was never given to the Cork County Committee of Agriculture, and I believe that what they found was not given either to the local co-operative society.  That is a disgraceful state of affairs for professors of a university to condone.  I do not like to attack people who are not here to defend themselves, but I want to register my disapproval of their neglect.</P>
    <P>A very useful thing in the line of education was introduced a couple of years ago.  The vocational education people combined with the Department of Agriculture in running winter farm <Col N="1539" /> classes.  There were some of them in Cork County, including the constituency I represent and, as far as I can gather, they proved a great success. We found a little reluctance at the start among some who thought people could not do a good job for themselves.However, before even the first course began, all those who applied could not be accepted.  I would suggest the extension of these winter farm school schemes to other districts. Instead of having three in Cork, I would like to see half a dozen each winter and a corresponding number in other counties.</P>
    <P>In my county I am glad to note that the young farmers and farmers' sons are availing themselves very much of winter agricultural classes.  At this rate it will be a good many years before we have reached the stage where all young men who want to earn their livelihood by farming and by the care and management of their own farms can receive education in one of the Department's agricultural schools but the winter classes, plus the winter farm schools, are an invaluable aid to these people.</P>
    <P>I must also congratulate the Department and the Minister on the successful drive against bovine tuberculosis. It was rather a tough job to undertake.I live in one of the six counties where eradication has not yet been completed but I was glad to note a few weeks ago at a bovine TB eradication advisory committee meeting in Cork that the incidence of the disease has come down to four per cent, from the original figure of over 30 per cent. I was also very pleased to note that the Department intend to take up all the reactors in these remaining counties and have them disposed of before the end of the year.  Farmers may haggle and grumble about price&mdash; whether they are justified in that I do not know &mdash; but getting rid of the reactor is the most important thing of all.  We will not feel the full effects of the eradication scheme until the last reactor has been removed from the Twenty-six Counties.  When that is done, we can reasonably assume that the price of our cattle will be a good deal higher.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> I wish to compliment the Minister and the Department on the subsidisation of artificial fertilisers and lime over the years.  In my district, at least, that has resulted in the land carrying increased stock and in an increased production of milk.  If I take my constituency into account, which I always do when speaking here, there may be some areas where the main way of living is grain growing, and so on, but generally speaking it is a dairying district.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department are also to be congratulated on the introduction of this £15 for each extra heifer added to the herd.  Somebody mentioned that the small farmer gets nothing out of it.  At the start, the small farmer does not get as much out of it as I would wish him to get, but if he has three or four heifers incalf every year, when there is a £15 bonus going you can reasonably expect he should get somewhere around half of it.  I think he is entitled to it.  The man who adds the heifers cannot keep repeating it year after year but for three or four years at least, the small farmer will be getting the £7 10/- extra for that calf, and more luck to him, although he is not getting nearly as much as I would wish him to get.</P>
    <P>There are many branches of agriculture but dairying is the foundation and the greatest of all.  I am pleased to note that, despite the lamentations of born pessimists&mdash;I have heard it represented down in my constituency over the past two or three years that with the removal of the reactor, there would be no milk available for the creameries&mdash;the supply of milk to the local creameries is increasing according as the reactors are being dropped out.  It shows how wrong some people can be.</P>
    <P>As a dairy farmer myself, I would like to see more being given for milk. When considered in relation to other sections of the community, the dairy farmer is entitled to more and the gap between the earnings of the agricultural worker and the industrial worker should be made much narrower.I know this cannot be done overnight.  It may entail some difficulty <Col N="1541" /> and I am glad to note that in official statements the Government have made it quite clear they are trying to close that gap.  I hope they will be as successful in closing it as they were in closing the gap between output and wages during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>One of the great industries in my part of the country, next to cattle raising and milk, is the pig industry. It is a very important industry.  Deputy Browne from Mayo stated that the pig industry had gone from the west. He also stated that western farmers had no sale for their cattle at the last couple of fairs.  I do not know much about the west but I was through portion of the Deputy's county some months ago.  Going through it made me feel rather penitent because the majority of the land I saw could scarcely be regarded as land at all, except perhaps by a shipwrecked sailor.  It is very poor country.  I am not going to lecture Deputy Browne or the people of the west.  They have my utmost sympathy.  I cannot see why they got out of pigs or why they have not availed of the fertiliser and lime schemes as people have in other counties.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of wheat offals. We are wasting a lot of our time and we should turn our attention to something more practical.  We find of course that Irish wheat is costing more and the farmer is entitled to get more.  It is believed from the other angle that foreign wheat went up again this year and the price of offals went down, for which, from the farming point of view, we are glad.  It is the usual way with business; these are things which will fluctuate and nobody can control them, but I do not understand why the pig industry has gone anywhere.  A special attempt should be made by the Government in the congested areas in this regard.  They have tried to do a lot for these areas but an attempt should be made to encourage the pig industry in them. I do not know if the west is as badly off in regard to fertiliser as a recent survey showed West Cork to be.  If it is, the first thing that should be done is to try to get the holdings fertilised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> I know that Deputy Browne mentioned that the people would have to buy cattle but the Agricultural Credit Corporation have some fairly good schemes and lend money on fairly good terms.  If you use a man's money, you must pay for the loan of it.  We have all had to borrow money but we survived.  Courage is half the battle, no matter what you are battling for and in farming, you definitely want courage.  Above all, you want a lot of courage in politics.</P>

      <P>The courage you will get there will be true courage.  In the main, the Department and the Minister are doing a pretty good job.  It is all very grand to talk about prices and the rest of it, and what we are going to get for milk, but somehow I do not believe it because when the Opposition were in Government, they asked us to reduce the price of milk by two-pence a gallon instead of increasing the price.  Let us be practical, no matter how we are going to argue with one another across the floor of this House.  For the sake of ourselves and the people, do not sing songs of despair, particularly when there are no grounds for despair.  It is a very bad thing if you try all the time to dishearten people.  I daresay that some people have emigrated because others were explaining to them that they could not live here.  That is a wrong policy.  We should always strike a cheerful note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can remember people, particularly small farmers, who had to work hard to survive and who did survive.  They worked harder than people have to work today.  I do not want the people today to be the slaves people were in other times.  It is a good thing that they reached the stage at which they could get away from the poverty and misery which existed for generations.  What I am saying is the truth and I do not care who criticises me for it.  The world today is not as large as it was and you can go to New York and back in one day if you want to.  All you require is the cost of the journey. The dangers of travelling are not as <Col N="1543" /> bad as they were.  We have emigration and we have people leaving the land, but the extraordinary thing is that although many people have left the land within the past ten years, the output of the land has increased.  It shows that somebody is making the best use of modern development methods.  That is what we should try to do.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Browne mention the food processing factories. Earlier, somebody mentioned a rumour that all was not well with them.  I am not a member of the new company but I am a member of the council of the Beet Growers' Association and my information is to the contrary, that the work is going ahead to get those factories going, to get the essential crops grown and while I do not know the date, something is supposed to be done this year.  In a matter of this sort, everybody will give the necessary encouragement to get the vegetables grown for processing.  I admit it requires capital to start companies to engage in these activities and where money is borrowed, there must be taxation to pay it back.</P>

      <P>At Question Time to-day, I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands certain questions in relation to the Meevagh boatyard in Donegal.  First, I want to say that from the time I was asked to inquire into the troubles at this boatyard.I felt I should pursue a course of delayed action.  I did not want to be too much on the attack against the <Col N="1544" /> Parliamentary Secretary, because I felt, if I pursued a certain line of attack and if this boatyard were eventually closed, the Fianna Fáil Party could say: &ldquo;Your Fine Gael representative in North-East Donegal helped to close it.&rdquo;  I was content to allow the Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara to do everything they could to try to solve the difficulties confronting the men there.  I regret to say that, having waited almost five months, I found nothing happened.</P>
      <P>To-day I tabled the following question to the Minister for Lands:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Lands the number of boats, similar to those built in Irish boatyards, purchased by State grants or loans in Scottish, English and other foreign markets; the total amount of (a) grants and (b) loans given; and the rate of interest charged on loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 52 was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Lands if he will make a comprehensive statement relative to the future of Meevagh Boatyard, County Donegal in view of the great disquiet in that area over the mishandling of the matter by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
      <P>The reply to that question was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scale of operations at any boatyard depends on the volume of boatbuilding and repair work available.It is regrettable that there was a walk-out of staff at Meevagh boatyard in August last, but I am satisfied that no blame attaches to Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the handling of the matter.  As to the future, I am hopeful that the various incentives in the Government's Programme of Sea Fisheries Development will lead to increasing demand <Col N="1545" /> for new boats and expansion of boat-building.</P>
    <P>I want to say, first, that there was no detailed reference in that to the Meevagh boatyard.  This yard has employed 14 workers for the past 50 years.  In the spring of this year, the workers became suspicious as to the happenings at the boatyard.  In consultation with their union representatives, they held a meeting in Donegal town.  They were convinced after that meeting that the future of the boatyard was in question. They knew some of the workers would be laid off, but they did not know which.  They agreed amongst themselves that if any were paid off, they would all walk out.  I admire that decision.  At the same time, they contacted their public representatives. They contacted me and I, in turn, made representations to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I got an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that there was no truth in the rumours circulating.</P>
    <P>On 29th July, however, I got a telephone message inviting me to a meeting of the workers in Downings. I understood that all public representatives were to attend that meeting.  I attended and found no public representative but myself present.  I was asked to preside.  I did so, but I warned the boat-builders that any decision they arrived at would be their own decision and that I would not influence them one way or another.  I did try to guide them to the best decision. They were determined that if the notices were not withdrawn, they would all walk out.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned on 19th July, and on 27th July, seven men received notice.  That decision must have been known to Bord Iascaigh Mhara before the Dáil went into recess.  I feel common courtesy demanded that a Deputy who had been in contact with the Department on this matter should have been notified of any decision it was his business to know.  I received no communication from Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I was surprised when I received the telephone message to attend the meeting.  I promised to bring the matter to the notice of Bord Iascaigh Mhara the following day.  I phoned a <Col N="1546" /> civil servant in Bord Iascaigh Mhara and told him the men were prepared to stay on the boat until it was finished. They claimed there was at least two months' work for the 14, but the Department felt they would be in one another's way.</P>
    <P>Despite the promises made by the Minister for Local Government that the Parliamentary Secretary was doing all in his power to promote more work in the yard, they were not prepared to yield one way or the other.  At this time, the Parliamentary Secretary attended a meeting of the Sea Angling Festival in Killybegs.  On the front page of the <i>Derry Journal</i> of August 20th there appears a photograph of the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;a very handsome one, too, if I might say so. On the same front page, however, appears the heading &ldquo;Fears for Future of Donegal Boatyard.&rdquo;  If the Parliamentary Secretary had Meevagh boatyard at heart he would have visited it from Killybegs.  He had with him Mr. Brendan O'Kelly, chairman of Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
    <P>The next relevant item which appeared in the newspaper was on Tuesday, 3rd September, when the Minister for Local Government, who had failed to attend any of the previous meetings, turned up at a joint meeting of the local development association and the workers.  The heading on the front page of the <i>Derry Journal</i> read: &ldquo;Meevagh Boatyard Won't Close.&rdquo; This is the crux of the matter and this is the point I want cleared up: While the Minister says in Donegal that Meevagh Boatyard will not close, the Parliamentary Secretary in this House admits that is in doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying he might tell us <Col N="1547" /> what is the future of the Meevagh boatyard.The Fianna Fáil Government closed Meevagh in 1947.  Deputy Dillon, when Minister for Agriculture, opened it and it remained open until July of this year.  If any effort had been made by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to get extra employment for those who were working at Meevagh boatyard the yard would still be working.</P>
      <P>A further headline appeared in the <i>Derry Journal</i> on 10th September from Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  It said: &ldquo;Outlook Gloomy for Meevagh Boatyard, says Board.&rdquo;  I do not want to labour this point but if the Minister for Industry and Commerce can give millions to the Verolme boatyard at Cobh, it is not too much to expect that a boat should be built at Meevagh boatyard, so that 14 men can be kept in employment.  I feel it is an abuse of the moneys of our citizens that so much is being poured into Cobh boatyard to facilitate the millionaires of the world, to facilitate foreigners, while boat-builders in Donegal, anxious to work and build fleets for the fishermen of this nation, are left without employment.</P>
      <P>The second-best industry this nation has is fisheries but the Parliamentary Secretary is failing in his duty to promote better facilities for the workers in boatyards.  As a warning, I say that today Meevagh boatyard is being closed down; tomorrow it will probably be Killybegs, and then Baltimore or Dingle.  It is a ridiculous situation when people in the fishing industry can go to Scotland or England and purchase vessels with the aid of Government loans while at the same time, men are being put out of work in a boatyard in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to come down off his high horse and pay a visit to Donegal.  Let him forget the stories that officials of Bord Isacaigh Mhara tell him; let him forget all the stuff he reads in books and come down to practical knowledge of what the fishermen and boat-builders of the country want.  If the Parliamentary Secretary came to Donegal and spoke to the 14 men who <Col N="1548" /> are still idle, it would not be outside the realm of possibility to find a solution to the problem.  As Deputy O'Donnell wishes to speak, I shall give way to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief.  In this House we pay considerable lip service to the Irish language and to the Gaeltacht.  We boast of what we are doing to preserve the Gaeltacht and give employment in it.  In Meevagh, there is the only boatyard in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and 14 Irish-speaking families are getting a living from it.  This is the boatyard selected by the Parliamentary Secretary for closing.  It is not the first time it was closed.  As Deputy Harte said, it was closed in 1947 and reopened by Deputy Dillon in 1948 and the Parliamentary Secretary is about to close it again.  Why does he not come straight out and say that Meevagh boatyard in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht will be the last to be closed?  That is what we want him to say.  If he does so, we shall be quite satisfied.</P>
      <P>Recently a boat within a radius of 13 miles of Meevagh lost its propeller while seine net fishing and as a result it was tied up for four months at the pier in Burtonport and the crew left idle simply because the propeller could not be procured.  If Meevagh were in full production and carrying spare parts, the propeller could have been provided in 48 hours for this boat, the property of Mr. John McGinley.  Incidentally, it was a boat issued under Deputy Dillon's scheme for the issue of boats without deposit to Gaeltacht fishermen. It is the only one I know of issued in Donegal to an Irish-speaking fisherman without a deposit and it is still the property of the Board.  It was allowed to lie at Burtonport for four months, simply because the propeller could not be obtained.</P>
      <P>We know that if you order a boat from McDonnell or Tyrrells, there is a delay of at least 18 months before the boat is available.  Yet we are closing this boatyard in the centre of the fishing industry and the centre of the Gaeltacht.  Why?  Because it is not the policy of the Minister to keep these small yards open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> The Minister gave an undertaking some time ago that the last man into the yard would be the first out.  He gave that undertaking in a letter to the Minister for Local Government. I know an employee of Meevagh boatyard who went to work there in 1950. He received his notice to quit this year and when he asked for his certificate of service, he was given a certificate from 1956 to 1963.  Why did they not give him a true certificate from 1950 to 1963, in which case he would have been the last out instead of the first? I should like the Minister to explain that in the light of the undertaking he gave the Minister for Local Government that the first in would be the last out.  I cannot name him obviously but he resides at Rossapenna Cottages at Downings.  Why was he given this certificate?  It was an excuse to get rid of him because he kicked with the wrong foot, because his politics were not the right brand for the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>There is no need to make any apology for general fisheries policy at present. Substantial grants have been introduced under the Programme for Sea Fisheries Development announced in the White Paper last April 12 months.  These grants have been instituted by the Fianna Fáil Government.  It was a Fianna Fáil Government who first introduced the principle of giving grants to enable fishermen to purchase new boats at reasonable cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;purchased at 25 per cent of the cost together with a 10 per cent incentive grant in the event of repayment being effected within ten years on the hire purchase loan.  Hire purchase commitments have now been reduced to a rate of 4 per cent per annum and the facilities now apply also to secondhand boats. The net effect has been to increase the catching power of the Irish fleet and this is the main purpose of fisheries policy at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The direct result of this constructive policy has been that in the present year, month in and month out, landings have been running 20 per cent ahead of what they were for the corresponding months last year.  This has been the most progressive leap forward in sea fishery landing since the formation of this State. They are running 20 per cent per month higher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Value and volume, a little bit ahead in value, but in the region of 20 per cent.  Largely, this has been because we have succeeded through (a) the policy of grants and loans towards the purchase of new boats and (b) the policy of making the loan facilities, with their reduced interest rate, available for the purchase of secondhand boats, we have succeeded in increasing the catching power of the fleet.  Indeed, the boats which have been purchased on the secondhand market abroad are boats that could not have been constructed in any Irish boatyard and they have enabled high-powered vessels to be put in the hands of Irish skippers, thereby considerably increasing the catching power.  Killybegs has been in the forefront of this policy of having high-powered vessels.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am anxious to get down to the specific issue, although the debate was enlarged by both Deputy Harte and Deputy O'Donnell, and that is why I made my preliminary specific remarks.  Coming now to Meevagh boatyard, the situation that has faced An Bord Iascaigh Mhara here is one in which there was a walk-out by the employees in Meevagh boatyard actually at a time when there was a vessel in course of construction in the yard, a vessel that would have provided work for some time ahead. The issue is as simple as that.  Indeed the trade union concerned, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, at all stages had detailed discussions with the officers of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara who travelled down to Meevagh on several occasions for these discussions, not alone with the men but with the local branch secretary of the union.  The Board reached agreement on a rota basis on which the men would be employed.  There was not enough work on hand to employ the 13 men there but a rota basis was agreed on as being suitable, <Col N="1552" /> between the officers of the Board and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  The men concerned repudiated this agreement and, despite the very strong advice given to them by the local branch secretary of the trade union, a total walkout was organised by the men concerned and there the position stands.</P>

      <P>The union concerned adopted a very responsible attitude in this matter but their advice was apparently ignored and the situation now is that, following a walk-out while work was still in progress at the yard, work has not been resumed, for the simple reason that the men concerned have not resumed work.  The position was left open for some time.  The boat which was in course of construction was there available and work could have been resumed by the people who walked out, but that was not done.  Reluctantly then, after a period of time, it was decided to remove the boat to Baltimore boatyard for completion and that, in fact, has been done.</P>

I still maintain, as I have suggested to the Minister for Local Government by correspondence, and statements here in the House, that, in the event of orders coming along, these orders would be utilised in Meevagh boatyard.In fact, one such order relating to one boat was halfway through the course of construction when this walk-out took place.  Any such suitable orders could be channelled to Meevagh boatyard if there were men available to carry out the work.</P>

There is no question of this matter concerning an unofficial walkout action being lifted into a general indictment of the fishing industry.Any such attempt is fraudulent. As I said, the industry at the moment is doing very well, thanks to a positive Government policy, which has provided grants and incentives to our fishermen to buy new and secondhand boats, Government policy which has decided to concentrate on major fishery harbours around the coast, one of which is in County Donegal.</P>
