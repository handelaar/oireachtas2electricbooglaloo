    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was about to deal with the purchase of land by non-nationals.  There is grave disquier in the country over the purchase of land by foreigners.  While the position has been exaggerated, nevertheless I am of opinion that the Government should take drastic action because people are seriously perturbed over these purchases.  The stamp duty of 25 per cent should be doubled or, better still, increased to 100 per cent. The amount of land available to the Land Commission should be preserved <Col N="178" /> because sales of land to non-nationals will reduce the pool of land.</P>
      <P>Another matter that enters into it is that those foreigners who purchase estates pay grossly inflated prices for them.  I know of a holding in the midlands which was sold for a very big figure and shortly afterwards the Land Commission tried to acquire a holding within three or four miles of this estate which had been purchased by a non-national.  The Land Commission made an offer which was rejected and Land Court proceedings were held at which the owner pointed out, and rightly so, that this adjoining holding had fetched so much an acre. He made that price his yardstick and the Commission had to pay more or less the same price.  Consequently, the rent they will get from the allottees will have to be considerably higher because of a purchase of land in the locality by a foreigner.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that a 40 or 45-acre farm is the ideal standard and one at which the Land Commission will aim.  However, I think in many cases over the last year or so his officials have not been aiming at that standard.  I know of one estate near Loughrea, the Bowes-Daly estate at Dunsandle, where the officials have not put the Minister's ideal standard into practice.  They have given tenants six or seven or eight acres of land bringing them up to 33 acres, 34 acres or 35 acres, but in few cases have they brought the tenants up to the 45-acre standard the Minister has prescribed, despite the fact that there is still ample land to achieve that aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made last night to the over-holding of land on the part of the Land Commission.  Deputy Seán Flanagan and Deputy Leneghan, both from Mayo, referred to this practice. It is one that is very difficult to explain away.  The Land Commission will be given power now to take land that has been let over long periods.  They may find out that they themselves are the biggest culprits and some other statutory body may have to be set up to take from the Land Commission land which they themselves have been holding for ten or 12 years.  They give <Col N="179" /> the explanation that they are waiting for some other land to become available in the locality so that they can effect their proposed rearrangement scheme or they will tell you that they paid so much for the land in question when acquiring it that they have to let it for many years to recoup their losses. That should not be.</P>
    <P>The Minister should insist that a register be kept of all the lands held for two years or longer and each year the Minister or some senior official of his Department should demand an explanation from the Land Commission as to why lands acquired over two years previously should not be disposed of or what good reasons they have for holding them.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly attached great importance to Section 13 which prohibits the sale, transfer, letting or subletting of certain lands without the consent of the Land Commission.  That is the best section of the Bill. Advantage has been taken of the Minister's announcement of this legislation to get out from under the umbrella and dispose of land without giving the Land Commission an opportunity of entering into competition for its purchase.  Section 13 will prevent things like that happening in future and so it is a very important section.</P>
    <P>This Bill will make an important contribution to the relief of congestion especially in the west of Ireland where it is a very serious problem.  However, people should not expect that after its enactment congestion will disappear overnight.  It will be impossible, in the course of a few years or a few decades, to bring up all farms to the ideal standard of 40 to 45 acres mentioned by the Minister.  There is not enough land in the west of Ireland to bring farms up to that standard and it will take some time to carry out the overall rearrangement scheme.</P>
    <P>However, there is plenty of land in the midlands and other parts of the country that should be purchased by the Land Commission and there is also plenty of scope for the purchase of small holdings that come up for sale <Col N="180" /> in the congested districts and there should be plenty of opportunities for working out good rearrangement schemes.  You often hear people say that land is not paying but these are the very people who buy up every farm that becomes available in my part of the country.  They march with farmers' organisations protesting about rates and other matters affecting them but yet they buy up small farm after small farm as they come on the market. Farming pays for them.  It does not pay for the small farmer who has not enough land to rear his family and provide them with the decencies of life.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to get the Land Commission to deal expeditiously with all the holdings they have on hands and get rid of them before attempting to acquire other holdings. The Bill is a good one.  I hope it will be enacted by the House and its provisions accepted by all Parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few good spots in this particular Bill but that is no justification for the attempt at this stage to hoodwink the small farmer and congest into the belief that his economic salvation is around the corner.  Some of the proposals in the Bill will be of benefit at a later stage to a Government really interested in the solution of congestion and the setting up of economic holdings but we must examine the intentions behind this legislation so far as the present Government are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past 15 years during which I have been familiar with statements made in this House, it has been stated by the former leader of Fianna Fáil, by his successor and by various Fianna Fáil Ministers for Lands that the pool of land available for the relief of congestion in this country is drying up and that it would not be possible to give economic holdings to all the farmers who needed them.  At that time an economic holding was regarded as one with a valuation of approximately £13 10s. which constituted a farm of about 20 to 23 acres. The average sized holding created by the Land Commission between 1930 and 1950 was about 23 acres.  It was during that time that the Fianna Fáil <Col N="181" /> Government kept telling the people that there was not sufficient land available to relieve congestion.  How then is it suggested that this Bill can propose to give power to the Land Commission to create holdings of from 40 to 45 acres if the land was not available in the past to create 25 acre holdings?</P>
    <P>This is another attempt on the part of the Government to hoodwink still further the unfortunate congests in the west of Ireland.  I should like to congratulate Deputy Carty on the remarks I heard him make here last night when he pointed out that if the Minister is really serious about the welfare of the smallholder he would put a ceiling on the amount of land to be held by any individual.  While you have no power to limit the amount of land that can be purchased you will never have enough land available to relieve congestion.  I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil have no intention of putting any ceiling on the purchase of land by non-nationals, by speculators, by big business people or by big professional people.</P>
    <P>I believe, however, that Fianna Fáil are no longer in a position to delude the small farmers and congests of this country, because, everywhere large tracts of land became available over the past ten years, they have been allowed to pass into the hands of people already well off, people who had no need of land and who, in many instances, purchase land to evade responsibilities as far as income tax and other State levies are concerned. At the same time, small farmers in the vicinity of these large tracts were left with no hope for the future because those tracts represented the only opportunity in the different localities of getting an increase in holdings.</P>
    <P>The main thing we have to examine in this Bill is, as I said, the intention of the Government to do something. Let me put this to the Minister: he is now of the opinion that 40 to 45 acres of good land is the essential sized holding.  Yet, he tells us that he has experience of small farmers and their needs over the past 30 years.  Will he tell me now why only two years ago he stated publicly that 33 acres <Col N="182" /> of good land should be sufficient for any farmer?  Why did he change his mind within two years and jump from 33 acres of good land to 40 to 45 acres now?</P>
    <P>Surely, if a man has any knowledge of land problems, or professes to have any deep interest in the farming community, he will not be dogmatic in 1961 in relation to the figure and then be equally dogmatic two years later in substantially altering that figure. The simple fact, of course, is that the Minister let the cat out of the bag in his opening statement when he said there was a very strong volume of opinion that an economic holding should be a larger unit, say of 50 to 60 acres, but he went on to add that the available pool of land is limited; he felt, if he went a little higher, the fraud that it is proposed to perpetrate now would be completely exposed so he settled for a lower figure of 40 to 45 acres.  Tied in with the intention of increasing what he terms the size of an economic holding is the warning that conditions by 1970, if we are admitted to the Common Market, would justify raising the ceiling with regard to the size of the holding.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of our entrance into the Common Market, is it not a fact that the Common Market countries are making preparations for the extinction of eight million farmers in Europe?  Eight million smallholders will go out of farming as a result of the policy of the Common Market countries.  Is it not fair to suggest now that this Government are prepared to tie in with Common Market policy by creating circumstances here which will wipe out completely the small farmer; when I say &ldquo;wipe out completely the small farmer&rdquo; I mean wipe out those of them who remain.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement has, of course, an answer to that. At page 5 he tells us &ldquo;I must emphasise the adoption of an area of 40 to 45 acres for the family farm does not carry with it any implication of deliberately reducing the number of persons on the land.&rdquo;  What implication does it carry if it does not carry that?  If there are a number of small holdings in rural Ireland under £20 <Col N="183" /> valuation, and the pool of land is limited, and if you increase some of these holdings to a £25 valuation, what happens the remainder?  Do you not need the remainder in order to create the £25 valuation holding? You are, therefore, automatically decreasing the number of landholders in the country and it is a dishonest statement on the part of the Minister to say there is no intention of deliberately reducing the number of people on the land.  This is a deliberate, planned step on the part of the Government to hasten further the flight from rural Ireland.  The key to any solution of the land problem is a ceiling on the amount of land to be held by any individual and until such a ceiling is imposed it is nonsense for this House to try to give hope to those who need land that their needs will be satisfied.  The real test is whether the present Government are prepared to put that ceiling on.  It is my belief they are not prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>We must examine, as I said, the intention of the Government in introducing this Bill.  According to the Minister, one of the reasons for the introduction of the measure is the fact that in certain parts of the country many holdings lie vacant and let in most cases being badly worked.  When the Minister comes to reply I want him to clarify that statement.  I want him to state what the certain parts of the country to which he refers are.  The belief is prevalent at the moment that the Minister is referring to the west of Ireland in particular where as a result of the policies of this Government over the years, a large number of very small farmers and congests have been forced, through economic circumstances, to pack their bags, close the door of the house, set the little bit of land, and go to work in England.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter.  Is it intended that in an area where such events have taken place the Land Commission will now direct their attention as far as the acquisition of land is concerned?  I make no bones about it: the aim of this Government is, in my opinion, to rap down on these <Col N="184" /> unfortunate people whom the Government drove out of this country.  It is an amazing situation to find at the moment that, when the Land Court sits, there are a dozen cases of acquisition notices on holders of 10, 20 or 30 acres.  Much time is wasted and much money spent on arguing whether a 10 acre holding should be acquired by the Land Commission. Inspectors are brought to Galway or Roscommon, or from these areas to Dublin, to give evidence about the working of a 15 acre holding.  Counsel are engaged on both sides to advise and, after very serious deliberation, the authorities make a decision either for or against.  All that time, all that effort and all that money is spent on a few acres, a few acres held by a man who had to leave the country and who left it with the clear intention of returning, when he had made some money in England, and enlarging his holding.</P>
    <P>While that is going on, we have on the other side the scandalous position of large farms changing hands and the Land Commission doing absolutely nothing about them.  If the Minister thinks my description is wrong, I shall give him a specific example.  If he cares to look at the local papers in Roscommon published over the past two months, he will find that a large number of cases were heard by the Land Court, and various appeals, and all in connection with small holdings.</P>
    <P>When the question arose of dealing with substantial holdings first, for some unknown reason, these cases were brought up to Dublin for hearing, and then they were dealt with within a few minutes.  Within three miles of the town of Roscommon there was a farm of land of approximately 100 acres situated in the heart of 25 or 30 small holdings.  This was a nonresidential farm, a first-class piece of land.  The majority of the smallholders around it were hard-working farmers trying to eke out an existence on their existing holdings.  The Land Commission showed an interest in this farm for a couple of years prior to its going on the market. When it did go on the market, it was purchased by a professional man.  I have nothing whatever <Col N="185" /> against the individual who purchased it, but it was purchased by a professional man who had no need whatever of the land.  The Land Commission notified their intention of acquisition, but the Land Court confirmed the sale of this farm to this professional man, in spite of the needs in the area.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister reconcile that position with his intention to give from 40 to 45 acres of good land to people in the west?  That is only one farm.  Within the past two years over 2,000 acres of suitable land within ten miles of Roscommon town were purchased by professional people, cattle tanglers, people who had no need whatever for land.  What has happened, in fact, is that practically all the suitable land in that area has been bought up by people who should not have been allowed to have it. There is no hope now of the small farmers in that area ever getting an economic holding.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to realise that this Land Bill was not necessary to acquire those 2,000 acres.  All that was needed was a proper mentality on the part of those charged with relieving congestion.  The existing powers of the Land Commission were sufficient to acquire the lands to which I have referred.  In fact, the existing powers of the Commission are sufficient to acquire all the land necessary for the relief of congestion provided a ceiling is put on the amount of land held by any individual.  We have a Government who profess an interest in the smallholders, a Government supporting a Constitution which states it is the duty of the Land Commission to create the maximum number of economic holdings.  Yet they appoint on the deciding authority in the Land Commission persons who have no interest whatever in the relief of congestion and who are all along the line on the side of the big fellow.  The intent of whatever legislation has been passed in this House by the goodwill of Deputies on all sides is being defeated because of the type of people appointed to decide whether land should be taken or not.  The position is so serious that only after very careful screening should people be appointed as Lay Commissioners to <Col N="186" /> carry out this very onerous and responsible task towards the small farmers.  All the legislation here is useless if people are appointed as Lay Commissioners with the mentality of ranchers.  That is what has happened in the past.  That is one of the real reasons why we have no proper approach made to the solution of congestion.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to tell us the certain parts of the country where these holdings he referred to are vacant and are badly worked.  I do not want to quote at length from a speech the Minister made some time ago about the people who spent all their time going to race tracks, when he said it was time they were forced to work their land or have it taken off them.  If he is referring to these gentlemen farmers who are not utilising their land, then I am with him.  But we know there are very few of that type in the undeveloped areas and congested areas.  There are few gentlemen farmers there who can bring their Jaguars to every race meeting in the country.  The Minister knows where those gentlemen live.  He must know the way their land is being neglected. Yet he has the audacity to come in here and say it is necessary to bring in legislation to deal with them.  It is not necessary to bring in legislation to deal with people not working their land at present.  This is another attempt to suggest that the Government are now serious about dealing with those people who have made no use of their land over the years.  I am referring in particular to the midlands, where thousands of acres of land are being allowed go to waste&mdash;a sin against the nation&mdash;and no attempt is being made by the Government to acquire these lands and create economic holdings in order to give the small farmers and congests in that part of Ireland an opportunity of working that land in the interest of their families and of the nation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has made any close analysis of the extraordinary way the population is based here and how unfairly balanced the land is distributed so far as the small farmer is concerned.  There are 12,000 holdings in Ireland with a poor law valuation of approximately <Col N="187" /> £2¼ million.  There are another 280,000 holdings with a poor law valuation of £1.9 million.  The 12,000 holdings I refer to represent 3 per cent of the holdings in Ireland, while the 280,000 represent 70 per cent.  Therefore, 3 per cent of the holdings have a poor law valuation of £2 million, whereas 70 per cent have a poor law valuation of less than £2 million.  What kind of a balance is that?  If we are to have any land policy, we must start on the holdings in the category to which I have referred.  It is a terrible crime to find our young people, who are anxious to work the land and to go to agricultural colleges to increase their knowledge of farming, being denied that opportunity while first-class land is left to people with no sense of responsibility to the State.</P>
    <P>It was either Deputy Leneghan or Deputy Flanagan&mdash;perhaps both&mdash;who stated that this Bill came too late, that it is 40 years too late.  It shows that the Deputies concerned are aware of the situation in rural Ireland.  What they are not aware of is that there was sufficient legislation there already to deal with the majority of the problems but it was never brought into proper use or when the Land Court dealt with matters, they leaned over backwards to favour the big fellow, as I have described him already.  I do not see where this new legislation will be loaded in favour of the congest or the small man.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters in the Bill which I would prefer to deal with on Committee Stage and I will reserve some of my comments on the various sections for that Stage.  The Bill, which was heralded for months by the Fianna Fáil Party, is one further proof that they have no hope left in them as far as rural Ireland is concerned, that the mentality of big business, big everything, has now taken over completely in this Government, big industrialists to get into big production as far as the Common Market is concerned, big supermarkets as far as business is concerned and big ranches as far as rural Ireland is concerned. It is a big change for a Party like <Col N="188" /> Fianna Fáil which professed to look after the small man.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear now that Fianna Fáil are in the hands of the very wealthy and powerful interests which are in the city of Dublin and that the backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party, some of whom have spoken here, no longer carry weight.  The very fact that Deputies Carty, Flanagan and others were forced by circumstances to come into this House and protest that the Bill was either 40 years too late or that there was nothing in it that would bring about a solution of the land problem is proof positive that the people who elected them to this House are losing confidence fast in Fianna Fáil and when this Bill, with whatever changes are made in it, becomes law, it will be then even more apparent that the hopes which the small people in Ireland have are finally dashed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant today to hear members of the Fianna Fáil Party themselves express anxiety about a matter to which we have drawn the attention of the Government repeatedly over the past few years, that is, the purchase of agricultural land by non-nationals.  It is a deplorable thing that the Government have sought consistently to minimise that situation and even to deny the existence of the problem.  Now their own backbenchers are warning them.  It is a problem which causes acute anxiety in the country and is there in spite of the denials of the Government Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I direct the attention of the House to this situation because I think it is not only socially undesirable but may give rise to very undesirable consequences. We seek to promote the introduction of industrial capital from abroad for the purpose of industrial development in this country and our people have no instinctive reaction against the introduction of foreign capital for industrial development and the provision of employment.  They have no instinctive reaction against the acquisition of land for the erection of industrial premises or factories and they do not very much mind the acquisition of <Col N="189" /> residences with pleasure grounds annexed to them, but they know quite well the difference between that kind of acquisition and the acquisition of agricultural land.  If you asked them to define it they might find some difficulty but there is really no confusion in their mind.  They are perfectly right: there is a fundamental difference between the two kinds of transaction and the transaction which is pregnant with evil is the acquisition of agricultural land by non-nationals.  That ought to be brought under stricter control so that the magnitude of the problem can be kept under constant review and where it seems, as I believe it now seems, that in certain areas it has gone beyond the limit which it is socially desirable to permit, then the powers of the Land Commission should be invoked compulsorily to acquire that land for distribution amongst congested holders whom it is desired to resettle.</P>
    <P>The only satisfactory way in which this can be done is to make suitable provision that any transfer of land which operates to transfer the beneficial ownership of the land to a non-national shall be null and void if it is not registered in the Land Commission. Unless that is done, all sorts of legal devices will be operated in order to conceal the true purchaser of the land.  Trusts will be set up and Irish companies will be established and a variety of legal devices employed so as to ensure that the legal title to the land, in fact, passes from an Irish owner to a new Irish owner in the person of a company or a trust but where that is further pursued to the point of ascertaining who the beneficial owner is, it will be found in many cases that the legal owner, who is an Irish personality in the form of a trust or company is, in fact, holding the land for the benefit of a non-national.</P>
    <P>The only way in which that can be effectively checked is to declare by law that any arrangement of that kind is null and void and the payment of the consideration will not operate effectively to transfer title to the land.  In those circumstances, this kind of transaction will no longer take place because competent conveyancers will <Col N="190" /> realise that the non-national purchaser would fail to get a good title to the land he sought to buy unless there was prior notification to the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>If we could get that kind of exhaustive record kept then the true dimensions of this problem would become manifest and the great evil of public <i>malaise</i> which the Minister must himself now realise exists when he hears the backbenchers of his own Party speak of it would be allayed and we would know what the real situation was and be in a position to determine what steps were necessary to bring the problem under effective control.</P>
    <P>This Land Bill has some useful proposals in it and some proposals that will want very scrupulous attention on Committee Stage but I want to raise specifically this issue of principle. What purpose have we in mind?  Are we trying to wipe out the whole system of tenant proprietor farmers in this country?  If we are, we are mad. We have a whole social system built up in this country based on the principle of the man who works the land owning the land he works upon.  We arrived at that arrangement after fighting a land war and after years and years of struggle, and subsequently of domestic legislation, in order to give effect to it.</P>
    <P>Some of us here remember the air of triumph and rejoicing which swept through this country when the 1923 Land Act was passed which transferred all tenanted land in Ireland to the Land Commission for conveyance to the tenants.  Are we to go back on that?  Do we want to get the people we settled on the land off the land? I do not.  It is very popular continental economists' talk to say that the only way to operate the land satisfactorily&mdash; from the economists' point of view&mdash; is to wipe all the smallholders off the land, divide it into large sections and operate it on a quasi-industrial basis. That was Lord Lucan's view.  It is nothing new.</P>
    <P>Lord Lucan took that view in the first quarter of the 19th century and proceeded to do it on all the Lucan estates in west Mayo.  His idea was to remove all the tenants from their <Col N="191" /> holdings, consolidating the holdings into 500 acre lots, to bring in Scotch factors and to re-employ the displaced tenants as labourers.  The net result was a savage land war, at the end of which it was not the tenants who were gone off.  Lord Lucan was gone. I am sure the economist, John Stuart Mill, and others who contemplated that operation deplored the failure of Lord Lucan's plan.  Do we?  I do not.</P>
    <P>Our people were right.  They kept a firm grip on their holdings and they have since reared generations of good people on that land.  This is a very fundamental matter.  I was recently in west Donegal and I came to two houses I knew very well when I first went to Donegal as a representative for the constituency 30 years ago. When I first went there 30 years ago, those two houses were situated on two adjoining small farms and according to the standards obtaining today, the people living there were poor.  They did not think they were poor.  They were two very independent families and as fine people as one could meet in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>Out of these two houses there came, in the poverty which an economist would regard as unsufferable, a university professor, the matron of one of the largest specialist hospitals in the world, two principal teachers of national schools and a very high member of the Irish Civil Service who was universally esteemed.  Now those two houses today are receiving into them, I am sure, four to six times the income that they had when I first knew them.  Where are the children of those houses now?  They are not acquiring, at great sacrifice, the education which their predecessors sought, secured and exploited.  They are working in the tunnels of Scotland. There are two or three girls in industrial employment in England.  They are earning four to six times as much as their parents ever earned, but they have never passed the sixth book in school and they never will.  The girls are working in factories in England and are earning far more than the women of their homes earned 30 years ago.  They are lucky to get <Col N="192" /> married to respectable boys in England or they will come home and get married here if they are luckier.  Which is the better life?</P>
    <P>I think the life these people lived, in dignity and security on their own holdings, and the struggle they made to get education and to aim at higher things for their children were infinitely better than the transfer of those families from those small holdings into the comparative affluence of industrial employment in Great Britain.  In that part of the world, they go largely to the tunnelling employment.  Not a month passes in Donegal that some boy is not brought home in a coffin because everybody knows that the mortality rate in that work is very high and hence the immensely high wages they are in a position to secure.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this country should ask himself what is most important in life.  Is it money or is it happiness? I am convinced that the people who knew poverty but who, by their efforts, attained to the positions of professor, matron, principal teachers, and so on, are infinitely better off in that they are truly using the faculties with which God endowed them to the highest possible purpose, with a corresponding satisfaction, than the succeeding generation who, turning their backs on that kind of struggle for higher education, have gladly sought the additional financial reward of prompt enrichment in the ranks of industrial labour in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I think it is true that in many parts of rural Ireland today economic difficulties have become so great, particularly in the case of small farmers, that they have been forced into industrial employment in Britain because the struggle to keep their families at home became impossible.  The rising cost of living operated to destroy the possibilities of very small farmers in this country hanging on and they have been forced to abandon the life they would have preferred in favour of industrial employment in Britain so that they can live.  That is a great tragedy.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves now, when considering this Land Bill, what is our <Col N="193" /> ultimate objective.  I want to see kept on the land of Ireland as property-owning farmers the maximum number of families the land is capable of supporting. I want to suggest to the Dáil that if you want effective land reform in this country, one of the essential features of it is reform in housing. If we are to have the people firmly fixed on the land, we must envisage a situation in which girls are prepared to marry into farms and rear families.  The plain truth is that in the congested areas, particularly, though the houses are decent, time has slipped by.  People really have not adverted to the fact that many of the houses are there since their reconstruction after the Famine. They have been there 100 years. There have been adjustments and alterations made but fundamentally the amenities and accommodation are those of the first half of the nineteenth century.</P>
    <P>Such houses in our cities and towns have largely disappeared.  The Gaeltacht housing scheme brought a great revolution in housing in the fíorGhaeltacht, but outside the Gaeltacht in the congested areas as defined by law, the plain truth is that the general accommodation of the houses on the farms corresponds closely to the kind of accommodation that used to be there for all to see in the thatched houses in our towns and villages.  In the towns and villages now, there are no thatched houses left.  In the course of the past 40 or 50 years they have all been pulled down and replaced by new houses with modern amenities.</P>
    <P>On the small holdings in the country, no such revolution in housing has taken place and unless and until we can promote that revolution in housing on the small holdings, then our hopes of preserving the present social pattern of our society must be illfounded. Therefore I suggest to the Minister that one of the most important reforms required in land legislation at the present time is a clear indication to small holders all over the country that they can build themselves a new house with reasonable amenities and on terms they can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>I saw an admirable model of a <Col N="194" /> Land Commission house which was shown here in Leinster House some time ago.  I understand that such a house can be built for under £2,000. With appropriate grants from the local authority and the Department of Local Government the net cost of that house could be brought down probably to something of the order of £1,400. If that were spread over a sufficient term of years as an addition to the small farmers' annuity, it should be possible for a very large number of small farmers who really require new houses to arrange for such houses to be built.</P>
    <P>I imagine that if this matter were closely examined, the building of these houses could possibly be undertaken by a body analogous to the National Housing Agency, albeit that it might be better annexed to the Land Commission. I envisage a situation in which a farmer would say: &ldquo;I want a house&rdquo; and the Land Commission, if they were satisfied that he was in good faith, would arrange for the collection of the appropriate grants from the Department of Local Government, proceed to build the house, then add the cost to his annuity and collect it over the years as the land annuity is at present collected.</P>
    <P>There is not the slightest use in giving a grant of 30, 40 or 45 acres of land, unless the farmer is helped to use it to the best advantage.  If a family in rural Ireland are provided with 45 acres of land, unless they use that land to the very best advantage, instead of being a blessing, it may be a curse to them.  It is no easy job for one man to run 45 acres of land and to get the maximum output from it.  Forty-five acres of land is a borderline case.  It is too small to be mechanised and it is almost too large to be operated single-handed without mechanical assistance. Therefore unless you install, alongside a comprehensive programme of enlargement of holdings, an adequate advisory service to help the farmers to work the land to the best advantage, instead of doing good, you may be doing harm.  Advisory services are not primarily the responsibility of the Department of Lands.  Therein is one of the anachronisms of our Government, that the Department of Lands is <Col N="195" /> separated from the Department of Agriculture, because both are so intimately concerned with land.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands might as well make up his mind to the fact that no alteration in the distribution of land without effective assistance for the farmers to enable them to use it to the best advantage will do any good. The Minister must also face this fact, that no action on his part can hope to have a successful issue unless the farmers are provided not only with advice but with the means to give effect to that advice.  I am quite certain that if we are to get effective use of the land of Ireland, particularly in the congested areas, we must provide the farmers living there with credit on the terms they can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that it is quite useless in the Second Schedule of this Bill, which purports to define the areas where congestion exists, to exclude the counties of Cavan and Monaghan. Indeed I would be glad to hear what argument is there for scheduling any particular area.  Why are the operations of this Bill or any part of it restricted to that area?  Would there be any objection to making the provisions of the Bill applicable to the whole Twenty-Six Counties?  If there is insurmountable objection to that course and it is desirable to segregate for the purpose of this Bill the congested areas, then I suggest to the Minister that it is remote from reality to omit Cavan and Monaghan, the two counties in Ireland which have suffered most heavily from emigration resulting from poverty during the past ten years.</P>
    <P>I view the provisions of section 10 with the gravest concern and I do not think this is an honest section.  We all know when land purchase was proceeding in this country, in many cases the landlord had an obligation to his tenants to maintain certain embankments and works of that character which protected the land for which his tenants were paying rent from perennial flooding.  When the Land Commission bought the estate from the landlords, they took over the estate with all its liabilities and then they divided it.  On some estates they <Col N="196" /> remembered to apportion out responsibility for the maintenance of embankments and I understand that in those cases there was a suitable abatement of the purchase price and the consequent annuity payable on the land.</P>
    <P>In other estates, they did not purport to do that.  They divided the land, but the residual obligation to maintain these embankments remained with the Land Commission.  For years, there has been litigation and there have been battles going on, the Land Commission claiming they were not liable, the tenants being advised they were not liable, and my experience has been that at the point of starting proceedings in the High Court, the Land Commission have said: &ldquo;Oh, we will get the Board of Works to do something,&rdquo; and a <i>modus vivendi</i> was found and the proceedings dropped.</P>
    <P>I think this section 10 is designed to put an end to all that and instead of saying that these holdings were conveyed to the tenants without any apportionment of the old landlord's obligation to maintain embankments, we are now putting that obligation on the tenants.  If that is so, it is a very wrong arrangement to try by law to unload on to the tenant purchasers these liabilities.  They were not set out in the original agreement under which they acquired the holdings on which they now live.</P>
    <P>One has to read section 13 in connection with section 27.  At first glance, it seems to be not an unreasonable arrangement that if the Land Commission, who are an autonomous body with quasi-judicial standing, determine it is desirable to consider the acquisition of a holding, they will not make such determination without proper inquiries and due consideration of all relevant matter and that, having made the decision that they are going to inspect the land and consider its acquisition, the Land Commission should have the right to say to the person: &ldquo;With the exception of conacre, you cannot during the next 12 months enter into any arrangement involving the letting or sale without prior consultation with the Land Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is an unreasonable <Col N="197" /> stipulation, but when you read it in the context of section 27, quite a new picture emerges.  Now there has been taken from the Land Commission what hitherto was a reserved power, what was recorded as excepted matter under section 12 of the Land Act.  Now the Minister is to have the power through his four senior inspectors to serve notice.  The moment he serves notice now, there may be no dealings in the land, as defined by the restriction, without prior consideration by the Land Commission.  That is a very dangerous departure because if the Minister has power to go to anybody in the country and get his senior inspectors to take the step which brings section 13 into operation, that is a power the Minister never has had before and I do not think it is a power the Minister ought to have.</P>
    <P>We have always been very scrupulous in this House, and wisely so, to preserve the fixity of tenure, the free sale to which our people have rightly attached such importance at all times. We have consented to some abridgement of that principle if the power to abridge that principle were an excepted service in that it could be exercised only by a quasi-judicial body, the Land Commission, who were not answerable to the political head of the Department for the exercise of that power.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed under section 27 to give that power to the Minister's servants, and in those circumstances I think section 13 requires much more rigorous examination.  In my view, the amount of time you will save by the operation of section 27 is not worth the candle.  We are standing on a rock, and mind you, it is a rock which for 40 years Ministers of three successive Governments&mdash;Cumann na nGaedheal, Fianna Fáil, inter-Party, then again Fianna Fáil, then again inter-Party and now Fianna Fáil&mdash;have always defended even under vigorous pressure from their own supporters. That rock was that no political head of the Department of Lands would ever accept responsibility for determining what land should be acquired and what land should not be acquired.</P>
    <P>I know that the final decision as to whether the land is to be acquired or <Col N="198" /> not remains an excepted matter reserved to the Land Commission, but here we have introduced this new principle that the notice to consider the matter can create a 12 months' restriction on the user of that land.  I am prepared to consent to that so long as this question of inspection and acquisition remains an excepted matter, but if it becomes the power of the political head of the Department of Lands to create that situation, I believe we are making a most unfortunate inroad on a principle which hitherto we have all had the wisdom to regard as sacrosanct&mdash;that the ownership of land shall not be infringed by the political head of the Department of Lands no matter what Government he belongs to.  If the Minister finds himself with the power to direct his senior inspectors to initiate proceedings of this character, his life will cease to be worth living if he is a conscientious man, because the pressures on him to make promiscuous miscellaneous decisions of this character will be well-nigh irresistible.</P>
    <P>Sitting here in Dublin, we are only too liable to forget what inspection of such land and a restriction of this kind operating for 12 months thereafter involve in rural Ireland.  It means that for 12 months a family are living in an atmosphere of gloom.  There is a possibility, there is a prospect hanging over them that the Land Commission will put them out and it is a disruption of their lives which I think it should not be in the power of any man in the public life of this country to impose upon them.</P>
    <P>Even if any Minister's senior inspector says: &ldquo;This is not a holding of this sort; really we ought not to proceed&rdquo;, the Minister, under heavy pressure, is constrained to say: &ldquo;Nevertheless, leave the matter to the Land Commission&rdquo;.  There will be more and more cases in which local political pressure will make that course well-nigh unavoidable and serious injustice will be done and great injury inflicted.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the Minister is in a position to say: &ldquo;I have nothing to do with the acquisition of the land: if you think any place should be acquired, write to the Land Commission <Col N="199" /> and if they think it is right, they will proceed and if they do not, it is no job of mine; I do not want to make them&rdquo;.  We all know the fraudulent representations which have gone on here by many members representing to their constituents that they are in a position to divide land.  We all know the meetings at dead of night and the promises: &ldquo;This land is being divided and I guarantee you you will get a stripe of it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It has always been a source of infinite satisfaction to me to be able to say: &ldquo;I have nothing whatsoever to do with the division of land; except for bringing your case to the attention of the Land Commission, which is something that will ensure your claims will be considered, I have nothing to do with it.  But anyone who says to you that he is in a position to get you land is a fraud.&rdquo;  And, of course, they found it out.  That is true.  Now the situation will arise in which a meeting can be held in any village and a TD faced with a claim that they want such-and-such lands inspected. He is no longer able to say that he will bring the representations to the Land Commission but that he has no power to influence them; that they must decide in their own judgment what is to be done.  Now the people will be entitled to say: &ldquo;You have the power: the Minister who belongs to your Party and whom you say you represent in this constituency, has the power to get this land inspected and that is what we want&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very serious and undesirable departure.  It is supposed to expedite the process of land acquisition. It may operate to that end but when I hear Deputies speak of the desirability of setting up a super Land Commission, compulsorily to acquire from the Land Commission the land they already have and will not divide, you cannot help wondering will the little extra expedition which Section 27 is designed to produce be worth the candle in exposing people in all parts of the country to a system of political persecution of a most malignant kind if it becomes no longer an excepted function but a political function to <Col N="200" /> determine whose land is to be inspected for acquisition and whose is not.</P>
    <P>There is another detail which the Minister ought to consider.  I understand the permanent Secretary of the Department has been appointed to the Land Commission.  There is nobody better fitted to be a Land Commissioner than he is and there is a precedent for it.  The late Mr. Deegan, the Lord have mercy on him, was a Land Commissioner.  He was a friend of mine.  But there is a difference. When Mr. Deegan was a Commissioner, the powers envisaged in section 27 did not exist.  Now we are in danger of a situation arising in which the executive head of a Department, the Secretary, is directed by the Minister to order one of the four senior inspectors to initiate proceedings for the acquisition of land.  Then the question of whether the land should be taken or not comes before the executive head of the Department who is now sitting under a different hat and is supposed to be sitting in a quasi-judicial capacity to determine between the owner and the senior inspector of the Department as to whether the land should be acquired.</P>
    <P>You have the extraordinary situation of land, in respect of which he has given a direction that acquisition proceedings should be initiated under section 27, comes before him in his judicial capacity to determine whether or not it should be acquired.  I think the Minister should review that matter. Personally, I hope he will drop section 27.  If he does, this problem does not arise.  If he does not, he should face the fact that the precedent of Mr. Deegan being at one time Secretary of the Department and a Land Commissioner is not a satisfactory one in the situation it is now proposed to create.  In the absence of section 27, I have no quarrel with the arrangement, but with the operation of section 27, it appears to me we are imposing on an individual an executive and a judicial function in respect of the same matter which it is impossible for one individual faithfully to discharge.</P>
    <P>One of the new proposals in the Bill and one for which there is much to be <Col N="201" /> said is the proposal to enable a farmer incapacitated by years or, I gather, by any other circumstance to opt to surrender his holding to the Land Commission in consideration of a pension which will be payable to himself and if desired, to his wife for the rest of her life and in addition&mdash;a humane and sensible arrangement&mdash;that they may rent their own house and an accommodation garden for the remainder of their days and that there will be special concessions in respect of the annuity for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>The only question I want to ask the Minister is whether he has made the category of persons eligible to avail of this wide enough?  You have a number of odd familiar situations arising in rural Ireland where it is manifestly desirable that persons in possession of a small holding should pass it on to people prepared to work it.  You have old spinsters left in holdings desperately trying, by letting some in conacre and grazing a goat, to struggle on.  It would be much better if they took the pension and settled in the adjoining town and made the land available to some active person.  You have a number of categories of persons other than those who are actually old and incapacitated who, I think, could with advantage avail of this provision, and where the provision is purely optional and the initiative lies with the tenant, is there any objection to making it pretty wide?</P>
    <P>If somebody wants to give up land and can advance the justification to the Commission that he is physically unable to work it or for any other reason unable to use it, or, indeed, if he simply wants to give it up and no longer wants to work that land and would prefer to take a pension, is there any reason that he should not fall into this category?  What is the use of leaving a holding with anybody who says he is not able to work it or does not want to work it and would sooner be rid of it?  The best evidence of that is his frame of mind.  As long as the initiative lies entirely with him, as long as we are not proposing that the Land Commission should have power <Col N="202" /> to order him off the land.  I see no objection to widening the category very extensively.</P>
    <P>I would not be in favour of giving the Land Commission compulsory powers to put anyone out of his home. It is much better to wait for elderly people to die.  It is their home and in my eyes, it is quite sacrosanct.  It is a good thing to say to elderly people, many of whom we know personally are hanging on beyond the limits of reason and sometimes at great sacrifice: &ldquo;Look, the sooner you settle down in comfort in the house and in the garden and let the land go, you ought to do it.&rdquo;  I think that is a very good idea.  I admit you may not be able to be quite as liberal in your proposals to persons who cannot plead old age or other incapacities but I am not sure you could not extend the plan where a person does not plead old age or incapacity but simply wants to give up the land, and elects to take a pension, rather than sell to the Commission, that would be available to the person provided he was prepared to give up house, land and all.  I suggest to the Minister that that is worth considering.</P>
    <P>I note that the explanatory memorandum states that:</P>
    <P>Cash purchases (by auction or private treaty) under the Land Act, 1950, will be open to all the purposes of the Land Acts&mdash;and no longer restricted to lands required for migrants or for the re-arrangement of fragmented holdings.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister remember when the 1950 Act was going through this House and what he had to say about this business, that it was useless, it could never be used and that it was merely eyewash to mislead the people? The education of Fianna Fáil is a slow and tedious process but it is gratifying to those of us who have undertaken it to realise that slow and tedious as it is, it progresses steadily.</P>

      <P>Of course there was a time when the Minister said that it could not be made to work.  I am <Col N="203" /> glad now that he realises the principle is a sound principle.  I am glad that he acknowledges in this regard, as he has so often acknowledged before, that it is a principle which he at first rejected categorically, which he had shoved down his throat like a child swallowing castor oil, and has come to recognise it did him good, and he is going to take more and go to the chemist and ask for another bottle and say that while he did not like it at first now he realises it is excellent and salubrious.</P>
      <P>I urge most strongly on the Minister for the reasons set out by me in regard to the dual function proposed for the Secretary of the Department, but for the far graver reason of avoiding any suggestion of political interference in the acquisition and inspection of land, that he should drop section 27.  Its only purpose is to expedite proceedings. I believe any expedition we procure thereby will be altogether at an excessive price and will create endless problems, not only for the Minister but for any successor, no matter what side of the House he might come from.</P>
      <P>These are powers which, if I were Minister for Lands tomorrow, I would not want to have.  These are powers which if I were Taoiseach and were seeking to appoint a man as Minister for Lands, I would not wish to put in the hands of any person who is engaged in public life, but which I would put quite cheerfully in the hands of Land Commissioners appointed either by myself or my predecessor in office.  Contrary to what Deputy McQuillan says, I believe, if you choose decent men for the position of Land Commissioners, they will recognise, as they have recognised for the past 40 years, the quasi-judicial responsibilities devolving on them and give effect to the land code enacted by this Oireachtas.  That is what we want.  The more detached and the more independent we can preserve the Land Commissioners in charge of this extremely delicate task, the better it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot conclude on a Bill of such importance without urging every Deputy to ask himself the questions <Col N="204" /> again: &ldquo;Whither are we going?  What are we trying to do?&rdquo;  I want to repeat here what I have said at home and abroad and of the truth of which I am profoundly convinced.  One of the most precious things we have in Ireland is the institution of a farming community who own the land they work on.  One of the proudest boasts we should have is that west of the Shannon, there are virtually no agricultural labourers&mdash; every man works for himself.  I believe that is a great sheet-anchor of stability in our society; I believe it produces a way of life which is very precious, very happy and very good.  It would be an irreparable tragedy if we abandoned that system and reconciled ourselves to the facile proposition that the dry-as-dust economists were right in the belief that there was no aspect of the user of land except that it corresponded to the higher standards of efficient operation.</P>
    <P>There is a social side to land tenure to which due weight must be given, not only to the economic return to be derived from the land but to the quality of life and to the element of happiness in the family who live and work on an economic holding in the west of Ireland as compared with the alternative available to them if they seek industrial employment either in their own country or abroad.  We will always have a sufficiency of people who choose security, dignity and happiness on their own holdings to the monetary reward and alternative enjoyments available in Birmingham, Glasgow, London, Boston and New York.  There will always be those who want to go but there will always be enough who want to stay, and we should concern ourselves most earnestly to ensure that nothing we do in Oireachtas Éireann will make it more likely that those who want to stay will, for the want of security, be driven from their homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement of this Land Bill some months ago was accompanied by a flourish of trumpets throughout the nation.  It raised the hopes of our depressed farming community; it gave them new hope that salvation was on the way.  Whether it was wise to announce a Bill of this <Col N="205" /> kind 12 months in advance is open to serious question because it does seem that the Minister, despite all the good intentions inherent in the Bill, did give to those people directly concerned in the new acquisition of land an opportunity to circumvent the Minister's intentions, and to render useless a goodly portion of the good intentions of this measure.</P>
      <P>Anything which can be done to help the small farmers of this country, to bring them a greater sense of prosperity, security and happiness will, as always, have the full support of the Labour Party.  We welcome enthusiastically those parts of the Bill which seek to ensure that in future there will be allocated to those needing them economic holdings of land of from 40 to 45 acres so that the people living on these farms will be assured of a decent livelihood, that they will have a decent standard of living and be able to live in frugal comfort.  That is a very desirable thing.</P>
      <P>There are many important features in the Land Bill, in its intention to give the Land Commission power to acquire more land, acquire it more speedily, divide it more speedily, to ensure economic holdings, to restrict the usage of land by people who are not using it to the best advantage, to restrict ownership by absentee landlords and by those who are unable to work the land properly.  Those are good features and so are the provisions which ensure adequate compensation for the owners of land acquired, the payment of pensions to old people who give up their land and the provision of facilities for them to continue to live in their old homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we have to have regard to the fact that land is limited in this country since ours is an island home, surrounded by the sea.  Land is very much coveted in this country and clearly there is not enough to go round. For that reason, we wonder why the Minister did not think fit to tackle the fundamental problem facing the farming community by reason of the acquisition of land by foreigners.  This Land Bill fails miserably to grapple effectively with the land problem because it ignores the situation which is <Col N="206" /> created by the right of foreigners to purchase land in this country.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister has not had regard to the pleas made in this House in recent years to stop the purchase of land by foreigners.  I wonder why, given this unique opportunity, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that something effective was done in this regard.  We are agreed to concede to the Minister and the Land Commission the power to acquire land which is not properly worked and we are doing this at a time when we are well aware that the most arable tracts of land in Ireland to-day are being purchased by outsiders and that the Land Commission are unable or unwilling to grapple with this problem while we have terrible congestion all over the country.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were sincere in his desire to provide economic holdings for all farmers in need of them, he surely should have taken steps in this Bill to restrict the acquisition of land by outsiders, by people who have no regard for the Irish people or for our heritage, who are alien in origin and outlook and who are only coming here to exploit to their own selfish advantage the people and land of the country.</P>
    <P>We welcome outside capital, outside advice and guidance in respect of our industrial potential and, indeed, of our farming potential as well.  We welcome foreign investment in industry to create employment but, as a Party, we stop short when it comes to the selling out of the land of Ireland.  This is something which no Irishman could condone and it is a problem fraught with the danger of serious repercussions.  We deplore greatly the absence of any restriction on the purchase of our land by aliens.  We say that the Bill fails in its objective by reason of the fact that the amount of land available to the Land Commission is clearly restricted to these parcels of land which from time to time come on the open market.</P>
    <P>The vast tracts of land in this country, the big estates, are becoming more and more coveted by outside people and are being sold privately to people who come in here when large estates are available.  This is causing <Col N="207" /> indignation and anger amongst the unfortunate small farmers in the congested areas.  These men know when an estate is likely to be sold and they look forward to seeing it acquired by the Land Commission and divided amongst them.  There is consternation when they find that it has been sold privately to some foreigner.  The Minister has completely ignored that aspect of social life in Ireland.  There is nothing in this measure to grapple with that problem.  We merely give more power to the Land Commission to do a deal in regard to these small parcels of land which may become available from time to time; but, in regard to the vast areas of arable land, so coveted by outsiders, the Land Commission are clearly bereft of power to deal with them.</P>
    <P>We do not believe the Irish farmer should be sacrificed on the altar of private property.  We do not believe the Minister should permit a situation to continue wherein the profit motive reigns or wherein money is the criterion by which land is adjudged.  We all know outsiders can come in here with packets of paper money, buying up our best land, and the Land Commission are unable to compete with them.  In such circumstances, what chance has the small farmer?  What chance have the small farmers in the congested areas of ever getting a decent parcel of land?  There are no provisions in this Bill to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>I hope it is not yet too late to prevail upon the Minister to introduce the necessary restrictions to preserve the land for the people of Ireland in the first instance.  That is what we should do if we are sincere.  We support the contention of so many Fianna Fáil Deputies that a ceiling should be placed on the number of acres any person may own.  That is a reasonable suggestion.  Its reasonableness is made manifest by statements of Deputies in the Minister's Party.  It is desirable and timely that a limit should be placed on the acreage any one person may own.  Only by such restriction can we hope to deal effectively with the land problem and give to uneconomic holders the acreage the Minister <Col N="208" /> envisages and the opportunity to enjoy a fuller, happier and more prosperous living.</P>
    <P>In 1961, some 19,000 persons left the rural areas.  They migrated to the cities and towns or emigrated to Great Britain and elsewhere.  The figure is an alarming one and it should engender shock and shame in all, and particularly in those in authority and in power.  This is a fantastic drift from the land.  Our rural areas, which form the basic social fibre of the nation, are denuded of population.  If this denudation continues, we shall have no land problem for there will be no one left to whom to give land.  They will have gone, as a result of economic pressure, because of their clear inability to eke out a meagre livelihood in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is time some Government took the necessary steps to bring back a spark of life to our rural areas and do something to entice our people to remain on the land.  The whole question of land has been grossly mismanaged since the inception of this State.  The great pity is that the ideals and aspirations for which so many generations fought and died were not given effect to at the foundation of this State in 1922. Down the years, little or nothing has been done to put the Irish farmer back on his own land, to make him the heir to the land of Ireland, to the wealth of Ireland, and to help him to share in the national estate which his forebears before him created and in which he is entitled to participate.</P>
    <P>Nothing effective has been done by so-called Republican Governments to undo the conquest of 700 years.  Vast estates have been allowed to remain in the hands of the land barons and the laws condoned that situation and consolidated the position of these barons.  Our concern is not for the rancher and the land baron; our concern is for the poor small farmer.  Our concern is for the real people of Ireland who look to an Irish Government to acquire and divide these estates and give them a chance of a new life in the new Republic.  Irish Governments have failed to recognise their signal, patriotic duty.  We have now a Land <Col N="209" /> Bill which merely tinkers with the problem, which avoids any reference to restriction on the purchase of land by aliens, or other flagrant defects in present land policy.  We welcome the extra powers the Land Commission seek.  We hope that this Bill will have the effect of ensuring that land that is not being properly worked, land owned by absentee landlords, will be speedily acquired and speedily allotted and that this interminable delay we have experienced in the Land Commission will be obviated.</P>
    <P>I feel disposed to speak on this subject of the Land Bill because since I was elected to this House two years ago I have been inundated with representations from the smallholders of South Tipperary and West Waterford in respect of their crying need for more land.  Those people reside mainly on the sides of mountains or close to bogs. The problem they have of trying to eke out an existence on a few acres is, indeed, a sorry one.  In the main they live away from the built-up areas. They have no proper roads to give access to their farmsteads; their houses are in a state of dilapidation. They have no running water, no sewerage facilities and no modern amenities in their homes.  Under such conditions is it any wonder that as soon as their children come to adult age they get away as fast as their heels will carry them from these lonely primitive parts of Ireland?  In the face of such circumstances, is it any wonder that we had something like 20,000 people leaving rural Ireland in 1961? The number fell slightly last year, but an alarming number of persons are still flying from rural Ireland.  This is because of the lack of land, lack of modern amenities and lack of the effective State aid necessary to enable these people to remain on the land.</P>
    <P>It is greatly to be deplored and regretted that despite the generous State aid and stimulation to agriculture by the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture&mdash;these twin Departments concerned generally with the land question&mdash;in the main it can be proven conclusively that these aids are benefiting one section of the farming community only, that is, <Col N="210" /> the big man.  The rich farmer is benefiting mainly by these State aids.  Clearly the poor man is unable to avail of them because he does not have the initial capital.  Therefore, we have a policy of State aid which makes the rich farmer richer and the poor farmer poorer.  We should like to see differentiation in the allocation of grants.</P>

      <P>We should like to see the help and aid provided in the Bill conferred on those who most need it, to bring them up from the bottom rather than down from the top.  Apart from the desirability of an economic holding of from 45 to 50 acres, the Minister must have regard to the fact that, because of the isolated locations in which some of these farmers reside, there is a problem of housing.  It is no good giving a man a holding of 40 to 45 acres, unless one has regard to the house in which he lives and to the social amenities which he enjoys.  He must have good roads, running water and electric light.  He must have a comfortable home with all modern amenities.  The Land Commission must be prepared to build more houses for our small farmers.  In my constituency particularly we rarely see houses being built for farmers where land division is concerned.  Many of the farmers living on the foot hills of Slievenamon, the Comeraghs and the Galtees who have hopes of getting land where estates are being divided are wondering what will be done about their housing circumstances.  Many of them are anxious to leave these mountainous parts and come down to the lowlands.  But that involves a problem of whether the Commission are prepared to build houses for them.  We should like to see greater emphasis laid on the ideal of providing proper homes and outoffices with the land, so that these families will have a sense of security and permanency and that they will remain on in these farms and work them as effectively as they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see in the Bill that the Minister is prepared to facilitate in every way the purchase of farms where <Col N="211" /> people are unable to work them economically by reason of age or disability and that he is prepared to pay a decent price, if necessary even in ready cash.  Moreover, there is provision in this measure for a pension, so to speak, for these old and disabled persons who remain on in the homestead. The Minister will appreciate that the enticement of the old age pension for the aged owner of a farm to make over that farm to the younger members of the family has not been the great incentive it was hoped it would be. Admittedly, there is an enticement to the old folk to hand over the farm, but it is not a sufficient enticement.  I know many old farmers not enamoured of the prospect of 35/- a week when they sign over their farm to the eldest son or other relative.  The Minister described the pension he has in mind as an annuity.  I was wondering whether it would be paid annually or monthly. Having in mind the type of person we are dealing with, I believe the pension should be a weekly pension.  Those disabled persons who may have land but are unable to work it should be treated particularly generously.</P>
    <P>We welcome and support many of the other provisions of this measure. We congratulate the Minister on his courage and daring in facing up to this problem of the land question in Ireland. He has done something effective towards remedying the problem.  As I have pointed out in the main portion of my speech, it is greatly to be deplored that he did not face up to the main and fundamental problem confronting us, that is, restriction on the purchase of land by aliens.  I only hope that as a result of the overwhelming consensus of opinion on all sides of this House in respect of this problem, the Minister may be able to see fit on Committee Stage to bring in a provision which will satisfy us that the large tracts of pastureland which are now falling into alien hands will be conserved for the Irish farmer as being the only effective thing we can do to resolve this problem of smallholders and congestion with which we are concerned today.</P>
    <P>In respect of the acquisition of land <Col N="212" /> by the Land Commission, there ought not to be the great delay from the time land is acquired until it is actually allotted.  It is a matter of concern to us that so much land acquired by the Land Commission is let in conacre.  I may say in respect of the land which is let in conacre that it is not being availed of by the smallholders in the area concerned.  It is put up for public competition and it is mainly the big farmer who is able to acquire the conacre. There are estates being let in conacre not merely for one year but for two years, and perhaps three years and more.  We feel that when land is acquired, the Land Commission should be in a position to carry out the necessary investigations and allot the land within a reasonable period of time and should not allow this practice of reletting year by year to go on interminably while leaving people in congested areas in a state of expectancy and agitation as to when they will eventually be helped by being allotted a piece of land.</P>

      <P>I think it is agreed on all sides of the House that every Deputy welcomes a Bill such as the one now before us.  In my opinion, this is the one Bill that will solve the problem of small western farmers. Having regard to the position in the Minister's constituency, which is the same as that in mine, the Minister more than any other Minister ever appointed Minister of State must realise the difficulty of the small uneconomic holders of the west.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the Bill he has introduced.</P>
      <P>I should also like to congratulate the Minister on the design of the new Land Commission house which has water, sewerage and other amenities laid on.  The provision of such a house was long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not agree with the last speaker's statement that the Land Commission did not build houses for people.  To my knowledge, the Land Commission have built houses on rearrangement or resettlement, at any rate in the west.  There were certain cases where the Land Commission did not build but they were cases where <Col N="213" /> the holders were not being moved from their original holding.  In all such cases, however, the Land Commission gave substantial grants to the people to build their own houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister should direct his Department not to sanction the sale of land, especially in congested areas, until a full-scale investigation is made as to whether it is suitable for rearrangement or resettlement.</P>
    <P>My principal reason for intervening in the debate is to ask the Minister to make provision in this Bill in respect of commonages in townlands.  The time is long overdue when the division of such commonages should take place. There may be ten to 15 or there may be only three to five persons availing of the commonage.  They all pay a certain annuity in respect of it.  One of these persons may be better off than his neighbour and may be able to stock the commonage with sheep or cattle, as the case may be, while the others may not be in a position to do so.  It means that the one person is grazing the whole commonage.  If the commonages were divided amongst the persons concerned, with the aid of grants from the Department of Agriculture, each individual would be able to hold his own portion and, if necessary, sell the grazing of it and make a few badly needed pounds out of it.  I hope the Minister will make provision in the Bill to deal with that matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> This Bill, I suppose, is like many Bills, another curate's egg: it has its good parts, its bad parts and its doubtful parts.  Land division is generally deemed to be good politics, if you do not divide the land.  It is generally deemed to be good politics if you keep on promising but difficulty often arises for a politician when the land is divided in that he makes one friend but makes many enemies.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a western Bill.  It has the complexion of a western Bill introduced by a western Minister.  I am sure the Minister would not object to being clothed in the mantle of a modern Moses leading the displaced children west of the Shannon to the Promised Land of Westmeath and Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> I was surprised that in the Schedule to the Bill there is no mention of Tipperary or of my constituency of South Tipperary.  I know, of course, that we have not the problem of land congestion as it exists in the west&mdash;no Munster or Leinster county has&mdash;but there is this problem in Munster, and I am sure in Leinster, in practically every county.  I could mention places in my constituency like Hollyford, Upperchurch, Kilcommon, Newport, the Glen of Aherlow, the Nore Valley, many areas in west Waterford, in which the problem is as bad as it is in many parts of the west.  Indeed, I am quite sure that for any lands made available in Tipperary we would have sufficient deserving applicants there without ever having to cross the Shannon or to go outside our own county.  I do not believe this Bill will make the tremendous impression upon the land congestion problem west of the Shannon that the Minister appears to think it will unless he proceeds with some kind of system of wholesale confiscation of land&mdash;and, of course, that is not envisaged.</P>
    <P>Will any priority basis operate as regards the distribution of land?  The information is not given in the book of statistics for constituencies.  Presumably, the number of holders under one acre would mostly be cottage holders. In South Tipperary alone, we have 3,000 and for North Tipperary, the figure is 5,322.  The total number of holdings is 19,545&mdash;roughly, 20,000.</P>
    <P>According to the book of statistics there are 1,311 holdings of one to 5 acres; 895 holdings of five to ten acres; 621 holdings of from ten to 15 acres; 2,262 holdings of from 15 to 30 acres and 3,023 holdings of from 30 to 50 acres.  I have divided the 30 to 50 acre group and taken half of the figure as the number of people with uneconomic holdings, simply as an estimate.  I have eliminated entirely the cottage holders. On that basis, from one acre upwards to half the figure between 30 to 50 acres, I find we have a total number of between 6,000 and 7,000 holdings that might be classified as uneconomic. That is in County Tipperary as a whole.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister deal with these <Col N="215" /> holdings on any kind of a priority basis?  Will the man with 30 acres take precedence as regards land settlement over the man with 20 acres?  With only a limited amount of land, obviously we can deal with a larger number of holdings if, for instance, we take the marginal economic holdings.  Furthermore, will the Minister stop at marginal economic holdings?  Will the person with from five to ten acres ever secure an economic holding?</P>
    <P>I asked a question in the House here some months ago whether cottage holders will qualify or can get land. We are always told they are not excluded but, in practice, I think it happens that they very rarely secure a division of land.  I asked how many landless men secured land in North and South Tipperary over the previous five years.  The answer was 15.  In other words, three men in every twelve months in North and South Tipperary who were classified as landless secured some parcel of land.  I cannot remember how much the persons in question got but at least they got some land. That was only a small percentage of the amount of land distributed during that period.</P>
    <P>From a practical point of view, as regards getting land, I think cottage dwellers can be written off.  It is well that that should be known. Unfortunately, they have been used for political purposes down through the years.  In my constituency I have found, going around here and there, that it is quite commonplace to establish persons in a cottage next to a farm where a couple of old people live.  Down through the years, the cottage dwellers are promised at various political meetings that, for instance, Mick Murphy's farm will be divided any day now. Loyally, year after year, those people would be at the polling booths, waiting for the day when Mick Murphy would die and they would acquire a piece of his land.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It would be well if these people were told honestly that their chances of getting land is practically next to nothing rather than have them live in a kind of fool's paradise down through the years.</P>
      <P>What is the position of people with from one to five acres, from five to ten acres and from ten to 15 acres? Will the Minister tell these people now that to resettle them would require a large amount of land and that there are so many of them that in the first instance, from a practical point of view, we must deal with the marginal holders as our first concern because they are much fewer in number and would more easily be dealt with in so far as they would require only a small amount of extra land to make their holdings viable?</P>
      <P>Has any Minister the courage to say to these people with from one to five acres and from five to ten acres that there are so many of them and that they need so much land that they have to be written off?  Any Minister would be very slow to tell these people that harsh truth.  I think it was Deputy McQuillan who mentioned that there was a steady process in operation on the Continent under which they were prepared to extinguish eight million landowners because of the Common Market.</P>
      <P>If we took the people in North and South Tipperary with from one to 15 acres and said to them: &ldquo;You are too difficult a problem for land resettlement,&rdquo; we would be telling 2,827 people: &ldquo;There is no more hope for you now.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding <Col N="217" /> £119,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for payment of Increases in certain Pensions, etc., in respect of public service.</P>
    <P>In moving this Estimate, I want to apologise for a statement I made yesterday which was slightly misleading.  When I was asked what did the Estimate cover, I said it covered all except the Army.  As a matter of fact, it covers the Army, too.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Estimate is to seek the approval of the Dáil for increases in Public Service Pensions, including Military Service Pensions and Special Allowances, and to authorise payment of the increases with effect from the 1st November, 1963, in advance of legislation.  I hope the necessary Pensions (Increase) Bill, to give statutory authority for the increases, and for those given last year, will be taken very shortly.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Budget in April last, I indicated that it had been decided to provide a further increase in public service pensions, thus following up the generous increases given last year, which had already raised pensions above 1955 level, irrespective of how long ago the pensioners had retired.  These and later pensioners will benefit under this year's increases which will raise pensions to the level of the higher salaries introduced in December, 1959, for the Civil Service, and on other dates about the same time for other public servants.  Flat rate pensions are being increased by a percentage, generally about 5 per cent, determined by reference to increases granted in cognate pensions in relation to pay or cost of living movements or other relevant factors.</P>
    <P>The revision of all public service pensions to 1959 level is a notable achievement which has not, of course, been effected without substantial cost to the Exchequer.  The total annual cost involved in bringing all pensions to 1959 level is approximately £1.14m., of which £820,000 is in respect of the 1962 increases and £320,000 in respect <Col N="218" /> of this year's increases.  These figures include any Exchequer recoupments in respect of part of the pensions increases paid by local authorities.</P>
    <P>In this year's Budget, £120,000 was provided to meet the anticipated charge on voted moneys in the current financial year in respect of the increases to 1959 level, which have effect from 1st November, 1963.  In the light of the results of more detailed pension calculations which have since been carried out for the various services, it is expected that a sum of £119,000 will be sufficient to meet the current year's charges and provision accordingly has been made in the Additional Estimate before the House. This sum will cover payment of the increases for all pensions paid direct to the recipients out of Votes of the Oireachtas.  The main classes of pensioners&mdash;former civil servants, national teachers, and so on&mdash;appear on the face of the Estimate.  Part of the cost of certain local authority pensions, such as vocational teachers pensions, is recouped by the Exchequer and the Estimate contains a small provision to meet any claims which may be presented by the local authorities before the end of the financial year.</P>

      <P>I have always found pensions legislation and administration extremely difficult to follow, but listening as carefully as I could, I found the speech of the Minister equally difficult and I am sorry he did not circulate a copy of his speech before he made it. I might then perhaps&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; advisedly&mdash;have been able to follow it more closely.</P>
      <P>However, as I understand it, going back to the Budget, the effect of this Estimate is that all pensioners who are now drawing pensions and who retired prior to the 1959 increases in Civil Service and public service pay generally are now brought up to the level of pension at which they would have been if they had retired immediately after the 1959 public service increases in pay were given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There have since then been two further revisions in <Col N="219" /> public service pay and I take it that the figure of £1,140,000 the Minister mentioned was the figure for bringing pensioners who retired between 1959 and the present time up to the level of pension at which they would be if they retired on the present scales.  That is a substantial sum from the point of view of the taxpayers of the country but it is a very much less substantial sum when one considers it in terms of difficulty and hardship to the individual pensioners and particularly when we remember that they are facing now a substantial increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the manner in which the cost of living has increased consequent upon the urge to increase prices that resulted from the Minister's Budget turnover tax proposals.  At that time we were told by the Minister that the proposals would not mean any increase of any consequence in the cost of living.  We know now that he was wrong in that.  We know now that the true position is that the past month has shown a substantial increase in costs, particularly in the cost of the necessaries of life, a cost which falls more harshly on the pensioner than on any other sector of the community and the House will have to face up to the position that another improvement in the lot of pensioners is urgently necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the time or the place to consider the effect of the ninth round discussions that are going on outside the House in relation to public service salaries and pay generally.  It is an open secret that the amount of that round will be substantial and that the Minister will find that the cost of the public service will advance very strikingly.  It is a pity that because apparently of a nice theoretical calculation the Minister by the turnover tax proposal in his Budget started off this upsurge which will mean the beginning of an inflationary spiral.  Whenever there is inflation, the people who are hit most are the pensioners.  The people who are living on small fixed incomes are those who suffer most from inflation and while we welcome this contribution towards easing their burden and bringing <Col N="220" /> them up to the 1959 level, at the same time with the outlook ahead, it seems to me clear that in justice to the people concerned a further amelioration in their conditions will have to be brought in at a very early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must sympathise with the Deputy because I know that statements like this when they are read are not easy to follow but the figure I gave of £1.14 million was roughly the figure of the cost of bringing the pensioners up both last year and this year.  It is not an estimate of what would be necessary to bring pensions up to the present level.  I think the Deputy can calculate that for himself.  From the date mentioned herein, the end of 1959, there was the eighth round increase which was roughly 15 per cent. A 15 per cent increase in pensions would cost £1 million, and we are not doing that.</P>

      <P>That is right.  There is one thing I should like to say, and we will be able to discuss it fully when the Bill comes before the House, before Christmas, I hope.  We have put pensions now on a fairly solid basis.  The previous increases were a percentage here and a percentage there, but now we have a flat basis in respect of the the pensions applicable around 1st January, 1960, and I feel from this on it will be a simple matter to deal with pensions.  It will be a matter of a percentage increase from whatever money is available to us.</P>

      <P>Control of Imports (Quota No. 2) (Amendment) Order, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4(2) of the Control of Imports Acts, 1934 provides that any quota order made under the Act and <Col N="221" /> any order similarly made amending that quota order shall cease to have effect on the expiration of six months from the date on which it is made unless it is approved by each House of the Oireachtas by resolution passed before the expiration of the said six months.</P>
    <P>The order to be approved is the Control of Imports (Quota No. 2) (Amendment) Order, 1963.  The effect of the order is to remove quota restrictions on cycle tyres in relation to OECD countries.</P>
    <P>Quota Order No. 2 prohibits the importation of cycle tyres except under licence.  It is desirable that quantitative restrictions on imports, generally, should be removed as soon as possible, in view of Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community, since such restrictions will have to be removed at once on entry into the Common Market so far as the goods of the member countries are concerned.  For this reason, and since it was practicable to do so, it was decided that the quota on cycle tyres should be removed, subject to adequate safeguards against imports from low-cost countries.  The Irish Dunlop Co. agreed to this.</P>
    <P>The effect of the order is to remove the quota restrictions on cycle tyres manufactured in existing OECD countries while maintaining them on imports of cycle tyres from other countries, including low-cost countries. Under the Control of Imports (Amendment) Act, 1963, which became law on 26th June, 1963, there is power to operate quota restrictions on a selective basis, i.e. the restrictions can be removed in the case of goods manufactured in some countries while they are retained against goods manufactured in other countries.  The order was made in accordance with these provisions.</P>
    <P>There is a customs duty of 67½ per cent full rate, 45 per cent preferential rate, on cycle tyres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>For the second time within a quarter of an hour.  I must reprove a Minister for breaking the undertaking given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach to <Col N="222" /> the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to the effect that, when a Minister read his speech, a copy of that speech would be circulated.  The Standing Orders do not permit the reading of speeches, but we have always agreed it was a useful thing that an informed brief should be read by the Minister for the purpose of dealing with technical matters.  However, it was made quite clear at the last meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges recently, at which it was discussed, that while that was an excellent thing, it should be followed by the other assistance.</P>
      <P>The quota legislation is somewhat technical and as the Minister will appreciate it is unusual in present circumstances to have a quota order at all.  In so far as I was able to follow the Minister, however, the line of country in relation to this is that the existing much wider quota order has been repealed and a narrower type of order brought in, narrower in the sense that this refers only to countries outside the OECD.  It is perhaps a little unfortunate that it was administratively done in that way if it were possible to do it otherwise, because the introduction of any additional quota order is bound to create the impression outside that we are not moving away from the era of quantitative restrictions.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say we are, but the introduction of a quota order does create the other feeling, particularly when many outside, other than those in this particular trade, feel that the working of these orders is a matter that is so technical that they do not really understand exactly what is being done.  As I understand the Minister's explanation, what is being done is to enlarge the area from which these goods will be brought in without quantitative restriction and only to restrict them in the case of certain foreign countries that are not members of OECD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of uncertainty outside about the Government's general policy in relation to tariff reduction and I think it is fully analogous to quotas for many trades. The Government announced last year, <Col N="223" /> in November I think it was, that there would be a cut of ten per cent in tariffs as from 1st January, 1963.  That, of course, was ten per cent of the then existing tariff: when, for example, it was 60 per cent it meant ten per cent of 60 per cent, or a reduction of six per cent.  That was made clear from the announcement made by the Minister on, I think, 13th November, 1962.</P>
    <P>Later, the Minister made another announcement, but, unfortunately, I failed to find the exact statement issued from the Government Information Bureau.  Another announcement was made by the Minister in which he said there would be a similar reduction of ten per cent on 1st January, 1963.  I failed to find the exact reference, though I searched pretty well for it.  My recollection, however, is pretty clear that the announcement made in relation to the tariff cut of ten per cent coming on 1st January last was that it was to be exactly similar to the ten per cent that came on 1st January, 1962.</P>
    <P>In fact, therefore, it would mean that a tariff of 60 per cent on 31st December, 1961 would become a tariff of 48 per cent on 2nd January, 1963. My recollection is fairly clear that it was a straight-line ten per cent that was set out.  Certainly, that was the understanding in industry at the time and I think it is currently understood by industry that that was the Government's intention in those notices.  I was therefore very surprised indeed to find &mdash;and this is where the confusion has arisen&mdash;that the Minister, when replying to the debate on 5th November this year, indicated that the position was not a straight-line reduction of ten per cent but was a ten per cent diminishing basis; that, in the case I have mentioned of a 60 per cent tariff, it would become 54 per cent in 1963 and after 2nd January next, would become 48.6 per cent; in other words, that the reduction now would be ten per cent on 54 and not on the straight-line ten per cent on 60 per cent previously announced.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there is this misunderstanding as to what exactly is in train outside and the Minister can <Col N="224" /> be assured that there is very great misunderstanding and very great doubt and vagueness as to which of the two statements was correct.  I was in touch yesterday with a person at the hub of industrial policy and it was categorically his view that the straight-line method was what had been announced all along up to now and that the statement made by the Minister on 5th November was not in accordance with previous statements.  I think it desirable that the Minister should take this opportunity to clarify the position beyond question so that we shall know exactly where we stand on 1st January.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy's suggestion that I may have broken an agreement, or rather an understanding, reached in the Committee of Procedure and Privileges among the Whips, I plead guilty, but so far as this is a one-page four-line foolscap document, I did not feel it necessary to circulate what I proposed to say on the order.</P>
      <P>I am very glad Deputy Sweetman raised the other matter because I want to plead guilty to a lapse of mine in the course of my reply to the debate on the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, on 4th November. I corrected that mistake with some Deputies who were in the House at the time but not unfortunately in time for the publication of the unrevised edition of the Debates.  I also corrected it with some traders who raised it with me but not in a general way.  Therefore, I am obliged for the opportunity of being able to correct what I said on 4th November.  What Deputy Sweetman has now stated as to his first understanding of the rates of reduction is correct.  If I may take his example again, in the case of an <i>ad valorem</i> tariff of 60 per cent before 1st January, 1962, the ten per cent reduction effected is a six per cent decrease, leaving it at 54&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I was endeavouring to secure from the Minister in his reply some indication as to the policy as regards land resettlement as between the very small holders and what I might call the marginal economic holders.  I was pointing out that if you take holders from five acres up&mdash;ten, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 acres&mdash;you will have broadly diminishing numbers of holders as you proceed from the lower to the higher acreage.  In the lower acreage group, you have a large number of holders and if they were to be accommodated as regards land settlement, they would individually and collectively demand a larger amount of land than those in the higher group and, therefore, I think you would secure the greatest immediate good for the greatest number by dealing in the first instance with the marginal economic holders, those of 30 and 35 acres.</P>
      <P>Is that, generally, the policy the Minister is inclined to follow?  At the same time, I should like him, if his objective is 40 and 45-acre holdings of good land, to let it be known so that the public and particularly smallholders will realise the position&mdash;that their chances of getting land in the immediate future are less and that they stand far down on the priority list as regards being accommodated through land resettlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already mentioned that in fact cottage-holders although they have <Col N="226" /> been deceived in this for years are virtually excluded from securing land in land division nowadays.  Again, there are exceptional cases such as where a man in a cottage, for instance, loses his livelihood, where he has worked as a steward or chief land owner on a farm, and has to be considered.  He should be considered.  Or a man who for years has taken conacre or grass and shown himself competently interested in farming would come to be favourably considered.  I know a man who has made an international reputation for himself in bloodstock, although he has no land.  That is an exceptional case but surely he is entitled to consideration.  These are the exceptions but in practice&mdash;it is not easy for the ordinary Deputy to get a figure&mdash;we find the average cottageholder is not eligible for land resettlement and the sooner they are told that, the better for the country.  It is good public relations to tell them so, even though in the immediate viewpoint it may seem bad politics.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say if, as regards taking over land, any distinction is made in regard to the functional use to which the land is being put.  I recognise the cases where land is not being worked, the absentee owner, land being sub-let, and that these constitute reasons for moving in on land but is a distinction made between, say, cattle, production of milk and tillage?  Is there a general principle that where land is being considered for taking over, the tillage farm has an edge on the dairy farm which in turn has an edge on the man who is just running dry stock?  As a general principle, that can be carried too far because certain areas lend themselves to dairying and to tillage, while certain other areas, and perhaps, the particular circumstances of a holding, lend themselves to dry stock.  If you say the only man who should have a holding of land is the man who is ploughing every acre.  I think you will be unfair in certain cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that temporary lettings would still be allowed. I wish to know for what period will a single farmer or a widow be allowed let land.  I understand that at the <Col N="227" /> moment the letting of land is allowed up to five years and after five years the Land Commission become interested. Is there a limit in regard to the temporary letting of land in regard, say, to a farmer who is ill or a widow who might not re-marry?  Will they be entitled to let their land?  Is there a limited period or is each case judged on its merits?</P>
    <P>I expressed my disappointment that my own county or constituency did not appear in the Second Schedule of the Bill which mentions Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, portion of west Cork and portion of Clare.  I am disappointed because parts of my county contain a large number of congests.  I know that the Minister may include these areas by order and add them to the Second Schedule but I would have preferred if he had introduced the Bill with them in it and not have drawn a line through the country.  I fail to see why the Minister should have placed such emphasis on the part of the country from which he comes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the part of the Bill which introduces farm pensions in the form of cash, annuity, or part cash and part annuity.  It is an excellent provision for old people to encourage them to give up their land.  It is at least better than sending them to the poor house.  The annuity is to be based on life expectancy and I assume that the Commissioners could give a more generous annuity to a very old man who they expect will live for only a couple of years, but what is the position of a person in, say, the 40's who has a small parcel of land?  What kind of annuity can they provide for such a person?  I have in mind the case of an unmarried lady with a small business, the profit from which is negligible, and who has a small parcel of land which she has let for a number of years, land which she has inherited.  The land is her sole source of livelihood.  What will her position be?  She is about 40 years of age and is incapable of working the land.  She lives in a town four or five miles away from where the land is. How will the Commissioners arrive at <Col N="228" /> a worthwhile annuity for this lady who has a life expectancy of, say, 35 years? I should like the Minister to tell us how he has worked out his approach to this type of problem.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's farm purchase loan scheme for what he terms the migration scheme for selfmigrants. That is a very good section and one which is to be commended. Section 13 states that land cannot be let, sublet, sold or transferred for a period of 12 months after an order has been made by the Land Commission. In other words, there is a freezing of the land for 12 months. Although that has been praised by most people I regard it as being a little bit extreme.  Surely if the Land Commission have done their preliminary work properly it should not be necessary for them to freeze the operations on a farm for a period of 12 months.  Surely if they said that they would stop the sale, letting, subletting or transfer of a farm for the next three months it would suffice.  I suggest the period could be shortened and that a few months should be sufficient time for the Land Commission to make up their mind.</P>
    <P>I should like to get some information about another aspect of the Bill. I understand that the pre-1933 Land Act redeemed holdings which were fee simple holdings and which are now no longer free to be sub-divided without permission from the Land Commission.  I understand there are few of these cases in the west of Ireland but I should like to know if there are many cases in the rest of the country.  If one considers the property of a man who has bought his land from the Commission is it not an infringement of property rights that, having paid his full commitments and fulfilled his obligations as far as the Commission are concerned, he should now have to approach the Commission in regard to the future of the land?  I can see the Minister's point of view. Unless there are many of these holdings, unless there are a large number of holdings which are liable to be sub-divided and increase the land slum problem, I would think it is an infringement of property rights and <Col N="229" /> questionable.  Unless that danger exists in tangible form, the provision, to my mind, would be questionable.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised at some of the statements made regarding the length of time some holdings have been in the hands of the Land Commission. Some Deputy mentioned a farm which was in their hands for 48 years and another mentioned 60 years.  In my constituency it is true that a number of holdings have been held for what seems to be an unduly long period.  I can never get an explanation of what reason there may be for that but when one hears of periods of 48 years and 60 years one is nonplussed as to how that situation could have arisen.  I think it was Deputy Seán Flanagan, who appears to have considerable experience of the Land Commission, as he would have as a solicitor, who mentioned periods of ten, 20 and 37 years of retention by the Land Commission. These extraordinary figures are quite incomprehensible to me. When the Minister is so anxious to expedite the division of land it seems extraordinary that Deputies from his own side of the House can give figures like that.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned the question of commonages and said that they should be given over to some landowner. I agree with that.  In my constituency, at Ballymore, after the division of an estate, we were left with about 40 acres.  There were 23 cottage-holders agitating for some of that land. In the event, none of them got any of it and, possibly, from the very beginning they were not eligible under Land Commission policy.  They had been promised land down through the years, particularly before an election, but then it was decided to make it into a cowpark.  There the matter rests at the moment.  Only one or two farmers are using it.</P>
    <P>There are 40 acres of land there and it is bound to deteriorate.  It was handed over to the county council.  I was against that but the council, by a small majority, decided to act as caretakers of this 40 acres.  Only one man shows any interest in it.  It is deteriorating and, unless something is done about it, it will become useless.  I do <Col N="230" /> not think you can give land out like that unless you give ownership with it. The man who uses it cannot take the same interest in it as an owner and give it the manure and attention which it needs.  Whether you call it a cowpark or a commonage, the giving out of land like that is completely unjustified. It would be better to give it to one man who would use it instead of trying to dodge the anger of people who were wrongfully promised land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the point made by the last speaker that cowparks are not desirable things. He may be speaking for himself or for his own particular circumstances but I cannot agree with him when he says that land set aside for cowparks will not be properly treated and will deteriorate.  If a county council is handling it they will collect rent for the cows that use it and will manure it and treat it properly as any other good farmer would.  If such land is not properly treated, the responsibility must rest on the county council rather than on the Land Commission.  It is only fair to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have cowparks in my constituency and we would like to have many more.  On occasion it has been found that they were established in places which were unsuitable and they have had to be resumed by the Land <Col N="231" /> Commission but if properly sited where there is a number of landless men who can feed a cow or two on them they are most useful and of great value.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question of the overholding of land by the Land Commission. That is a question that should have been dealt with in the Bill.  The Minister, for his own protection and that of his successors, should have ensured that the Land Commission would not take over a farm and then proceed to let it year after year.  If anyone tries to tell me that land is not being abused when it is getting no treatment of any kind and is simply let on the 11 months or conacre system, I do not believe him.  In County Meath &mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;there are some 8,000 to 9,000 acres of land in the hands of the Land Commission and at least 2,000 to 3,000 have been in their possession for periods ranging from three to six years. That is a shocking situation.  The excuse made in most cases is that, because of local agitation, the Land Commission wish to hold on to the land until the agitation dies down.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister not consider including in this Bill a provision to ensure that so soon as a farm is acquired, a list of the successful applicants for land will be supplied because nothing disrupts rural life so much as a large farm being taken over by the Land Commission, a great many people expecting to get land, many of whom will be disappointed, and people left in a state of ignorance as to the final allocation of those lands. I know people who have jeopardised their very existences, trying to hold on to certain things, because they were under the impression they would get a farm of land in an area where a farm had been acquired by the Land Commission.  It is no consolation to such people to discover after two, three, or four years that they are not going to get any land.  I am not blaming the Minister.  The system has grown up; everybody is promised a farm.  I quite agree with Deputy Dillon&mdash;I do not agree with many <Col N="232" /> things he says&mdash;that the practice of members of this House giving the impression that they have something to do with the giving out of land should be wiped out.  We have no power to allocate land, but that apparently is the suggestion made by some people.</P>
    <P>As against that, I suggest that if a member of this House recommends someone to the Department of Lands, the very least he can expect is to get a decent reply.  The Minister and I have had this out before by way of question and answer.  What one receives is a badly printed, or typed, sheet of yellow paper saying the applicant will be considered, or something, along with all others who apply.  Now that is not respectful.  There cannot be so many of these recommendations and it should be the easiest thing in the world to send a reply that could be read and understood by ordinary people.  I am absolutely against this stereotyped reply.</P>

      <P>I have deliberately refrained from writing to the Minister because I do not like embarrassing him.  I write to the Land Commission. The reply to which I refer is not the type of reply a member of this House should receive.  I ask the Minister to look into the matter.  If the Minister says that the only way in which to get a decent reply is by writing to him, then I shall certainly write to him in future.  I do not think that is the correct thing to do and I have always passed the recommendation to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to recommendations, a member of this House recommends an applicant.  Inspectors go to the area to interview the applicants.  It is not good enough that the people recommended by a particular Deputy are not interviewed. The very least the inspectors should do is interview them.  I do not know who decides whether or not a person is entitled to a farm but, if an inspector goes to an area, there is one way in which he can find out the facts for himself, that is, by visiting each applicant.  Not alone is that not done, <Col N="233" /> but people who have been recommended by others, including myself, are not visited.  When I write asking why they were not visited, I get no reply; I do not even get an acknowledgement. That is not the way in which these matters should be dealt with.  I have no quarrel with the Minister. This is a matter that should be dealt with by the Land Commission and the Land Commission are long enough dealing with these matters to know how to behave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy sure they were within a mile of the particular place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were not within a mile, the inspector visited people further away, and I assume the inspector knows what a mile is.  This may be a very simple matter, but it is also an important matter.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Treacy that there are certain sections of the Bill which are to be approved.  It is an excellent idea to bring land legislation up to date.  I am sorry opportunity was not taken to remedy all the known defects that exist.  All of us are aware of instances which made a hoax of the whole matter of land division.  The Minister has repeatedly stated here that the pool of land is drying up.  That seems logical enough until we look at the other side of the picture.  If the pool is drying up, why is it the Minister does not consider it important that aliens are buying one acre for every five the Land Commission take over? These are the Minister's figures.  Surely that will not increase the pool available? Surely it is foolish to allow the pool to be dried up through another outlet?  Another outlet will only cause the pool to dry up even more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the decision to give full-sized farms.  The only snag is that we immediately come up against choosing between the lesser of two evils: should a man get a full-sized farm on which he can live or should a greater number get smaller-sized farms in order that they may have an opportunity of using land?  That brings me now to the problem of congests.  The Minister has <Col N="234" /> laid down the congested districts in the Bill and he says that he could add to the list.  There is an idea, wholly fallacious, that everybody in County Meath is either working at a highlypaid job or working as a large farmer. Unfortunately, that is not true.  In portions of North Meath in particular, there are considerable numbers of congests living on very, very small farms. Over the years, a certain amount of this congestion has been remedied, but not entirely.  So long as we have these small pockets, so long will we find a great deal of dissatisfaction because people are brought in from outside the county.</P>
    <P>Consider now the position of those to whom the Land Commission gave land some years ago.  What was given was the then recognised farm.  That is now too small.  What will the order of preference be?  Will the man who got a farm ten, 15 or 20 years ago, a farm which is now too small, be considered before the man who had a farm all the time and got no addition to the previous allocation?  These problems will have to be solved and some attempt must be made to lay down a proper order of priority.</P>
    <P>One of the things we find very irritating is someone, who is not a good farmer, getting an extension to his land while a very good farmer whom everyone would consider entitled to an extension gets nothing. Possibly there is an explanation for that.  If there is, it should be made available.  We should know why these things happen.  The Minister, in reply to me, made a statement with which I do not agree.  Possibly, on reflection, he did not agree himself.  I had been making a case for a man who was a dairy farmer but who did not own an acre of land.  He owned slightly less than an acre.  He lived in a vested county council cottage and had ten or twelve cows.  He started off with one or two and gradually built up a herd.  He and his wife and young children lived off the proceeds of that herd.  He took conacre.  He got root crops in a neighbouring farm.  He took grass for the cows on the 11-months system and made a living in that way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> In my opinion he was an ideal farmer if he had any land.  When that neighbouring farm was divided, however, he did not get any of it.  The Minister told me that such a man was not a farmer and was not in the category entitled to get land.  I think the Minister was wrong and, on reflection, I think he will agree with me.  It is not the person who owns land but the person who knows how to use land who is the real farmer.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of landless men&mdash;the county council cottage tenant, vested or unvested.  Depending on the political mood of the time, it has been the practice for the past 30 or 40 years to tell these people that they are or are not entitled to land. The present Government, in fact, gave a number of these people land in the Thirties and most of them turned out to be excellent farmers.  When the decision was taken I do not know, but it has since been decided that these people are not eligible for land.  Once or twice, they have got a few acres in my constituency.  There is nothing in the Land Acts which says they are not entitled to land; yet the Minister and the Commission have ruled them out.  A person born on land, who has no land of his own but has been working on land all his life, is more likely to make a success of working land which he would subsequently own than somebody who never worked on land in his life.  The farmer's son or the farm labourer is entitled to get an opportunity of becoming a farmer in his own life.  When we find these people being disallowed it makes a mockery of equal rights and equal opportunities for all.  These people are entitled to equal rights and opportunities. They are entitled to a share and they are not getting it.</P>
    <P>Then there is the other type of man, whom I think the Minister and the Land Commission have been dealing with most unfairly.  I refer to the small farmer who, because he cannot live and rear his family on the farm, has, of necessity, to take a job.  He goes to work for somebody else and he works the farm in his free time.  If he had a full-size farm, he would not <Col N="236" /> find it necessary to do work for hire. Those people are ruled out on the ground that they are not earning their living from farming.  Surely nobody will suggest that such a farmer should stay at home and allow his family to starve until such time as the Land Commission acquire a farm in the area and enable him to get a sizeable holding?</P>
    <P>These are problems which the Minister may have overlooked.  The Land Commission from their experience should know all about them.  Apparently the Commission have not changed very much over the years, and it looks as if they are determined that the old rules which have been operating heretofore will continue in the years to come.  I should like to repeat that the small farmer who is unable to live on his holding and who has to take outside work is very definitely entitled to land.  If a full-size farm cannot be given to landless men, I suggest that at least each one of them in an area who is considered able to work land should get a small portion if a farm is being divided.  The people in my constituency most independent when times get bad are the men who have jobs with neighbouring farmers or with the county council and who have a few acres of land of their own.  If there is a spell of unemployment, such men are able to do a certain amount of work for themselves on the land.  The right to own land should be given to all these people.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the person who works on a farm which is taken over.  This is one of the most grievous injustices perpetrated by the Land Commission.  In the case of men working on farms taken over there seems to be a rule of thumb by which one man may get £100, another £250 and another nothing at all.  Of course, all of them lose their jobs.  It does not matter whether they are land stewards or ordinary farm labourers, if these people are getting their livelihood off the farm and the farm is taken over by the Commission and subsequently divided, they are entitled to compensation. In most cases the only compensation they want is land.  It is amusing to find some of these people being <Col N="237" /> offered £100 or £200.  Apparently, the Land Commission do not realise that the amount of money they are offering would not buy one acre of the land on which the man had been working. Land has reached a pretty high price in most areas, particularly in Meath.  No matter what way we look at it, it must be admitted that people deprived of their livelihood because the farm is taken over by the Commission should have first claim.  The Minister gave me a list of priorities some time ago, and I find that these people are supposed to have first claim.  But if we take the list and compare it with the actual practice, we find a different set of priorities being used.  If the Minister doubts my word, I shall be only too glad to give him particulars of farms divided where the people working on them have been, on the flimsiest excuses, completely ignored in the allocation of land.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  It is the question of the change in the annuity.  I do not think the Minister is serious when he suggests there should be such a difference, that the person who comes from a congested district should have, as he has now, to pay only half the annuity while the local person, whether cottage tenant or landless man, who gets land should have to pay the full annuity.  Is the Minister suggesting this as a good way of cutting down the flow of applicants for land in the midlands and the east?  Is the idea to make the land so dear for them that they will be afraid to take it because they will not be able to pay for it?  Something like this was done when the Gibbstown estate was divided.  That was long before the Minister's time.  First, the migrants were given 30/- a week for the first year and their annuities and rates were paid for 12 months.  But the local people who got land were given no 30/- and got a bill for the annuities and rates the day after they took possession.  This seems to be a reversion to that idea, and I entirely disagree with it.  This will be met with the strongest possible opposition because it is an attempt to try to apply two different attitudes in respect of people settled on the one farm.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> The attempt to try to persuade the old or incapacitated farmer to give over his farm is a good idea, provided it is not pushed too far.  The suggestion is made that it will apply only to those who have no friends.  I do not know if the Minister has met any of them but I have not yet met an old farmer with a big amount of land who had not a great many friends.  The older he gets, the more friends he will have.  The Minister will find very few people fitting into that category.  One thing the old farmer may be very sure of is that when he wants somebody to live with him as he gets older, particularly if he is living on his own, he will have no difficulty in finding someone who will be prepared to oblige.</P>
    <P>I have not much faith in the suggestion that this will do very much to solve the problem.  Unless the Minister uses his powers to deal with the crotchety old fellow who will not use the land and who has money enough to exist on while he allows the land to go to waste, I do not think it will be of very much use at all.</P>
    <P>The question of the annuity arises. A previous speaker made a very good point which is referred to in the Minister's speech, that, of course, the old farmer will get more for a smaller farm than the younger farmer will get for a bigger farm because of the length of years during which he will be drawing the annuity.  But there is one matter that I should like to refer to, that is, the question of pension.  From time to time, and particularly in a recent Pension Bill which was challenged in this House, we have found the State intervening to try to take away some of the benefits which have been conferred by Social Welfare under other pension legislation and which they count as part of the compensation in the case. The Minister would entirely defeat his proposals in this Bill if he attempts to tie it up with the question of a means test which will be applied in respect of social welfare payments because there will be absolute objection to it by the people concerned.  The land is worth a certain amount and the State are taking a chance on the person living a certain length.  The State makes its estimate of the number of years the <Col N="239" /> farmer will live and will fix a fair price.  If the estimate is to be affected by the amount of pension the person gets, then another Department of State will be paying for portion of the land. That is not at all desirable.</P>
    <P>Whether or not it is right that senior inspectors should have the right to order inspection of land is a matter about which we all may have doubts but I have in mind and perhaps the Minister will recall that some months ago I brought to the notice of the Land Commission a number of farms and suggested that they were about to be sold and asked the Land Commission if they would do something about having them inspected.  Nothing happened for three or four months and then the farms began to be sold and two or three of them were gone before the inspector got there.</P>
    <P>I believe it was the cumbersome machinery which was required to put the thing in motion which prevented that matter from being properly dealt with.  The Minister defended it very strenuously in the House but in view of the reference he has made in his speech I think he realises that in cases like this there should be some quick way of dealing with the smart person who feels the Land Commission are looking towards him and will get rid of the farm quickly and let somebody else carry the baby.</P>
    <P>For that reason, there should be a quick way of dealing with such people, provided it is not used for political purposes, and I do not see any reason why it should be so used.  The temptation would be there, possibly, to somebody at a pretty low level to try to put a political slant on things and to say to somebody who has a farm: &ldquo;We are going to see to it that you are not allowed to do anything with that farm&rdquo; if he thought it would gain kudos for a certain political party but I have faith enough not alone in public life but in the members of this House and in the members of any Government that might be elected to say that we do not usually have that type of person in public life.  I feel that no Minister for State would stoop to that and any Deputy who would stoop to that sort <Col N="240" /> of things would not last very long in public life.  Irrespective of any comments that may be made about the present standard of public life, we all of us claim to be at least decent enough not to allow that sort of thing to happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the question of rights of way.  I do not know whether or not the Minister is to get a special benediction before he attempts to get this matter straightened out.  It is one of the greatest sources of income for lawyers.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has consulted his colleagues in the legal profession before trying to bring order into chaos.  We have reached a stage, particularly with the advent of large size farm machines where an impossible situation is building up.  A farmer having a right of way over somebody else's land may get a new machine which he cannot get in to his land over the right of way.  The man who owns the land, possibly because he is jealous of the other man's progress, will not allow him to alter the right of way. The result is that there are all sorts of shocking situations.  We have all heard the old stories about people having to take the wheels off a machine and trying to put the machine on to some kind of vehicle in order to drag it along the narrow laneway into their land.  If the Minister is able to do anything to clear up that situation he will be doing a very good job and will earn the thanks of everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one matter about which I am not quite clear.  The Minister has referred to a reduction from seven years to two years for the period during which a newly vested holding is immune from compulsory acquisition. I am sure the Minister has received reports in connection with persons who have been allocated farms by the Land Commission and who, because of the fact that they held a vested farm, whether it is a half acre or 200 acres, when they come to the new farm in the Midlands are immediately vested.  I am referring to congests.  We have had experience where one of them just went to the window of the new house, looked in, and then went to the local auctioneer and sold the holding.  One <Col N="241" /> can imagine what the local applicants who did get the land felt when they saw that sort of thing happening.</P>
    <P>There is the recent case in Martry.  I crossed swords with the Minister over this.  A man employed as a builder's labourer in England who had a small bit of land in the west of Ireland was given a farm.  I do not know how it was done.  He took possession of it and went back again on the next plane.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  Reference has been made to commonage.  To be fair to Deputy Hogan, he was not referring to a commonage; he was referring to the residue of an estate.  He was not referring to a commonage as we know it that is owned jointly by a number of people.  Recently there has been a certain amount of trouble in my area.  There is a pretty big commonage which is owned by quite a number of families and nobody knows how many of them own it now.  From generation to generation the people have been spreading out and, as I understand, some of the owners are as far away as Australia and America.  An outsider went in on a commonage and by some device succeeded in establishing <Col N="242" /> a claim.  I think the matter was brought to the notice of the Minister. He was asked to have it investigated. There was a court case about it and all sorts of trouble.  Commonage is a matter which must be dealt with with kid gloves because if one rushes in to straighten out a matter one finds that somebody who has not been mentioned will come along at a later date and try to establish a claim.  While there is provision in the 1950 Act to cover that, it is not entirely satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to state whether or not the Land Commission would agree that where there are wellestablished claims in a commonage, and the commonage is of a pretty sizeable area, they will be prepared to allocate to the various applicants portions of the commonage.  Can that be done?  If it can be done, is it something which the Minister would look on with favour, because commonage is not the most desirable way of holding land? When a new applicant comes in and finds everybody else using it&mdash;particularly if it is unfenced&mdash;he assumes he also may use it.  If stock are allowed to graze on the long acre and to ramble on the commonage for any time, you will then find stock there belonging to people who have no right there as well as that of people who have a right.  Is this a desirable way of dealing with this matter?</P>
      <P>Permission to sub-divide is a thorny question.  The Minister is taking powers to prevent sub-division of any type of land.  This is something which can be tied too tightly.  I had recent experience of a man who wanted to give a small portion of land to his son who was an agricultural contractor. They were both intensive farmers. Both of them felt they could make a living but the son was insisting, and the farmer agreed, that he should get 12 acres and that the father would retain the balance of about 40 acres. There was no question in the area of land becoming available.  The Land Commission refused to sub-divide.  The young man wanted to build a house on his piece of land and he should have been allowed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, recently, I was asked, in relation to a farm of about 80 acres, if the Land Commission would permit the <Col N="243" /> owner to give 12 acres to a brother so that he and his family could live there. The Land Commission refused permission to sub-divide.  If application in this respect is made to the Land Commission, almost certainly there will be objection to it.  I do not think there should be objection in such cases.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would make clear whether or not he will consider my suggestion that farms taken over for division by the Land Commission should be divided as soon as it is humanly possible to divide them.  The successful applicants should be notified as soon as possible, thus preventing speculation and disruption in the area. Furthermore, when land is being divided the Minister should see to it that every deserving applicant in the area is considered before a decision is made.  Unfortunately, we have instances of people, even those living on a farm, who have been ruled out by the Land Commission inspector, for no apparent reason.</P>
    <P>When migrants are sent to the midlands and to the east to take over a farm, they usually come with large families.  Time and time again, these people have drawn my attention to the fact that there is no employment in the area whereas they were told there would be employment for their children. Take somebody with five or six growing boys or girls who moves into an area where there is very little employment. The only way they can get employment is by moving the natives out.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should be perfectly honest with the people they are bringing to those areas.  Consider a relatively old man or woman in a new farm in a strange area whose children have to emigrate, just the very same as would be the position if the family had remained in the west.  It is a very serious problem.  It can have a very disrupting effect on an area.  The position is aggravated all the more when 20 or 30 families with five or six children move in.</P>
    <P>The Minister can visualise what such a situation is likely to do to the economy of the district.  Consider those employed by local farmers or in the local factory.  Very often, there <Col N="244" /> are two or three people who are prepared to work for lower wages and therefore others must emigrate.  I know of a man who was dispossessed by the Land Commission.  He had to go to England because the job he got after his farm was taken over was subsequently taken from him by two young boys who were prepared to work with a local farmer for the same wages as he had.  That man left nine children behind him but he has since brought his family over to England.</P>
    <P>It is easy to gloss over these matters here in Dublin but it is not so easy to do so in the heart of the country when you meet those people every day.  I certainly do not blame the Minister for all the ills which have befallen the people in my constituency who were hoping to get land but did not get it. However, he is now in a position to ensure that those things do not happen again.  This Bill gives him a right to change the law drastically and I assume he has the power to carry it through this House, no matter what any of us may say.  He should grasp the opportunity to ensure that the measure is not a stop-gap to solve the problem this year but one which will leave himself and his successor for many years to come free from land troubles.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my answer to a similar question on 23rd October, 1963, when I stated that &ldquo;the Arigideen River is part of the Owenkeagh catchment area.  This has been surveyed by the Commissioners of Public Works with a view to a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The results show that the works required are very expensive in relation to the value of the land capable of improvement and it is difficult to evolve a satisfactory scheme.  However, I am arranging that the final examination of this catchment will be taken up soon and I hope to have a decision on the proposal in the next few months&rdquo;.  There is nothing that I can usefully add at this stage.</P>

      <P>I replied to a similar question by Deputy Esmonde on the 7th November, as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is understandable that milk producers like producers of any other commodity would like to have higher prices if they could get them.  I do believe, however, that the treatment of producers so far in our circumstances has been reasonable.  The steady increase in milk production over recent years surely affords some evidence to support this view.&rdquo;</P>

In those circumstances and in view of the increased cost of living and in view of the ninth round, is there not something to be said for removing the 1.35 pence levy from creamery <Col N="250" /> milk in order to help the small farmers to meet the new situation?</P>

      <P>The Exchequer was asked to bear.  The total liability now is approximately £5 per cwt.  Under the original scheme the Exchequer was bearing £6 6s. 8d. per cwt.  I am suggesting that the obligation on the producer to provide one-third of the subsidy should now be suspended in view of the fact that these producers have to meet the increased cost of living which in the Taoiseach's mind makes a ninth round of wages an urgent present necessity.</P>

      <P>The scheme for the training of pilots for Aer Lingus is <Col N="253" /> operated by the company and certificates are issued by my Department on the results of examinations held at the end of the training.  The cost of training here is higher than in some countries abroad.  It is, however, considered desirable that the pilots should be trained in their own country and the Vote for my Department contains provision for reimbursing Aer Lingus the extra cost of having the training carried out at home.</P>

      <P>The statutory regulations governing this matter provide that a licensing authority shall, on the first licensing of a vehicle, assign to it an identification mark consisting of an index mark and registered number.  In the case of a vehicle which has been actually sold, it has been the practice for motor taxation offices to facilitate the motor trade by supplying an identification mark to the dealer over the telephone in anticipation of an immediate application on the prescribed form for a first licence.  This practice has generally operated satisfactorily, but it has had to be discontinued in any areas where it has been found to be abused.</P>

A considerable part of the lands had to be allotted as a commonage.  Fencing of allotments was deferred until such time as allottees would be free to assist in the work.  The necessary materials have already been moved to the estate and it is hoped that fencing operations will commence within the next week.</P>

      <P>The National Library of Ireland derives from the former library of the Royal Dublin Society. That library had, during the 19th century, been in receipt of a Parliamentary grant towards the cost of the purchase of books.  By the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act, 1877, the Society's lands were transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works and the library itself was transferred to the Department of Science and Art, the successor of which is the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>By an agreement, dated 1 March, 1881, between the Commissioners of Public Works, the Department of Science and Art and the Royal Dublin Society the National Library was placed under the superintendence of a council of 12 Trustees, eight of whom are appointed by the Royal Dublin Society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The member referred to reported sick at Gormanston Camp on 26th June, 1961&mdash;not 1962&mdash;and from that date until 29th June, 1961, he was treated by the Camp medical officer for muscular strain.  He did not report having sustained any injury in the course of his training or otherwise, and I may say at this point that exhaustive investigations have failed to establish that he received any injury in the course of his training.  Apparently, in the few days during which he was being treated, an X-ray was not thought necessary.  He did not report for treatment on 30th June, 1961, the last day of his training.  I cannot, therefore, accept the unfavourable implications of the Deputy's statement that the member was discharged in an unfit condition.</P>
      <P>Compensation is payable to members of An Fóras Cosanta Áitiúil only if they are injured in the course of training.  In the absence of any evidence that he was injured in such circumstances, I regret that it is not possible to grant the member compensation or an allowance in respect of loss of wages, and that his medical expenses cannot be met by my Department.</P>

    <Title>Land Bill, 1963&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Land Bill is designed purely and simply to get the goodwill and support of the farming community in the west of Ireland.  Any benefits contained in it are applicable to the congested areas and any difficulties contained in it are designed and aimed at the people who are not residing in those areas.  This Bill goes so far as to define the meaning of congested areas in relation to its application and I find that the only areas so defined all have a coast line along the Atlantic.  Not one other county is mentioned in that list.  Many of us who are familiar with conditions in this country recognise that there is congestion, land hunger and the need for resettlement in many other places.</P>
      <P>Here we have a Bill which does very little for landless men who have good farming knowledge.  It does nothing more for them than any previous Bill and it does nothing to increase the size of existing Land Commission holdings which are considered uneconomic according to the terms of the Bill itself.  There is nothing in it to deal with the problem created by the purchase of land by aliens and there is nothing in it to regulate that development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One section which will meet with a favourable reception in this House <Col N="283" /> and outside it relates to elderly people but, on examination of that section, we see that it applies only to a husband and wife or to a blind person. What about the father and son, the brother and sister, the mother and son, and the widow?  There are many types of land holders who should be included in this section in order that the intentions of the Bill may be achieved and that they may qualify for the benefits offered here under the social welfare section.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to deal with the bad housing situation on the land, even if we restrict that comment to housing conditions on lands with which the Land Commission have been concerned.  This Bill, obviously designed for the west of Ireland and the congested areas along the western seaboard, will not benefit the 10,000 landless men and small farmers in County Dublin, men who have a good knowledge of farming and who need land.</P>
    <P>There is congestion in county Dublin.  It is now the smallest county in Ireland because of the large area of land taken over by Dublin city and suburbs; the amount of land remaining is less than that in any other county.  A number of smallholders in the county are agitating for portions of land.  There are also landless men with a good knowledge of land management. There are dispossessed farm managers and farm labourers who worked on lands taken over by the Land Commission and who now want to be settled on land themselves.</P>
    <P>Not alone is this Bill a nuisance so far as Dublin county is concerned, but it is also a nuisance for Leinster, Munster and the midlands because the provisions are designed with the accent all the time on the relief of congestion in the congested areas. Take the smallholder from the west who gives up a 20-acre holding in order that local congestion may be relieved.  He is transferred to a farm of 45 acres in the midlands.  At the same time, a smallholder in the midlands, who gives up 20 acres of land, also gets 45 acres but the gentleman from the congested area gets his land <Col N="284" /> on a half annuity whereas the other, who was resident in the midlands, must pay the full annuity.</P>
    <P>Right through the Bill preference is given to persons from the west of Ireland.  It is a onesided Bill and, because it is, it is most unfair.  Whatever the policy may be, it is the taxpayers in general who will contribute towards the cost of implementing it. The taxpayers of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and elsewhere, will contribute to this.  Yet the Bill is designed mainly to give advantages and benefits to people from the west of Ireland. I think it should be called &ldquo;The Migration Bill for the West of Ireland&rdquo; rather than the Land Bill, 1963.</P>
    <P>With regard to the payment of the full annuity, I cannot see anywhere in the Bill the period during which the full annuity is payable.  The half annuity is perpetual.  Surely the period during which the full annuity will be payable should be indicated.</P>
    <P>I notice it is by ministerial order that a congested district will be recognised and brought within the scope of this measure in order to give the benefits offered to residents of congested areas.  Similarly, loan facilities are offered only to persons resident in congested areas.  A man with 100 acres in a congested area can avail of loan facilities from the Land Commission whereas a man with 50 acres or 20 acres outside these areas cannot avail of any loan facilities or benefits under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In connection with the cash loans set out, is the Land Commission prepared to give a cash loan for the purchase of a viable holding by a person from a congested area or will the cash be made available on the Land Commission guarantee to a bank?  I ask that question because many from whom land has been taken by the Land Commission wanted cash and all they got was a slip of paper.  They got land bonds.  Most of these were interested in cash.  That is why I ask this question now.  This benefit is, of course, also available only to congests.</P>
    <P>I notice that when a congest gets these benefits he is bound to sell the land only to the Land Commission.  He is not free to dispose of it as he wishes. Now many people would prefer to get <Col N="285" /> a very limited income from the land rather than sell it to the Irish Land Commission with the prospect of a life annuity in cash because the purchasing power of money is falling rapidly. A fairly young person receiving such annuity might find himself in very straitened circumstances after some years.  The purchasing power of the £ today is 6/10 as compared with prewar values.  People in receipt of these annuities might find themselves very poor indeed at the end of 20 or 30 years; should the value of money continue to fall, these annuities would be almost useless.  That is one of the reasons why people place such value on land.  Land remains an asset and the sale price moves up as the purchasing power of money falls.  The Bill does not incidentally set out what the minimum or maximum price per acre will be for land voluntarily sold to the Land Commission or whether the price will be related to existing market conditions in the particular area.</P>
    <P>In regard to the allowance of £156 per year mentioned here, it is not clear to me, at any rate, whether this figure will be a joint means test allowance or whether the allowance will be separate for husband and wife when applied for the purpose of calculating any old age pension that might be payable from the Department of Social Welfare.  If it means they are getting a means test allowance of only £78 per year each, it is not much use to tell them they will get social welfare in addition because at present £104 is apparently the limit when a means test is being applied.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for further powers of acquisition, but it is to be hoped the policy pursued in the early Thirties, when a number of farmers received the princely sum of £5 per acre for land taken from them, will not be continued.  We must be careful to ensure that a fair price will be paid and that we will not go into the sphere of confiscation when it comes to taking land from people.  I have an example of a young farmer who was given 100 acres of land by his grandfather.  The Land Commission moved in immediately. They said he was able to earn his living otherwise than on the land, <Col N="286" /> and they would not allow that land to be given to him.  They took the farm and divided it up.  That was a very serious interference with the rights of a private individual.  This man's father subsequently gave him a portion of land, and he has proved to be a very successful farmer.  He retired from his business in Dublin and he engages now only in farming.  He was a farmer's son and he knew farming very well. Yet he was prevented from having the land which his grandfather had given to him.  This is an example of where the Land Commission interfered unfairly with the rights of a private individual.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section which provides that land will be available for all appropriate purposes instead of being reserved for migrants only.  That is a very welcome step.  There can be land hunger.  There is congestion in many areas outside the areas specified by the Minister in this Bill.  Now it appears there will be a more liberal attitude so far as the purposes for which land is reserved are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have raised previously a question concerning the period for which full annuities would be payable.  It would be most unfair for payment to be stretched over an unlimited period.  So far as the provisions of this Bill interfere with existing conditions, they will result in reducing the sale value of land.  The Bill is a threat to fixity of tenure, one of the principles the Irish people are determined to maintain.  It looks as if the Land Commission are moving in more and more as the landlords of this country.  They tend to interfere with the ownership and management of land.  Nobody will object to the Land Commission moving in on derelict holdings.  However, the first place they should move in is on their own holdings&mdash;the holdings they have already allocated to different types of people, mainly congests and other smallholders.  A number of these holdings are derelict.</P>
    <P>The houses are locked up and the owners, perhaps, are working in England.  Something should be done about taking over those holdings instead of interfering with the rights of private individuals not directly <Col N="287" /> asociated with the Land Commission. The Commission have a great responsibility to the State to ensure that this land, very often taken by compulsion at very unsatisfactory prices, will be properly worked and managed and not allowed to become a wilderness. There are plenty of wildernesses all over the country, and they are no credit to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>We witnessed with disgust in the past the allocation of land to wasters and good-for-nothings, who never stopped until they succeeded in getting that land vested.  Then they went to the auctioneer, sold the land given to them at the expense of the State, put the money in their pockets and made off to the nearest pub or elsewhere.  It is only right to say, however, that most of the allocations proved to be a success and the persons who received the land turned out to be very deserving cases.  But the Land Commission should lose no time in seeing what is happening to the land they have allocated and making reports on it.</P>
    <P>I believe they are supposed to have annual reports of the management of each farm.  I cannot imagine the kind of report that must be going in about some of those derelict sites and abandoned wildernesses.  But for agricultural development in recent years, there would be more of them.  There are now plenty of enterprising agricultural contractors only too anxious to go in and work and develop these lands.  Even if they do, the persons who got that land should be dispossessed because they are a burden on the taxpayers and have proved that they did not deserve the free gift which they received from the State in the form of a farm of land.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of this Bill which will affect the rights of the individual so far as landowners are concerned, that is, where a notice from the Land Commission inspector is served.  The moment the person gets service of the notice he is not allowed to let, sublet, subdivide or transfer any part of that land.  A period of 12 months appears to be too long for that purpose.  It means that the farm is frozen, is worthless and <Col N="288" /> valueless to the unfortunate man who has received the notice.  He will not get anything by way of compensation from the Land Commission who have served the notice if in the long run they decide not to purchase the holding. Certainly, the value of the land would be almost nil for the 12 months while that notice is effective.  That is a long time in which to leave people in a state of suspense.  It should be possible for the Land Commission to make a decision in a period much less than 12 months.</P>
    <P>I consider this a very one-sided Bill. Some recognition should have been given to the smallholders and landless men in other congested districts, not only in the areas which have an Atlantic coastline.  We must be very careful that the effect of this Bill will not be to interfere in any way with free sale and the letting of land.</P>
    <P>Very often land which is let on the 11 months system is put to very good use.  There are many progressive farmers who do not own land but who rent land for milk, grain and beef production and there is coming off that land far more than the owner could ever hope to produce by his own enterprise and initiative because he has not got what it takes.  Therefore, where land is being properly used by a person other than the owner great care should be taken to ensure that the good use of that land is not interfered with and that the volume of production on the holding is not reduced but is increased, if possible.  It is not likely to be increased if the owner is prevented from letting it to a progressive, enterprising man but is left to work it himself.  He may not be an enterprising, progressive person or he may require a considerable amount of capital.</P>
    <P>There are many farmers who were reduced to poverty during the war and who have never recovered, who have large farms but have no capital.  There may be enterprising, progressive farmers in the area who are making very good use of that land.  In doing so they are giving a living to two families. They are supporting their own family and the family of the landowner who may have been reduced to a state of poverty before the war and has not <Col N="289" /> since succeeded in securing sufficient capital to allow him to manage the farm himself.</P>
    <P>The same considerations apply in the case of aged landowners who are not physically fit to work and manage their farms.  If they are making that land available for worthwhile production by enterprising local farmers who are supporting their own families, there should be no interference with that land.  It would be a gamble so far as the Land Commission are concerned. They might take the farm, divide the land and the land might produce far less and give a far smaller return than it is giving at the present time.</P>
    <P>We will not get one extra acre of land as a result of this Land Bill.  We must deal with the land that is there.  I mention that because this Bill, like every other Land Bill, may encourage thousands of landless men and small farmers to believe that now there is a chance of their getting land.  There will be hundreds of small farmers who will believe that there will be land available to enlarge their existing holdings when, in fact, it must be pointed out that the fraction of the population who may get an extra acre is very small indeed.  We should not build up hopes in the minds of all and sundry that there will be lots of land available for division now by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy has had the experience of shopkeepers and various classes of wage earners asking to be recommended for a holding because they are farmers' sons and worked in their early years on the land and know how to manage land.  Admittedly, there are many amongst them who could manage land and work it better than some people who are on the land, but it is difficult to see how the needs of all these people can be satisfied in addition to the needs of those who are already on the land.</P>
    <P>I have mixed feelings regarding the vesting of Land Commission farms when I see what happened to many of the farms in my own constituency which were vested.  It would be better for the Land Commission to resume a number of those farms rather than <Col N="290" /> vest them in the existing tenants. Unfortunately, most of the vesting is now completed and most of those farms have gone under the auctioneer's hammer and have gone into the possession of new owners.  Now that we have a new Land Bill and this question of vesting arises, those of us who have the experience of what occurred in the past in relation to farms allocated by the Land Commission should try to make provision in this Bill to ensure that there will not be a repetition of the conduct that we have witnessed in the past, and that people who are given a free holding of land will prove worthy of it, will prove they deserve it, will prove they are able to work and manage it and to get a high output from that land.</P>
    <P>I feel a minimum output target should be specified by the Land Commission. They ought to be able to say to these new tenants that they require a certain output from the farm&mdash; poultry, livestock, vegetable crops, grain crops, or whatever it may be. A certain acreage of a certain quality should be capable of a minimum output. That minimum output should be specified by the Land Commission.  It would be a test of the person who got a farm.  It would prove very soon whether he was deserving of it, whether he was fit to be an owner and a manager of land.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that nearly 20,000 people left the land last year. Many of them did so because there is no living on the land for them.  Many of those who left the land were owners of holdings of up to 20 acres.  Those 20 acres are lying there still&mdash;let, possibly, to neighbours or to agricultural contractors&mdash;while the owners are working in Britain or even in Dublin.  Therefore, we must face up to the fact that people are leaving the land and that this Bill may only in a small way succeed in arresting the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>A Bill to ensure the satisfactory marketing of produce from the land would be a better step than a Bill at this stage for the division of land. When all these people&mdash;if there will be many&mdash;are moved out of the congested areas into Leinster and into the <Col N="291" /> midlands, we ought to have increased output, increased production, more surpluses of various crops.  The question then arises where all these will be sold.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  My point is that with the allocation of this land, we shall have a problem of production to deal with.  If the produce of that land cannot be sold, we shall have the situation that exists at the moment where almost 20,000 people left the land last year.</P>
      <P>When we read parts of this Bill regarding the proper management of land, and so on, it makes us ask the question why landowners are set upon regarding management.  We do not know of any legislation that will interfere with the shopkeeper or the factory owner if he is not managing his business well.  However, if it is a landowner, apparently this Bill proposes to interfere with him and may take his land from him.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputies mention the delays in dividing land. It is nothing short of a disgrace to take a farm from a farmer against his wishes and as soon as the Land Commission have taken it from him to call down an auctioneer and to let that land on the 11 months' system.  They get back about 12½ per cent of the cost price of the land.  Every year afterwards they let the land so that, before the land is divided, the Land Commission have got the price of it in lettings.  They have deprived the former owner of the land of the income he could have got during those intervening years.  The Land Commission were getting the conacre money, instead of leaving the land with the man until they were ready to divide it.  It is very unfair of the Land Commission to deprive a man of his land and to let it.  In many cases, the farmer himself is very glad to rent it back from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is designed mainly to raise the hopes of the people living in the <Col N="292" /> western areas.  The Minister comes from County Mayo and it is natural that he should be prejudiced in favour of the west.  However, as a Minister of State, he should treat all citizens alike.  He should not single out any area for benefits and leave the remaining areas to suffer any disadvantages that are contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has specified congested areas which, actually, are only along the Atlantic coast at the moment.  He should now carry out a survey in every constituency and include in the list every congested area he can find in order that equal rights will be available to all citizens.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands, after long and serious discussions with the officers and officials of his Department, has introduced a measure which should be more than acceptable to people on all sides of this House.  It would be asking for far too much to think that the measure would be accepted in its entirety by all members. It would be miraculous if all its sections were accepted without reserve. It is a courageous and bold attempt on the part of the Minister to tackle a problem which is getting more and more acute each day.  There has been public demand for new land legislation and the demand has not gone unheeded by the Government.  I feel sure that many organisations conversant with the agrarian problems in this country will acclaim this measure.  One cannot but think of the amount of time and energy devoted by the Minister towards tackling this big problem.  The many novel sections testify to this indisputable fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take the section which offers incentives to people who are no longer able to work their lands as they would like to and having considered all the thought that has gone into this section, we must agree it was not included in the Bill without a great deal of discussion with other Departments of State.  I believe this to be a very acceptable section and a sensible one and when it becomes law and if the matter is tackled diplomatically by the officers of the Department of Lands and by the Department's inspectors, it <Col N="293" /> will certainly have the effect of increasing the pool of land available for the relief of congestion, which is a highly desirable objective.  It will also have the effect of breaking down old, erroneous beliefs which greatly retarded the working of the Land Commission for many years.</P>
    <P>There is also a section in the Bill which aims at tidying up certain sections of the 1950 Act and I welcome the aims of this section particularly. Indeed, I have often wondered why this section as drafted was ever included in the 1950 Bill.  It set out that land bought under section 12 of that Bill could be used only for rearrangement or for the benefit of migrants. This Bill changes all this and will certainly give the Land Commission greater scope to implement their programme. I congratulate the Minister on the change.  The section was always a puzzle to me and I came to the conclusion that not enough consideration was given to the section when it was introduced in 1950 by the then Minister for Lands.  I hope the change will have the desired effect, and from my experience in this regard, I believe it will.</P>
    <P>My county of Galway has many and varied land problems and many of them are to be found in the eastern portion of the county near the River Shannon.  I realise it would be very unrealistic to think that this Bill will solve all the problems we have in our county.  We all know that even if we got the whole of occupied Ulster and part of England as well, it would not give economic holdings to the 60,000 congests in Ireland at present.</P>
    <P>I think everybody here will welcome the section that increases the amount of land bonds from £15 million to £20 million.  The extra £5 million which the Minister proposes to get should have a very good effect. There is a reluctance on the part of many people in this country to accept payment by way of land bonds.  All Parties in the House should direct their endeavours towards making the position in this connection quite clear. At present six per cent land bonds are above par.  In fact a few days ago on the Dublin Stock Exchange, a £100 <Col N="294" /> bond was worth £102 and there is no reason to think that this state of affairs will change in the immediate future. As long as a Government can offer a loan at 5¾ per cent and get money at that rate, then the person who has been paid in land bonds has nothing at all to worry about.  A person would be well advised to request to be paid in such bonds.</P>
    <P>Of course there are erroneous ideas on this subject and it is up to people who know the situation and especially Deputies here to do their utmost to ensure that these erroneous beliefs will be discarded for all time.  Auctioneers and solicitors have a very special duty to make the position quite clear and to do everything possible to convince the people that there is no more secure investment than six per cent land bonds.  If the matter were clearly understood by all people who have land for sale, it would be much easier in many cases to get land.  This old belief is not confined to people living in backward areas.  People with a very high degree of intelligence are reluctant to accept these bonds.  I would appeal to the Minister, when replying, to lay emphasis on the fact that these bonds are much better than, or at least as good as, hard cash.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech stated that he regarded section 13 as a very important section.  I agree with him fully in this.  There is at least one estate in my constituency consisting of about 1,000 acres which for a number of years the Land Commission were anxious to acquire.  However, because there were two old allegedly bred horses on the estate when the case was taken to Dublin, it was held that the person concerned had a stock farm.  I cannot see how a person with merely two such horses&mdash;and I might add that neither of them ever won a race; it is significant that one of them was called &ldquo;The Last Man,&rdquo; and should have been called &ldquo;The Last Horse&rdquo;&mdash;could be considered as making a contribution towards a bloodstock industry.  However, as the section was framed, this man was allowed to keep and still has his 1,000 acres of land.  I would ask the Minister to direct his attention to the estate in question.  I have made representations <Col N="295" /> to him regarding this matter on a number of occasions and I sincerely hope the Minister will do all in his power to expedite the acquisition of this estate.</P>
    <P>Another section in which I am very interested in section 37.  The explanatory memorandum in this regard says:</P>
    <P>Section 37 reduces from seven years to two years the period during which a newly-vested holding is immune from compulsory acquisition by the Land Commission.  This measure is considered necessary having regard to the problem of vacant and derelict holdings and the desirability of avoiding the appearance of discrimination where local conditions are similar.</P>
    <P>Not long ago, the Land Commission were extremely interested in a holding right beside my own parish but because the lands were not vested for the specified period of seven years, they could not interfere and the most undesirable thing in the world happened: the lands fell into the hands of a local professional man.  Even though the people locally were congests in every sense of the word and even though the Land Commission were more than anxious to acquire the holding, nothing could be done because of this old section.  I am glad the Minister is about to change that section now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy like it cut down further, to one year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyGMillar" hpid="Mr. Millar Mr. Millar">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Millar</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it would solve the problem in so far as this case is concerned but perhaps it would not be in the best interests of the Bill as a whole.  However, that can be left to the officers of the Department.  The main point is that it is now proposed to reduce the term from seven years to two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said so much in favour of the Bill, I feel I must now say something somewhat against it.  I have always felt that there should be a ceiling on the amount of land held by any one individual.  I can see great difficulty in imposing such a ceiling <Col N="296" /> but I know three farms in the eastern part of my constituency, the Eyrecourt area of County Galway, comprising about 3,000 acres.  In that area we have good, industrious farmers but many have only 20 to 25 acres of land and some have only about 16 acres. Where such a great pool of land exists and where it is possible to end congestion by the fixing of a ceiling, it should be done.  I may be wrong in this and there may be a good reason for not having a ceiling but if so, I should like to know what that reason is.</P>
    <P>I shall finish on one other point. Early this year, there was a Land Commission house on display here in Leinster House.  I must compliment the designers of that house because it was a fine piece of architecture and the designers are to be congratulated on it. If this is the type of house that is to be provided in the future, the people living in them will have very comfortable accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is some 12 years since the present Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced a Bill in this House known as the Undeveloped Areas Bill which held out great hope for industrial development and the reduction of emigration in the congested districts.  In retrospect, we find that these hopes were not realised.  Today the Minister for Lands has brought a Bill into the House which holds out somewhat similar hopes so far as the development of our agricultural resources in the congested districts is concerned, which hopes to help the migration of the people from these districts to areas where land is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me, the fundamental idea of providing a farmer with 40 to 45 acres of good land or a larger acreage of not so good land is good but I can anticipate great difficulties in implementing the proposal.  Taking my own part of the country into consideration, I see from the West Cork Survey, carried out by a number of experts in the different fields of agriculture, that a number of important conclusions can be reached.  One piece of information given in that survey is that the number of land holders in <Col N="297" /> West Cork with fewer than 30 acres is 8,480.  Of these holdings, about 4,000 are under 20 acres.</P>
    <P>The survey gives further information of a detailed character obtained through an investigation of conditions in cross-section holdings in different parts of the area.  In the Castletown, Bantry and Schull districts, the income of the farmers who could be said to be typical of the farmers in the area was little more than £174 12s.  per annum.  In the Skibbereen and Dunmanway area, where the land is better than in the other districts, the income was £278 12s. per annum.  That is the net income of the land owners. In the group with from 30 to 50 acres, the net income in the Castletown, Bantry and Schull area was £401 2s. per year.  Again, that is the net family income.  In the Skibbereen-Dunmanway areas, the corresponding net income was not much more, £408 2s.</P>
    <P>From that we see, if we accept the figures in this survey as correct&mdash;and I have no hesitation in doing so, knowing the manner in which it was undertaken&mdash;that much more than 70 per cent of the holdings in West Cork are uneconomic and that family incomes from agricultural pursuits are entirely below an economic standard.  As a result of such small incomes from their holdings, a big number of these people had no option but to emigrate because there was no other employment available to any extent in the area.  That is why we find in West Cork a significantly high percentage of emigration.  I live in the parish of Schull and from the next parish, at the extreme end of Mizen Head peninsula, in size a relatively small parish, the local priest told me last week that in the past ten years about 600 people emigrated.  That gives an idea of the level of emigration from West Cork as a result of low incomes from holdings and no alternative employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have a tremendous job trying to bring these farms up to the acreage which is deemed to be an economic holding.  If he were to do that in West Cork, he would need to have a big number of holdings of <Col N="298" /> more than 100 acres because 40-45 acres of good land, which the Minister mentioned, would probably be better than 150 acres in some parts of West Cork and more likely to give a family a better living and higher production. To implement such proposals, I think, would mean that a big percentage of the 1,490 farmers in West Cork should be removed if you were to give each farm the equivalent of 40 to 45 acres of good land.  There is no other way of doing it because the number of big holdings in the area is relatively small.  That would mean a big decline in the population and the consensus of local opinion is against that.</P>
    <P>I know it is very hard to reconcile the two points of view, trying to hold the population and giving them a proper living standard on the land.  I appreciate that it is very difficult to hold those farms and to build up their incomes to an economic level.  I think it is impossible, even though some local people feel that should be done. Undoubtedly, I think land must be acquired and given to the smallholders to bring their holdings up to an economic level or as near it as possible.  I am sure West Cork is no different from a number of extensive areas in other counties along the western seaboard and I can see the position arising in which you would need millions of acres to accommodate the people if you were to transfer them from their present uneconomic holdings to economic ones in other parts of the country.  If you were to do that, as is to some extent implied in the Bill, it would require a vast pool of land which I do not think exists.</P>
    <P>I know that in the midlands, possibly, we have a big number of farms and estates not worked to full capacity and possibly a big acreage could be acquired for division but what, in the estimation of the Minister's Department, is the size of that?  Would it be 1,000,000 acres?  I do not think so because the latest report is that there are only about 30,000 acres in the possession of the Land Commission to provide for additions to holdings.</P>
    <P>I can see Deputies from central <Col N="299" /> Ireland objecting to the acquisition of land from big farmers who are working it to full capacity and employing labour.  The State could not uphold acquisition in such circumstances and so we must rule out such holdings or, at least, it should be ruled out, even though I agree partly with Deputy Millar when he said that the size of holdings should be reduced or that there should be a ceiling on the amount of land held by anybody.  I do not like ceilings, personally, as interference with individual rights is a serious matter but the idea may deserve consideration. Where a man or a family is not utilising the land properly, it is only right for the Land Commission to acquire it at its full market value and when that is done, there is no grievance.</P>
    <P>I think the terms of this Bill cannot be implemented.  I cannot see how we can give all these smallholders in the west of Ireland, and possibly in other parts, 45 acres of good land or its equivalent, which in some cases, would be twice that figure and where the land is low-yielding, possibly much higher still.  It is a formidable task which I think will not be accomplished in the near future.</P>
    <P>Who will tackle this job and try to put the Bill into operation, assuming it is passed?  I cannot see the Land Commission as capable of doing it.  We have questions about the activities of the Land Commission here, week in week out.  There is a general feeling among members of the House that the Land Commission is not working smoothly and efficiently and that it should be completely overhauled.  I agree with such assertions and if a big task such as this measure will involve if it becomes law, is to be imposed on the Land Commission, as will happen if we are to make any headway towards the goal set out in the Bill, we shall have to overhaul the Land Commission in a big way.</P>
    <P>It is an autonomous body set up by an Act of Parliament, not directly responsible to the House, not directly responsible to anybody except in a loose way to the Department of Lands. I am a believer&mdash;while not a firm <Col N="300" /> believer&mdash;in giving these people certain powers and a certain independence and while I feel it is not advisable to have Deputies prying into the ordinary everyday workings of such bodies, I do feel that we should have much more control in Parliament over such bodies as the Land Commission who are charged with such important functions. If that were the case, the Land Commission would not be working the way they are working.</P>
    <P>How many Deputies during this debate have referred to the time it takes the Land Commission to divide a farm of 45 or 50 acres?  There seems to be the same pattern all over the country.  When the Land Commission buy a farm irrespective of its size &mdash;and I am taking a small size&mdash;it is a three year job to divide it.  In many cases, it takes much longer than three years.  Surely that should not be the case?  There are also the incidental expenses which are involved: inspectors travelling here and there, interviewing people over an extended period, letting the land for grazing and so on.  The applicants in many cases are kept waiting in a rather uneasy state of mind.  Most of them would prefer the land to be divided without delay, to know the outcome of the division and how many acres of land, if any, they will get.</P>
    <P>What is the system employed by the Land Commission for dividing a holding? The Land Commission acquire a holding and when it is known locally that they have acquired the holding, a number of people in the neighbourhood apply for a parcel of that land. The inspector calls frequently on these people and these calls are spread over a period of up to three years.  He does not take these people into his confidence to any great extent because his dealings with them are mainly of a secretive character.  I will have no idea of what he said to my neighbour and my neighbour will have no idea of what he said to me.  His talks with the different applicants are kept confidential. Why not change that system? Why not bring all these applicants, the people he has in mind to give land to, together and say to them: &ldquo;I am the Land Commission inspector.  It is my <Col N="301" /> job to divide this land fairly and impartially between you.  I should like to get your help and co-operation because that would assist me.  In my opinion the land should be divided like this&mdash;John Murphy should get so many fields, Seán Ó Drisceoil should get so many and Brian Lenihan should get the balance.&rdquo;  Everything should be done openly and above board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be bad.  When a farm is acquired, I always like to see the boundaries straightened out.  It may not necessarily mean that the acquired land is the only land for distribution.  The lands of these farmers who are to benefit should be pooled.  If a farm is divided among three or four local farmers the Commission should approach the matter openly in the presence of these people and say: &ldquo;We have these five farms and we will redistribute them so as to straighten things out and bring your holdings as far as possible up to an economic level.&rdquo; That is not done; if it were, the job would not be spread over three years, nor would such expense be involved, nor would people feel that they did not get fair play. Any court of law which makes decisions behind closed doors is open to suspicion and in the same way the Land Commission is open to suspicion. I am asking the Minister to urge on the Land Commission inspectors the need for doing their work openly and above board.  I have offered a suggestion how this can be done but more favourable suggestions may be forthcoming. I am suggesting that the applicants should be brought together and that the Land Commission inspector should address them jointly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job should not be done the way it is being done.  To give you an idea of what is happening, there was the case of a man who was satisfied with the lands he got.  A few fields were taken from him but he was satisfied that the fields he got were of greater advantage to him.  Having a sentimental attachment to the piece of <Col N="302" /> land that was taken from him, he ventured to ask the Land Commission inspector: &ldquo;Who will get the couple of fields I gave you?&rdquo;  The inspector replied: &ldquo;That is none of your business.&rdquo;  Is that the type of man we should have dividing land?  On that point, we should have a stricter interviewing board for potential Land Commission inspectors who have to meet farmers and other people.  Civility, courtesy and diplomacy should be three qualifications which the inspectors should possess.  We should have inspectors speaking to farmers in their own language, putting their cards on the table and showing diplomacy.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it is a difficult problem to satisfy applicants for land that they have been treated fairly and impartially but with the qualifications I have mentioned the work would be far easier and less costly and could satisfy the applicants to a greater extent that they were getting justice and fair play.  I would urge the Minister to ensure as far as possible, when Land Commission inspectors are being appointed, that, apart from other qualifications, they should have the qualifications I mentioned.  I do not like the type of man who will answer a farmer who asked a fair question &mdash;possibly if I were in the same position, I would have asked a similar question&mdash;&ldquo;that is none of your business&rdquo;. He is not the best type of man and he will have to do 13 or 14 trips to accomplish something which could possibly be done in two trips.  He is a burden on the State.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the point further.  I am very sorry I had to reflect on the Land Commission generally but there was no other course open to me if I am to speak my mind openly and honestly on this Bill.  I think my views are shared by a majority of Deputies, all of whom are most dissatisfied with the system under which the Land Commission work and, indeed, under which individual officials of the Land Commission work.</P>
    <P>I want to express here the hope that after this Bill has passed never again will it take three years to divide a small holding.  Instead of three years, I hope it can be achieved in at least <Col N="303" /> three months, to the greater satisfaction of all concerned.  Another matter which the Bill will, I hope, ensure is that farm productivity is maintained at a high level.  I should like the Minister to tell us, when he is replying, what co-operation, if any, exists between the Department of Lands and the Land Commission on the one hand and the Department of Agriculture and the county committees of agriculture on the other.  These committees have big responsibilities in the development of agriculture but it is my experience that there is no co-operation whatever between them and the Department of Lands.  I have been a member of the Cork committee over an extended period and it is my experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rooney suggested that lands vacated by their owners who have gone to England should be taken over by the Land Commission and distributed among deserving applicants.  Coming from the West Cork constituency, I cannot agree, because there we have a substantial number of holdings with the land let, the dwellinghouses locked and the owners gone to England.  They have gone because they cannot get a fair living at home.  However, many of those owners hope to come back again when they have made some money in England and resume occupation and even possibly buy an adjoining holding.  We must here differentiate between the owners who have not been forced out because of economic difficulties, who vacate their land for letting <Col N="305" /> purposes and the person who has to go to England for a period to earn some money, in many cases in order to develop that land and the housing on it.  It would be completely unfair that such holdings should be acquired.</P>
    <P>I had intended to mention a few more points, but I feel sure I would come up against you, Sir, and I do not wish to do that.  I would, however, suggest to the Minister that he should study this survey of West Cork which I have here.  It would give him a good idea of the problems there with which he and the Land Commission will be confronted.  No matter what Government are in power, this relief of uneconomic holders in West Cork will be a difficult problem to overcome.  I believe it cannot be overcome without the co-operation and goodwill of all concerned.  I do not wish to delay the House by quoting from this survey report, and anyway it is unusual for me to give quotations, but I recommend to the responsible authorities a study of this book.  They will find the problems listed.</P>
    <P>I hope this measure will be more fruitful than a measure which is, to some extent, on a par with it.  I refer to the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I hope that as a result of the implementation of this Bill, farms which are wholly uneconomic today will be brought up to standard and that there will be co-operation between the Department of Lands and other Departments to ensure that all the help and advice so essential for proper production will be given to these landowners.  I am doubtful, however, that we will see much fruit from this measure within the next three or four years.  I believe, as I stated earlier, that the Minister must overhaul his machine.  It is not working smoothly.  If it continues at its present rate, the job will not be done for centuries.  If necessary, the Minister should bring in legislation here to effect any changes which may be necessary in the Land Commission itself.  I hope earnestly this Bill will be a success and that the rural population, particularly along the western and southern seaboards, will benefit from it.</P>

      <P>The most important <Col N="306" /> problem in my constituency is the high rate of depopulation and the general low level of our agricultural development. When the Minister for Agriculture introduced his Estimate, I was hopeful that something would be done to solve this enormous problem.  As the Minister's speech unfolded, I was filled with regret and, speaking later on the Estimate, I did not hesitate to express my concern.  I am glad I was here last night when the Minister for Lands introduced this Bill.  This Bill will not go the whole way but it is at least a step in the right direction.  The aims are good; the intentions are good. Credit is due to the Minister for tackling this problem and to the officials of his Department and the inter-departmental Committee which have made available so much information.  Last week I asked here what had become of the inter-departmental Committee's recommendation with regard to the small farmer and last night, for the first time, I had a certain sense of satisfaction when I realised that at last something positive was to be done to succour the dwindling west.</P>
      <P>There are some in this House who complain but along the western seaboard, there is no rejoicing.  That is the area most affected and it is only logical that it should be the area to benefit most.  It is there the biggest problem lies.  The Minister has, in fact, introduced many provisions that will benefit the midlands and other parts of the country.  I disagree with what Deputy Tully had to say this afternoon.  It is obvious he is far removed from the problems of the congested areas.  His main grouse was that people were moving from the west to the midlands and, secondly, that they had big families.  Big families are a Christian and a Catholic heritage in the west of Ireland and long may the grace of God ensure that that situation continues.</P>

    <P>I have here the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i> Last night Deputy Reynolds gave us some interesting figures for Leitrim. The figures for Mayo are even more interesting and will clearly demonstrate that we are well entitled to sympathy. The number of holdings in Mayo between a quarter of an acre and not exceeding one acre is 574; between one <Col N="307" /> to five acres, 2,183; five acres and not exceeding ten acres, 2,843; ten to 15 acres, 3,828; 15 acres and not exceeding 30 acres, 10,967; exceeding 30 acres but not exceeding 50 acres, 5,049; exceeding 50 acres but not exceeding 100 acres, 2,153; exceeding 100 acres but not exceeding 150 acres, 346; exceeding 300 acres, 111.  The appalling fact is that there are 20,125 farmers in Mayo with less than 30 acres.  There are 22,568 farmers with a valuation of less than £15.  There <Col N="308" /> are 17,000 farmers trying to get a living on farms with a valuation of less than £10.  I submit to any midland Deputy, no matter where he sits, that surely to goodness he cannot complain if these are the biggest beneficiaries under this Bill.  Are they not the people in greatest need?</P>

      <P>The national average retail prices, in respect of mid-August, 1963, given in the table referred to by the Deputy, are the latest available. The compilation of the corresponding mid-November prices is in progress but the results will not be available for some weeks.</P>
