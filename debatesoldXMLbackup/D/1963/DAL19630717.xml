      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill do now pass.</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill has been discussed at length and in detail in the Dáil in its various Stages.  Now that the debates on it are coming to an end, so far as the Dáil is concerned, I think it desirable once more to try to relate the Bill as a whole to the wide issues of Government policy arising at this time. These wider, basic issues of policy seem to me to have been, in the main, evaded in the debates on the Bill so far as the leading Opposition speakers were concerned.  This is a disappointment. So far as relates to Deputy Dillon, his failure and the failure of his Party to deal constructively and comprehensively with these issues was not concealed by his resort to the tactics of abusing the Government as reported in today's Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efforts of political Parties to win credit for themselves and to bring discredit to their opponents are not <Col N="1065" /> necessarily harmful, so long as they are not regarded or presented as the sole purpose of political activity.  In the final resort, the main purpose of political effort must be to settle the principles and the aims which should inform national policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I do not suppose any of us would wish to hinder the Taoiseach in anything he wants to say but I understand the rules of order place a limitation on debate on the Fifth Stage.  Whether a general review of Government policy is relevant at this stage, I beg leave to doubt and submit to your ruling, but if you should rule that it is in order, certainly we would be quite prepared to urge on you a liberal interpretation of the strict rules of order if the Taoiseach wishes to spread himself, as he apparently does.</P>

      <P>As this is the last of the major debates in the Dáil before the Adjournment, I think it would be in accordance with the wishes of all Deputies that the limitations normally imposed on the Fifth Reading debate on a Bill should be applied, if at all, rather leniently.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies are well aware that particular issues of policy have to be determined before Government plans, including taxation plans, can be settled.  Certainly in the thinking of the Government, very important policy decisions have now to be and are being decided, whether Deputies realise it or not.  Decisions are being made which will determine the rate and the direction of our national progress for a long time to come.  This will become more obvious, perhaps, when the Government's second <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is published in the course of the next couple of weeks.  We are, in our thinking, at a point on the national road where we must firmly make up our minds whether to go forward or to go back and our decision is likely to prove irrevocable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debates on the Finance Bill, Government spokesmen have tried to explain that this Bill is not regarded as an ordinary routine measure of its kind, not merely as a Bill to settle the tax arrangements of this State for one year only but as a crucial part of the Government's whole plan for economic and social progress.  Some Opposition Deputies must have understood this.  To the extent that they concentrated on its purely political aspects, they have, in my judgment, defaulted on the obligation of a responsible Opposition to help to clarify the basic issues of policy by constructive debate on them.  By and large, the members of our community get their knowledge of the <Col N="1067" /> policy questions arising for decision at any time in our political life by means of the debate on them by political Parties.  To the extent that the Fine Gael Party have, in relation to this Bill, decided to rely upon their not inconsiderable powers of invective, they have advertised their disinclination to deal with these matters in a constructive manner.</P>
    <P>Do we wish to accelerate the national economic advance or to slow it down to avoid spending money on it, or to retreat from it in the interests of a mistaken concept of economy?  Do we accept that the fair distribution of the social benefits&mdash;the better living conditions which are made possible by economic progress&mdash;must be organised by the Government and must involve some redistribution, through taxation, of national income?  Do we want the improvements which only Government action can make possible, in education, health, housing, social welfare and in all other public services and amenities? Do we want them to the extent of being prepared to pay for them? These are the questions to which Fine Gael have not attempted to give clear answers or indeed any answers.  We sense that their answers, if they gave them, would be negative, but they have declined to attempt to define their political philosophy, if they have one. I think they have a political philosophy of sorts but because they are still hypnotised by the prospect of another Coalition arrangement with the Labour Party, they prefer to conceal it even if its character is occasionally and accidentally revealed in their speeches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach discovered a new political philosophy last month when he decided to go left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has recognised it.  The Labour Party, for their part, give me the impression of understanding the issues well enough but of not wishing to face up to their implications.  They seem to believe it is possible to keep on saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the economic and social aims of the Government and &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the means of realising them. The contradictions in their attitude are <Col N="1068" /> becoming increasingly clear and must be so even to themselves.</P>
      <P>So far as the Government are concerned and the Fianna Fáil Party who support the Government, we have tried to define our economic and social purposes as clearly as possible.  We have not attempted to evade or to conceal their financial consequences.  We want the Dáil and the public to see them as a connected whole, not only the taxes but how the resulting revenue will be spent; not only the benefits but the obligations which must be accepted if these benefits are to be realised.</P>
      <P>The question is: what kind of a community do we wish to become? Is it to be one based upon some fundamental principles of social justice, in which the equal right of all citizens to share in the benefits of economic growth is to be accepted, a community which is capable of combined effort to bring about that growth and to ensure equitable distribution of the benefits?  Or is it to be a society where economic progress is left to chance, where social aims are undefined or kept vague or are left to be settled by a perpetual conflict between different sections and classes, each seeking to draw the maximum from the pool of national resources regardless either of the justice of the claims of other classes or the possibility of destroying the nation in their conflict?</P>
      <P>It may be that the future is with the time-servers, the men of no fixed aims to whom politics is just a game of ins and outs.  I do not want to believe this.  It may be, as somebody has said recently, that the Irish people are against government and that a Party that gives them or promises them government is inviting rejection.  I do not believe this either.  It may be that, in committing the future of my Party to my conviction about the growing political maturity of the Irish people, I am reckoning on something that does not exist.  I am sure that events will justify my conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot force other political Parties to set out, for comparison with the Government's policy, alternative policies equally detailed and clear.  We have tried by every legitimate device of criticism and challenge to get them to <Col N="1069" /> do so but so far without success.  I know they think it may involve them in some political risk.  They believe that ambiguity and evasion are the means of winning votes, or, at least, of not losing them, but I believe they are wrong.  I believe the future is always with the Party that attempts to give the country leadership, and not with those who seek to evade defining their position, or who desire to play only the role of destructive critics, whatever occasional minor victories they may win.</P>
    <P>I believe the predominant position which Fianna Fáil have occupied in Irish political affairs for over 30 years is due to the fact that there never was ambiguity about our aims. The people may have been for them, or they may have been against them, but they always knew what they were.  For our part, we are not in politics as a game of any kind, but to implement a decision which was taken long ago, a decision that the freedom we had won for this country should not fail to remedy all the adverse economic and social consequences of foreign rule; should not fail to yield opportunities for a better way of life for the Irish people.  We knew that freedom was not an end in itself, that indeed it would create many new problems.  We also knew it gave us opportunity, subject to our capacity to organise ourselves to use it, to elevate the economic, social and cultural conditions of our people.</P>
    <P>We have not achieved all our aims &mdash;far from it.  I wish we had.  Progress in many directions has been disappointingly slow, but we do not intend to give up on that account, but rather to press more strongly ahead.  I said here in a debate last year that no nation could expect to slide downhill into prosperity.  There is no solution to Irish economic and social problems that does not require plan, work and sacrifice.  I regard it as a real disservice to the Irish people to tell them otherwise.  I know most of our people know this to be so, although some may be persuaded otherwise against their better judgment, by traders in discontent. It seems from Press reports I have seen that some irresponsible elements in farmers' organisations are <Col N="1070" /> talking about a campaign of illegalities to force more and bigger doles from the Exchequer, and that there are traders who, as they say, are refusing to be tax gatherers for the State, as if it were not their State, and as if they had no stake in its prosperity, and no obligation to help in its functioning and development.</P>
    <P>We know there are various sections, big or small, which are always demanding that they should get more and more out of the national pool, while putting no more into it.  I believe the spokesmen of all these sections&mdash; who seem to regard selfishness as the main motivating force of the Irish people, and patriotism a matter for fools &mdash; do not really represent the people for whom they speak.  I believe our people are far more decent, understanding and patriotic than they represent them to be.  What sort of nation do we want to become?  If the political Parties or the sectional organisations would try to give us an honest answer to that question, we would know their real motives, and they, on their part, might find themselves compelled to reassess their attitudes so that their answers would appear reasonably respectable and responsible.</P>
    <P>For the Government's part, we are telling the people, as we told the Dáil, that no programme of development can be completed without cost, and that there is no source from which that cost can be defrayed except their own production.  We are telling them that there is no means by which people can become permanently better off unless their work becomes worth more through better organisation and higher productivity.  We are telling them that the whole campaign for national development will founder unless there is a general acceptance of the ideas that all have a part in it and that it must be organised under the authority of the Government because there can be no substitute for that.  We are telling them that the cost of Government administration is continuing to go up.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that there are some arbitration awards affecting categories of the public service which are awaiting decision by the Government, awards which would involve a substantial <Col N="1071" /> addition to the cost of these services.  Every Deputy, even those who voted against the Budget, will press for the implementation of these awards, but I know very well that if they involve further tax additions, many of these same Deputies will also vote against providing the money.</P>
    <P>I believe this is the year in which we must reorganise our forces and rearrange our plans if the four per cent per annum rate of growth for which we are planning, and which we hope to maintain, is to be achieved.  This means reorganising our tax arrangements also.  The feasibility of this rate of growth and what it requires from each sector of the nation's economic organisation, and from all the constituent elements of our national community, will be spelled out soon in the Government's Second Programme.  I still believe that, notwithstanding all the difficulties, by the end of this year, we will be organised and geared to sustain this rate of growth.</P>
    <P>This is the difficult year so far as our internal arrangements are concerned, and a main part of the difficulty is to secure widespread public understanding and acceptance of a tax structure which will make the whole plan work. No definition of possibilities or targets, and no plan, will work miracles.  There are no miracles in this business unless the generation of united national effort in which every element of the community will be willing to subordinate its own sectional interests to the achievement of the national purposes should be regarded as a miracle.  That is a miracle we can perform for ourselves.</P>
    <P>The organised opposition to the turnover tax, which is the main feature of the Finance Bill, comes mainly&mdash; apart from political opposition in the Dáil&mdash;from a section of retail traders. Every increase in employment, every improvement in living standards, means more money passing over retail shop counters.  The retail traders of the country stand to gain most directly from rising national prosperity and, as a class, there is nothing they have to do, unlike other classes, to get their share.  In May, 1963, the value of <Col N="1072" /> retail sales in Irish shops was eight per cent higher than it was in May, 1962, and 13 per cent higher than it was in May, 1961.  That was a direct consequence of the success of the Government's first Programme.  We do not want any thanks from traders for that. We did not do it solely for their sake but for the sake of the whole community. Considerations of self-interest &mdash;assuming no higher motive would convince them&mdash;should suggest to the retail traders that they should support, more than any other element of the community, the measures which the Government are taking to maintain this economic improvement.</P>
    <P>This organisation, RGDATA, have proposed as a solution of our tax problem reduced Government spending. They, no more than any others who put forward the same vague idea, have not attempted to define that solution more exactly.  We must do it for them.  They mean lower social welfare payments, lower farm subsidies, lower wages for State employees, the curtailment of expenditure upon education, health, housing services and so forth. If any Government adopted this course, the first and, indeed, the most direct effect would be experienced by retail traders.  How it could be in their interest to curtail the volume of money in circulation, and to engineer a trade depression, only the executive of RGDATA could explain.</P>
    <P>In the Government's view, the volume of business activity should be maintained at the highest level the volume of national production can support and the Government's plans should be devised with this purpose in view.  No Deputy, irrespective of Party, fails to recognise that we require a considerable improvement and expansion of educational facilities particularly at the post primary and technical level.  No Deputy but desires to see the residue of unfit housing finally cleared away and the standard of housing accommodation improved. All Deputies profess to desire the extension and improvement of social services, including the health services. Deputies are continually pressing for improvements in the telephone service, <Col N="1073" /> for the extension of road construction to meet the growing volume of traffic, or for a wider scale of activities in drainage and land improvement.</P>
    <P>There are plans to be implemented, plans which all Deputies will welcome, in respect of land division, afforestation, fisheries and so forth.  The many measures which have been adopted and which are now in operation to stimulate higher production and greater efficiency in agriculture and in industry, the cost of which must increase with their success, and on which all our future hopes are based, must be maintained and financed.  There is no field of Government activity in which some desirable improvements are not possible, although many of them have still to be delayed, or completed at a slower rate than we would wish, for financial reasons.</P>
    <P>All activities of Government require the provision of money and are not possible without money.  I believe the Government are setting the rate of progress at a bearable level; Deputies who want a higher rate of development must argue for more spending and those who want less spending must argue for and accept a slower rate of progress.  In their recent report the Central Bank expressed their concern about the continued rise of Government expenditure and indebtedness as factors affecting costs of production and, therefore, affecting also the competitiveness of the national economy with special reference to the expansion of exports which is essential for further economic growth.</P>
    <P>This was a reasoned and reasonable statement which should not be lightly brushed aside.  We know that we can run into serious difficulties if our production costs are inflated either by Government policy or because of incomes rising faster than output.  The Central Bank said that the Government's spending on current account is increasing more rapidly than national income and that Government capital outlay is increasing faster still.  This, in my view, is inevitable in a developing economy.  In the highly developed countries the proportion of national income taken for public purposes is <Col N="1074" /> considerably greater than in this country and there is general public acceptance of this position and understanding of the need for it.</P>
    <P>A reluctance to divert a higher proportion of national resources to the financing of national progress must involve a slowing down in the rate of progress and the same result is secured whether that reluctance is expressed in political opposition to tax changes or in demands to have the effect on personal incomes compensated by income increases.  The growth target which we have set ourselves, this four per cent per annum increase in real terms, taking one year with another, cannot be achieved unless the present rate of investment can be increased.  Our rate of investment expressed as a percentage of the gross national product is still one of the lowest in Europe.  We regard it as essential to the achievement of our economic aims that the rate of investment should increase faster than gross national product and, if this cannot be realised by activity in the private sector, then the responsibility is on the Government to see that the investment activities of public authorities are maintained at the level necessary to meet the requirements of economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>A corollary of investment rising faster than gross national product is that consumption should not rise as fast.  The considered policy of the Government was expressed by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement as follows:</P>
    <P>Clearly it is right that the State should directly and indirectly increase the volume of investment and do everything in its power to promote as rapid a growth of the economy as can be sustained without excessive strain on the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I said, during the course of the Second Reading debate on this Bill, that every political decision is a choice between alternative courses.  It is right that the Central Bank should warn us of the dangers of trying to move too fast, of the dangers of adding to the inflationary forces which are always present <Col N="1075" /> in our economy.  The dangers of the alternative course&mdash;of moving too slowly, of cutting down our programme of economic and social progress&mdash;are of a different character, but they are just as serious.  If the impetus of the national advance should be checked at this time we could have very real difficulty in getting it started again.</P>
    <P>The crisis of confidence which this Government inherited from the Coalition proved more intractable as an impediment to recovery than did the financial crisis.  Public confidence in the country's future progress is not yet so deeply rooted that we can afford to weaken it.  While it would be shortsighted to pursue policies that would be likely to impair the prospects of sustained growth, or that would involve risk of a serious recession later, there are no economic indicators, and the Central Bank report does not point to any which show that this is happening now.  Because there is in the building industry, to which the Central Bank report refers, some danger of excessive stimulation of demand inflating costs unduly or creating a danger of a later recession, the Government have taken steps through the formation of the Building Advisory Council to keep this situation under examination and to seek to maintain activity at a uniform level representing the full productive capacity of the industry.  We do not think we are trying to go too fast.</P>
    <P>This is, I agree, the key problem in economic policy and a critical test of Government competence&mdash;fixing a rate of progress at the highest level which can be sustained, and applying all the checks and balances required to keep it at that level.  Nor is it entirely under the control of the Government because when a momentum of progress has been built up it cannot be arbitrarily checked or precisely regulated.</P>
    <P>There is now, I believe, a much wider public understanding than previously of the elementary economic considerations which will determine the country's rate of progress.  I am certain the Government will see any danger signals as quickly as others.  We have, I can claim, shown our intention <Col N="1076" /> and our capacity to act when they are seen, minority Government though we may be.  If we miss any signals we expect the Central Bank to direct our attention to them.  We will certainly take heed of their warnings but the considerations which operate in determining Government policy are not exclusively those to which bankers attach the chief importance.</P>
    <P>I hope soon to see set up and functioning the Economic Council which is at present under discussion with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and with employers' organisations.  This body will be concerned with the principles which should guide policy&mdash; the policy of the Government in sectors outside agriculture and of the employer-labour conference in securing the further development of the national economy towards full employment with adequate wages and stability of prices&mdash;and will be, in my judgment, an important addition to the mechanism by which national policy is formed.  Its importance will grow together with its influence in policy formation and on public opinion as its purpose and value become widely understood.  The ultimate responsibility for organising national policy, for framing legislation and for preparing administrative arrangements, rests on the Government in office and cannot be placed elsewhere.  This is the kind of democracy on which we have decided, with a Government responsible to a national Parliament elected for five-year terms.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Second Reading debate, Deputy Norton proposed that this turnover tax should be submitted to a national referendum.  No system of democracy could work on that basis.  If the turnover tax is to be submitted to that test, why not every other tax, and when the people have voted against all taxes, certainly all indirect taxes, as they probably would, then we could shut up shop and give up this idea of an independent Irish State?  In the Constitution Referendum of 1959, about the proportional representation system of election, we argued that our system of electing Deputies to Dáil Éireann, related to the political circumstances as they <Col N="1077" /> were likely to develop, created a risk of a succession of minority or coalition Governments, ineffective and short-lived Governments, with the disappearance of all elements of consistency from Government policy, leaving the country without democratic leadership and making planned progress a virtual impossibility.</P>
    <P>The Opposition Parties argued that the retention of the proportional representation system need not have that defect.  This Government is a minority one and none other is possible in this Dáil.  We have tried to prevent the forecasts which we made in that Constitutional Referendum from coming true, at least during this Dáil's lifetime.  We have decided to pursue the same policies as if we had a secure working majority to save the nation from the worst consequences of political instability and when the going got difficult not to seek the easy solution of another general election as our predecessors did.  Because we are a minority Government we are, and we knew very well we would be, liable to be subjected to pressures by organisations outside the Dáil which are trying to exploit the Dáil situation for sectional purposes.  These pressures are being used to an extent to which they would not be, and were not in our own experience, attempted when we had a secure working majority.  This is the main weakness of minority Governments, that these organised sectional pressures will surely be used and can sometimes become intolerable.  It is essential for the preservation of normal democratic procedure and arrangements that the activities of some of these pressure groups should be discouraged.</P>
    <P>Independent Deputies who supported the Government during the progress of this Bill&mdash;those of our members against whom these pressures were directed, Deputy Leneghan and Deputy Sherwin&mdash;have, in resisting these pressures, rendered a service to Irish democracy the importance of which will become far more obvious in time, and have set an example which is likely to be frequently mentioned in future Dáils and which will give strength and encouragement to others who may find <Col N="1078" /> themselves in future in similar circumstances.</P>

      <P>It seems to me, however, that the Opposition Parties for some purpose of their own which has not been revealed, or because of their lack of understanding of what is happening, are now trying to show how right we were in the proportional representation Constitution referendum debate.  If the Government should fall at this time because of the Dáil situation here, because of the external pressures and because Deputies who have not the protection of Party membership are improperly influenced by these organised efforts with proportional representation still in the Constitution, the probability is that the country would be condemned to a rapid succession of ineffective minority Governments until our democracy collapsed, as democracy collapsed under similar circumstances in other countries, or the people forced to make some such change as we had advocated.</P>
      <P>I have said that we do not propose to revive that proposal for a Constitution amendment.  That is still our position, but I believe that the dangers we were trying to eliminate by that proposal are very real and are still present.  At this time they can only be countered by the determination of the Government not to be driven from doing things, which in our judgment the national situation may require, to avoid a Dáil defeat.  We will not try to avoid a Dáil defeat by any time-serving operations.  On the other hand, we have no intention either of walking out on our responsibilities. We will fulfil our duty as we see it unless and until a Dáil defeat forces dissolution or the Dáil's normal five-year term is expired.  The Dáil records will show that in the course of the enactment of this Finance Bill, decisions were reached by some narrow majorities, even minimum majorities, but they were the right decisions and that is what will matter in the long run.</P>

      <P>When I look at the Party opposite and when I hear the Taoiseach speak today about his resolution, purpose and clarity of mind, I cannot help recalling that one of the signal services his Party rendered this State was to give us the ambiguity of the dictionary Republic.  Thank God, there was a Party to put an end to that detestable form of insanity and who said: &ldquo;If our people want to be a Republic, let them, but let us not be such only in the columns of Chambers's Dictionary but <i>coram populo</i>.&rdquo;  These recollections are extracted from me: they have little relevance to the present or future, but the impudent attempt of the Taoiseach to cast himself and his Party in the role of sole protectors of this State and of its economy is the great treason to Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let them get it into their heads that this House and all the Deputies who sit in it are the custodians of the welfare, of the survival of our nation.  We will tear this nation to pieces if we are to attempt a brainwashing of our people and try to put it into their heads that one Party in this House have the prerogative of protecting their interests and that every other Party who opposes them are against the nation.  Then democracy comes to an end.  I say, and I am proud to say, that I believe the Parliament established in this country by successive <Col N="1080" /> generations of Irishmen are the true custodians of our national interests and the prerogative of that duty devolves on no one of us but is shared by all&mdash;by us in Opposition as by the Government in office.</P>
    <P>I wish I could go on record as saying that I believe Fianna Fáil had discharged the latter part of their responsibility with anything like a realisation of what their duty to the State is. My experience in sitting opposite them when they were in Opposition has been of irrational, wild irresponsibility and willingness to associate themselves with any form of public misconduct in order to scramble back into office. I have not forgotten the windows of the <i>Irish Press</i> and their advertisements for the IRA when we were seeking to restrain the development of a civil war along our northern borders. However, enough of the past.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach begins his present brainwashing operation today by saying that the crossroads have been reached as to whether we go forwards or backwards.  I have sat opposite this Taoiseach for 30 years, and in the course of that time he has crested more hills, turned more corners, reversed more stones, explored more avenues than any ten men I know.  I heard him declare in this House 20 times the dawn of a great new State founded on some glorious piece of Fianna Fáil legislation.  Notably, I remember 25 years ago this Taoiseach declaring that the problems of the Irish transport industry were finally resolved and that we were about to embark on a glorious period of transport development.  Since then we have put £35 million into the transport industry and the net result is that the Taoiseach is now tearing up all the railways in the country.  Now we are at the crossroads.  If we follow Seán Lemass, we are advancing towards the dawn; if we follow anybody else, we are heading for hell.</P>

It amuses me to hear the Taoiseach, in pursuit of that general line of propaganda, brainwashing propaganda, declaring that the decision we now must take is whether we are to invest in national development or not.  Has the Taoiseach never heard of the Shannon Scheme, has the Taoiseach never heard of the Land Rehabilitation Project, has he never heard of the establishment of the turf briquette factory? Has the Taoiseach never heard of our housing programme which provided a surplus of houses in the city of Dublin? Has the Taoiseach never heard of rural electrification which brought electricity to every rural home in Ireland, the bulk of which was done by our Government and part under the present Government?</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach never heard of the forestry development, of the Agricultural Research Institute? The choice the Taoiseach suggests today is between investment in national development and non-development. Let me say to him that the choice does not exist.  It has been the policy of every Government that I know of, since this State was founded, boldly to invest in the resources of this country and to provide by the joint efforts of successive Governments an infrastructure for economic development which has been declared by one international authority after another to be unique among small nations.  One of the things that has struck successive international commissions who have come here to look at our economy has been the infrastructure that has been provided here, the roads, the power, the housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is pure folly to get up in this House and make the case that one side of the House want development and the other do not.  It is clearly a slander on our own people and is calculated to sap confidence in the economic future of this country.  Are we putting forward the proposition to all potential investors in the economy of Ireland that if there is any change of <Col N="1082" /> Government, all must abandon hope? If such a proposition is being put forward, then it will have the effect which I have outlined because let me tell the Taoiseach that there is going to be a change of Government.</P>
    <P>What a disservice it is to the national interest to declare before the world that if there is a change of Government from the Fianna Fáil Party, all prospects of economic development in Ireland come to an end.  Of course such a proposition exists only in the imagination of the Fianna Fáil Party who may hope to blackmail a few poor weak men into dangling along into the Lobby because they are persuaded these propositions are true and are essential to the survival of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Declarations of that sort do no service to Ireland.  On the contrary, you place in real jeopardy the economic development which we all ought to desire to see, no matter what Government are in office.  I would urge on the Taoiseach, who is, after all, like myself, now reaching the last decade of his public life, not to perpetrate that great disservice on this country.  To associate the whole future of this nation with any one political Party is an illusion and a falsehood and a great disservice to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have no apology to make on behalf of this Party as to our record on the policy we set forth.  No Party can do more than print its policy in black and white a fortnight before a general election, for all the world to read and criticise, and to stand on that policy.  I want to ask Fianna Fáil this question.  Where and when have they done it?  If they have, if there is some hidden source which I have not yet discovered, where was there in it a proposal to tax the food, clothing and fuel of our people?  I never found it.  I never heard a whisper of such a proposal being laid before the country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says the Government in this country who are obliged to listen to the representations of what he pleases to call sectional interests are labouring under an embarrassment that no democratic Government ought to have to face.  He goes on to say that if democratic Governments are faced <Col N="1083" /> with that in the future, democracy must collapse in this country.  Was there ever such tripe spoken by a public man since democracy was first instituted? What is the difference between free democratic institutions and dictatorships and authoritarian regimes but that the Government of the day shall be susceptible to the will of the people and that if the Government proceed to go daft, the will of the people should be made manifest through Parliament and through lawful public demonstration?</P>
    <P>I want to say most deliberately that time and again young people have come to me and consulted me as to what they will say to those who claim the right to defy the law by conspiracy or by violence.  I have replied to them: &ldquo;Go back to your young companions and remind them that in this country there is no justification for any man conspiring to defy the law or defying it with arms or violence because in this country he can join a political party.  He can make his opinions heard and felt and, if that is not sufficient, if he cannot find a party to correspond with his desires, he has a right to go out and stand at any street corner, to get up on his barrel and gather his friends around him.  If he can gather enough of them he has a right, in the last analysis, to change the Government. So long as he has that right, he cannot claim he is under any pressure which would justify him in defying the Government elected by the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the right the Taoiseach seeks, perhaps unconsciously, to challenge. It is a desperately dangerous thing for a head of an Irish Government to say he feels that the invocation of that right by a section of our people constitutes an intolerable handicap on the Government of the day.  It is not. It is a legitimate, proper and admirable exercise of freedom which, under God's providence and as a result of the work of those who went before, our people gloriously enjoy.</P>
    <P>Of course, when one is in Government and that right is exercised against you, you know a moment's resentment.  I have recalled before in <Col N="1084" /> this House seeing 10,000 farmers march outside the Department of Agriculture when I was Minister for Agriculture.  I do not deny that because I wanted to be Minister for Agriculture and because my whole heart was wrapped up in the industry of agriculture it hurt and exasperated me, more particularly when they were being led in that demonstration by a man whom I knew to be a staunch supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party, nominally to get delivery of a report a copy of which I knew that man had in his pocket as he was walking at the top of the procession.  I was willing and anxious to go out and to tell them the facts but he took damn good care not to ask me.  But was I entitled to go out and denounce them for exercising the right they had?  I was not. They were perfectly law-abiding, perfectly orderly.  They offered nobody any offence or threat but they were exercising the right I gloried they should have.  I deplored the method of its use.  I resented the fact that I knew Fianna Fáil Deputies were organising them into that folly but they were free men and they had a right to do wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that is the glory of true freedom.  I know that the Taoiseach has been raised in a school which maintained continually that the people have no right to do wrong.  I have always held that, under the supreme law of God, the people have the right to do wrong and if you take that right from them you make them slaves, not free men: they have a right to make mistakes.  They have a right to go wrong politically and they have a right to discover their mistake and correct it.  That is why we have general elections&mdash;so that when the people go wrong and make the mistake of choosing Fianna Fáil there will be a general election to give them the chance of correcting it&mdash;and that is what we are concerned, in connection with this Finance Bill, to bring about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say this and perhaps this shocks the Taoiseach and deprives him of the stimulus of the cut and thrust <Col N="1085" /> of debate for which he yearns though he does not seem to enjoy it when he gets it.  I agree with him and I disagree with Deputy Norton when Deputy Norton says this Finance Bill should be submitted to a referendum.  I think that procedure is the very negation of parliamentary democracy.  We were sent here to legislate for the people and the decisions of this Oireachtas are binding on our people&mdash;and the Government act by the authority of God. Those seem to me to be fundamental facts which are accepted on all sides of the House.  I do not think our decisions, except in so far as the Constitution requires it, should be submitted to referendum of the people. The proper method when it appears that the majority of the people have parted company with the Government's policy is that the people be consulted in a general election and a new Parliament chosen.  So long as the Government feel that is not so, they have a right to hang on even if the only two buttons holding up their breeches are Deputy Leneghan and Deputy Sherwin.</P>

      <P>Surely, if the Taoiseach finds that the taxation proposals brought by his Government before this Parliament move groups of people like the merchants or the farmers of the country to indignant public protest, instead of expressing bitter resentment that they should exercise that constitutional right, would he not be better occupied examining his own conscience?  These are not the kind <Col N="1086" /> of people who ordinarily come out in the streets to demonstrate.  If you try to get them to come out to a meeting it is extremely difficult to get them to do so.  All of us know in our own political experience that if you go to hold a meeting the last people you can get to come to and attend the meeting are strong farmers and comfortable merchants.  They may give you every other kind of support but to come out and demonstrate in the streets they are extremely reluctant to do.  Surely when they are out demonstrating, you ought to ask yourself what has gone wrong?  What has caused them to adopt this line of public manifestation? I suggest to the Taoiseach that, instead of stirring himself up into a frenzy of indignation because they have done this, he would be better occupied in asking himself why, in asking &ldquo;What have I done or what have my Government done that could so move them as to make them do it?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sometimes the Taoiseach when he is in his more elevated moods launches in the general process of the brainwashing operation some sublime political aphorism.  Listen to this.  It sounds quite well until you ask yourself the simple question &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;  Here it is: &ldquo;Every political decision is a choice between two alternative courses.&rdquo;  Is that not a very profound observation?  That is like saying every circle is as round as another.  Such observations have a fine reasoned sound, but when you come to examine them they mean Sweet Fanny Adams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach asks us to make up our minds on the question of whether the Government are travelling too fast or too slow.  I want to put it to the Taoiseach that is not the question he should ask himself at all.  The question he should ask himself is whither is he travelling.  It is a very silly thing to concentrate on the pace at which you are travelling until you have made up your mind in what direction you propose to go.  I want to suggest in the context of this debate, which has been widened on an unprecedented scale, that it might be no harm to return to what is strictly relevant on the Fifth Stage of this Finance Bill.  Why are we <Col N="1087" /> opposing this Finance Bill?  Why are we, as the Opposition in this House, voting against this Finance Bill?  These are the questions we ought to be asking ourselves within the strict rules of order today.</P>
    <P>We believe this Finance Bill will raise the cost of living on our people.  We believe that the inevitable consequences will be to reduce our competitive position in foreign markets.  There is no contesting that for it is agreed on all sides of the House and on behalf of the Government it was conceded last night by the Minister for Justice that the intention of this is to raise the cost of living on the people generally. What are the implications of that?  I think Deputies are closing their eyes to the inevitabilities of the future.  I have always believed, and I still believe, that a very large volume of our total export potential is providentially founded on the fact that there are 50 million hungry people living beside us and that we have the facility for delivering to that market perishable agricultural produce in a fresh state.  In that I include our livestock and livestock products.  I fully recognise, however, that, if we are to employ our own people in their own country, we have got to expand industrial output; and that means export markets as soon as we have reached the stage of substantially saturated domestic demand.</P>
    <P>We have got to face two facts.  One is that if we raise the cost of living in this country, it is wholly illusory to imagine that our industrial costs are going to remain low.  Industrial efficiency is improving.  Individual output doubtless is expanding.  That in some measure ought to be able to bridge the gap between the rising cost of living and our industrial costs.  But if the cost of living goes up, as certain as we are standing in Dáil Éireann costs will rise.  We have to realise that in face of two facts.  One is we are trading very largely in the British market, which heretofore has been a protected market for us and that protection is gradually being whittled away by EFTA and the prospect of our entering into the Common Market. <Col N="1088" /> I was always breast high for entering the Common Market if Great Britain entered it.  I supported the Taoiseach's policy when he advocated that and fought for it and I deliberately refrained from exhaustive criticism so long as I believed him to be negotiating in Brussels on behalf of this country. But I want to direct attention to a most significant thing in that connection. When Herr von Brentano was speaking on the television two nights ago, for the first time since this business was mooted I heard a German statesman speaking of the next stage of development of the Common Market involving the admission of Great Britain, Norway and Denmark without referring to Ireland.  In my experience of Germany I have never heard anyone do that before.  That is a matter to which the Taoiseach might advantageously turn his mind.</P>
    <P>Whether it is in the Common Market or whether it is as we are at present with the operation of EFTA proceeding, we are faced with a complete and progressive elimination of our protected position in the British market. That is one reason for reduced costs.  But, over and above that, we are moving rapidly into a situation where automated industry is taking over.  Within a decade or so our men will be competing with their machines. That is a very grim and formidable prospect.  I see some industries being inaugurated in this country today and, when I compare the methods and resources on which they propose to depend for production with the automated processes I have already seen in operation, it strikes me that many of the processes we are inaugurating to-day are as much behind modern continental and American practice as the ass and cart was behind the internal combustion engine.  How we are going to keep our place, except in highly specialised branches of industry where individual skill can be exploited to particularly great advantage, is a very important problem for us to consider. With the onset of automation, the scope for individual skill as opposed to automated skill seems to be getting narrower and narrower.</P>
    <P>We oppose this proposal generally <Col N="1089" /> to raise the cost of living for it is going to decrease our competitive capacity in the export markets of the world.  Secondly, we oppose it because, no matter what anybody says and no matter whatever adjustment is made in social service payments, the small farmers of this country, many of whom do not benefit under social service payments such as blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and children's allowances, are going to have their standard of living further depressed.  Unless we can expand our exports, both agricultural and industrial, in foreign markets, we are marching into a growing danger.</P>
    <P>We have at present an adverse trade balance of £105 million per annum. That adverse trade balance does not produce the expected repercussions on our balance of payments because substantial sums in capital flow into this country.  I have never yet discovered from any source any clear breakdown of the character of that capital investment. Certainly, some of it is coming in to buy Irish land as the traditional pledge against inflation.  Some of it is coming in to buy city property, and a very large quantity of that is being purchased by British property investment companies.  Some of it is coming in as &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money and some as investment capital for industrial enterprises, but in any case it is reasonable to assume that for every £10 million of it remaining in the country, there will ultimately develop an annual charge in perpetuity of £700,000 to reward that capital in foreign ownership.</P>
    <P>That is all right if our balance of trade assumes a character which will carry that additional annual outflow, but, if we continue to run a growing adverse balance of trade with the purchases of land and property ceasing and the influx of capital reducing and the efflux of interest on the capital already here continuing, we shall run into a balance of payments problem of an extremely difficult kind to grapple with, unless we have prospects of steadily widening export markets for our industrial and agricultural produce and I cannot see, if we deliberately raise our own costs, how we can hope to achieve that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> I hear the Taoiseach pretending to believe there is contention between the different parts of this House about the desirability of investing in Irish industrial development.  He knows perfectly well that is not true but I remember when we were in office one of the problems arising was not the availability of capital for investment but the availability of enterprises in which to invest it.  Since we went out of office, what are the great investments that have been made of Government capital <i>en bloc</i>?  There is Nítrigin Éireann, the Verolme Dockyards, Irish Steel Holdings, Potez Aircraft and Dundalk Engineering.  I ask any rational Deputy would any <i>entrepreneur</i> in the world invest in that group, representing £15 or £20 million of public money, except the Irish Exchequer?</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to stand over any investment of public capital which provides employment for our people at home if it ultimately fulfils the modest condition that it will provide for its own depreciation and pay the interest that the Government have to pay on the capital they provide.  I do not ask it to make profits in the commercial sense.  Of course it is good if they can do so and plough it back into the enterprises expanding, developing and strengthening them but I do not regard that as a <i>sine qua non</i> of what you could describe as a successful enterprise.  If it can depreciate its assets and pay interest on the money the Government have borrowed to provide the capital and give decent employment I think it has justified itself.</P>
    <P>How can any of us say we view with confidence the prospect of these investments to which I have referred?  I view them all with the greatest apprehension.  Later today we shall have to go into the question of the Verolme enterprise but it is indicative that this enterprise was launched on the proposition that a Dutch capitalist wanted to put capital into Ireland. Next we were told he would not put in any more than a token sum in consideration of our providing about £4 million.  Now we are faced with a <Col N="1091" /> suggestion that we should make him a present of £999,000 in order to keep him there.</P>
    <P>That is an investment pattern on which I do not think this country has any reason to congratulate itself.  It is silly and bad for the country to be proclaiming that no Party other than Fianna Fáil believe in capital investment in Irish industry.  Far from that being true, as the Taoiseach knows, it was our Government which set up the Industrial Development Authority and initiated the whole system of freedom from income and corporation profits tax on exports.  I do not want to take from our successors in the very least that they adopted and even expanded these schemes but it is bad for the country to pretend there is some conflict of belief about the desirability of promoting industry here when in fact there is not.</P>
    <P>But there is conflict, not as to the general principle of stimulating industry by any means available in order to provide us with exports and proper use of the skill of our people in their own country&mdash;we all want that&mdash;but it is the quality of the undertaking that gives ground for pause.  I admit we have certain joint responsibility.  We got the Canadians to put money into Avoca.  The mistake we made&mdash;it is easy to be wise after the event&mdash;is that we did not say on the first day: &ldquo;Not a penny.  This is just a hole in the ground.  If the Canadians can exploit it and do well out of it, good luck to them, but no Irish money should go into this enterprise.&rdquo;  I admit we have joint responsibility in agreeing to a policy of making more public money available which, as far as I can see, is all gone down the drain and that will never yield back a penny but I am fearful that we shall be dragged into other similar enterprises resulting in our having to carry a deadweight of debt around our necks which may create an atmosphere of disillusion with the whole prospect of development through Government intervention which could do harm to the economic life of the country.</P>
    <P>I think we can set against incidents of that kind, with considerable satisfaction, <Col N="1092" /> the development of aspects of industry like the Irish Sugar Company. The Cumann na nGaedheal Government first set it up; Fianna Fáil further developed it and under the present administration this vegetable-canning activity and canning of other products is going forward, I hope with every success.  So far as it succeeds it is a good thing applauded by all sides.  The institution of the briquette factory was a valuable and desirable development because it is an element in Bord na Móna activities which is profitable and helping to carry the costs of many of its other activities.  There is no charge on the generation of power for that branch of Bord na Móna activity. They are actually selling their products in foreign as well as domestic markets at prices giving ample return on the money invested.  We began that: the present Government carried it on.</P>
    <P>I believe this to be a really bad Bill.  It is creating a widespread sense of anxiety and apprehension and I do not want to close without saying quite clearly that for anybody who wants to read the policy in detail of this Party, of which I am the leader, he can find it there in black and white and if he cannot and if he will write to me, I shall furnish it in black and white for all who run to read.  I want to state categorically that we believe that people should be entitled to live in peace and dignity in their own country, that destitution should be the first charge on our resources.  I presume these are propositions which are acceptable to most Parties in this House. I claim no special prerogative in this for the Fine Gael Party.  We believe that every family should have a roof over its head and a roof that will stay up, and Fianna Fáil have made the great mistake of allowing the housing programme to run down to the point at which we have a housing crisis in the city of Dublin at the present time.</P>
    <P>We believe that the ideal to be aimed at and the objective to keep constantly before us is that the best we have to offer in primary, secondary, vocational and university education should be available to every child, without reference to the financial circumstances of his parents.  We <Col N="1093" /> fully appreciate that over the long term that will cost money and we believe that the people must be asked to provide the money to attain that end as quickly as may be.  It will not be attained overnight but it should be the agreed objective of us all.</P>
    <P>We believe that agriculture and industry must make their contribution, and they can, to the economic life of this country.  We deplore the view that agriculture should be treated as a kind of poor relation of the economic life of Ireland and we have frequently urged on this Government, and when in office did our part, to expand and modernise the agricultural industry and would continue to do so if returned to office in the morning.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government are wholly wrong in accepting this method of financing the essential requirements of the country.  It is wrong to accept as a principle that you should tax the vital necessaries of the people in order to do that and that that is the only method whereby the necessary revenue can be obtained for the economic expansion of our society. We have stood all our life in the public life of this country against the principle of taxing the foodstuffs of the people.  We believe that that tax, if enacted by this House, should be repealed, and we are glad and happy, if the Fianna Fáil Party at any time wish to go to the country in a general election, to argue that issue with them on the platforms of Ireland.  We will accept the verdict of our people, whatever it may be, in a general election.</P>
    <P>We are not in the least afraid that any decision the people may take will result in the breakdown of parliamentary institutions in Ireland.  Parliamentary institutions are more secure and more firmly based in Ireland than they are in practically any country in Europe.  I rejoice in that fact.  I have no apprehension that they will ever fail us and I confidently appeal to the Government now to do Ireland the best service they can possibly do, that is, to call a general election at the earliest possible date and put out of all doubt or question what the will of the people really is in respect to the financial policy enshrined in this Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach's intervention this morning was considered to be very necessary within the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party.  After the contributions we have had from the Government side on the Finance Bill, I should think the Party's forces would need some rallying because such a lack of enthusiasm for a Finance Bill I have never seen since I came into the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the Minister for Finance had a lone task in trying to defend the Bill in its various details and naturally found himself in some difficulty in respect of some of the questions he was asked.  He did not get much help from those who pretend they are enthusiastic about the provisions of this Finance Bill and especially that in connection with the turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach appeared&mdash;and it is not his usual role&mdash;to lecture the Opposition Parties generally this morning as if he were the purest politician who ever sat in this House.  I would not accuse the Taoiseach of being the greatest scoundrel that ever sat in the Government benches but I would not say he was the purest of politicians. Nevertheless, his whole speech this morning was based on the assumption that everything that was done from this side of the House, everything that was said from this side of the House, had the ulterior motive of trying to catch a small section of votes here and a small section of votes there.  I have not been as long in this House as the Taoiseach but I recognise&mdash;and within his heart, the Taoiseach himself will admit it&mdash;that very many of the measures that were introduced into this House by him, and particularly by his predecessor, were designed entirely to win or to maintain a certain vote, and the Taoiseach himself knows there are certain sections of this community which he is afraid to touch, which he is afraid to investigate from any point of view, even the point of view of raising money, because he <Col N="1095" /> knows that if he did that, he would be swept out of office at the next general election.  He is a man of courage in many respects but he knows his Party is too strong for him and that they will not let the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach knows well what I have in mind.  Every single member of the Fianna Fáil Party is committed to the Fianna Fáil policy and I do not take any exception to that.  Neither do I take exception to the two Independent Deputies who support them or the people who voted for them. However, these Deputies were voted for as Deputy Leneghan and Deputy Sherwin.  They had no mandate for any type of policy.  They have a mandate from the people of Mayo and a constituency here in Dublin to represent those people fairly in Dáil Éireann but it is ludicrous to suggest that these two people, of all those who are not of Fianna Fáil in the House, have the best judgment, especially in respect of this turnover tax.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach seems to take credit for, and attributes in particular merit or virtue to, the fact that he is not dissolving the Dáil.  That is not a very big-hearted thing for him to do.  That does not show tremendous courage or a tremendous sense of responsibility. What else can the Taoiseach do?  If my judgment is correct, if there were a general election in the next three or four weeks, Fianna Fáil would lose substantially.  That is my judgment and I think it is the Taoiseach's judgment as well as that of every member of his Party.  If he were to go to the country in the next three or four weeks&mdash; naturally, he will not&mdash;he would be swept out of office.  Therefore, all he can do is to hang on&mdash;maybe that is not the right word&mdash;or stay in office as long as he can with the support of the members of his Party and that of the two Independents in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach did a disservice to this debate by widening it.  It is right at times in an adjournment debate that the Taoiseach should give a general review of the progress of the State in <Col N="1096" /> its many sectors, to give a review of Fianna Fáil policy generally, and state what are the intentions for the future. However, every debate cannot be a broad or general debate and what we are considering and what we are expected to consider here is what is in this Finance Bill.  The one objection we see to the Bill is the introduction of what is described as the turnover tax. We are considering the proposals that are before us.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and members of his Party have asked us on many occasions: &ldquo;What would you do to get the £11½ million which we expect the turnover tax will bring in?&rdquo;  Will the Taoiseach answer a question?  In recent times he was in Opposition for six years.  Does he remember that he or any member of his Party suggested a method for raising extra money?  Did he or any member of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench suggest to an inter-Party Government Minister for Finance any new method by which he could raise money?  Did they ever advocate a tax?  When taxes were introduced in respect of cigarettes, beer, tobacco, and the usual things, to provide money for social welfare and health, and to advance the country generally, Fianna Fáil voted against them.  I have no objection to that.  I take the advice of the Taoiseach in that respect when he said while in Opposition: &ldquo;It is not for us to propose new taxation.  It is not for us to make proposals.  You are the Government and you have the responsibility.  It is for us to criticise when we think you are wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is exactly what we are trying to do on this Finance Bill.  The Taoiseach and members of his Party are trying to give the impression that those who vote against the turnover tax are denying the people increases in social welfare benefits.  That is entirely untrue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Deputy Burke please not interrupt?  I do not intend to delay the House very long.  On this Finance Bill, the Labour Party are giving a positive vote to enable the Government to raise a little over £4 <Col N="1097" /> million per year which will just about pay for the small increase the Government propose in respect of social welfare, children's allowances and other benefits.</P>
      <P>This morning, the Taoiseach spoke as a kind of Simon Pure in politics.  I do not know whether that was deliberate or unconscious.  Let us not dwell too much on some of the things for which the Taoiseach was responsible in the past.  He tries to give the impression that the Labour Party want everything, but do not want to pay for anything, that we pretend to be concerned about social welfare benefits but do not want to pay for them, that we are always clamouring about unemployment and the cost of living.  The Taoiseach has as good an appreciation as anyone else of how elections are run in this country.  If he wants to attribute ulterior motives to the Labour Party, let me remind him of some preelection promises he made.  &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands back to work.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil did not succeed in getting them back to work.  There is no doubt about that.  The Taoiseach and the former Taoiseach, now the President of Ireland, promised they would not interfere with the food subsidies.  The Taoiseach made that promise in Tramore.</P>

When they got back into office, the excuse was that they did not know what the financial state of the country was.  They did not know it when they made the promise. They were stupid and dishonest to make that promise if they did not know the financial state of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have enough experience as politicians to know what the state of the country was, because all the facts were available in the various statements published by the Department of Finance from time to time.  The Taoiseach promised that he would get cracking on housing.  He <Col N="1098" /> tried to allege that the Minister for Local Government in the inter-Party Government lay down on the job.  The Taoiseach knows in his heart that from 1948 to 1951 under a Labour Party Minister for Local Government, there was a new housing drive, and that there was an awareness of the need for housing on the part of the Minister which he passed on to the officials of the Department and to the members of local authorities.  He certainly did more in his efforts to provide houses for the people than most Ministers for Local Government.  The situation is as bad now as it was when the Government took office in 1957.  So far as I can see, there seems to be a go-slow on the building of houses, for what reason I do not know.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made many promises prior to the last election&mdash;promises which he did not fulfil.  He says he did not promise 100,000 new jobs but that that was a blueprint for discussion.  We did not get 100,000 new jobs.  On the contrary, we got emigration.  We find that in the past 12 months unemployment has been increasing, despite what the Taoiseach says.  The Taoiseach said that in this debate we evaded the wider issues.  I am sure the Chair would have taken us to task if we had taken the line which the Taoiseach took this morning.  He talked about a second <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  I know the Taoiseach's intentions were good and the intentions of the Government were good when they introduced the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>. Again, I do not think they have any reason to be unduly happy about the final results of that programme, especially in view of the fact that employment is precarious in many parts of the country, and unemployment has risen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said that the Opposition failed to deal with policy questions.  We are concerned about what is in the Finance Bill and that is what we are talking about.  Deputy Dillon referred to the fact that the Fine Gael Party had a policy document which they published before the last election.  The Labour Party have a policy document, too, in much greater <Col N="1099" /> detail than that of any other Party. What the Taoiseach thinks of it we do not know, but the policy document of the Labour Party issued prior to the last election is the most detailed of any policy document of any Party.</P>
    <P>This debate has been notable for the fact that there have not been many contributions from Government spokesmen. The Taoiseach jumped in this morning to rally the flagging forces of Fianna Fáil.  I see the Minister for Transport and Power is ready to enter the fray, for what reason I do not know, but we will get a &ldquo;clatter&rdquo; of statistics in any case.  I know that in a debate such as this, suggestions are likely to be lost, and it is impossible for the Taoiseach or Minister to deal with them all.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a reasonable chance of reducing expenditure in this country in some directions.  I am not trying at all to tell the Taoiseach that by a reduction in expenditure in certain directions we can get all the money the Minister for Finance needs, but I suggested in the debate on the Vote on Account, or in some such debate, that there should be established committees of this House to inquire into expenditure, especially in respect of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, Local Government, the Department of Defence and all the bigger Departments of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Taoiseach will tell me that the officials in these various Departments have scrutinised and pruned to the very last £, to the very last penny, but all the wisdom as far as the administration of expenditure in this country is concerned is not vested, and they would be the first to admit it, in the officials in the various Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the latter portion of the year, we consider the Estimates.  We know the type of debate we get.  It is merely a criticism of administration, various suggestions, and so on.  Never do we seem to get down to the expenditure of money and I would say in respect <Col N="1100" /> of Industry and Commerce and Agriculture that we may be carrying&mdash;I am convinced we are&mdash;what could be described as dead wood which could be cut out.  I am also convinced in respect of Industry and Commerce and Agriculture that we are misusing the moneys.  I am convinced that the money is not being applied in directions that are really productive and that much more use could be made of some of these moneys.  I believe that much can be done by committees of this House whose task it would be to finecomb, so to speak, the expenditure, especially the expenditure in respect of these bigger Departments.</P>
    <P>We heard many high sounding phrases from the Taoiseach this morning. They appeared like that.  One appreciates that the Taoiseach cannot, perhaps, explain in detail what is in his mind when he uses these phrases.  We hear such phrases as &ldquo;a fair distribution of the nation's wealth&rdquo;.  I must confess that I am not impressed when I hear phrases like that unless I see evidence that the user of the phrase is determined that there will, in fact, be a fair distribution of the nation's wealth.  If we take one example, wages, we cannot say that tremendous efforts are being made to distribute the nation's wealth in a fair manner.  When we remember that in respect of what is described as the most important industry, the agricultural industry, those employed in that particular industry receive the lowest wage of anybody in the country, the agricultural industry on which people say this country depends, the agricultural industry which provides us with most of our exports, the agricultural industry which does all that for the country, and yet it is the industry that can pay only £6 odd per week to agricultural workers in the major portion of this country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made some mention of what we describe as the &ldquo;pay pause&rdquo; document and what he describes as the &ldquo;Closing the Gap&rdquo; document.  Now we must approach this Finance Bill bearing in mind that there is a pay pause, bearing in mind that there is to be a turnover tax, and also bearing in mind the seeming <Col N="1101" /> reluctance of the Government to exercise any form of price control. The Government seem to believe that prices will control themselves by dint of competition amongst manufacturers and traders.  I think the Taoiseach will have to be concerned about the control of prices when this turnover tax comes into operation, as it undoubtedly will seeing that the Government have a majority in this House to put it through.  Because there will be differences in the prices that traders will charge in order to compensate themselves for the turnover tax they will have to bear, I believe there will have to be some form of control of prices because, if the Taoiseach is wise, even he must recognise that, if the trade union movement is to act with discretion, is to act in the interests of the State, bearing in mind also its own interests, trade unions will have to be convinced that the Government are concerned about the control of prices. If we are going to have a pay pause we must have some effective control of prices.  Otherwise we will find ourselves in a situation in which I believe the Taoiseach does not want us to find ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also says that so far as the Labour Party are concerned we always seem to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; when there are proposals for the raising of money for certain purposes, purposes which he describes.  I said at the outset that as far as we are concerned, we have shown approval in a positive way for three proposals in the Finance Bill, one a major proposal, for the raising of money.  We had no hesitation in walking into the Division Lobby with the Government in their proposal in respect of corporation profits tax. Had there been a division with regard to the proposal in respect of the increase in the profits on rents or the tax evasion proposals, I and my Party would have had no hesitation in joining the Government in voting for these proposals.</P>
    <P>What we are concerned about in the turnover tax is not what the Taoiseach believes some of us in Opposition are concerned about.  I am not acquainted with RGDATA.  I know they have their problems in regard to the operation <Col N="1102" /> of this tax, but my primary concern, and the primary concern of the Labour Party, is not the problems that traders and shopkeepers and manufacturers may have in respect of the turnover tax but the problems in respect of the consumers, the people who will have to pay.</P>
    <P>There have been statements from the Government side, and boasts, to the effect that we are now going to increase old age and widows' pensions, unemployment assistance, children's allowances, and all that sort of thing, to the extent of about £4 million per year. Again, Fianna Fáil speakers have tried to give the impression that the whole of the turnover tax is going to social welfare.  If questioned they would, of course, admit that it is not but in general statements they make and from the general observations of their supporters down the country one would think the whole £11,500,000 will go towards giving increases to social welfare recipients.  Mark you, I do not think it is a great feat that in a year in which we are raising £16 million extra taxation we still give the same sort of increase, particularly to the old age pensioner.  We give the same increase in a year in which the Finance Bill is expected to raise an extra £15 million or £16 million by way of taxation as we gave in the years in which extra taxation represented some £2 million or £3 million.  We still dole out the usual half-crown.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked this morning about the planning of the economy generally.  He suggested, especially to the workers, that their work must be worth more.  I was glad he went on to qualify that by saying there must be better organisation because, too often, people think in terms of harder work, and more work by the workers when they think about increased production. I think all of us in this House would agree that, as far as the Irish worker is concerned, he is the equal of most workers in most other countries in the world.  What militates against the economy in this country, what militates against greater industrial production, is the lack of organisation.</P>
    <P>I should still like the Taoiseach to dwell at greater length on a statement <Col N="1103" /> he made during the Budget debate.  He said, and I do not want to appear to be giving his exact words, that Government policy should take a step to the left.  I think that is a fair paraphrase of what he said, but there does not seem to be a great deal of evidence that the shift to the left in government is to be marked.  There is a great deal of scope for some shift to the left in Government policy.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Dillon talking about the investment in the Verolme Dockyard, the Dundalk Engineering Works, Nítrigin Éireann, Potez and other concerns. I agree that some of them do not seem to have been eminently successful. I would blame the Government and Government policy for that.  They are doing a disservice to the idea of establishing State or semi-State organisations in the manner in which they are giving financial assistance to projects of that kind.  As far as the Avoca Copper Mines, the Dundalk Engineering Works, the Verolme Dockyard, or as far as any of these industries in which the Government put a substantial amount of money are concerned, I say they are doing a disservice to the idea of the State promoting industries so long as they do not seek some sort of control in the running of these industries in which they invest substantial amounts of money.</P>
    <P>They have themselves to blame if some of these projects are not as successful as the Government wished they would be.  The move to the left will not be successful if we are to be confronted with the examples Deputy Dillon quoted today.  My Party believe, where private enterprise fails to do the job, in the encouragement of the establishment of industry by the State so that the people will have employment. We are in favour of a co-operation of public and private enterprise because that also is possible, but all these projects will fail unless we are to exercise some control.  We need not be afraid any more of being regarded as this sort of socialist or that sort of socialist; our primary concern should be for the welfare of the people in keeping them at home in good and remunerative employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> The Taoiseach very quickly adopted &mdash;and nobody blames him for it&mdash;as part of his policy some of the things embodied in the late Holy Father's Encyclical <i>Matter et Magistra</i>.  He could read that again and adopt many more other things in that famous Encyclical to such an extent that he and his colleagues would have greater encouragement in intervention in the establishment of industries, in the promotion of the economy generally, so that Irish men and women can find good and useful employment.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Finance if he has any reason to review his estimate of the revenue he expects to get from the turnover tax.  This figure of £10½ million was mentioned in the Budget speech and has been referred to throughout the debate, but we have never had a breakdown of the figure; whether it is merely a simple 2½ per cent on the expenditure on consumer goods or not, I do not know. Last night, there was an amendment seeking that the turnover tax should be removed from certain items of food. We were informed by the Minister for Justice, speaking for the Minister for Finance, that if these items were exempt, the turnover tax would have to be 3½ per cent in order to bring in the £10½ million.  I wonder could we get a breakdown on the position&mdash;if bread were exempt or if butter or meat were exempt.  The Government are expressing their problem as a problem of £10½ million, but if the yield of the tax on bread were to be £1 million, the problem would only be £1 million and surely our ingenuity would not be taxed too much in finding ways of raising £1 million or £2 million to ensure that bread would not be taxed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be able to tell us what these essential foodstuffs would cost and what the loss in revenue would be, if they were exempt. There is no doubt&mdash;and it is no cliché&mdash;that a tax on these items is going to increase the poor person's expenses.  They eat more bread than the wealthier people.  The staple diet of the old age pensioner is tea, bread and butter and perhaps a rasher, sausage and egg.  Undoubtedly such people depend more on these items <Col N="1105" /> than the wealthier people do who have a wider variety of food available to them, even the people in the middle income group.  The compensation they are going to get by way of the extra 2/6 a week will not mean a great deal to them.  They will still have to pay&mdash; I know it will be an infinitesimal amount&mdash;of something amounting to a halfpenny on the 2/6.  If they are to live at all, especially those living at home, they must expend all of the 35/on the essentials of life, in this case, food.</P>
    <P>One matter to which I had not got the opportunity of referring last night was the tax on medicines, drugs and appliances, on prescription.  I do not think we should tax them.  The turnover tax is to be passed on and the public will have to pay.  We all agreed in this House in October, 1961, that these things are very costly for the middle income group and in the majority of cases, constitute the heaviest part of the burden when one becomes ill.  It must be recognised also that these drugs, which are very effective, are also extremely dear.  A doctor prescribes pills or medicines to be taken for three months and many of these small pills cost 1/- or 2/- each. Those people who have not a medical service card, or who do not come under any health scheme, find themselves crippled by these charges.  Now, under this Bill, they will have to pay another 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Last week an argument was made that it would be difficult to exempt them but I do not think it would.  In respect of other purposes, separate accounts must be kept but as far as prescriptions are concerned, there should be no trouble.  The prescriptions should be kept for the inspector who calls and it is not difficult to determine what sales should be exempted.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for many exemptions, in respect of all types of agricultural produce, moneylending, banking, insurance.  There are exemptions in respect of certain types of building materials.  Yet we cannot exempt medicines.  Even at this late stage could I appeal to the Minister or the Taoiseach to exempt medicines?  I presume the Taoiseach knows that medicines prescribed by veterinary officers <Col N="1106" /> for animals are to be exempt. Surely if we can exempt drugs and medicines for the treatment of animals, we can do so in regard to medicines for human beings.  People must have tea, bread, butter, sugar, to stay alive but if there is a danger of death through illness, surely it is unreasonable for any Minister to impose a two and a half per cent tax on the drugs and medicines that may help to save lives.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the debate today has taken an unusual turn.  What I am mainly concerned with in this Bill is the turnover tax.  We in the Labour Party are concerned primarily for the consumer who, we believe, will be called upon to pay at least two and a half per cent more for the commodities he buys.  This tax introduces a principle which I am sure will be perpetuated by future Fianna Fáil Governments.  We feel sure that since such a simple method of tax collection has been introduced, the amount will be increased to five per cent next year once the Minister sees such an easy way of getting money.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had to come here to vote some £4 million in subsidies for CIE, he would be telling a different story.  He is not having to do that&mdash;it is not included in the Bill this year.  I was about to deal with some of the things Deputy Dillon said. He has a way of repeating statements over and over again which has the effect of deceiving the people of this country and which gives a false impression of the economy.  He said once again that the adverse trade balance in 1962 was £105 million.  He likes to use big figures to give the impression that they have some importance for the community.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon knows perfectly well that from the figure of £105 million must be subtracted the invisible exports such as expenditure on tourism, receipts from foreign investments and other such receipts.  The Deputy knows perfectly well that in using the figure of £105 million, he is trying to give the impression to the public that there has been a startling change for the worse in our balance of payments situation. He knows perfectly well that is not true.  He knows we have had an almost unique record in the past five years, enabling us to balance our trade as between different years and that we have a far better record than he ever had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy Dillon talking so glibly about a £105 million adverse trade balance.  When he departed from office in 1951 he left us with an unmanageable balance of £61 million and when he left office for the last time in 1956 the major reason for the crisis for which his Government were responsible was another balance of payments crisis which was mishandled <Col N="1108" /> and not taken care of.  So the less we hear from Deputy Dillon about adverse trade balances the better.  Of course, he failed to mention that the external assets of the banks have been increasing, that they have gone up virtually ever since we took office after the Coalition left office, when Deputy Norton had to get up in this House and inform the public the available reserves of the community for the purchase of essential goods had so far deteriorated that the most drastic action would have to be taken in reducing imports, making materials for industry more expensive, inhibiting the economic growth of the country.  Again, I say the less we hear from those so-called experts the better.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to one of the points made by the Minister for Finance, that in this debate we ought to accept the general challenge on the question of the burden of taxation which the people have to face in maintaining Government and local government services.  It is very difficult for the average man to try to make any comparison in regard to what he has to pay in taxes and rates and what the people in other countries have to pay&mdash;the conditions vary from one country to another.</P>
    <P>It is only fair we should be asked to issue some reply to the challenge that comes from people who say: &ldquo;You are taxing the people too much, you are placing too heavy a burden on them, and this will have some effect on the costs of production.&rdquo;  The only way we know of comparing the burden of taxation between one country and another is a comparatively simple one which does not involve an avalanche of statistics.  It is to compare the total weight of taxation with the total production of the country and in that way we can make allowances for the country which is relatively less well off than others, for countries with small populations as compared with those with larger populations.  This is recognised internationally as a good method of comparison.  People who have been defending the interests of the less well off people or of the large companies do not complain about this method of <Col N="1109" /> comparison.  The Fine Gael Party have been complaining about the growth in the cost of Government since 1956.  They have been saying that the amount for current services has increased since 1957 by £56 millions.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any country where prosperity has grown and where that country has been able to take a very much lesser share of the national cake by reducing taxation.  What we have to measure is just how much we are taking from the national pool.  These figures have already been given but they do not seem to have been noticed. The Minister for Finance has mentioned them at various times.  On the conclusion of this debate, it is a good thing to repeat again that in 1956 which was a year of considerable crisis, of enormous unemployment and emigration, the total amount taken by the Government and the local authorities in that year when compared with the production of the country&mdash;goods and services&mdash;was just a shade under 23 per cent, 22.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am informed that this year, if the national income rises by the amount we expect, the total amount we shall take through taxation and the rates we now know will be levied will represent 23 per cent of the country's total value of production and services.  There has been virtually no change except that the country has grown very much more prosperous since the dark days of 1956.  There is more expenditure and more consumption and, as a result, it is possible to find money for the many purposes for which we require it and which have been elaborated over and over again by Ministers during the course of Estimate speeches and by the Minister for Finance in the course of his Budget speech.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have not seen any country which has been able to do without the money that comes from increasing prosperity.  We need not go into it in detail: let us just say that this figure is just under a quarter of the value of the total production and services of the country.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking of the amount taken of the total production of the country in tax and was trying to make some comparisons with other countries.  It is a curious fact that this figure of roughly one-quarter does not seem to alter very much from one country to another.  It is a little bit more in Northern European countries, a little bit less in the Southern European countries, but we are at least in good company.  We can say that the amount taken in taxation and rates in this year and the amount taken next year when the sales tax is fully operative&mdash;again, if the national income expands, as we hope it will expand&mdash;represents the amount taken by other countries in search of better social services, in trying to find money for better education and in investing money in various products for their State's advantage.  There is nothing exceptional in the total burden of tax and of rates levied in this way.</P>
      <P>I am aware that you cannot make absolute comparisons between one country and another.  However, it is a fair enough comparison.  If you look at the history of those countries you will find that countries far more developed than we are, with a long history of independence and privilege in that regard and who have raw materials which we lack, have not found it possible to dispense with the proceeds of taxation and although their national incomes are very advanced indeed they still go on taking something over one-quarter of the value of the people's production and services for their essential social services and other State requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wanted to mention this because the implication has been made that this is a very heavy burden on the community, but of course every increase in taxation in any form is felt by the community.  However, I want to make quite clear to the House and to the people that there is nothing exceptional in the imposition of this tax when it is related to all the other taxes we levy <Col N="1111" /> and to the value of the production of the people of this country and the services rendered known as the gross national product.  I can say that without any fear of contradiction from anybody because the figures can be examined and studied and those are the facts as I have given them.</P>
    <P>Throughout this long debate we have waited for some genius in the Opposition to explain to the House what they propose to do when the taxes on liquor, tobacco and petrol no longer truly reflect the growth of consumption of the Irish people, when they no longer make it possible for money to be found for all the essential purposes that have been described in the course of this debate.  Nobody has really suggested any alternative to this sales tax.  Nobody has given us any kind of indication as to why, in our special circumstances, we should be virtually the only country in Europe without a tax on ordinary current consumers' expenditure of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Nobody has suggested how we can replace the sales tax with any other form of taxation.  Some Deputies have suggested that there might be higher income tax or that more taxes might be placed on industry.  At the same time, it has been made quite clear to us that we dare not go beyond the present limits of corporation profits tax which have already been criticised by the Opposition and that therefore we cannot have recourse to that kind of taxation to find the money we need.</P>
    <P>We know that the Irish people spent on consumer's expenditure, nearly £40 million more in 1962 than they spent in 1961&mdash;a very considerable increase.  We know that that has virtually nothing to do with the increase in the cost of living because the increase in the cost of living was so small as to have little effect on the gross increase.  We felt, therefore, that there was an opportunity for proposing a form of taxation which is universal in Europe and which has certain satisfactory features&mdash;and the satisfactory features have already been fully illustrated by various speakers.  I should like to repeat them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> We believe the people want the programme of social and economic expansion to continue.  We believe the turnover tax in future will reflect accurately the growth of the national wealth.  If people save more as between one year and another and if they save in the right kind of way, it will be possible for us to make use of their savings for capital expenditure. On the other hand, if they spend money, the turnover tax will accurately reflect the increase in the spending and again will enable money to be found for national social and economic development.  As already indicated by the Taoiseach, this tax enables a redistribution of the profits of the community at large through their expenditure to be effected.  It is possible to find out how much can be given to increased social services each year by relation to the collection of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>As already indicated, the increases in social welfare benefits which will come into operation when the tax commences are in fact more than what is actually required to meet the effects of the turnover tax on the cost of living for those with lower incomes who face hazardous circumstances of life.  That has been made absolutely clear.  Yet we hardly heard any speaker go into detail in regard to that.  We heard airy statements that the increases are not nearly enough, but nobody has given us any specific information to prove that.  We claim very definitely that these social welfare benefits are part of a long series of increases that have taken place under Fianna Fáil down through the years, which show that we have a policy of redistributing a proportion of the nation's surplus each year.  I might add that if one looks back on the last ten years it will be found that virtually all the increases in social services that have been given have been given by the Fianna Fáil Government. The list of those provided by the Coalition Governments is very small indeed.  The greater share has been given by us.  Particularly in the case of necessitous persons with families, the increases have been very much greater than the increases in the <Col N="1113" /> cost of living.  For example, anybody who examines what a widow receiving a non-contributory pension with three to five children receives now compared with 1943, will see there has been a very remarkable increase&mdash;nearly double the increase in the cost of living. That does not mean the social services are adequate yet.  We are always trying to increase them.  They have steadily gone up, and I hope they will in the future.</P>
    <P>Again, at the conclusion of the debate we might challenge someone to suggest some way by which the essential items of increased expenditure can be eliminated.  We have heard vague suggestions of extravagance in this or that Department.  We have had questions asked by Opposition Deputies to try and bring out some elements of extravagance.  But if we add all the alleged extravagances together, we find they would not come to £500,000 and would not solve the problem at all.  It is obvious from the speeches of Opposition Deputies that they recognise that.  In regard to the main increases under social welfare, agriculture, education, industry and commerce, which form the bulk of the requirements for the extra money, we have not yet received from the Opposition any definite suggestions either to reduce the expenditure or of finding the money in some other way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon advocated four different methods by which the money could be found, but I have never heard them described by him in detail.  If the Opposition are to discuss in a constructive way this very serious decision on our part to institute a new form of taxation, which is already in operation in most other European countries, they should treat the matter with more intelligence and detail.  It would have been most interesting and constructive if we could have had a debate on the value of a sales tax in comparison with increase of taxation on all the list of taxes we have at present.  But I would not expect very much from the Fine Gael Party, because their reputation for financial acumen has not been very great since the second World War.</P>
    <P>If we examine what happened between 1954 and 1956 and all the <Col N="1114" /> warnings given to them by us from 1951 to 1954, and if we examine the promises they made at that time as to what they would do if returned to office, we find they had an obsession in regard to taxation and living costs and when they tried to get rid of their obsession on being restored to office, they were not able to do anything about it.  All through this debate, I am constantly reminded of the major propaganda campaign of Fine Gael in 1954.  There were thousands of leaflets distributed throughout the country and hundreds of speeches made in which they promised specifically to reduce the prices of all the commodities that had gone up in the previous three years and promised to bring down all taxes.  They made that the major point of their campaign.  It was a campaign which promised to make things easier for the people, but when they got into office the cost of living rose, none of the taxes were reduced and none of the commodities were reduced in price.  It was the most silly, superficial election campaign ever run in the history of the country.  Looking back on it, I much prefer the earlier type of election campaign when we were at least discussing fundamental issues on which we sincerely disagreed.  The campaign of 1954 is a perfect illustration of the superficial attitude of Fine Gael towards matters such as taxation and the cost of living.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy Dillon speak about the increase in the course of this debate.  If Deputy Dillon looks at the whole increase in the cost of living from 1954 to 1963, he will find there was an increase during the three years the Coalition Government were in office and that the increase since then, worked out per year, has been very little different&mdash;just a shade higher than it was during his three years of office.  Deputy Dillon knows very well that increases in the cost of living relate in many ways to what is going on outside us.  If we look at the increases in the cost of living in the countries of Europe since 1957, we find that the increase that has taken place here is nothing remarkable.  It does not <Col N="1115" /> indicate a lack of attention by the Government to the problem of inflation.</P>
      <P>We want to make sure we can increase productivity in industry and agriculture here.  The increase in the cost of living is something that compares favourably with increases in the countries with whom we have to trade. The reputation of the Fine Gael Party for predicting reductions in the cost of living and taxation is so poor, that I think the less we hear from them on that subject the better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish said that when we used as propaganda the statement about putting husbands back to work, it was a lie, that we did not do so. The Deputy seems to have forgotten the appalling unemployment there was at the beginning of 1957 when some 97,000 people were out of work.  He seems to have forgotten the growth of employment that has taken place in industry since then, the growth in the national income and the real living standards of our people.  He seems to have forgotten that actual agricultural income per person went down during the three years of Coalition Government and has gone up by about one-third since then, not quite as much as industrial income.  There was very serious unemployment and mass emigration from Dublin city in particular where we used that propaganda, during the Coalition Government's term of office.  He seems to have forgotten the great change that has taken place since; that there were a great many Dublin Corporation flats vacant in the two years following the Coalition Government as a result of their mishandling of affairs and the great change that has taken place in that respect.  There is a new and tremendous demand for housing accommodation in Dublin, quite apart from the unsafe buildings, a demand from an expanding community, expanding in economic growth since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard so often from Deputy Dillon about the 100,000 jobs but no member of Fine Gael has yet had the decency or honesty in making that statement to give credence or respect to a statement made with <Col N="1116" /> tremendous publicity by the Taoiseach four months before the general election that the previous calculations made by the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to what could be done with the given amount of capital and the blueprint made for finding 100,000 jobs would require drastic revision; that it was not to be taken as valid because the country's financial position was deteriorating so rapidly that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office, they would have to make a fresh appraisal of the position.</P>

      <P>That speech of the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, was published as a special supplement of the <i>Irish Press</i> in October, 1956.  Yet, we have been plagued with this deceptive propaganda from Fine Gael ever since about the 100,000 new jobs as though, having written and designed the blueprint to show how the nation could advance, much of which still remains valid, we never took steps to warn the country of the results of the three years of Coalition mishandling and never warned them that we would have to re-examine the position when we took office.  However, we can take it that one of the features of Fine Gael propaganda is endless repetition of the same alleged facts for some rather obscure political purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the need for better educational facilities.  He had better look at the bill of the Department of Education and the cost of education during the Coalition Government.  It has gone up from about £13 million to more than £20 million, nearly double.  Apparently, he was not paying much attention to education then.  He spoke of the need for assisting farmers but we are spending two to three times what was spent by the Coalition in their last year of office on agriculture and its aids.  We wait in vain for someone to criticise the main features of the agricultural programme in the Programme For Economic Expansion. We hear complaints and lamentations from Fine Gael but no real criticism of the main features of the programme.  The only proposal I have heard from Deputy Dillon in the <Col N="1117" /> past two years was the proposal for an extension of credit facilities for farmers and an increase in the number of farm advisers.  His Party were in office at the end of the war and again at another period and never even thought of tackling one great problem of finding a marketing system for our milk and pig products.  It was left to us to do rather late in the day and we had to make some effort to establish marketing boards for milk and pig products.  There was no mention of it in the Coalition time.</P>

Under this Government the tax will be used wisely for the regeneration of the national economy.

      <P>One of the major successful results of the Programme for Economic Expansion is that there was practically no criticism in detail of it at any time by the Opposition. The major features of it were accepted and we could say to would-be investors in industry from abroad: &ldquo;Here is a programme which sets out how we believe the nation should advance, how it is proposed to allocate money.  You may take it no matter how ferocious the debates may be in the Dáil it is a document representing the opinions of the vast majority of the people since there has been no effort by any Party to criticise it as a whole.  On occasions, on Estimates, they may have criticised one or other point but they have not questioned the validity of the document or suggested it was not the right approach to the national economy.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> We are now about to publish a <i>Second Programme For Economic Expansion</i> in which our hopes for the next five years will be fully elucidated in every field of national endeavour. Perhaps we could get more constructive criticism from the Opposition on this occasion and be able to say once more that the programme is generally accepted because nobody in the Opposition has tried to tear it to pieces or deny its general validity. If we can do that, perhaps we can look forward to the turnover tax and the national capital which the State finds each year being used to good purpose in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is remarkable not only because it has been used to depart from the generally accepted procedure of discussing on the Fifth Stage of a Bill the actual contents of the Bill but also because it is being used by the Taoiseach to distract, by the introduction of extraneous matter, the people from the actual effect which the Finance Bill will have on the economy of the country and on the economic and social life of the community. I want to emphasise that there is so far as we are concerned and, I believe, so far as other Deputies in the House are concerned, no disagreement between ourselves and the Fianna Fáil Party on the aims.  Where we differ is on the methods to achieve those aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is general acceptance of the objectives of stimulating a high rate of national development, of producing by Government intervention and action economic growth and expansion, of aiming at a high level of employment, improved living standards, reducing emigration and maintaining a reasonable balance both in trade and in our balance of payments.  All these objectives are subscribed to and accepted by Deputies in every part of the House.  Where we differ is on how to achieve these objectives and, in particular, on the failure of Fianna Fáil to implement in practice the promises that were held out during the last election campaign.  During the earlier discussions on this measure references were made to the policies <Col N="1119" /> and statements which the Taoiseach made when in opposition.  It is not sufficient for him to say that the Opposition are against raising the money to pay for the proposed expenditure because we have expressed our willingness to provide whatever money is necessary for the essential services for the running of the State and for the provision of social welfare, health and other necessary public expenditure.</P>
    <P>We differ from the Government on the proposed turnover tax.  One of the reasons we advance against this tax is that it will nullify to a very considerable extent the views expressed by the Government when they introduced earlier this year what has been known as the pay pause White Paper, and we believe that if price stability is to be achieved, it cannot be achieved, on the one hand, by giving some increase in social services and, on the other hand, substantially increasing the cost of living by direct Government action and intervention.</P>
    <P>That view is not peculiar to this side of the House.  I want again to quote what the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, said in 1956 when he spoke in the Dáil during the Budget debates of that year, as reported at column 621, Volume 157, of the Official Report of the 17th May, 1956:</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that most people who have written upon the theory of public finance subscribe to the view that it is desirable that the number of separate taxes should be kept as few as possible, that the State should rely for the bulk of its revenue on a few main taxes and should not try to multiply the number of separate taxes.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious reason for that.  It is undesirable that the hand of the tax-gatherer should be brought into business.  The number of businesses subject to the regulation which is necessarily involved in the collection of taxes should be kept to a minimum.  Government intervention for tax-raising purposes in any business always results in waste and <Col N="1120" /> is the cause of higher costs as well as of higher prices.</P>
    <P>That was the Taoiseach's view when in opposition.  It was a view that was reinforced by the booklet <i>Economic Development</i> which was published with the approval of this Government in 1958.  When the Commission on Income Taxation considered this matter, they recommended by a bare majority a purchase tax but that purchase tax was to be in substitution for, and not in addition to, the existing rates of tax. In a minority report, indeed a very pertinent report, which was signed by Professor Meenan, he expressed the view that if a tax of this sort were once introduced, it would be merely the thin end of the wedge and that ultimately it would not be in substitution for the existing rates of tax but would become additional to them.</P>
    <P>There can be legitimate ground for different views on different types of taxes but where there is no legitimate ground for different opinions is on the application of this tax as applied to four specific types of commodities, food, clothing, fuel and medicines and two out of those four are more compelling than the rest, namely, food and medicines.  I believe the effect of this tax will be to raise further the cost of living, and remember that the emphasis in Government statements and in the various comments that have been made by columnists and others has been on the fact that we should aim at price stability.  Nobody will disagree with that view.  It is a generally accepted aim and objective.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here in recent years by the Taoiseach that he thought we had reached a situation in which prices had levelled out.  I have been looking at the figures and they show that consumer prices which were reasonably stable between 1958 and 1960 rose on an average by 4.3 per cent between 1961 and 1962, compared with 2.8 per cent between 1960 and 1961. Subsequently, the consumer price index indicated a further rise in 1962 and a further rise up to the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>The need for price stability has not merely been emphasised by those who have considered the matter in this <Col N="1121" /> country but has also been referred to by the Organisation for European Co-operation and Development, which published a report in 1961 after the question had been examined by a group of economists.  It is entitled <i>The Problem of Rising Prices</i>.  The report said:</P>
    <P>By having a wages policy, we mean, first of all, that the authorities themselves must have a reasonably precise view, estimated by the best means which they can devise, of the average increase in wages that is appropriate to the economic situation and consistent with stability of the price level.  This view will necessarily depend primarily on experience and expectations regarding the longer-run rate of productivity increase in the economy.  But it may also have to take into account various aspects of the current economic situation, such as the phase of the trade cycle and the state of the balance of payments.  Having such a view, getting it known by the interested parties and mobilising support for it as an objective towards which to work, is the essence of having a wages policy.</P>
    <P>The report went on to address itself to circumstances which are applicable to this country as well as to the other member countries of the OECD.  Last year, the National Employer-Labour Conference which met and established a sub-committee to consider the matter expressed the view that:</P>
    <P>... the central objective of economic policy should be the attainment of the highest possible rate of economic expansion consistent with reasonable price stability and without seriously disturbing equilibrium in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>The effect of this turnover tax will be to raise the cost of living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been asserted by Government spokesmen that the increase in the cost of living will be compensated for by the rise in the social welfare benefits.  That is all right, but the social welfare benefits <Col N="1122" /> cover a very limited category in the community.  They apply in full only to the limited number of recipients who are entitled to the maximum benefits, persons with large young families.  There are others outside the social welfare section who will be affected by it.  I have in mind the case of a retired person living on a pension, or a pension and a small income from investments accumulated as a result of past exertions.  Many such people derive no direct benefit from the social welfare schemes.  They are outside the scope of the schemes because of their income or because of their age.  They are also excluded from participating in the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  There are very many people who will be affected by the rise in the cost of living and who will not get any off-setting compensatory benefit.</P>
      <P>Is it not a fact&mdash;has it not been demonstrated by experience here as well as in other countries&mdash;that what the Taoiseach said in 1956 is correct, that once the State intervenes, once the State directly participates in tax gathering, or the operation of a tax of this sort, it becomes more expensive? On the one hand, you have through the shopkeepers or traders, or directly through the Revenue Commissioners, State action and State interference to raise money, and on the other hand, the State pays some limited increase to the recipients of social benefits, but in the long run, the result is that there is first of all, a rise on the cost of living followed by a demand for wage and salary adjustments.  Instead of price stability, instead of the objectives of the pay pause, or the paper entitled <i>Closing the Gap</i>, there will be all round demands for wage and salary adjustments, and in the long run, the economy will be faced with a vicious circle of rises in the cost of living followed by rises in wages and salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly so long as wages and salaries keep pace with the cost of living, it is reasonably satisfactory for those who benefit by it, but what about the weaker sections, the retired pensioners, those who are unable to benefit?  Unless we consider the small <Col N="1123" /> shopkeeper, the small trader, and the self-employed person, who are unable to compensate themselves for the rise in the cost of living, they are the people who will suffer the adverse effects of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>I believe there is general agreement on the aims of providing better social welfare benefits and a general redistribution of the national income, but how will that work in practice?  The recipients of social welfare benefits are not the only categories in the State looking for help or assistance from the State.  I am considering in particular the case of those who are looking for houses.  I want to compare the record of this Government with the record of the previous Government on the building of houses, not merely in Dublin but in the country as a whole. I have here the figures given in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> published recently. They show that the number of houses erected by local authorities in 1956 was 4,000 and in 1961, it was 1,400. There was a slight improvement last year but the figures are not yet available. The number of dwellings erected with the aid of State grants under the Housing Acts in 1956 was 5,300. In 1961, it was 3,895.  In 1956/57, Dublin Corporation built 1,564 houses. In 1960/61, the figure was 277.  Again there was an improvement last year.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked about social aims and objectives.  One of the most pressing needs in this country is not merely to deal with the backlog of bad housing conditions from historical causes, but to keep pace with the demand for new houses and better accommodation for those who marry and have families, or those whose family circumstances alter and who require bigger and better accommodation. If we take that aspect of Government policy over the past six years, we find that they are not building as many houses as were being built in 1956/57. There was considerable criticism then that we were not doing better and that we were not building or reconstructing as many houses as were necessary, but at any rate we were proceeding in the right direction.</P>
    <P>If we take employment, we find from <Col N="1124" /> the figures published in <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued prior to the Budget this year that in 1956 there was a total of 1,127,000 in employment.  In 1962, the figure was 1,068,000, a drop of 58,000, not to mention the numbers who have emigrated in the interval.</P>
    <P>Everybody subscribes to the view that State intervention should be undertaken in order to provide employment and to supplement, or assist, where private enterprise is unable or unwilling to provide the necessary remedy. In that regard, it is essential that we should examine carefully what has been done.  It is necessary to have regard not merely to the employment provided but also to examine critically whether value is secured for the State expenditure involved.  In this it is, I believe, possible to take an objective view because all Parties have been responsible for and directly concerned in the State expenditure involved.  It is equally important to recognise that political considerations sometimes operate as reasons for the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>I have taken a note of a number of State projects undertaken either directly by the State or partly by public or individual financial investment and partly by State investment.  If we examine the expenditure incurred and compare the projects initiated over the past five or six years and the return on the money invested, we will find, I believe, that a very considerable proportion of the expenditure incurred has been both unproductive and unsound. In that regard, I noted recently that the monthly review on banking issued by the Standing Committee of the Banks commented on the fact that the forces pushing up expenditure were irresistible, expressed the view that money had to be found, and the turnover tax was the answer.</P>
    <P>It is easy to speak of forces being irresistible if there is no regard to the particular purposes on which the money is spent and equally easy to speak in facile fashion about the turnover tax when the persons concerned are themselves excluded from it. Banking is excepted and one has, therefore, to dismiss to a considerable <Col N="1125" /> extent the views expressed by some anonymous writer in that article.  It is all right to apply it to the other person; as long as it does not apply to me, there is nothing wrong with it.  If we examine the money that has been invested, we find some rather interesting results.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not seek to avoid the commitments into which we entered in respect of Avoca, but during our period the investment was by the Canadian interests involved.  Subsequently we approved the Government proposal to continue expenditure there in order to explore and exploit to the fullest possible extent any prospects that existed.  If, however, we take Avoca, the Dundalk Engineering Works, Verolme, all these and others, they can be considered in the light of the volume of public investment involved and the comparable employment and economic prospects held out. It will be possible at a later stage to discuss in greater detail the Verolme situation, and it is unnecessary, therefore, to go into it now.</P>
    <P>I believe we have got to examine far more critically than in the past the huge national expenditures that have taken place.  If huge national expenditure is undertaken without adequate examination of the prospects, without an adequate assurance that a market will be found for the goods or commodities produced, without a full disclosure of all the facts behind the project, without a full examination of the various factors involved, and full information on the capacity, the skill and the competence of those directly concerned, it is obvious that the forces which are described as &ldquo;irresistible&rdquo; will continue.  If, on the other hand, public expenditure is investigated critically initially, there will be fewer occasions on which the Dáil will be asked to vote Supplementary Estimates or come to the rescue of particular undertakings or investments.</P>
    <P>Investment by the State should be justified by sound reasons based on as full and accurate an assessment as can be made.  The greatest tendency here has been to start an undertaking with State aid, either full State capital, or partial State capital and private investment, <Col N="1126" /> and, if that undertaking subsequently gets into difficulties, to invest further State moneys in order to rescue it or continue it in operation because of the employment content. Public capital investment is then increased in an effort to salvage or maintain the undertaking.  These considerations naturally force up public expenditure, described, as I have said, by some writers as &ldquo;irresistible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe that in future we must ask ourselves if these investments are justified. Is it not often the fact that because of the employment content and because of political considerations &mdash;this applies equally once an undertaking has started &mdash; a very grave decision lies with either the Government or the Dáil and the fact is that the situation may be such that neither the Government nor the Dáil can withdraw because of the large numbers employed.  It behoves us, therefore, to examine in a more critical fashion State investment and State participation before embarking on what in a number of cases in recent years have proved to be undertakings of which there was no proper or adequate consideration.</P>
    <P>We should consider in future whether State investment in other spheres of activity would not give a greater return and a better response.  I have in mind such things as housing, drainage, afforestation and, above all, education. I should like to give now the comparable figures for State investment in education to show how little is being done not only over the past few years but over the past 30 years.  I find that the sum provided for education purposes in 1930-31 was £4,697,000, or 21 per cent of the total Supply Estimates. Thirty years later, in 1961-62, the total amount for education was £19,500,000, or 13.4 per cent of the total Supply Estimates.  As a percentage of national expenditure, we have not, therefore, even kept pace with what was being spent 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that a great deal of State expenditure in other spheres increased very substantially in the intervening period.  State investment and State expenditure in other branches trade liberalisation to 90 per cent, <Col N="1127" /> increased greatly but the fact is we are not keeping pace with&mdash;not to mention improving on&mdash;the expenditure.  Undoubtedly the actual rate of expenditure has increased but compared with the total Supply Estimates expenditure, the proportion spent on education is lower now than it was 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words on the effects of the turnover tax on our competitive position in international trade. One of the effects of the turnover tax will be to raise still further the cost of production and to impair the competitiveness of Irish industry.  It is true to say that the comparatively rapid growth of industrial development in some recent years was due to a temporary improvement in the home demands as well as in an improvement in certain cases on the export market. Now, however, conditions have altered very considerably.  Costs of production have increased, export demands have dropped and our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> our trade with Britain and with continental countries has altered very considerably.</P>
    <P>I want to ask what action do we propose to take on the adverse trade balance which exists between this country and the continental countries with which we have trade agreements. By and large, the pattern of trade between this country and the continental countries, either the Six or the other European countries with which we have agreements, is that the total trade between ourselves and these countries means that we buy approximately £40 million worth of goods each year from them and they buy approximately £10 million worth from us.  So far as the trade with Britain is concerned, on a two-way basis, it amounts to £250 million a year.  That by any standard is a sizeable sum.  So far as our trade with others is concerned, we have had a heavier trade balance over a great many years.</P>
    <P>These trade agreements were negotiated many years ago.  Some of them have been continued on an annual basis or altered in numerous ways since then, but we have had this experience in the OEEC, and now in the OECD, that we implemented in practice as well as in theory <Col N="1128" /> as far back as 1956, and even before it, we initialled the OEEC recommendation and protocol on trade liberalisation and we implemented that not merely in theory but in practice. However, we found&mdash;and we have found since&mdash;that some of the countries with which we have trade agreements and who in theory subscribe to trade liberalisation under the OEEC auspices took administrative or other action to defeat the objectives of these measures and failed to reciprocate the trade agreements which were made.  Notable was our lamb trade with France and our butter trade with Western Germany.</P>
    <P>On two occasions at least, we had to make representations in order to get these discriminatory measures modified. We now find the whole pattern of trade is both obscure and uncertain. It is obscure because we cannot see what the future pattern is going to be as a result of the failure of the Brussels negotiations, and uncertain because as far as one can see the Government have decided to remove, unilaterally, tariff and quota protection without any reciprocal advantages from these countries with which we trade.</P>
    <P>I want to question the wisdom economically and politically&mdash;no matter from what angle we consider the prospect of European economic development in the future&mdash;of this country unilaterally reducing tariffs without some <i>quid pro quo</i> in return.  As far as we know, there is no immediate prospect of this country becoming a member of the European Economic Community, no immediate prospect of any bilateral or multilateral trading arrangement which will compensate us for any decisions we may take to reduce tariff or quota protection.  Here we have available a mechanism built up over a number of years which provides employment for a great number of our people and a great lot of emphasis has been laid on public expenditure and effort by different Governments to promote economic and industrial development by State action and assistance, not merely by State investment through capital or other facilities but by State protection and assistance by means of tariffs.</P>
    <P>We have endeavoured to participate <Col N="1129" /> in the wider problems of a European Economic Community.  In the past, we have indicated our willingness to accept trade liberalisation and implemented it not merely in theory but in practice and we have seen other countries refusing to implement these undertakings in practice, but now we decide unilaterally to reduce tariffs this year by ten per cent and next January to go a further step of ten per cent without any <i>quid pro quo</i> in return.  I have no doubt a great many industrialists view this prospect with concern but more important is the concern which must be felt by many employees.</P>
    <P>In other countries, schemes have been introduced for the re-employment of labour, for retraining workers and for the diversification of employment of one sort or another and provision had been made in the Rome Treaty for certain facilities, financial or otherwise, to facilitate that arrangement.  But we are outside the terms of the Rome Treaty and outside its provisions which may be available, under the Social Fund, or otherwise, to provide these retraining and resettlement facilities and we, in those circumstances, decide to embark on these steps with the risk of serious damage being done to the position of employees, with no compensatory advantage being secured either by training arrangements or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I understand that one of the effects of the turnover tax will be to impair still further the competitiveness of Irish industry.  It will not merely raise the cost of living but also of production, and one of the problems Irish industrialists face is the position in which they will meet competitors with a far greater market, far bigger capital resources, far greater opportunities of trading as well as a far older industrial tradition.  In those circumstances, I question most strongly the decision to reduce tariff protection without any <i>quid pro quo</i> or any reciprocal advantages in return.</P>
    <P>The turnover tax will affect severely the wage and salary earners.  As I have said, it is easy for the quarterly bulletin of the banks to speak lightly of this matter because it does not affect banking.  It is easy to speak lightly of <Col N="1130" /> it because they are excluded, but it affects the vast bulk of the people, the wage and salary earners, who have to buy the ordinary necessities of life, bread, butter, tea, sugar, clothes, and who will also have to pay this tax for drugs and medicines.  I agree there is a very strong case for excluding medicines from the scope of this tax.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong in our sense of values&mdash;I can understand the administrative difficulties involved&mdash; when animal medicines are to avoid the tax because of arrangements under which agricultural purchases are excluded, while medicines for human consumption will fall within it.  Nowadays, the bulk of the medicines are preparations sold pre-packed by manufacturers and are far more costly than they ever were previously.  A notable development in medicines has been the rise in their cost.  Everyone recognises that people can avoid certain types of expenditure: a person may eat less expensive food, postpone for a while the buying of clothes or some other such necessary and essential commodity, but if people are sick, particularly from serious ilness, the purchase of medicine is inescapable. For that reason, I believe this tax will affect very considerably a number of persons who are not equipped financially to meet the extra bill.  I want to express the view that this matter should be recognised sympathetically by the Minister.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach opened the debate, he referred to the fact that so long as the Government had a majority, they proposed to implement the measure now before the House.  I find no fault with that view.  I know from experience that the Fianna Fáil Party will cling on as long as possible.  Indeed, I know of no other Party here or in any other democracy who have subordinated national considerations to Party purposes to the extent to which Fianna Fáil have done it and will do it.</P>

      <P>When you look at the record of the Democratic Party in America under Roosevelt, or the <Col N="1131" /> Liberal Party in Canada under MacKenzie King, both astute politicians who sometimes subordinated national considerations to Party advantage, you will find the parallel to some extent of the manner in which Fianna Fáil operate.  They have always endeavoured to identify Party as distinct from national interest in that operation, and, of course, it has the effect of being more compelling and more appealing when done in that way.  The fact that democracy and parliamentary institutions function here as they do is due in very large measure to our Party in the past.</P>
      <P>Indeed, in the years gone by, those who represented our Party can claim &mdash;I have no doubt history will accord the major share of the credit to them &mdash;not merely courage and determination but a selfless devotion to the interests of the Irish people which won the approval of all who witnessed their achievements and, indeed, the admiration and respect of their opponents in Ireland and elsewhere. It is only legitimate and right that we should discuss all the merits or otherwise of this question, that these discussions should be carried on as vigorously and strongly as possible.</P>
      <P>I have never had the same admiration for proportional representation as some of my colleagues, but it is the system we have at the moment and, so long as it operates to provide this country with a Government, we are entitled to operate it.  I believe the people would welcome an opportunity of expressing their views on the proposals enshrined in this measure.  I believe the present Government have no mandate, that they gave no indication&mdash;in fact, they gave the very contrary impression&mdash;to the electorate at the last general election that such action would be taken.  The present Taoiseach in 1956 expressed himself as strenuously opposed to the State intervening in the way he is now doing through this measure as a taxgatherer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He expressed that view, as set out in the report of the Budget debate in 1956.  There was no indication at the last general election, or in the report published by the Commission on Income Tax that this type of tax would <Col N="1132" /> be introduced.  It imposes for the first time a tax on a limitless range of commodities. It will operate in every home and on every individual.  No indication was given of its imminence beforehand. I submit that no fundamental economic or social change of that character should be introduced where the Government are not certain of their mandate and not certain of their authority.  The only election that has taken place since the general election has been the by-election in Dublin North-East.  In that by-election the people expressed emphatically their opposition to and repudiation of this tax.  I believe that when the opportunity offers, that repudiation will be emphasised clearly, indignantly and definitely by the electorate as a whole.</P>
    <P>On the Government and on the Government alone lies the responsibility for introducing this tax, contrary, in so far as people have had an opportunity of expressing a view, to the expressed views and opinions of the public as shown in the recent by-election, and contrary to the views of the elected representatives who believe this turnover tax is bad economically, bad socially, bad nationally&mdash;bad for this country from the point of view of the individual consumers and taxpayers, and bad for our trading position.  We seek, and will endeavour to secure at the earliest opportunity, a mandate from the country to withdraw this tax and to carry out a policy of economic and social development designed to raise the standard of living of the people of this country through improved economic and social opportunities, better housing, better health and educational services, and by raising for all our people an edifice through which they will procure improved economic and social conditions for their families.</P>

      <P>Roughly 100 years ago, an Irishman in England started an agitation to secure certain fundamental rights for the ordinary people.  One of these was the right of the citizens to assemble peacefully and to petition Parliament.  It was rather strange to listen this morning to the Taoiseach challenging that established principle and right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> In a way, the sentiment he voiced in connection with the organised objection to the proposed turnover tax was like a voice from the Tory benches of the British Parliament House in the early part of the last century, only phrased in modern Fianna Fáil terminology.  It just shows how far people can become removed from first principles and how Lord Action's axiom on the influence of power really does operate when he said that power is a corrupting influence and that all power corrupts.  I do not use the term &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; in its accepted sense in relation to the Taoiseach but it seems that the possession of power over a long period does develop in the minds of men who hold power an insidious belief in their own infallibility.  We had a demonstration of that here today.  A man of great acumen and great ability controverted what I believe and what most people accept to be fundamental democratic principles in his criticism of the agitation which has gone on outside this House against the proposed tax. To quote his own words, he referred to the improper pressures of outside groups.  &ldquo;Improper pressures&rdquo;&mdash; I do not know exactly what that is intended to connote.</P>
    <P>Speaking for myself as an Independent, I have had no representation of any kind from any outside groups in connection with this tax, good, bad or indifferent.  I have not been threatened or cajoled.  No attempt has been made to bribe me or to suggest that I should vote one way or another.  It has been left entirely to myself.  Therefore, I can claim I have examined this proposition coldly and from the point of view of the welfare of my constituents.  I have taken a line of opposition to it from the beginning and have continued consistently to do so and will to the end because I believe it to be a proposal which will mean a reduction in the living standards of the majority of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I believe that the turnover tax which is suggested at 2½ per cent will not in fact mean an increase in the cost of living of 2½ per cent but of much more than that.  Of all the different aspects of this tax and the possibilities that flow from the proposal, there is one <Col N="1134" /> which has not been touched upon at all and which appears to me to be the most dangerous of all and certainly appears to be an inevitable development. I refer to the probability&mdash;the certainty in the case of unscrupulous traders, and there are such people&mdash; of profiteering at the expense of the people.</P>
    <P>I think I read recently that the Tánaiste was talking at some meeting at which he said that the objection to putting the tax on at source&mdash;and by source, I take it is meant the manufacturing or distributing level or earlier&mdash;was that by the time the tax would become effective in the hands of the retailer it would be up to 3¼ per cent.  However, as I see this thing developing, of a certainty this tax will become, even from the moment of its initiation, something which will increase the cost of living from five to six per cent, and perhaps even more.</P>
    <P>I remember having an argument recently with one trader on this subject. He told me he would feel justified in putting it up ten per cent.  He obviously is one of the profiteering groups to which I have referred.  He is not alone.  Human nature being what it is, any trader reading the handbook circulated by the Minister and which purported to explain this most involved piece of legalistic machinery would feel he was given <i>carte blanche</i> to go ahead and charge what he liked.  He was explicitly told the Minister was not concerned about what items would be increased in price or what prices would be; that it was up to the trader to go ahead and &ldquo;get what you can so long as you give us 2½ per cent.&rdquo; Who will suffer except the person who always suffers?  Who will pay?</P>
    <P>Take the ordinary people, the people living near enough to hardships and difficulties, people such as the many thousands in Ballyfermot who are being forced to pay far too high differential rents out of meagre wages, who are being forced to pay exorbitant bus fares in order to keep relatively well-to-do farmers in a more or less politically happy condition and available for the Government at their call.  These people, with the workers throughout the county and the country generally, will be the <Col N="1135" /> sufferers because they will be at the mercy of the unscrupulous trader who will take full advantage of the Minister's suggestion in this matter.</P>
    <P>The principle of the tax is not one with which I find myself in great disagreement, were it enforced in the proper way.  The Minister and the members of the Government and others have been saying to the Opposition, in effect: &ldquo;What is your alternative, if you think this is wrong? What should we have done in order to get the money?&rdquo;  I would accept the principle of a tax of 2½ per cent being levied on goods at source, by which I mean at the distributing and manufacturing end, provided that food and medicines were excluded.  Surely it should be a fundamental principle with us that food should not be taxed under any circumstances, nor should medicines.</P>
    <P>These items are the very essentials of life&mdash;food for the maintenance of life and medicine for the relief of pain &mdash;and should be made as cheap as possible.  No deliberate step should be taken by any Government to increase them in price in the slightest.  It is socially and morally unjustified.  This tax will become a runaway tax in the sense that it will be completely ungoverned. I would have had no objection to it were it imposed on the manufacturer, had these things been excluded and had machinery been provided to ensure that the 2½ per cent would be tightly controlled and that there would be no possibility of profiteering by the distributor or the manufacturer.  But here we have unbridled licence being afforded to the traders.  That is a bad thing.  It is asking too much of human nature that people should simply seek the 2½ per cent and no more.  We know from experience they will go much further than that.  In order to keep their records, a number of firms could probably justify adding a half per cent or one per cent for expenses.  Of course, it will go a much greater distance than that and the tax may very well be disastrous.</P>
    <P>The question of inflation has been mentioned.  Of course, that is inevitable. <Col N="1136" /> This is an inflationary move.  It will provoke wage demands.  It is hardly to be expected that the working people, who carry this country, will take this lying down when they find that when the tax comes into operation, their wage packet is reduced.  I submit that a man in the city of Dublin with an average wage of from £10 to £11 per week will find his purchasing power reduced by almost 10/- a week.  It is not to be expected that Dublin trade unionists will grin and bear that, nor should they be expected to.  What little prosperity some sections may be enjoying today is long overdue.  It is a very marginal prosperity and one that should not be interfered with.  It is confined to a small section of the population.  The vast majority of the workers are still living more or less from hand to mouth.  They are facing very high rents.  This has provoked a great deal of opposition.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked about this tax as being essential for the improvement of social services.  That line of argument has always been followed by Governments seeking to obtain money. It has been my experience over a number of years in this House that when measures are brought in to obtain money, the excuse is given that we must improve the lot of the social welfare classes.  But what has been done for these people has been miserable.  It is something we have every reason to be ashamed of.  I have no doubt that the half-crown for the old age pensioner has become with Fianna Fáil &mdash; and I suppose with other sections of this House &mdash; the accepted standard.  No matter what amount of money will be obtained by this tax, it does not appear to me there has been any change in the attitude of the Government as far as their approach to the problem of the old-age pensioner is concerned.  I am not to be convinced that the proceeds of this fantastic operation &mdash; the extraction of this money from the pockets of the working people&mdash;is going to benefit the social welfare classes at all.</P>
    <P>I feel the Government have made a grave blunder in this.  It is obvious from what the Taoiseach has said <Col N="1137" /> that he intends to maintain power until defeat in the Dáil.  As a very experienced and able politician, he realises that if he went to the country now, the Government Party would come back in a very attenuated form. Whatever high idealism he may seek to attribute to himself and his Party in pursuing this line of maintaining power in such a marginal fashion, the people outside see it in an entirely different light, and indeed in its true light.  They feel the country is holding on in the hope of better times, in the knowledge that if they were to go to the country now, they might be out of power for many a long year.</P>

      <P>The final auction has started.  Already, surely a very high price in words has been paid for this Finance Bill.  But still the bidders are here, prepared to go further.  I heard some extraordinary statements this morning and last night.  Last night, we had Deputy Costello in terrible trouble over what was going to happen to all the foreigners going to come to this country.  He forgot until after he sat down that he should have talked about the natives.  This morning, we had Deputy Dillon defending the gombeen men once again and hoping once again to impress some of them. Later, we had Deputy Cosgrave in trouble over foreign trade&mdash;over the lamb trade with France.  He forgot to mention the new land trade with Egypt which one of his Senators has started. He did not say a word about that.  It is nice to see a new industry has now been started in Longford-Westmeath. Along with all the others imported, we now have one from Egypt to improve the situation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Corish held out at length about the housing situation here in Dublin.  They said there was a surplus of houses in 1956. If there is one house in a place and no person for it, there is a surplus of houses.  That was the position in 1956. If there were houses built in Dublin in 1956&mdash;I do not know whether they were or not&mdash;there were no houses built in my constituency during that period because they gave us no money.  As a member of Mayo County <Col N="1138" /> Council for a long number of years, I have good reason to know.  In December, 1956, the Government owed Mayo County Council practically £1 million.  If they had as much money to spend on houses as they want us to believe, it is surprising they did not think it worth their while to pay Mayo County Council the money to which they were entitled.  It was paid over immediately there was a change of Government in 1957.</P>
    <P>I admit there was a surplus of houses in Dublin in 1956 and 1957 because I saw the people running out of Dublin.  I saw 600 houses vacant in a small area.  The people had baled out and there is no use in trying to fool the people or fool ourselves.  I saw people going in the middle of the night.  They owed money to the corporation and had nothing to pay it with because they had no work.  That left a surplus of houses.</P>
    <P>I heard talk of the necessity to produce some sort of small coinage to meet the 2½ per cent on low-priced articles because there was not enough farthings in the country.  When these same shopkeepers were charging £5 for articles worth 30/- and 30/- for a lb. of tea and 30/- for a 2/- bicycle tyre and 10/- for a 2d. jar of vaseline they were able to get sufficient big coinage to make these deals but nobody here alluded to that.  They will get the small coinage as readily as they found the large coinage when they made their ill-gotten profits for which they are now afraid they will be brought to book and may have to pay over their ill-gotten gains to the Revenue Commissioners.  That is all that worries them and their defenders on my left.</P>
    <P>I am glad that I have lived to see the day in this country when the rich men are marching, not the poor.  That is certainly a big change when we see the gentlemen marching who defrauded the Revenue Commissioners for years. Today some of them make out they did not get the letters in time or there would have been more of them out. The &ldquo;wise guys&rdquo; kept out of it; they did not march but they sent out the crowd of fools who were daft enough <Col N="1139" /> to march for them.  Surely the ordinary citizen is only laughing at us.  When anybody here says the ordinary people are behind that march they must know that it is the Fine Gael branch members who are behind it.  That was the case in my constituency where my opponent went out last week and the week before when he thought he was going to bully me and Deputy Sherwin into causing a general election, even though there is nobody in Ireland more afraid of a general election than he is.</P>
    <P>Somebody sent me a postcard yesterday from Dundalk.  I presume it was sent down there from here to be posted. It says &ldquo;Dear Judas, how many pieces of silver did you get for voting the way you voted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I presume it did. I wonder who offered the pieces of silver?  It was the people organised by Fine Gael who offered me the motor cars and all the rest and I refused to have anything to do with them.  I never even discussed the matter with any member of Fianna Fáil or the Government. I have a completely clear conscience. The other gentlemen did offer me silver or money and all the cars I wanted for the election and gave me to understand that I was sure to head the poll.  But who belonging to me could live in the country in the future if it could be said that they bribed me and got away with it?  No man will bribe me or get me to change my mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was elected to represent my own constituency and I know what the position was there about 1956.  There was not an employed man, no industry or anything else.  The power station was gone and the Bord na Móna works. They wiped out the grassmeal factory. Deputy Dillon has already said it would be his first concern if he gets into office to close it down again.  The people of the area want that industry there and whether Deputy Dillon likes it or not, he is not going to move it or any other industry as he did before. He closed down the grassmeal company on a former occasion because a certain Deputy of his Party happened to be a director of a grassmeal company <Col N="1140" /> in the east of Ireland.  If that is untrue, one of his present Senators is wrong because he made that statement. He wants nothing for the west because he knows he could not possibly be elected in Mayo.  As they say about foxes, if they keep far enough from their den, they may get away with something.  Let him talk for the people of Monaghan if he wants to, but I am talking for the people of Mayo where his Party were given an answer already.</P>

      <P>Those who criticise the turnover tax have criticised every other tax, good or bad, because it was introduced by this Government.  They never introduce anything.  They have not the imagination to do it.  So long as you do nothing you cannot be criticised but if you do anything you stir up a hornet's nest.  Fianna Fáil are the only progressive Party in the State. In 1932, after years of native government, there was not a house in the country or anything else.  The only thing Fine Gael ever talk about is the Shannon Scheme and they would not have that only that they got the Germans to do it.  Any progress that has been made has been made when the Fianna Fáil Government was in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may fool ourselves but not the public: where is the alternative to the present Government?  If there were an election tomorrow, some of the Fine Gael Party would have heart failure. Deputy Sherwin and I would have some chance of forming a Government compared with the chance they would have.  If they said they would go into a Coalition, nobody would vote for them because they would be a coalition of two opposite policies. Surely Labour cannot follow Fine Gael because Fine Gael are the most conservative and reactionary Party in Europe, apart from the Unionists in the North. Even if they put up enough candidates to form a Government, they could form nothing and there would be no Government. They are too well known now.  I do not need to go into the prospects of the other Parties, the twins or triplets.  There is no Opposition Deputy with any alternative to <Col N="1141" /> the present tax.  They may say: &ldquo;We are not supposed to tell you what we would do but you are wrong.&rdquo;  How do we know we are wrong when there is nothing to compare?  If they have an alternative, they should mention it and that is the only way they could impress people.  Why not stand up and say what is right and maybe you would convince the people?</P>
    <P>My attitude is that I have to defend the rights of the people who elected me.  I would not be fair to the people who elected me if I took the side of the rich people, the gombeen men.  It is scandalous to see people defending a crowd of chancers and racketeers, purely and simply on the grounds that these people have made false returns and are afraid anybody will go back over their accounts.  It is not Section 48 of this Bill which is worrying them but the section in which the Revenue Commissioners have been given power to go back over three years.  If I had anything to do with it I would go back to the time they started, during the War years, when they made their profits, and make them repay their ill-gotten gains.  It is not £1 million the Government would get then but £6 million or £7 million.</P>
    <P>There is not an ordinary worker in this country who would not laugh to see that money being collected because I know poor workers up to their knees in the bogs who are earning £6 to £7 10s. a week and who have to pay income tax while rich people by making fake claims can get away with murder.  Some of the claims made by these people would run the furnaces of hell for a year not alone an ordinary business.  I know a case where an auditor from Northern Ireland was even brought into court to swear a public house was making a loss when, in fact, it was making a profit.  The judge did not believe that because being a publican himself he knew no publican was running his establishment at a loss for the benefit of the public.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies try to convince us they are anxious about the tax on medicine and food but they are interested only in the effect of these provisions on their pals because within <Col N="1142" /> the next 12 months the bottom will have fallen out of their bucket and these people will have to pay their fair share into the revenue.  As has happened in other countries, the Government that has introduced this measure will be on top.</P>
    <P>The ordinary people are not worried about this tax.  In my own constituency the people who have contacted me in this regard are all traders and many of these traders had hardly shoes on their feet in 1939.  The decent trader has no complaint because he has kept accounts and he has been honest.  Even Fine Gael's chief organiser in north Mayo defended me because he is a decent honest man, an unusual thing in that Party.  It was very hard to understand RGDATA going around saying shopkeepers were charging too low a price for their commodities, and pursuing a policy of price fixing.  How is it that in TODCO a tin of vim is advertised with 4d off and there is 3d off a bottle of sauce?  If these people can reduce prices by that amount, which is a lot more than two and a half per cent, and still make a profit, what percentage of profit must there be when the normal price is charged for such commodities?  There must be a colossal profit in goods in Ballaghaderreen when two articles of underwear could be sold for the price of one.  The same applies to places selling two bottles of stout for the price of one.  One would want to be making a huge profit on a bottle of stout in order to be able to do that.  This is a fiddle and it is time it was exposed.</P>
    <P>What has been going on here over the past three months is pure hypocrisy and the people who have been defending the big shots have no more interest in the ordinary workers in this country than I have in what is at the back of the moon.  This is the best tax that was ever introduced and nobody but the frauds will worry about it.  I can buy a pint in Belmullet for 1/4d. while in Dublin it is 1/10d.  Do I argue about it?  That is a lot more than two and a half per cent and in the Dublin house, you cannot drink it at all.  It is like sour buttermilk.</P>
    <P>I can justify my position before the people of my constituency.  I have the <Col N="1143" /> gumption to stand up amongst the people in my county to be elected.  I do not have to go to another county amongst an anti-Irish gang to be elected, and the man who will put me out of that constituency has not yet had the baptismal waters of the Catholic Church put on his head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the feeling against these financial proposals <Col N="1145" /> has been growing week by week.  It started in reverse to the usual procedure because of the deliberate misrepresentations of Fianna Fáil.  If in the beginning they had endeavoured to tell the truth&mdash;if the Minister had told the truth&mdash;the tax might perhaps have had some chance of being accepted for a while, but we had one Deputy saying the tax would be borne by the shopkeepers alone, we had another saying it would be met by the consumer and we had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands saying it would be put on luxuries only, things like fur coats; we had other Deputies saying the ordinary people would not have to pay it and, as part of a deliberate policy of duplicity by the Government, efforts were made to try to hide where the brunt of the tax would fall.</P>
      <P>At long last in this debate, it has been admitted by the Minister that it will fall where we always knew it would fall, on the backs of the consumers. It was inevitable that if it was brought in&mdash;in an expenditure in the current year of just under £63 million &mdash;it would fall on the backs of the public.  It was so constructed that it would have the effect not of promoting the economic growth about which the Taoiseach spoke this morning, but of retarding that growth, preventing expansion, increasing the cost of living, increasing the cost of an already high cost economy, affecting our competitiveness in the export market, worsening our already precarious position in relation to the balance of trade, and generally turning the whole economy into exactly the reverse direction from the direction about which we heard this morning from the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the attitude adopted by the Government has had the effect of shaking the confidence of the country&mdash;not of shaking their confidence in the Government because that confidence was &ldquo;shook&rdquo; long ago&mdash;in economic growth for the future.  It is believed by those who have given thought to our future problems that this Budget and these financial proposals are not a firm or sound basis upon which that growth can be built.  We all know they are not <Col N="1146" /> a popular basis.  That is obvious.  It is clear beyond question that the people regard the Minister's Budget proposals as being the nearest thing to the proposals of the devil as could be imagined.  Apart from that, the long-term view is and must inevitably be that these measures which we are discussing will not promote economic growth.</P>
    <P>There are apparently no arguments the Taoiseach or any other member of the Government can adduce in relation to the display of popular feeling except that anyone who does not agree with him is automatically anti-national and automatically looking for a bloody nose.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the architectural sketch plans submitted by the Cork Health Authority to my Department last February, and the consulting engineer's proposals for the heating and other ancillary services received from the Health Authority this month.</P>
      <P>As the contribution from the Exchequer is limited to 50 per cent of the annual loan charges on approved capital outlay subject to an upper cost limit, the estimated cost of the proposed scheme is a matter of considerable significance.  For the proper examination of the architectural proposals, therefore, it was necessary to obtain from the Health Authority a break-down of the estimate of building cost furnished by their quantity surveyor in February.  This was asked for in March last and was received from the Health Authority last month, and the sketch plans have since been under examination in the light of the quantity surveyor's costings.</P>
      <P>There is no justification, therefore, for alleging undue delay on the part of my Department.

      <P>At the request of the health authority, arrangements for the filling of the permanent post of district medical officer at Tarbert, County Kerry, which became vacant in August, 1961, were deferred.  In October, 1962 the health authority submitted to my Department proposals for the reorganisation of the local dispensary areas which would involve abolition of the Tarbert dispensary district.  These proposals were not considered feasible and, accordingly, the filling of the Tarbert vacancy was referred to the Local Appointments Commission which, it is expected, will shortly recommend a candidate for appointment to the post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question refers to the No. 1 Area of Brosna dispensary district, County Kerry.  I am aware that the district medical officer for this area had been residing outside the area, i.e. at Abbeyfeale, County Limerick, since his appointment in 1945.  Abbeyfeale is within a mile of the boundary of the area.</P>
      <P>As a result of a question put down by the Deputy in 1949, the matter was taken up with the Health Authority. The information furnished by the Health Authority showed that no suitable residence was available within the dispensary district and that the Health Authority was satisfied that the service provided for the district by the district medical officer was satisfactory notwithstanding that he resided in Abbeyfeale. From time to time efforts were made by the Health Authority to obtain a suitable residence within the dispensary district but these efforts proved unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>I might mention that the permanent post is now vacant and that steps are being taken by the Local Appointments Commissioners to fill it.  When the new appointment is being made, I will examine the question of the proposed place of residence of the new appointee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputies have in mind an article which appeared in the current issue of the Journal of the Irish Medical <Col N="1152" /> Association.  If that is so, the Deputies paraphrase is incorrect.</P>
      <P>The article related to the death of five, not six, of eight patients admitted to hospital.  On admission, they were found to be suffering from a condition known as &ldquo;accidental hypothermia&rdquo;. It is a tendentious gloss on the information contained in the article, and conveys an entirely misleading impression, to say, as the Deputies have said in the question, that they &ldquo;died of cold&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Artificial hypothermia&rdquo;, I am advised, is a condition associated with faulty metabolism which, in turn, interferes with the right maintenance of body temperature.  Further the condition is not necessarily, as is implied by the Deputies, associated with either poverty or neglect.  Inquiries which I have made into the circumstances of the five patients who died indicate that in four of the cases the patients entered the hospital directly from homes where they had resided with, and been cared for, by married members of their own families.  None had applied for home assistance as might be expected if poverty were a factor in their illness.</P>
      <P>If, therefore, the question is based on the facts contained in the article to which I have referred, I feel that I should utter an emphatic protest against this attempt on the part of the two deputies concerned to distort the picture.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I think that the authors of the article, the two young doctors concerned, are to be congratulated on writing up these cases, thereby adding to the limited knowledge available regarding this condition.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked:</P>
      <P>the quantity of potatoes indicated to him as lying on farmers' hands in the district normally served by the Cooley alcohol factory.</P>
      <P>I answered the question addressed to me.  I can say further that, as I told the Deputy on the last occasion on which a similar question was addressed to me, my information is that the quantity of potatoes in Louth is, on the whole, very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that reply, if the facts are as the Minister states, and the quantity of potatoes in the area normally supplying Cooley Factory is negligible, could the Minister tell us why has he refused to allow the factory to take in all the surplus potatoes in Monaghan and has directed them to be transported to the factory in North Donegal, carriage paid, when, in fact, they could be received in Cooley?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply because the company with whom we discussed the matter thought it was unreasonable to ask them to reopen, and remain open, for such a small quantity of potatoes as were available.  It was known also that the quality in many cases was of a very low standard. Having regard to these factors, I thought myself that the company were not unreasonable in saying they would, while still in operation, accept tenders for these potatoes, namely, in the Carndonagh factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will <Col N="1155" /> agree with me that it is most unreasonable, in view of the fact that these very alcohol factories were set up as a social service, to dispose of surplus ware potato, that the small farmers in Monaghan or Cavan should be asked to send their potatoes, carriage paid, to Carndonagh rather than have them received for conversion into alcohol at Cooley when that factory is operating under its capacity owing to a scarcity of supply in the Cooley black scab area?  Is the Minister aware that under a scheme promoted by him, he has authorised the issue of documents to farmers in Monaghan, in view of their considerable number, authorising them to send their potatoes to Carndonagh?  That seems to have no regard at all to the legitimate interests of the small farmers of the Counties Monaghan and Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to have regard to all the factors that arise in a matter of this kind.  When we discussed this matter with the company, and having regard to the information, information as reliable as it could be expected to be, as to the quantities available, I felt the company's attitude was not unreasonable and that they should not be asked at this time, in the middle of July, to open up for a very small quantity of potatoes of very doubtful quality.  I think what has been done is a reasonable effort to meet the situation as fairly as possible.</P>

I am quite aware that, when people gamble with the market and retain supplies in the expectation that prices will go higher, something very often turns up and the gamble does not work.  A problem, of course, then arises.

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that the constant refusal of the Cork Harbour Commissioners to maintain landing places and piers, which are their property and under their control, in Cobh harbour, viz.  Aghada pier, Crosshaven, Cobh town and Admiralty piers, East Ferry, etc., has brought about a condition where these landing places are now both derelict and dangerous; that it is practically impossible to use them as landing places or <Col N="1158" /> berths for small steamers and other pleasure craft; and that these landing places were largely used for pleasure trips by Cork citizens and tourists viewing the harbour during the summer months; and if, in view of the fact that 75 per cent of the revenue of the Cork Harbour Commissioners is collected in tonnage dues from vessels using only Cobh harbour, he will take steps either to compel this body to carry out their maintenance responsibility or to dissolve them and appoint some person or body to carry out this work.</P>

      <P>The Harbours Act, 1946, imposes on harbour authorities the duty of maintaining the harbour works under their control.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners are the authority responsible for the landing places and piers in question, and representations concerning the condition of the works should be made direct to that body.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Cork Harbour Commissioners that they carry out regular and adequate maintenance of the landing places and piers under their control, having regard to the actual or potential use to be made of the facilities, and the revenue accruing from them.  The Commissioners spent £3,500 on such maintenance work in the Lower Harbour in the past year, and they have decided to spend £40,000 on the reconstruction of the Admiralty or Town Pier at Cobh in the near future.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Harbour Commissioners did nothing whatever to maintain the piers which are now dangerous to navigation? You cannot pull in at any of them and the situation has been aggravated by the fact that since the partial close-down of the Youghal railway line, the cost of excursions has been increased by 50 per cent to 60 per cent.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what are the present regulations with regard to the display of the cash price, in addition to the hire purchase price, on goods offered for sale by hire purchase; what methods of inspection and verification are used by his Department to ensure that any such regulations are fulfilled; if he will state the number of prosecutions resulting from breaches of such regulations in each of the past five years; and what penalty was imposed in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The information to be given in visual advertisements of goods offered for sale on hire-purchase terms is regulated by the Hire-Purchase and Credit-Sale (Advertising) Order which came into operation on 1st April, 1962.  Briefly, it requires that, in any such advertisement in which deposits, instalments or payment periods are mentioned, both the cash price and the total hire-purchase price shall be displayed in equal prominence with the other information.</P>
      <P>Compliance with the Order is enforced by authorised officers of my Department who inspect premises, issue warnings where necessary and, if rectification of the offending matter does not follow, report the offenders for the purpose of prosecution.  As a result of their reports, proceedings have been initiated against a number of offending traders.</P>
      <P>As the Order only became operative in April 1962, a reasonable period for adjustment was allowed to traders. The proceedings I have referred to are, therefore, the first to be taken in respect of contraventions of the Order.</P>

Regarding the cost of the raw materials for the manufacture of binder and baler twine it will be appreciated that I am not at liberty to disclose costings given to me in confidence by industrial concerns. The Deputies' attention is, however, directed to the fact that the published market prices of sisal have, on average, increased by 48 per cent in the first six months of this year as compared with the corresponding period in 1962.</P>

Is the Minister further aware that his handling of the case caused such grave public disquiet that the trial judge apparently thought it necessary on a subsequent occasion to call into the witness box both a Garda Superintendent and a prison officer in order to allay the public disquiet which had been aroused in the locality?</P>

This power of mine to defer the execution of warrants has been in operation since the foundation of the State and has been exercised time and again by my predecessors and was vigorously defended in this House by Deputy MacEoin when he was Minister for Justice.  I do not propose to be stampeded out of the use of this power which is vested in me by the Oireachtas and I will continue to exercise it in appropriate cases until such time as the Oireachtas, and nobody <Col N="1176" /> else decides, I should not have this power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying earlier in relation to the speech we had from the Taoiseach this morning, it was one of those frothy speeches without any factual proposals to which we have become accustomed to hearing from him.  It would not be unreasonable to say that we could paper every room in this building with the speeches the Taoiseach has made in relation to alleged plans over the years.  We hear a lot of those plans at times of crisis for the Fianna Fáil Party when it is necessary to rouse their morale, but we hear virtually nothing about them at a later stage.  I venture to say that the speech we heard from him this morning will be about as successful in providing the things people on all sides of the House desire as was his famous, or infamous, speech in Clery's Restaurant when he categorically promised he had a wonderful plan to provide 100,000 new jobs for our people.  Of course, he never had any such plan. There was nothing there except a desire to take advantage of the fact that naturally everybody listening to him was anxious to see that employment would be provided.</P>
      <P>Equally, today everyone of us wants to have economic growth balanced as well as it can be without straining our trade to a great degree.  But the repetition of truisms, such as we heard from him today, are not any indication of a policy as such.  The only indication we have of a policy is, first, what is included in this Finance Bill, and about which I shall have a word to say in a moment, and, secondly, that he believes that Government expenditure must go on rising and rising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an aside, the Taoiseach suggested that he now accepted and admitted that Fine Gael had a philosophy, although it was a philosophy of which he did not approve.  We can all remember it is not very long since the <Col N="1181" /> Taoiseach was trying to say there was no place whatever for Fine Gael and that he was trying to court the Labour Party into a different policy.  His normal form in this regard is to produce a statement of a principle with which everybody can agree but in respect of which he can produce no positive factual method of reaching a conclusion.</P>
    <P>I gathered he was anxious for a scheme of greater capital investment. Greater capital investment on what? Greater capital investment on worthwhile projects that were going to increase employment and living standards throughout the country would obviously have the support not merely of every Deputy but of every person throughout the country.  The fact is, of course, that the record of his Party in relation to capital investment has been a singularly unhappy one.  During the years 1932 to 1939&mdash;I am not going to blame the Taoiseach for what happened during the war years&mdash;it is a fact which cannot be gainsaid that there was no capital investment of any sort in any worthwhile project undertaken by Fianna Fáil as a Government in that period.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that cannot be gainsaid that the pattern Fianna Fáil were following after the emergency&mdash;the pattern initiated by the supplementary Budget of 1947&mdash;was the continuation of the anti-capital investment programme of the early 'Thirties.  It was not until 1949 that there was any realisation by the Government at all of the necessity to have a vastly expanded capital programme, but one expanded on worthwhile projects.  The changes that were made in 1949 were made in the teeth of Fianna Fáil opposition at that time, but they are changes that, having been made, have come to stay.  I am glad they have come to stay.  My regret, however, is that the record of performance in relation to capital investment by Fianna Fáil when in government has not been a very happy one.</P>
    <P>As was indicated in an article in one of the papers this morning by a person who cannot be described as being a Fine Gael propagandist, the Taoiseach <Col N="1182" /> himself more than anyone else has been responsible for the failure of capital investment in relation to our transport. It is to him that that failure through the years must be mainly attributed. The whole problem in relation to capital investment has been not a desire by any Government since 1949 to refrain from State capital investment, but to find projects in which it was worth while to invest the people's money on behalf of the State&mdash;to find viable projects that would mean a permanent increase in employment and, therefore, in living standards.</P>
    <P>The manner in which a vast sum was thrown away stupidly, instead of being invested productively, in Dundalk has already been discussed in this House.  I am not going to anticipate a discussion in relation to a similar effort that will take place after this debate has finished.  The fertiliser project which was recently started at Arklow was put up to us and was condemned by technical experts at that time as being a project that was not economically viable.  The Government say that there has been a change since then, both in technical methods and in the economies of the project.  When we asked them for particulars, they have taken the line of saying that it would be commercially harmful to the company for the change to be made public.  In the circumstances, the Opposition have no option but to place the responsibility firmly on the backs of the Government.  It must be on them alone that the responsibility for the investment lies.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that cannot be gainsaid that no Government since the change in outlook in relation to capital investment in 1949 have ever refrained from making any capital investment because they were against a capital programme as such.  The only tests that have been made were whether the project proposed was a viable project or was something that was not likely to produce permanent results.  As I have said a second ago, the judgment of Fianna Fáil in relation to those projects has been sadly lacking.</P>
    <P>On the income expenditure side, the Taoiseach also gave us an indication <Col N="1183" /> that we could look forward to nothing but increasing Government expenditure to be met from current account all the time.  If increasing Government expenditure were to be met by increases in the national income so that the proportion of national income set aside for Government expenditure would remain more or less constant and at a reasonable fraction, no one would object to Government expenditure as such going on; but when Government current expenditure is allowed to outrun the increase in national income and to outrun the normal revenue buoyancy that comes from increases in national income, then the situation arises that such increases require the imposition of additional taxation which may well have the effect of retarding economic growth.  If Government expenditure is so allowed to run ahead and taxation has accordingly to be increased beyond the limits, then the effect is not going to be a consistent and permanent growth.  It may provide a temporary inflation and a temporary sense of well-being but it will not provide the conditions in which we can hope to have any permanent increase in our living standards.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill which we are discussing today and which we have been discussing for some considerable period is based on the fact that the Government have allowed that expenditure to get beyond the point at which it could be met by revenue buoyancy or by the increase in national income. The natural and inevitable corollary of the statement made by the Taoiseach this morning that Government expenditure on current account is going to go on increasing is that the turnover tax of 2½ per cent imposed in the Budget and in this Finance Bill will equally be increased by Fianna Fáil for the purpose of meeting that expenditure. One cannot go without the other.  If the Government said categorically that they are going to go on increasing current income expenditure over and beyond that amount by which revenue buoyancy may come, then we see the real reason for the turnover tax was that it is a very simple tax to increase at any time.  It is as well, as I said <Col N="1184" /> earlier, that the Taoiseach should have made his speech so that stripped of the verbiage, not merely we but the whole country can see the mentality behind the imposition of this tax.  In my view, an increase in taxation of that sort outstripping any rises in national income or revenue buoyancy is going to prevent further growth rather than assist it.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised, too, that the Taoiseach when about to make a fundamental speech of that sort&mdash;if it was intended to be a fundamental speech &mdash;did not advert at all to one of the vital things in relation to our economic progress, in relation to our position regarding the Common Market, GATT and EFTA, and did not say where we are to go in relation to our external trade and economic conditions.  It is a fact that we are in the position at the moment of being alone and isolated in economic and world trade.  We are not a member of the Common Market.  I may say at once that I agree and always agreed with the Taoiseach in the final decision, not with the kite that he flew about joining the Common Market if Britain did not join.  I always agreed that it would be impossible to join if Britain did not join.  We are not a member of it.  We are not a member of GATT and yet at the same time, we are reducing our trade tariffs.</P>
    <P>We are not a member of EFTA, and I do not think that there is any very great advantage <i>per se</i> for an agricultural country in joining EFTA, if that agricultural country is to maintain a tariff selection.  But it seems now that what we are doing is remaining, willy-nilly and without any choice outside the European Economic Community, outside EFTA and outside the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and at the same time, committing ourselves to a policy of complete tariff reduction without getting from that policy any benefit whatever in direct negotiations with the people who will benefit by it.  That seems to me to be getting the worst of both worlds.</P>
    <P>Let me say at once that I was all in favour of joining the European Economic Community, if that had been possible and if Britain had joined. Then we were going to move into a <Col N="1185" /> world in which there would be a dismantling of tariffs by ourselves, a dismantling that I agree may be inevitable in the future, but a dismantling of tariffs by us in return for a <i>quid pro quo</i>&mdash;for our possibility of access to a much greater market than that to which we are able to have access at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand where the Government want to go in this matter. I accept that the free world ultimately is moving towards a period of tariff reduction and freer trade.  Everyone else in the world is moving towards that by dismantling of tariffs in exchange for other benefits.  We could obtain other benefits in the EEC or even outside that community but we have preferred to take unilateral action in our dismantling.  For example, we could have done some bargaining in this trading respect in the direct Government order placed in France of £250,000 for helicopters.  That was a direct Government trade operation. They know the ratio of our trade with France is about seven to one against us.  As the Minister for Defence and his colleagues acknowledge, no effort was made by the Government at that time to get any reciprocity for a very substantial Government contract.  That is one type of example.  Another is that we are apparently committed by the Government to short-term tariff reductions without any negotiations or bargain in any other country where that would assist us in getting something worthwhile for ourselves in exchange.</P>
    <P>I agree that the free world is moving towards tariff reduction in the long run and it is obvious that the position will be such that we shall have to compete on far less favourable terms in some of our best markets, notably Britain.  This is the time, knowing that, at which steps should be taken to try to ensure that this disadvantage will be overcome and yet I have seen no moves in that direction by the Government.  Therefore, if the Taoiseach was going to branch out from the Finance Bill into a discussion on general economic growth, as he did this morning, clearly that is one <Col N="1186" /> of the sides on which he should have given some lead or explanation to the country.</P>
    <P>So far as the possibility of increasing exports and the possibility of Irish private enterprise increasing productivity are concerned, this Finance Bill does not help at all.  On the contrary, it deals it a body blow.  The imposition of retrospective corporation profits tax to be paid out of reserves can only diminish the amount of those reserves that would be available for further expansion, modernisation and employment and better conditions of employment.  If the policy was to reduce dividends, there is a simple way of doing that&mdash;or even holding of dividends&mdash;by imposing a distributed tax at a differential rate from an undistributed tax but the way it is being done rules out any possibility of that.  The reserves that would have been there for modernisation, expansion and improvement of productivity, which we must have if we are to compete for markets, have been dealt a bad blow in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a truism that nothing in relation to industry can stand still.  Unless industry can be constantly modernising it will not be able to hold its own, much less improve.  Perhaps, to some extent the shock of tariff abolition may provide some shake-up towards competitiveness in industry but it will be as nothing compared to the benefits available if the Government had done their part in negotiating a counterpart of the reduction.  The target for a dynamic economy must be not only to modernise and expand continuously &mdash;a fair amount has been done in relation to free equipment by grant inducement&mdash;but this Finance Bill will prevent a great part of the modernisation that should go with it.</P>
    <P>Before the Budget, everybody thought what was needed was a Budget to encourage saving and investment and to encourage exports. There is little prospect of anything done in this Finance Bill encouraging any of those features unless the Minister claims for the turnover tax a discouragement of consumption.  I should like to know when he is replying if he does make that claim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> I want to draw attention to the fact that the turnover tax, the main feature of the Budget, is allegedly modelled on the Swedish pattern.  The Minister cannot deny that his justification everywhere for this type of tax is that it is modelled on the Swedish retail turnover tax.  It is not quite the same but he says it is modelled on it.  I was particularly interested, therefore, to read in <i>Skandaniviska,</i> a banking quarterly review, No. 2 of 1963, an article on the value-added tax, an entirely different tax, which suggests that Sweden is going away from the type of tax we are introducing towards the French value-added tax.  In other words, having based our tax on the Swedish pattern, we now find that is going to be thrown overboard by Sweden as entirely out of date and unsuitable even for them.  I am sure the Minister has in the Department this particular banking review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The tax the Minister has introduced is the worst form of all broadly-based taxes.  I said that long ago and I repeat it. The one he has introduced is the worst form of all and, as I say, it is apparently going to be thrown overboard now by Sweden.  I say to the Minister that I am sure this is in his Department, if he has not seen it himself, because from such time as I was over there, I knew this quarterly existed.  I have been able to get it ever since and it has perhaps some of the best economic articles to be read in any quarterly in a language which I can understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That article makes it clear, as does one by the <i>Economist</i> Intelligence Unit published last month in Britain, that the European Economic Community operates an entirely different type of tax from this and that in those countries in the EEC where they have a tax based on something like this, they are moving away from it and the commission has recommended that they would move away from it and go to the value added tax as in France <Col N="1188" /> which is an entirely different operation. I might say that one of the things the <i>Economist</i> Intelligence Unit reports is that the tax <i>sur la valeur ajouté</i> as practised in France applies generally to all transactions in goods except retail sales and the other members of the Six who have not got such a form as the <i>valeur ajouté</i> in France are all now moving towards the French model.  The Swedes are thinking of leaving the model the Minister thought so wonderful. The Common Market Commission issued a draft directive in November, 1962, for the harmonisation of turnover taxes in the Common Market. The recommendation was for those countries to replace it within four years by a non-cumulative tax.  After the fourth year, all States were recommended to move over to an added value tax.  That was one of the reasons why I asked whether the Taoiseach was still of a mind to get the country ready for ultimate acceptance, as he hoped, into the EEC when he had taken something as his model that has been discarded.</P>

The Minister himself deliberately chose this particular model and he could not have chosen a worse one.  He has varied somewhat from his initial announcement and the result of the variation is a worse hybrid than the initial announcement produced because he will get the worst of both worlds.

      <P>The Taoiseach is a very cute politician and he will not say something that can be quoted against him to slit his own throat, but he could not have meant all the things he said without one implying the other.  It could not have been done. Everybody knows that is what he did mean.  The Minister for Finance will enlighten the Parliamentary Secretary that the reason for the Bill we are discussing is that Government current expenditure has outrun the increase in national income and revenue buoyancy.  Speaking from recollection, I would say the revenue buoyancy was £8 million this year but Government expenditure was greater, and we are told by the Taoiseach this morning that that pattern must continue. There was nothing else anybody could infer or draw from any of his statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us, too, that we need an incomes policy and that he hoped to have one.  The Government have been asked to provide an incomes policy for a long time and they have not done it because it is only recently they have realised the difference between an incomes policy and a wages policy. Their line of country has been to concentrate on restriction in wages alone and to forget about all the other constituent parts of an incomes policy. That is why they have been so unsuccessful. That is why there has been no balanced growth.  I think they do realise, since the provocative publication of their White Paper in February, that an incomes policy governs more than pure wages, though they seem to be still inclined to fasten on the wages part alone, an incomes policy that should, in our circumstances of the necessity to expand exports, mean a reduction in our high-cost economy, this <Col N="1191" /> already high cost economy, which even the Parliamentary Secretary cannot deny, but, instead of that, the effect of this Bill will be, unfortunately, to put it even higher, and that will not help our competitiveness in relation to exports. We must be competitive if we are to survive at all.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us it is his desire to have widespread understanding of the policy he is adumbrating.  I do not think there is a person in the House who will deny that the easiest, the best, and the most thorough way, of having widespread understanding of the policy of any political Party is to have that understanding tested in a general election.  If the Taoiseach and the Parliamentary Secretary believe, as they pretend to believe, in the success of their policies, will they put them to the test?  The result will be that they will get a much greater hammering than they got in North East Dublin.  If the Taoiseach is honest, and if he is not being hypocritical in saying that the public will understand what they have in mind, there is an easy way to test that understanding, and one which we will welcome, and we have made it clear that we will welcome it.</P>

      <P>The people resent the tax of which the Parliamentary Secretary is now such an ardent protagonist, although he previously said it would affect only fur coats, and something else.  The people resent the fact that this tax is being placed on the necessaries of life in exactly the same degree as it is being placed on fur coats.  The people resent the fact that this tax will be completely unworkable, except in one degree.  It will operate in the place of the dance tax.</P>
      <P>We always said that a dance tax was workable, and Fianna Fáil always said it was not workable.  I am glad that to that extent they have been converted to our view.  The Minister is insisting on imposing this tax on sales that are effected between 1st August and 1st November on the credit, and paid for after 1st November.  On the other hand, the person who has got the funds to anticipate can anticipate as much as he likes.</P>
      <P>The tax will be unworkable because the divisions in our coinage are not percentage divisions.  It will cost infinitely more than the one per cent that is being suggested.  The reason that one per cent is being suggested is that the cost of administration will be used as an income tax cost rather than a sales tax cost.  I suspect that the official purpose of this tax is not so much to have a one per cent administration cost, as the Minister has indicated, but to utilise a series of cross-references so that the cost of administration will, in fact, be met out of income tax cost and the cross references used for the purpose of verifying income tax returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed this morning for the first time that the tax will have the effect of taking away from certain charitable institutions, rehabilitation <Col N="1193" /> institutions, more than the benefit the Minister alleges he is giving them under Section 97.  The people do not want this tax.  This is a financial and fiscal policy which was never envisaged at the time of the last general election. It is retrospective in certain respects, although in 1958 the Minister agreed that he would never introduce retrospective taxation again.  It is an imposition on the necessaries of life which everyone would have shuddered at if challenged about it in October of the year before last.  The only honest thing any honourable Government can do in these circumstances is not to take a referendum on this issue, but to submit themselves to a referendum of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We, by virtue of the decision of the Irish people, find ourselves in the position in 1963 that we must devise taxation which is necessary in order to achieve further expansion and achieve by 1970 a total national income of £1,000 million, an increase in national income of 30 per cent in accordance with the four and five per cent rises in national income since the initiation of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in 1958.  We must decide whether we want to go forward as we have done since 1958 or whether we do not.  We have come down <Col N="1199" /> definitely on this basis.  We believe that in order to achieve the standard of living and the economic growth to sustain that standard in our community planning is necessary.  Since 1958 we have had a certain success in the working out of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> first published in that year.  We have exceeded by more than 100 per cent the target set. Inside the coming months the full details of our new programme for economic expansion designed to achieve the targets I have mentioned will be published.</P>
      <P>In the achievement of any such targets, in the achievement of the progress we desire in the working out of the economic expansion and development of our community, one thing is clearly necessary in our circumstances; that is a continued involvement by the Government in all such expansion.  It is quite clear that in our circumstances the Government, no matter what Government it is, must take a positive lead in all economic expansion. By reason of our late start in the industrial race this is one of the facts of life as far as this country is concerned.  If the State is to take such a positive lead in the economic expansion and development of our community it is essential to devise a taxation system which will yield to the State the revenue necessary for such expansion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It all comes down to one essential principle and a recognition of that principle; we in Ireland today must plan and work ahead for economic expansion; secondly, the State must play a positive part in that work of, first, planning and, secondly, providing the capital to ensure that both the private and the public sectors play their part in such planning.  Lastly, we must devise here the necessary taxation measures designed to yield the revenue for this overall purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> This Finance Bill must be viewed in that context.  Nobody here will deny that there are many improvements needed over various sectors of our economic life.  I referred on the Second Stage, and again on the Committee Stage, to one particular field&mdash;the field of education.  The Minister for Education has announced the policy proposals he is working on at the moment, proposals designed to ensure a broad range of technical and technological education for our people, a type of education we need here to gear the country over the 'sixties and the 'seventies, a type of education designed to ensure that the ordinary man's child can acquire through the technical school and the technological college the technical and other qualifications which are in such great demand in the world today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That type of educational policy will, of course, need further financial assistance by way of scholarship development.  More financial assistance will be needed to set on foot the extended scope of the institutions necessary to provide the technical and technological education. All of these could use to the full the entire amount which can be garnered in one year from the turnover tax alone.  I would not be satisfied with an increased expenditure of £11,500,000, which is the increase we hope to get from the turnover tax, on education. I feel even more could be spent in this field alone in the 'sixties by any State anxious to equip itself as it should be equipped for the world today.  I can go through various other fields where the State must and will have to in future take a positive lead. A Land Bill has been introduced here. We will take the Second Stage of that Bill after the Recess.</P>

      <P>In any progressive attempt to get down to the roots of the land distribution problem, much more money needs to be spent.  Under the proposed new Bill, I envisage the Land Commission taking increased powers to engage in the acquisition and distribution of land.  That inevitably will require more finance.  It goes without saying that any attempt to put the Land Commission on a sound basis and equip it with the necessary powers to adopt a more progressive distribution policy in regard to land must require extra money.  If the Land Commission is to function as it is envisaged it should function under the proposed Bill it will require at least another £2 million a year to carry out its job and perform its functions.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party is rightly concerned with the future planning of our economy and how we are to achieve the targets we propose to set out in the new <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in the various sectors.  They are concerned and we are concerned that one thing necessary to ensure the future of this State is a broadly-based system of taxation that will yield the revenue necessary to carry out the plans in the fields I have mentioned&mdash;in education, in agriculture, in industry, in social welfare legislation. To carry out the improvements in these sectors so often advanced by those people who are concerned with them, there is one thing necessary, that is, that the State in our circumstances, and charged with the responsibility of ensuring those improvements, will have a steady flow of revenue coming in to ensure that these various functions are discharged.  The issue is as simple as that.  It comes to the simple issue that people are expected to face up to the fact that improvement is necessary and if improvement is necessary, the taxation measures to sustain that improvement must be devised.</P>

What we want from the Labour Party or anyone else who expresses criticism is a concrete suggestion as to how the alternative revenue can be obtained for the purposes we mention.  The Labour Party and ourselves are with each other, as it were, on the forward looking planning that is so necessary to our State today.

      <P>I was describing Deputy Dillon's behaviour.  If I described him as such, I withdraw it, but I want to say that his behaviour here of late has been of the nature of a circus master, and, indeed, the behaviour of the Fine Gael Party during the past half hour, since I attempted to make a constructive speech, is also of that nature.  The important thing in any economic plan is the creation of a climate of confidence. We have done that since 1947 because we have been able to present to the people an image of a Government in charge of the affairs of the nation, not a Government that is liable to scuttle like the previous Government was scuttled in 1957 and twice before that.</P>
      <P>Since 1957, the affairs of this country have been handled in a different way to such an extent that private enterprise has been able to expand both from investment at home and foreign investment which has come in here in the knowledge that there is an equitable taxation system, a Government securely in charge of the affairs of the nation, and that there is a general climate of confidence, the basic ingredient of any expanding economy. That climate of confidence has been reflected in a number of ways&mdash;a steady rise of four to five per cent per annum in the national income over the past few years, our external assets continuing to increase, emigration being cut to a very extensive degree and employment in industry steadily rising.  These are just some of the indicators which go to show the general climate of confidence from the point of view of investment and of the development of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> It has increased tremendously since 1957 and the greatest single indicator of that fact is the position in regard to banking and bank credits.  Anyone who remembers the position in 1957 will bear out what I have said.  I was at that time a member of a local authority with Deputy McQuillan and have a very clear recollection of the financial difficulties that local authority had, due to the closure of the Local Loans Fund.  Now there is the position where not alone have we the Local Loans Fund but the financial institutions, the banks, are able to give money on reasonable terms not only to local authorities but to private business as well.</P>
    <P>All in all, we have the necessary psychological and financial climate for the desired improvement in the economy. The fact that we have been able to foster confidence in the people has had this effect.  But that is only one side of the question.  The other is the direct participation by the State itself, either through its various Departments&mdash;Lands, Fisheries, Forestry&mdash;or indirectly through the Industrial Credit Company in assisting private industry.  This participation by the State is the most important single reason for the increased revenue we seek not alone through these proposals but in other taxation proposals that have not come before the House.</P>
    <P>We believe it is necessary for the State to give the lead not only in planning but sometimes in direct intervention in business.  There is no other issue in Irish public life today except this: a division or disagreement between the people who believe it is important to take an objective lead directly in our economy and those who do not so believe.  The people who believe that the State must take a positive part in developing our economy to a greater level than this will support our measures.  They realise full well that increasing Government expenditure in the proper directions is necessary and that we need the revenue to sustain that expenditure. On the other side, there are the obscurantist people who do not believe in increasing Government expenditure, <Col N="1212" /> who do not believe in the State's taking a positive part in directing the country's economy.  I believe these obscurantist people as a whole reside in the Fine Gael Party.  Those people who believe in the future reside in or support the Fianna Fáil Party.  I believe that is the issue in Irish politics today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been here since 10.30 this morning, except for one break of half an hour.  I offered myself on each occasion, without success.  The last speaker, Deputy Lenihan, referred to the fact, as a member of a local authority, that in 1957 it had difficulty in obtaining the necessary credit to carry out the desirable and essential works which are the responsibility of the local authority. He went on to develop the point that when the change of Government came about there was a loosening-up of the pursestrings and that credit was made available by the banking concerns to local authorities and to the State.</P>
      <P>I should like to say this much to this new recruit to a left-wing policy.  Is it not a terrible condemnation of a State to say that a Government in power or the Government to be have to take their caps off and go humbly to the private banks and ask them for sufficient credit to run the State?  Is that not what that statement by Deputy Lenihan amounts to?  Is it not a confession on his part that the Government have no power whatever over the means of developing the State and that the stranglehold of credit and finance is something that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael cannot break?  To a great extent, that very admission on the part of a member of the Government makes discussions in this House seem to me at any rate to be very unrealistic.</P>
      <P>If the money which is absolutely essential for development purposes can be held back by the banking system which is controlled from outside this State, what hope have any Government of embarking on a progressive policy which this present Government suggest they intend to do?  Nobody for a moment ever believed that the sources who control credit are progressive in their outlook.  Nobody can accuse our own organisations such as the Central Bank, and so on, of being progressive. They have always adopted a cautious attitude.  This morning, we listened to the Taoiseach giving what I can only describe as a back-to-the-wall speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was undoubtedly one of the finest speeches made by the present Taoiseach.  It was a last-minute attempt to rally support for a Party that is crumbling under his own eyes.  It was a last-minute attempt at the same time to frighten the general public that if Fianna Fáil are put out of office nothing but chaos will descend on the country.</P>
      <P>I recollect, when I was a lot younger, listening to older people talking about the war.  The previous Taoiseach of the Fianna Fáil Party managed for years on end to keep the day with him on the grounds that there was a danger of a war, that there was a danger of Ireland being involved in a war and, in those circumstances, it would be a disaster for the State to shake or shift the Government.</P>
      <P>There is no war now but the same old bogey must be produced.  Some other means must be found of dragooning the public or frightening the public into giving Fianna Fáil a prolonged lease of life.  On this occasion, the Taoiseach saw fit deliberately to criticise the Irish electorate, to sneer at them here, because they did not agree with his idea on proportional representation.  He told the Irish people here this morning that they were wrong not to have got rid of proportional representation, that the result now is that the country for the future will face minority Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that minority government is such a great disaster.  I do not think it would be possible to have any greater disaster than the type of majority government we have had under Fianna Fáil for sixteen to twenty years.  In spite of the overall majority they had, ranging at times to ten, 12 and 15 seats over and above all parties combined, they failed in their tasks to give an opportunity to the majority of our citizens to live in Ireland, to give them a decent standard of living, to provide work for them at home, to expand industry generally and, above all, to create a new approach in agriculture. They failed as a government with an overall majority the like of which will never be seen again.  They <Col N="1215" /> failed to bring about that change. Why?  Because that very majority they had gave them a sense of complacency and they sat back and played poker in their Party rooms when they should have been up and at it, concerned with the problems of State, instead of being concerned solely with how to prolong their life in office.</P>
    <P>Bag after bag of <i>clichés</i> were produced here this morning by the Parliamentary Secretary and by the Minister for Transport and Power whom I can only describe as a man suffering from mental constipation and verbal diarrhoea, having listened to his speech this morning on this matter.  We have had the statement from the Taoiseach that he believes in the growing maturity of the Irish public to accept what Fianna Fáil now offer.  Does he then suggest that the Irish people were an immature, raw society for the past 30 years?  I am inclined to agree with him.  They must have been immature and raw for quite a while when they stood for what they had in office.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said this morning that in the past, at times, economic progress was left to chance; that, as far as the future was concerned, he could not speak but that the danger is that men of no fixed aims may hold the political security of this country in their hands in the future: that men of no fixed aims may hold the political future of this country in their hands.  If we examine these statements, we shall find that those chickens will come home to roost in one Party.  The one I am concerned with at the moment is the one in office&mdash;Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke of economic progress being left to chance.  How many times in this House in the past 15 years have we listened to the Fianna Fáil front benchers saying it would be a crime for the State to interfere in the planning of society in this State? How many times did we hear it said that development here must be left to private enterprise?  How many times in the past 12 months have members of the Government Front Bench said inside and outside this House that they worship at the shrine of private enterprise? That was a fixed part of their policy until less than 12 months ago. <Col N="1216" /> What have we now?  Anybody who listened carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary a few minutes ago heard him say that Fianna Fáil believe the State must step in and plan.  If that is not a political somersault, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>I do not attribute a great deal of weight to the words of that particular Parliamentary Secretary, but we must attribute some weight to the words of the Taoiseach himself.  He stated recently, both inside and outside this House, that Fianna Fáil are moving to the left.  How sudden was that conversion and how true is it.  If I felt it was a sincere conversion, I would be the first to welcome it, because I believe it would make a tremendous change in this country.  It gives me no pleasure&mdash;in fact, I do so with the greatest distaste&mdash;to say I do not believe that the Taoiseach and the members of his Cabinet are genuine when they say they have adopted a new policy of a progressive, left-wing approach to the major problems facing the country.</P>
    <P>If it is true, they are shuttlecocks and have no principle if they are to switch overnight on a matter of vital importance. It is less than 12 months since the Minister for Finance made it clear here he was about to take steps to hand back to private enterprise a number of existing State companies.  He was questioned here as to whether it was the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna, the ESB or what companies.  He did not give us any idea.  He spoke at dinners in various towns about the desirability of handing back successful State companies to private enterprise. When questioned on it here, he did not deny that the Government had such a plan in mind.</P>
    <P>For the past nine months, we have not heard a word from the Minister for Finance about that plan.  Why?  Is it not because of the sudden new approach of a pseudo left-wing policy, which would make it impossible to sell out these successful companies?  This shows the Government have not thought of what it involves.  They have seen an opportunity to disassociate themselves from another major Party in this House.  The two Parties had <Col N="1217" /> become so close on matters of public importance that they were actually pushing each other to try and find some difference.  Fianna Fáil have slipped in with this new idea that they will go left and seek the votes of the underdog while, at the same time, take a gamble and try to hold on to what they have over the years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said this morning that Fianna Fáil were concerned for the future and sought a plan, hard work and sacrifice.  Let us look at the last one first.  So long as I can recall, we had a previous Taoiseach on practically every occasion possible putting a hair-shirt on the Irish people.  Now his successor wants sacrifice from the Irish people.  I believe the sacrifice has always been made by the poorer section of the community, by the emigrants and by those who cannot get work here. I have yet to see the people who have been spoon-fed and pampered by Fianna Fáil making any sacrifice over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>The previous Fianna Fáil policy was embodied in the sentence: &ldquo;I look into my heart and I know what the Irish people want.&rdquo;  That is thrown overboard now, and that is no harm.  Now we have the sudden conversion to a planned economy, but where are the signs so far of it being put into operation? The Government have used the idea to attract the younger voters and the more progressive elements among our people by speaking about the duty of the State to intervene, but at the same time they are acting in a completely opposite direction.</P>
    <P>We can see what the effect of this turnover tax will be on the cost of living.  An increase in the cost of living will mean an increase in the price of commodities, and that in turn will mean that industrial groups will find it harder than ever to compete in foreign markets.  Since the Taoiseach declared himself in favour of entering EEC, expert examinations have been carried out to find out whether our industries would be able to stand up to foreign competition.  With the exception of the report in respect of the cattle and meat industry, every report from the CIO has shown that the number to be <Col N="1218" /> disemployed in these industries ranges from 30 per cent down to 5 per cent in spite of any reorganisation that would take place in these industries.</P>
    <P>Those are cold, hard facts.  There will be a reduction of 30,000 in the number employed in these industries if the tariff walls come down.  What is going to be the position?  We are not able to compete with those countries. The prices of our products are too high and costs are too high.  Is it not a fact that the provisions of this Finance Bill, particularly in relation to the turnover tax, will make the situation still harder as far as the export market is concerned?  Where does that leave us, when and if this country's application for admission to the EEC is further considered?</P>
    <P>I must say this: the speech made today by the Taoiseach, one of the best he has made since he became Taoiseach, was a back-to-the-wall speech.  It was an attempt on his part to justify himself for the years he was in the wilderness.  He has sought in this speech to hold Fianna Fáil together for the last time, and when his policy and his years in government have been examined, I have not the slightest doubt that the Irish electorate which he has now said must be mature will find him and his Party wanting.  An examination of the record of his Party even since 1957 will convince any thinking person that it is time to get rid of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>As far as his statement is concerned that the future may lie in the hands of people who have no firm convictions and no political philosophy, I think that that will be the position if Fianna Fáil are able to hold on to office.  Whatever may be said about the older members in the present Cabinet, my belief is that what is there to replace them have no philosophy at all, no standards except &ldquo;hold on to office, get into power, and stay there as long as you possibly can.&rdquo;  I believe the members of the Fianna Fáil Party whose tongues are now hanging out for power to replace the older men are prepared to go left or right or any way possible if they think they will get into office.  The country cannot afford playacting in <Col N="1219" /> politics for the purpose of allowing people to reach high places.  If it was a political game where nobody was hurt, it would not be so bad, but in the process of all this jogging about and tricking, the Irish nation is suffering.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible comment on the public life in Ireland today that the Taoiseach has decided to walk into this House and say that Fianna Fáil are the national Party and that if they go out of office, the country is lost. This is the same Taoiseach who within the past 12 months spent his time touring the capitals of the major countries of Europe hawking&mdash;and that is the only word I could use&mdash;this country for sale to the highest bidder. We have them today flocking into this country to take advantage of the wonderful facilities offered by this Government, people who are attracted by the speeches made by the Taoiseach abroad.  The new approach seems to be that it does not matter who owns the land or the industries of Ireland, provided that there are a few people employed and that Fianna Fáil can say: &ldquo;We increased the number in employment last year by 5,000 and we hope to increase it further by another 7,000 next year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do this Government believe that the Ireland which they had hoped to see free and able to give a living to its people here is one where the best land is owned by non-nationals and where the industrial potential is exploited for the benefit of non-nationals, where profits are made on Irish investments the Irish people poured into industry are taken fully out of this country for the benefit of a limited number of investors who only put up a small fraction of the initial cost when the industry was started?  Why has there not been a proviso when Irish money is being handed out in the course of this industrial development plan that profits made as a result of Irish money being handed over to these private entrepreneurs, are or at least a proportion of them, are ploughed back into the industry in Ireland?  Is it not a fact that the only advantage at the moment in having some of these <Col N="1220" /> foreign industrialists in here is the work given?</P>
    <P>It will, I know, be argued by some people in this House: &ldquo;Are not the Irish people better off working here in Ireland no matter who owns or controls the industries or what profits are made than to be working in Birmingham or Liverpool?&rdquo;  I wonder if that is a sensible or honest way to face up to this&mdash;that this country is not able to solve its own problems, that we can only let these foreigners in on their own valuation, take what they like out of this country and in return pay slave wages as they are doing in many cases all over the country?  Is the new development now that the people who should be looking after the interests of the workers will not even fight in the Labour Court or elsewhere to see that the position is changed in which girls are being paid anything from £2 18s. to £3 4s. for a week's hard work, and that the companies which have got State money in order to allow them to pay a wage of that nature are brought to heel and forced to pay proper wages?</P>
    <P>The CIO reports available to the Government are a warning sign, a red light to them that this country is not able to compete now in the international field in trade.  What is the position going to be when the wholesalers and traders get their fingers into the pie?  As far as this Finance Bill is concerned, I want to make it clear that I am not speaking on behalf of the traders.  They have their own spokesmen in this House and out of it.  But I do want to make it clear that the consumer is going to be the victim in this in the long run.  That is admitted by all and sundry.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister for Industry and Commerce was asked what action would be taken by the Government to ensure that no more than the 2½ per cent turnover tax which is now going into operation would be passed on to the consumer when the cost went up. The Minister said that he was taking no action.  All he was doing was exhorting the traders and those whose business it is to deal with the price structure not to raise prices of commodities over and above what the <Col N="1221" /> purchase tax amounts to.  Is it not beyond dispute that not alone will this 2½ per cent purchase tax come into operation but that on top of that, the corporation profits tax and other taxes which this Government are now imposing will find their way right along the line to the consumer who will be forced to pay?</P>
    <P>It is not 2½ per cent on the first round of an increase; it will be at least 4 per cent next January when this tax is in operation&mdash;if ever.  There is no sign of a progressive approach in this type of turnover tax.  As I said before, if the Government, when dealing with the turnover tax, were prepared at the same time to bring in price control there would be a lot to be said for supporting a tax if it excluded the necessities of life.  None of these things is being done.  Even drugs and medicines that would assist in maintaining health in the country are subject to tax.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Government, who regard themselves as humanitarian and progressive, looking with abhorrence on what they call the Tory mentality, could tax medicine that helps to save human life and fail to tax medicine for animals.  Is there not a conflict between their left wing stand, as they describe it, and their actual policy in operation?  The animal is put before the human being.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that this type of turnover tax is imposed on medicine in Sweden.  That was stated by the Minister for Finance.  Is the Minister prepared to bring in here the type of health services available in Sweden?  Of the countries mentioned here, with which comparisons have been made in Western Europe, it is beyond contradiction that Ireland has the worst health service of them all. It is so bad that even the present Minister for Health had to agree to set up a Committee of the House to examine the possibilities of improving it.  The whole business is a stalling measure but there is dissatisfaction all over the country with the existing services and the cost of medicines.</P>
    <P>Last year a half-promise was extracted from the Minister for Health that he would examine the possibilities <Col N="1222" /> of bulk buying of medicines and drugs in view of their outrageous cost.  Now we find that instead of legislation to subsidise the price of drugs and medicine and make them available to the community at reasonable prices the Government has imposed a turnover tax on them.  For that offence alone against the public they deserve to be driven into the wilderness.</P>
    <P>The case for the trade groups has been made and I am sure will be made before long in another sphere but irrespective of what the Taoiseach has said, whether he likes it or not the traders have a right under the Constitution to protest against what they believe to be an unjust tax even though we know they will pass it on.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach again today launched a further attack on the traders and issued a warning to them.  He was not satisfied to leave it there but then turned on the farming community and, in what I thought was the most serious part of his speech, he lashed out at the farming community and sneeringly pointed out that they should be thankful for the £6 million of dole money they got.  That is how the Taoiseach described the support given to the agricultural industry.  I wonder what farmer Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party think of that description by the Dublin Taoiseach who looks at Irish agriculture through Dublin spectacles and says: &ldquo;I see that group of farmers doing nothing as usual.&rdquo; He has always shown contempt for them and today he revealed complete dislike.  So far as the aid given to agriculture is concerned, much of it is misused, misdirected and misplaced. It is wrong to say the farmer is getting that aid.  If butter is subsidised and the subsidy paid to the British people to eat our butter, how is it suggested the Irish farmer benefits by it? In my opinion, neither farmer nor consumer here benefit from that subsidy. Yet, we have that sneering reference by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I am not here to speak for the large farmers and if the Taoiseach ever wants support for a policy of acquiring the lands of ranchers, if he had the guts to do it, and dividing the land of those whose time is spent going <Col N="1223" /> from one racecourse to another, in the words of the Minister for Lands, he would get support from our group. They do not represent the farming community of Ireland.  They may be in high places in outside organisations but if they try to misuse the small farmers they will learn the hard way. The small farmers have been the plaything of Fianna Fáil for years.  I hope they will not be the plaything of any vested interest now coming on the horizon.  It was made clear in the past month at a regional meeting of representatives of small farmers of Connacht, the Church and various leaders in the West, that the small farmer there is on the way out.  He and his family are being wiped out faster than during the Famine by pressure of events here, by a policy stated today by the Dublin Taoiseach of the Government who knows nothing about the people in the west of Ireland except when he goes to fish in County Mayo with his new-found friend from London, who owns half O'Connell Street. The new ice cream general in O'Connell Street is the only company the Taoiseach can pick when he visits the west of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get into a discussion with the back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party who want to put me off what I wish to say.  The Taoiseach has no interest <Col N="1224" /> in the small farmer.  There is an old saying and it applies in politics: by their company you shall know them. That is what we see in the west of Ireland and the farmer members of the Fianna Fáil Party should be ashamed of the fact that the man who leads them today has nothing but contempt for the farmers of Ireland, who says they should be thankful they are getting £6 million of a dole handout. If I described the Taoiseach as a liar, you, Sir, would force me to withdraw it, but let me say it is completely untrue to suggest that the small farmers are being subsidised in any way.</P>
      <P>There is a vast difference between the rancher farmer&mdash;and I might add to the rancher farmer those who in recent years have turned wheat farmers &mdash;and the small farmer in Ireland. When I refer to the small farmer, I mean a farmer of under £40 or £45 valuation.  That man is not getting a fair crack of the whip as far as the State is concerned over the years. There has been a great deal of talk from Fianna Fáil that they are helping the small farmer.  The figures for the last year show that last year was the worst as regards the numbers leaving the land.  Why is it?  Nobody can say this Government had to clean up a mess made in the past four years by a previous Government they describe as a Coalition Government.  That Coalition Government cannot be used as an excuse since 1957.  It will not work as far as the small farmers are concerned because over the past three years they have been leaving faster than they did in the previous four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the small farmer leaving? What is there in this Budget and in this turnover tax that will attract him to stay on here in Ireland?  I have heard Government speakers say there was more money for education, that there was an increase in the last six or seven years from £13 million to over £20 million spent on education.  Let us put it quite bluntly that the biggest proportion of the increase was in salaries.  I do not deplore that.  The teachers are entitled to their increase but there is a backlog&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for <Col N="1225" /> Finance is here opposite me&mdash;of about 800 schools condemned and needing replacement.  The replacement rate is not sufficient to catch up with the backlog, in spite of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary who is here in the House is possibly the most energetic member of the Government.</P>
    <P>How are the children of the small farmer benefiting in the educational field?  We shall not have an opportunity of discussing the Estimate for Education before the recess.  The Government think so little of it that they can postpone that discussion until next November.  There has been talk here about the money needed for afforestation.  Since when did Fianna Fáil become interested in afforestation? How many times have I been told in this House since I came here that there was no rabbit wire or fencing material and that it was consequently impossible to carry out a plantation programme because the rabbits would eat the young trees.  That answer was given here year after year by various Ministers under Fianna Fáil.  That answer was given in 1948 by a Government in power since 1932 and at no stage while they were in office from 1932 to 1948 did the forestry programme exceed a figure of 9,000 acres per year.</P>
    <P>It took the Party to which I belong and others in this House at the time to force a recognition in the minds of politicians in this House of the tremendous value to the nation of afforestation. Today the figure is over 25,000 acres.  It is not enough but it is on the right road.  We have the people opposite us who are in Government today speaking as if they were responsible for afforestation or as if they had an interest in it.  They made their position on afforestation clear over the years.  Their speakers said it was a long-term programme.  There were no votes in the planting of trees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know where the timber is.  What is there for the small farmer in the west to do?  If there were available a sufficiency of forestry work which would enable him <Col N="1226" /> to do afforestation work for portion of the year and to work his holding for the rest of the year, we could keep the small farmer in Ireland.  At present he is getting neither the afforestation work nor the return from his own holding, and the sad feature of it is that in the west of Ireland the small farmers are turning in their thousands to the county councils asking for a few months' work in the year in order to feed their families.  What do we find, that the policy of this Government, so efficient, so modern, so ready to automate in the public service, is responsible for bringing in huge machines all over rural Ireland directed by the local authorities to do the work that men who are unemployed should be doing.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister who is present tell me where is the economic commonsense in bringing a big machine into a locality where there are 25 men unemployed? That is what is happening and that policy is coming from the Custom House.  I mention that because my view is that if these machines are to be used&mdash;and I am the first to preach modernisation and automation &mdash;and if we are to automate and use the most modern methods, we must make alternative arrangements for the workers who are disemployed.  The only alternative arrangements being made for the workers who are now disemployed are in England with their families and their relations.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 months, this Government, in their modernisation drive, have offered industrialists very attractive aid through grant and loan to modernise their premises and their machinery in order to complete with foreign countries.  I understand the Government are not even satisfied with the rate at which industrialists are accepting the offers but even in so far as those attractive offers are being accepted, what is the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave an example of a certain Deputy who came running into this House as if I had made a personal attack on him when I referred to one firm not many miles from this city that received grants of £55,000 to automate portion of its industry.  One machine that was brought in displaced eight or nine girls.  I should like to <Col N="1227" /> ask the Government was any guarantee given by that company that the girls displaced by the machine would be given work in another factory in this country?  Is it not a fact that the Irish taxpayers' money is being handed out <i>ad lib</i> to industrialists to allow them to modernise their factories, premises and machines, and that so far as the Government are concerned, there is no aid for the worker?</P>
    <P>I admit the Government have set up a committee to examine the question of compensation for disturbance for workers who are put out of employment. Last week, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that so far this committee has not reported. In other words, while the so-called modernisation programme is going on, and people are being disemployed, the committee set up to look after them has not bothered to report.  That shows on whose side the Government are. The Government say they are progressive and moving to the left, in their own words.  The Government should protect the worker's job for him but we see industrialists and former pets of the Government getting grants in the hope that they will be able to survive in the competition of the Common Market, if they get in.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by suggesting to the Taoiseach that the Government have no mandate for this tax.  The public had not even an inkling that such a tax was in the mind of the Government.  The public, the people who put Fianna Fáil into office, had no clue during the last general election that the Government were moving to the left, in their own words. Supporters of Fianna Fáil today do not know where they stand.  They do not know whether Fianna Fáil are left, right or centre.  In the interests of the Party, if nothing else, they should go to the country and allow their own supporters to sort out the party and let the public in general decide who should be the next Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what purpose it was intended to achieve by sending the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands into the House this afternoon to justify this Budget, <Col N="1228" /> or to justify this Finance Bill, because it seemed to me that in his efforts to justify the action taken by the Government in the Finance Bill, he completely mistook his mission.</P>
      <P>The outstanding viciousness of the Finance Bill is that it imposes taxation on large sections of the community whose backs are not capable of bearing that taxation.  Notwithstanding that fact, the Parliamentary Secretary told the House and the community in general that everything in the garden is lovely.  He said this is the best Government that the Irish people have ever got, or ever will get.  He gave the impression that the Government are extremely popular with the people &mdash;so popular that he would not chance another general election.  He told us of the various economic achievements of the Government in general and he gave the impression that everything in the garden is lovely.</P>
      <P>If that is so&mdash;and for the purposes of argument, let us temporarily admit it is so &mdash; what is the necessity for this mass attack on the resources of the masses of the community by taking out of their pockets this year £3½ million in additional taxation, to be followed by the extraction of another £10½ million in the full 12 months of next year?  If things are as bright and cheerful on the economic front as he says they are, the case for this indiscriminate taxation collapses.  If the situation is as the Parliamentary Secretary said it is, there is no justification for the vicious taxation imposition of the purchase tax which is the cardinal feature of the Bill.  Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary cannot have it both ways.  He cannot have all that prosperity on the one hand, which he so generously exhibited for his own edification this afternoon, and at the same time, justify the imposition of a heavy rate of taxation on a large mass of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our general complaint about the Finance Bill is that it lacks imagination. There is no evidence of growth in the Budget or the Finance Bill.  The Bill is primarily a punitive measure which taxes a very large number of people.  By the very form of that taxation in the Budget and the Finance <Col N="1229" /> Bill, the Government confess an inability to raise money from developmental activities to finance the further development about which the Taoiseach spoke today.</P>
    <P>If there were faith in the Government's policy, this taxation would not be necessary.  If there were hope that what had been done in the past by the Government would fructify, there would be no need for this taxation.  If the Government were convinced that dividends would be paid out of past investments, there would be no need for the imposition of this taxation.  It is because the Government apparently have no confidence that their past or present actions will result in the development to which they at least pay oral tribute that they have taken the other course, the lazy course, of saying: &ldquo;Where can we get £10½ million as quickly as possible?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They found out the amount of goods consumed in the country and said: &ldquo;What would a 2½ per cent levy realise in 12 months?  We can, in fact, get £10½ million in that way if we have the courage to go through with it, so that is the best way of getting the £10½ million.  It may be a troublesome way.  It may be that the people do not like that way, but that is the way to get £10½ million.&rdquo;  Thus we have a purchase tax imposed in this Bill which is a clear indication that the Government have no confidence in their already applied economic policy and no confidence in their economic development for this year.</P>
    <P>The tax imposes hardship on people who are ill-equipped to bear it.  A famous politician in this country once said that every time he wanted to know what the people of the country needed, he looked into his own heart. I had hoped that method of fortunetelling and mesmerism had passed from the scene.  Are we to understand that the Taoiseach has repeated the same exercise and looked into the hearts of the old age pensioners, home assistance recipients, blind persons, sick people, those living on unemployment assistance, and thought the best remedy for those unfortunate people in our community was a purchase tax of 2½ per cent as a minimum?  There can be no <Col N="1230" /> other explanation of where the tax came from.</P>
    <P>At the last election, there was not a single indication of a food tax on the horizon.  Candidates who can talk wildly and widely on a variety of subjects at elections never mentioned such a thing.  Even the Minister for Transport and Power, who is usually sent out to fly kites, had not a word to say about the taxation of foodstuffs. Nobody mentioned it at the last election and no mandate for the taxation of foodstuffs was given in the last election.  Why?  Because no mandate was sought to tax food or other essentials of life.</P>
    <P>Twelve years ago, we had largescale subsidisation in this country but in 1952, when Fianna Fáil, who had been out of office for three years, took office, they slashed half the food subsidies after saying in the previous general election that they never had any intention of doing so.  Then six years afterwards in 1957 when Fianna Fáil got back in office again the remainder of the food subsidies were abolished.  They had sought no mandate for cutting the subsidies on that occasion either.  In their campaigns prior to the general elections of 1951 and 1957 they never mentioned that they intended to cut the food subsidies but, nevertheless, when they came back to office, without any consultation whatever with the people, they slashed the subsidies, half in 1952 and half in 1957, and we have had no subsidisation of foodstuffs or other essentials since then.</P>
    <P>Now, of course, the wheel has turned the full circle.  Another six years has elapsed since 1957 and not apparently satisfied with having abolished the last of the food subsidies in that year the Government, again without any prior notice to the people, consultation with the people or a mandate from the people, come to the Dáil now to propose taxation on practically every article the community needs for its daily existence.</P>
    <P>Foodstuffs are in the forefront of the taxation proposals announced by the Government.  Foodstuffs will bear the heaviest taxation impact under these proposals and after them virtually <Col N="1231" /> every other commodity in use by the people will be compelled to yield up its tribute of taxation to the Government because they have no confidence that their developmental programme will bring in the money to avoid the necessity for resorting to taxation of this kind.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the taxation of foodstuffs, what we have to remember is that many of the articles which will be taxed are staple articles of food used by the masses.  Taxation on butter, bread, tea, sugar and milk will press much more viciously on the poorer sections of the people than on the richer.  Bread, butter, tea, sugar, and milk are staple articles of food for the masses.  Many well-to-do people use a microscopic quantity of these commodities in the course of a week or a month but the poor have to rely on them because their slender income does not enable them to have meats for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Meat is used, perhaps, once a week, if at all, in many poorer homes throughout the country and it is in the poorer homes that this tax will be felt in all its viciousness by those who have to live on staple articles like bread, butter, tea, sugar and milk.  To the wealthy, taxation on these commodities, apart from being lighter for them because their resources are greater, is not likely to affect them very much because they are not notable consumers of these commodities which usually go hand in hand with a low standard of living.</P>
    <P>The Government hope this year to get £3½ million now in the people's pockets out of those pockets to be used for the purpose of government. Next year, if the Fianna Fáil Party are still in office, the public will have the pleasure of paying £10½ million and all this is being imposed by a Government who have no mandate to do it in this House and as a result of the votes cast at the recent election.</P>
    <P>The only occasion this question of food taxation was mentioned was the by-election in North-East Dublin. There the Government were compelled to fight on the issue of taxation of foodstuffs and other essentials of <Col N="1232" /> life and the result in the only test so far applied was that the Government candidate was overwhelmingly defeated. Do the Government seriously believe they could win a by-election tomorrow on the taxation of foodstuffs? I have got a shrewd suspicion that they know perfectly well that they could not win even a by-election much less a general election.  Because of that fact, there is now a coming-together, a great herding spirit.  &ldquo;We will sit here&rdquo; they say &ldquo;and ride out the storm rather than chance going to the people for a mandate for food taxation proposals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If North-East Dublin means anything, it means that in a limited area with a fair cross-section of people but not, perhaps, as poor as could be found in other constituencies, Government food taxation proposals have been rejected.  If the Government want to test the feelings of the people on present taxation proposals, then the simple way is to dissolve the Dáil and let us have another general election in the next few months when in any case the Dáil will not be sitting.  If the Government do that, they know perfectly well they will be defeated.  The defeat of the Government is not the first serious matter.  What is much more important is that what the people desire should be done by the Government. It is a travesty of democracy that, although a majority of the people are opposed to taxation on food, they should have that taxation imposed upon them by a Government who do not command the confidence of the people and do not control a majority of the electorate.  But they are going to have it if the Fianna Fáil Government hold on to office.</P>
    <P>It has always been a principle of the sale of goods that the price fixed is somewhat about the pre-determined value of the articles to be sold.  If you go into the market place and want to buy, you have your own assessment of the value of the goods offered for sale. You buy there, and other persons seeking the same commodity can buy, too, at approximately the same price as you pay.  That has been the practice of competitive purchasing; but it has never been the practice, and it <Col N="1233" /> ought not to be the practice, of a democratic Government.  Certainly no one engaged in taking steps to raise revenue in a democratic country would raise that revenue by imposing the same rate of taxation on the very poor as is imposed on the very rich.</P>
    <P>It seems a travesty of justice that the poor old age pensioner going into a shop to buy any commodity should be subjected to the same rate of tax as the well-to-do.  I know it will be argued that they are supposed to get some increase in their social welfare benefits but they ought to get that increase in any case.  Social welfare benefits are already too low, having regard to the increase in the cost of living and social welfare benefits, even with the additions, will still spell out a pretty grim and gaunt life for many of those condemned to live on what we pay as social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>People talk about taxation on foodstuffs being operative in Sweden.  They forget that in Sweden the workers and the people generally have the highest standard of living in Europe, having displaced the Swiss who held that record for many a year.  The standard of living is outstandingly high in Sweden and what you can do in Sweden with their standards of income and their social services is one thing; what you can do here with our wage rates and social welfare benefits is quite another.  I do not know anybody who would not willingly swop Swedish taxation proposals, even as current now, for our taxation proposals here because that swop would show a substantial rise in the standard of living of any Irish person accepting the Swedish standards.</P>
    <P>It seems to me inequitable that the very rich and the very poor should be asked to pay the same scale of taxation under this Bill.  That is a bad principle to employ.  It is a principle that should not have been adopted.  The Government have made no pretence whatever of treating the poor any differently from the rich.  They impose a single tax, assuming economic equality between the rich and the poor, an equality which is not, of course, present. They do that because they are too lazy and too inept to work out a <Col N="1234" /> scheme of taxation on luxuries, too lazy even to indicate any sympathy for the poor in the community.</P>
    <P>We have now to face up to a situation in which £10½ million will be taken out of the pockets of the people in 12 months to finance this Government's activities.  Fianna Fáil have now the doubtful honour of being the first Party to impose widespread taxation on foodstuffs and on the other essentials of life.  This is being done without authority from the people, without the consent of the people, and in the face of clear evidence of revulsion on the part of the people. We have now reached a stage in Irish public life when, if Fianna Fáil get their way, this purchase tax, involving the taxation of foodstuffs and all classes of necessaries will be a permanent feature of life in this country.</P>
    <P>You will have now under Fianna Fáil, and thanks to Fianna Fáil, and again without the authority of the people, a situation in which the newborn child will have to suffer a tax paid on its infant clothing, in which all through its adolescence and manhood, it will pay taxes every day of every week in every year during which it survives.  When we and future generations are going from this land, we will pay a tax on our coffins and the other articles characteristic of Christian burial here.</P>
    <P>That is the position in which Fianna Fáil put our people in 1963, but that is not what they promised the people in 1961.  They made no mention then that they proposed to impose taxation of this kind.  I said they have no authority for what they have done and are now doing.  They have a minority Government.  They least they ought to do, if they have any regard for democratic Government, is to go back to the people in the three months available between now and November and put their proposals before the people.  I believe that, if they do that, these proposals will be rejected because the people do not want them.  If the people do not want them, they ought not to be imposed upon the people by a Government who have no mandate from the people and none of the authority that <Col N="1235" /> can be got in a democratic State for doing the things which this Government are doing under this Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach made it quite clear this morning that we had, in his opinion, reached a point at which a decision had to be made.  To his way of thinking, a decision had to be made for the increased revenue, increased Government expenditure, increased intervention by the Government in industry, and in various spheres of our economic life, in order to employ our people and in order to progress.  We do not say, on this side of the House, that he has not the right to raise revenue.  What we do say is that all these things must be substantiated on his own past record and performance.  He must show that there is reason why he should now ask for this £10½ million in the way of turnover tax to implement his policies.  Before he was elected, he promised 100,000 new jobs over five years.  Since that date, there are in fact 50,000 fewer jobs.  Last year, 18,000 people left the land.  During that period, from 1957 to 1963, the cost of running the State has advanced by £50 million a year and, if one takes into consideration the full effect of the proposed new tax, that figure will next year by £63 million.  The Taoiseach has, in other words, an extra £50 million in revenue; there are fewer people in employment; far more have emigrated over the period.  The Taoiseach has spent that £50 million. The servicing of the public debt is dragging us down.  At the same time he says he wants £10½ million a year more to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people did not give him a mandate for all this and, if he seeks this colossal increase, he has a place in which to find out whether or not the people want done what he says should be done, to find out whether or not the people want him to continue on the way he thinks is the right way.  We do not think he has succeeded in doing the things he said he would do and we believe that his interpretation of the situation is one that will not bring greater advancement in the future.  He <Col N="1236" /> has on more than one occasion taken the same line as he took this morning. If you read the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 13th June you will see that he said there that Government expenditure was the life blood of the economy.</P>
    <P>We realise that in a complex State such as you get in 1963 intervention by the Government in certain activities is inevitable but while it is inevitable, there should at the same time be encouragement for private enterprise. Because surely ten or 20 small industries, or even larger industries, founded on private enterprise with the profit motive, will have a better chance of providing constant employment than the activities indulged in by the Government in their intervention in some industries over the past few years.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Times</i> today, there is an article by the economist Garret Fitzgerald.  He deals with the various industrial projects which we have seen initiated through Government intervention of a major kind over the past five or six years.  He mentions the Avoca Mines, which has had an extraordinary and chequered career and in which this side of the House was involved at the start but not in respect of the introduction of vast sums of money at a later stage.  He mentions Irish Steel Holdings, Verolme and the Industrial Engineering Company of Dundalk and Potez. In all these cases, we find that while the Government intervened, complete success was not their lot.  We do not get mistakes of this sort in organised private enterprise operations.  If you get firms like Verolme coming in with their own money because they feel there is a profit to be made here, you will find that in 99 cases out of 100, they will succeed.  If Potez, who have not reached that difficulty yet, but who are asking for a large investment&mdash;larger than we thought&mdash;had all their own money and came in here in that situation, you would find that they would be 99 per cent successful.  It is possible with these large organisations to forecast the market and see to it that they do not make mistakes.  If we are to invest large sums of Government money in these enterprises, we <Col N="1237" /> have to have some tie on them.  These people, having taken the money and invested what is often a nominal sum themselves, can lightly take the risk, a calculated risk&mdash;a great phrase of the Taoiseach&mdash;and if the risk does not come off, it is easy to lop off the Irish industrial arm.  That is the situation we have to face up to.  I feel the Taoiseach stands condemned on this particular facet.  He was prepared to take a calculated risk and the odds were too great.  Having done that, he did not insert the proviso which would ensure that it would not pay these people to lop off the Irish arm and go home.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I entertained a Dutch economist and he was quite amazed to hear that these provisos did not exist.  He instanced examples in Holland where there had been investment, particularly American investment by large companies, and there were provisos under which they had to leave a very large sum in balance for as long as seven or eight years and whereby there was an arrangement for the withdrawal of profits which did not make it so easy for them to lop off these industries and go home and write off small losses that perhaps could be written in in their own country to save tax.  There is another score on which the Taoiseach can stand condemned.  It is that if you put a lot of Government money in and at the same time put in the top executives, then on your decisions lies the success or failure of the industry.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a particular industry in my own constituency which has been characterised by the lack of debate on it over the past five or six years.  I am the only Opposition Deputy from that constituency and as far as I was concerned my policy was that in regard to the Industrial Engineering Company the least said the better and that we would give the Government every opportunity and that we would not be hypercritical about their mistakes.  If top executives are sent there, and to other companies, and the choice is that of the Taoiseach, then if they do not do their job he is the one who must stand condemned. I refer to the fact that he <Col N="1238" /> sent Mr. Percy Reynolds to Dundalk, a man with no record in industry that could have fitted him for the task.  I feel that the picture painted in the <i>Irish Times</i> today is largely an historic picture.  Things will improve there from now on.  Let me say that the resignation of every executive in the entire group of companies was with the secretary and the secretary's resignation was with the board and yet Mr. Reynolds did not take himself out of there forthwith.  I want to accuse the Taoiseach of sending somebody there who has lost perhaps £1 million of Government money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attacking the Minister and I am saying that I did not raise this matter for six years. We have got to debate whether or not the Taoiseach was right or wrong in investing perhaps £50 million over the past five years; whether or not he was a gambler taking a calculated risk in backing an outsider.  That is the last time until there is a fixed debate on it that I will raise this matter.  If you want to look at the records, you will see that I have raised this matter on very few occasions.  I believe whatever loss there was in employment was attributable to the Taoiseach's choice. I believe the companies will improve now and if not prosper, certainly salvage a great measure of the employment from the situation created by the particular man.  There will be every support from this side of the House if they persist in their efforts to preserve employment there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill is characterised by something else.  While the Taoiseach says he needs this money to invest in Irish industry in our whole capital formation, there is no incentive within that Bill to anybody within the private enterprise sector of the economy to reinvest; rather is the till being raided to the extent that retrospective corporation profits tax is increased by 50 per cent.  Deputy Sweetman gave a list of the companies which had already <Col N="1239" /> declared their dividends, already produced their balance sheet and decided on their capital expenditure.  Will this retrospective taxation mean that the money they intended spending on new machinery and on extension to plant and premises will be taken from them? There could have been a provision in this Bill whereby reinvested profits would have been treated likewise.  No such provision has been included and on that score also the Government stand accused.</P>
    <P>One other factor is obvious to everybody. It is that Government expenditure costs money: if the Government want to spend £1, it has to be done in a very deliberate way; you must have the Revenue Commissioners and the civil servants to see that £1 is not misdirected.  In fact, the investment of that £1 costs the Government far more than it costs a private individual to invest in Irish industry through the buying of machinery or the extension of his premises.</P>
    <P>Last night on the Report Stage, the Minister for Justice replied to a question by me after I had given instances of people in my constituency who would be very badly hit by the turnover tax.  His reply was that the social welfare provisions and the increase in children's allowances would more than compensate.  He produced figures which could not be contradicted because of lack of time or opportunity to intervene.  He suggested that the small farmers would be more than compensated for the effects of this turnover tax.  Deputy Norton gave the answer to that a few moments ago when he said that year by year there have been necessary increases in social welfare benefits and that the Government were now chalking off against this tax any little improvements they had given over the years.</P>
    <P>The normal annual increase in social welfare benefits in every Budget during the ten years I have been here has been of the order of £3 million to £3½ million.  This year it is £3½ million. In other words, this weighing of the scales is a completely dishonest political move.  If you are to chalk up <Col N="1240" /> the turnover tax, you may chalk it up against all of the people, rich and poor. That is the fundamental reason why it cannot succeed.  It will be very difficult to remove, but the first chance the electorate get they will fling this Government out on their political necks because they have taxed the farm labourer on the essential commodities at the same level as they have taxed the man who can afford a fur coat for his wife or whose wife can afford a second motor car.  No amount of argument from Deputy Sherwin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or from the Government will change that situation. It is true to say it is the private individual who will be bit most severely by this tax.  The argument has been made that the rich man spends more, that he pays the 2½ per cent on a greater amount of money.  They forget that the rich man has other advantages. If he has a car, he writes it against his business; if he has lunch he writes it against his business.  That will mean his profits within the business will be reduced but it will not mean that whatever he draws in salary will be reduced accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no secret.  The country knows it.  The question of taxing expenditure in industry and capital formation because the Minister wants £10½ million arises here as also does the question as to whether his action in this respect, especially since membership of the EEC came on the horizon, was correct.  When Britain was seeking admission to the EEC, we on this side of the House gave the opportunity to the Government to proceed with their negotiations un-harassed and unrestricted, and in fact we were severely criticised throughout the country because our criticism then was neither severe nor harsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the British negotiations broke down, we decided to give the Government any opportunity they wanted to get the negotiations under way.  What did they do?  The great supporter of tariffs and quotas, the Taoiseach, <Col N="1241" /> decided on a rhythm of tariff reduction over the years, ten per cent now and ten per cent again.  We on this side of the House feel&mdash;Deputies Sweetman and Cosgrave have referred to it&mdash; that this was the wrong idea.  The Irish industrialist who had been nurtured behind tariff walls and quota protection is now being thrown to the wolves until by 1970 there will be completely free trade as far as the EEC is concerned.  I do not think that is the right line.</P>
    <P>We feel that if we are to reduce tariffs in this way, we should get some sort of <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangement from those with whom we deal.  France sells us seven times as much as we succeed in selling to her and when the Government had an order recently for £250,000, could they not have said to the French: &ldquo;Take a little more of our land.&rdquo;  Land was fetching an excellent price on the French market. I repeat that we need some <i>quid pro quo</i> in respect of every country with which we deal, that we should get something in return for what we give.  Britain has agreed on a rhythm of tariff reduction with the EFTA countries. It means that as time goes on we will find a greater variety of goods from a greater variety of countries competing against us on the British market. There is therefore bound to be a diminishing of our sales on the British Market.</P>
    <P>At the same time, of course, it is necessary that we should accelerate our activities in the British market as well in order to increase our sales there and to withstand the competition that will come as Britain reduces her tariffs against the EFTA countries.  It is not happening.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach just says there will be 10 per cent tariff reduction.  The Leader of the Opposition asked the Taoiseach whether, if this happened, the motor assembly industry would collapse and agreement was reached that if this procedure happened and these tariff reductions were made rhythmically at certain periods, then without doubt our motor assembly industry would collapse.  It is an <Col N="1242" /> industry employing quite a few thousand people.  If we have to enter free trade&mdash;which, at the end, will be best for us&mdash;then at the same time, we should not do it with our eyes closed. We should do it with our eyes open at all times.</P>
    <P>We had from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands the usual question as to what alternative taxation we would propose.  The answer to that is that before the last election we printed our specific programme. The Labour Party mentioned today that they printed their specific programme and they alleged it was in even more detail than ours.  I agree that both of those statements are true. It is also true that the Government printed no programme and sought a blank cheque.</P>
    <P>If the people want to know what we are going to do there is our programme for you but if we are going to say to the Government of today: &ldquo;We will impose alternative taxation, if it is necessary, on certain items.&rdquo; then, immediately, we know in our political wisdom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is exactly it. The Government know quite clearly that if we were to propose different taxation, or to say there are certain prunings that can be done, then, if we mentioned these specific prunings, everything we were going to do would be twisted by the Government and Government backbenchers in every constituency in rural Ireland would go around saying to the people: &ldquo;You will lose your jobs if Fine Gael get in.&rdquo; Here in my hands is a copy of the Book of Estimates.</P>

      <P>There are 328 pages in this Book.  If alternatives and economies cannot be found within that Book and if there are not excellent <Col N="1243" /> changes in legislation that will bring more employment and more economic activity to this State, then we on this side of the House are mistaken.  We believe that within this Book of Estimates we can do the job and the job we intend to do can be seen printed in our policy for the last election and you will see it printed in our policy for the next election which will not be too long.  We know we can find our taxation within that Book to meet what we intend to do.  Anybody who wants to produce the alternatives can take that, step by step.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands went further than anybody else, as usual.  There was a time in Boyle, I think, when he said this taxation would cover expensive commodities such as jewellery and fur coats.  He went a bit further today and said they were the people who believed that the lead must be an investment by the Government.  We on this side of the House believe that certainly there must be investment by the Government in ths complex year of 1963 but we similarly believe that if the incentives are given to industry and agriculture we shall get from the people the investment and the effort that will bring a greater result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want to see the difference now between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael it is quite clear.  It is that Fianna Fáil have rejected the idea of the people doing anything to help themselves and that the Taoiseach has gone back again to 1952 when he said it was better for the people that we should spend more for them and that they should spend less for themselves; that, instead of ? in every £, 6/6 or 7/6 in every £ should be spent by the Government.  We believe, on the contrary, that while it is necessary that there should be intervention by the Government in certain specific undertakings, at the same time, the people, if they get the encouragement, if they get the tax incentives, if they adopt, for instance, in this Finance Bill a removal of income tax in respect of profits left behind and invested in capital expenditure on works within a business, will do more for themselves <Col N="1244" /> and the Government would be better employed in keeping out of their lives and leaving them to proceed with their own advancement.</P>
    <P>This Bill is also most obnoxious for other specific reasons.  It has set the precedent of income tax for farmers. There is a provision in this Bill whereby people who let their land on the 11 months system must pay income tax thereon.  I know many cases of decent men and women who have reached the evening of their lives and who are holding their farms for a nephew or a son to be old enough to farm.  During the intervening period they have not the physical strength to farm the land themselves.  During that period, they are paying their rates, their rent, all their taxes, as they go along.  Now they are to be asked to pay income tax as well.  This is a bad precedent for the very good reason that the farmer pays rates not only on his house, not only on his outhouses but also on his land. You will find that a farmer earning £500 a year will be paying three or four times as much in rates as the man earning £500 a year in any other business.</P>

      <P>The man with the salary of £500 a year is paying very little in rates.  Largely, he is a £10 a week man.  He is probably living in a Housing of the Working Classes house. In his rent, there is a certain amount of rates.  In my constituency, I would estimate his rates at about £15 a year, if you take what we give him.  The farmer who would have that income would be paying £60 or £70 in rates and that is the whole basis of opposition to income tax on farmers.  If you make the farmer pay it as well, he will be paying two taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man has a public house and a farm down the country he will now have to put up his accounts for his farm.  He will have the expense of keeping them and he will have to pay ordinary income tax instead of valuation tax on farming activities.  When this Bill was introduced we thought the position was that the Revenue Commissioners would ask only for this <Col N="1245" /> in the case where a man's standard of living was such that there was a clear indication that he was defrauding the Revenue Commissioners by not returning sufficient profits from his business. As far as we know now, the Revenue Commissioners have a clear right to ask that man to produce accounts in respect of his farm.  These are two bad precedents and we on this side of the House could not stand by them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which must and will arise as sure as sun follows day is that the ordinary worker in this country will now work one-and-a-half weeks in every year for the Government.  He is probably working five or six for them as it is.  Once this turnover tax comes in, he is going to work another one-and-a-half weeks for the Government. Immediately he does this, his trade unions will try to retrieve what he has lost.</P>

Their unions will retrieve this 1½ weeks for them, but that will have to be added to the cost of production. The net result will be that we will be in a worse position than before, so far as exports are concerned.  In addition to paying 2½ per cent on everything he buys, the unfortunate consumer will have to pay for this increase in the cost of production.  The burden will be far heavier than this 2½ per cent, and I forecast it will be a factual ten per cent.  The members of the Labour Party would be in a better position to say what is the average percentage of wages represented by the cost of production. I regard it as extremely high, and you may take it there will be a savage increase in the cost of living, not only because of the 2½ per cent but also because of increased cost of production.</P>

But if one of you boys resigned, we would come back with 72 to 71 against you.  The plan is clear.  You want to get a surplus next year, have a general election and go back for five years.

      <P>The reason there are not so many in this House so often is that every Deputy is &ldquo;browned off&rdquo; with what he hears daily.  He does not come in here except when he wants to make his own contribution or cast his vote.  It has been decided by politicians for a long time that the majority of <Col N="1247" /> people have a &ldquo;chump&rdquo; mentality. Machiavelli summed that up in his advice on how to get votes.  The assumption is that the majority of people live only in the present and are concerned only with the things immediately around them, that they do not analyse, because that requires effort and training, and that they do not look into the future.  Because of that, you can cod them up to their eyes. You have only to paint a picture, any picture, and they accept it and convey it to their companions.</P>
      <P>It is because of that there is so much codology.  It is hard to blame politicians.  If they told the truth, they would never get elected.  I happen to be one of those people who gives his whole time&mdash;not just a little bit of his time&mdash;to local affairs.  I probably have met the majority of the members of my constituency in person.  They come and say they want a house.  Having asked them the usual questions and knowing the housing position, I tell them: &ldquo;You have no chance; you do not come under the regulations.&rdquo; I have to argue with them for half an hour and I cannot convince them.  There is only one other way out&mdash;I reject it, but the other fellows do not&mdash;and that is to kid them and tell them: &ldquo;O.K. Give me your name and address and I will do my best for you.&rdquo;  The fellow who cods them wastes no time and loses no votes.  He knows as well as I do they have no chance, but he tells them that he will do his best for them.</P>
      <P>If you attempt to tell the truth, you wind up by having them tell you: &ldquo;You are no damn use and you will not get my vote again.&rdquo;  That sums up politicians.  They cannot tell the truth unless they work like trojans to win votes.  I can afford to tell the truth because I work so hard that I have enough friends to put me in.  Because the other fellows diddle-daddle, they cannot depend on work to put them in and they must depend on codology to win.  I sympathise with those members who have to cod people, because I appreciate people's ambition to get in here and stay in here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going further, I want to <Col N="1248" /> quote again from President Kennedy's book&mdash;he is fond of quotations from history just as I am&mdash;a quotation from Frank Kent, an important American writer.  He said:</P>
    <P>Probably the most important single accomplishment for the politically ambitious is the fine art of seeming to say something without doing so....</P>
    <P>&mdash;That is the Opposition&mdash;</P>
    <P>The important thing is not to be on the right side of the current issue, but on the popular side....</P>
    <P>&mdash;That is the Opposition&mdash;</P>
    <P>... regardless of your own convictions or the facts.  This business of getting votes is a severely practical one into which matters of morality, of right and wrong, should not be allowed to enter.</P>
    <P>That is politics.</P>

      <P>Frank Kent, quoted by President Kennedy.  Let us get back now to this turnover tax.  On several occasions, I thought I was going to hear an alternative to this tax but never have I heard it.  Deputy Donegan I thought for a moment was going to tell me but then he said &ldquo;Oh, no; we won't.  We would be misquoted.&rdquo;  But while he claims the right to misquote the Government, he refuses to give them the same right to misquote.  He wants secrecy and does not want to give the same right as he claims.  It amounts to that.  They were his own words&mdash;&ldquo;We are not going to do it because we would be misquoted.&rdquo;  But he claimed the right to misquote the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had heard some alternative, he would have some excuse for wanting me to fight it but how can I do it?  I have my own convictions.  I am not here trying to pull in some Party group.  That is a great advantage an Independent has.  He speaks for himself only.  I have not got to pull in a lot of people, some of whom may be good, others not so good, and others weaklings.  The Party man has to fight for his whole group, to lie for his <Col N="1249" /> group.  If I have to lie, it is only for myself so it will only be a little lie compared with their lie.</P>
    <P>We had a by-election which was fought largely on the basis that this was going to be an outrageous tax on food, and during the campaign there were cartoons in the evening and morning papers to this effect.  This is proof that they accept that a large number of the electorate are chumps.  This was issued by Fine Gael, 18 Hume Street.  It was one of the many issued and was dated Saturday, May 30th, in the <i>Herald</i>.  A shopkeeper is selling a lollipop to a child and he says &ldquo;It is now 2½d.  It was 2d. and I must give this gentleman the other halfpenny.&rdquo; Underneath it says that the tax goes to the Government, not to the shopkeeper. Let us examine that.  That is the basis on which they fought the campaign.  The Government say only a halfpenny for every ten lollipops sold.  That is all, but this cartoon stated that the Government wanted a halfpenny on every lollipop and that was the reason why the shopkeeper had to charge 2½d., whereas the Government wanted only a halfpenny on every ten lollipops.  A halfpenny on ?&mdash;that is the tax.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Opposition were accusing their pals, the monied crowd, who fought the election for them and won it, of being outrageous profiteers. Robbers, in fact, is the best word to describe it.  They were actually saying: &ldquo;Our pals the shopkeepers are making a halfpenny on ten lollies and will give one to the Government&rdquo; because that was the position.  The Opposition took it that the people were so chumpy that they would not see through this and things like it.  That is the basis on which politicians approach the ordinary man in the street&mdash;that they are chumps, that they cannot reason, they cannot analyse, they cannot count, they will not bother to do these things but will just accept them, whereas the whole truth is that if the shopkeeper charges a halfpenny on every lollipop, he is going to put almost 1,000 per cent into his own pocket and give a halfpenny to the Government, though he might not even give that halfpenny <Col N="1250" /> because, do not forget, he could &ldquo;hook&rdquo; a bit and give less but certainly would not give more.  The whole basis of the whole campaign in Dublin North-East was a fraud on the basis of that cartoon and similar arguments.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that anything will be charged on small amounts, and if anyone does charge, then the customers have the remedy in their own hands&mdash;not to buy from them.  That will happen; do not worry.  We have heard this talk about the tax on food being the same for everyone&mdash;for the poor and the millionaire.  Let us analyse that.  As everybody knows, the well-to-do spend considerably more than the poor man. Therefore in accordance with that, he will pay more tax.  If the poor man goes and buys a fish and chip, he will pay a halfpenny on it, but the fellow with the money will go in for his steak and chicken and probably pay a £ for it and pay a fistful to the Government. As against the poor man's halfpenny, the wealthy fellow with the money will pay 6d. and that all goes into the kitty. Do not forget that the well-to-do folk often have two and three dinners a day.  Such a man has his usual dinner, he has meat and other luxuries for his tea and will do enough stuffing and be very full every night.  All this steak and chicken and caviare crowd will have to pay on that surplus spending, and all that money is going into the kitty which can be used for the common good for a year and henceforth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an example, let us suppose for argument's sake that there was to be no tax on food.  The Government would probably lose £2 million of what they would lose to the monied crowd, because if the poor had not to <Col N="1251" /> pay it, the fellows at the top would also not have to pay it, and you will be losing the revenue from the crowd who go into Clerys, into the Gresham, or into any cafe or restaurant in the city.  The Government would lose all that money and would have to find other means and eventually that loss would probably fall on the poor people because they always pay, while this is the sort of tax that gets at the crowd with the money.  The poor man can only spend 2½ per cent on what he has had to buy, perhaps a shilling a week, but the other fellow will probably have to shell out 10/- or 15/- in the week.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy is: &ldquo;We will charge the poor man a `bob' but give it back to him.&rdquo;  That is just the same as going into a pub and asking a friend to have a pint.  You are not going to give him a pint unless he gives you one back again.  It is the same thing if the Government charge the poor and are going to get it from the well-to-do.  They will give it back to the poor and therefore will charge the poor nothing.  That is elementary, but that is not the way the matter was put to the electorate of Dublin North-East and that is why I am saying that the whole campaign was a fraud.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister want the money for?  We all know that there was a deficit of £6 or £7 million and that no increase in benefits could be expected this year.  It is no use saying that they should be granted this year. In 1956, your bum year, you gave nothing at all to any of the non-contributory sections&mdash;not a penny to any of them&mdash;but you charged an extra &ldquo;tanner&rdquo; on every packet of 20 cigarettes that year.  The workers smoke cigarettes, so they were being charged as much as what the Government are now looking for in the £, put on to every packet of 20 cigarettes, and the Government gave nothing back in 1956.</P>
    <P>In 1957, the Government were so bankrupt that they would have got nothing but the new Government came in and gave them one shilling.  On the coalition Budget, they would get nothing in 1957 as they had <Col N="1252" /> got nothing in 1956.  At least if this Government are charging a little on food, to get something from the people with the money, their policy is to give it back to the poor and so, in effect, they are taking nothing from the poor.</P>
    <P>They are giving 2/6 to the old age pensioner, to the unemployed man and his wife, if the shopkeepers, the pals of the Opposition do not rob them. That is the equivalent of the tax on expenditure of £5.  Rents are not included, nor bus fares nor certain insurances, so that the old age pensioner who has 32/6 or 35/- to spend will only pay out 10d.  Despite all the tears that have been shed for him by the Opposition it will cost him nothing.  Nor will it cost the family with children anything.  A letter in the papers abusing me said the first child would get 2/6 a month.  The truth is the first child gets 2/6 every week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is splitting hairs.  Up to now, the first child got nothing but now gets 10/- a month.  For the second child, there is 4/6 a month and for every other child.  If there are four children, there is 4/6 every week in this Budget for the family.  If the Father is a labourer and his wife spends, say, £7 or £8, she will only hand out 3/- or 4/- of the 4/6.  Therefore, it costs the family with children nothing.  In the case of a man with two children, he has no responsibilities.  It is the big families the Opposition were shouting about.  The man with two children gets 2/6, so that if he has to pay anything it will be only 1/- a week towards his own father or mother, perhaps, or his own future or a neighbour's.  All these people pay out 4/- or 5/- to pools every week.  I see the collector stopping at almost every door.  They practically never win but 1/- does not mean anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man with one child will get 2/6 and the most he will have to hand out to meet the tax is 1/-.  The man with no children will have to pay a &ldquo;couple of bob&rdquo; but, of course, that point is not made here&mdash;the only couple who will have to pay a few shillings are <Col N="1253" /> those with no children, but they can afford it.</P>
    <P>If there was a sales tax cigarettes and drink would have to bear a heavy increase seeing that the Government would lose so much money when their hand would be out of the rich man's pocket.  This tax keeps their hand in where the interest comes from money in the bank and profits from stocks and shares and gambling and all that sort of &ldquo;wangled&rdquo; money.  This tax will make a big sweep on that group.  That is why these people were in such a frenzy to defeat the tax in the past few months.  A sales tax would have to go on a considerable amount of goods; the number excluded would be insignificant. It stands to reason the workers would have to pay twice as much because if the well-to-do, the chicken-and-chop people are being relieved, the poorer people must make up the difference.  If beer went up, it would have to be by a penny on the stout and twopence on the pint at least but in this budget there is only need for both to go up ½d. because the tax on ? is only ½d. or 1d. on ¾.  A publican may charge only ½d. on stout and ½d. on the pint now and come out on the right side.  Suppose the fellow with £4 or £5 in his pocket who drinks 20 or 30 pints at the week-end&mdash;you often read of him in the in the papers&mdash;has 40 pints on Saturday and Sunday night on each of which he would have to pay an additional 2d. as against ½d. in this tax, he will be saved about 8/- because the rich man is being made to pay instead.</P>

      <P>We heard about the Government depending on one or two votes.  Surely Fine Gael with their 45 seats are not a majority Party next to the Government?  We have Labour with 16, Clann na Talmhan with two, one for Clann na Poblachta, two Progressive Democrats and four Independents who go from Billy to Jack regularly.  That is the collection the Opposition try to compare to a big Party of 70 and two individuals.  There is no comparison.</P>
      <P>Suppose the Opposition had their wish.  I am as astute a politician as any.  I know they have had a chance they will never get again because they managed to fool the people into believing things like the lollipop yarn.  They had the monied people on their side. Last night a member of the Opposition said how much one firm would lose through a corporation profits tax being retrospective.  Obviously, if one firm were going to lose that, the Opposition would expect half of it in the campaign and naturally they would expect it from thousands of firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit they had a great chance for once in a lifetime but there campfires are burning low now because these people are now doing a deal for themselves. The high hope now is that a Deputy will die and that the Government will lose a seat but let me remind the Opposition that they will never get 71 again on any other issue but this issue.  In this connection, terror was applied and many of these fellows were terrorised as much by the crowd who were pressing them, on the one hand, as by the danger that there would be an election on the other.  As Shakespeare put it, they died deaths in the past few weeks.  I can assure the Opposition, whether the Government lose a seat or not, it will not make any difference.  In the past few votes, a few <Col N="1255" /> of the Opposition were missing.  I heard some of them saying: &ldquo;I am voting no more.&rdquo;  Having voted on the principle of the Bill, they felt they had done enough to save themselves for the gang outside so they said: &ldquo;I am going to save my seat now.&rdquo;  That is why the Opposition had only 65 last night.</P>
    <P>Getting back to all this terror that was applied to Deputy Leneghan and myself, let me say that on the night of the vote on the Second Reading, I had to fight a row with four fur-coated women in the restaurant.  Deputy Mullen was asked to call me and he will verify that.  How did they get in here?  They used threats and blackmail, what they would not do to prevent my being elected in future.  I told them to go to hell and that was two hours before the vote.  The Taoiseach was right about blackmail.  If people can go as far as these women went, who got in here with the help of the Opposition, what can we expect for the future if by chance the miracle happened and those in opposition became the Government?  In any event, they could not win enough seats for an overall majority because PR does not give that opportunity.  It is only a marginal seat that the Government would lose.  Even if the Opposition got eight or nine more seats between them, they would still need the support of a few Independents.  How much could they depend on them? What about the blackmailing of those who are not made of the stuff that Deputy Leneghan and myself are made of?  What chance would they have?</P>
    <P>It is my opinion there will be no election for two or three years.  As I have said, the Opposition will get no more 71's.  I am not denying this tax is a nuisance.  All taxes are.  An issue like this cannot be put to the people with the expectation of winning.  If that were done, it would be going back to the potatoes and salt of the past, back to the workhouses, because people individually are selfish.  They do not like sacrificing themselves or giving anything away.  We do not forget that the great success of Sinn Féin in 1918 was due to the fact that the <Col N="1256" /> British were imposing conscription and people voted for Sinn Féin to save themselves.  The same occurred when Abraham Lincoln introduced conscription to win the fight against slavery and people did not want to accept it.</P>
    <P>Issues like that cannot be put to the people.  They can only be put to the people afterwards, in good time when the scheme has been allowed to operate. People cannot be asked to make decisions while they are stupefied with lies.  It was said to me: &ldquo;If there is a general election to-morrow, you will lose votes.&rdquo;  I admit that but I would not lose many.  I have many friends. I am not a deputy who depends on having my name in the paper.  I depend on hard work.  It was also said to me: &ldquo;Frank, in a year or two, you will head the poll.&rdquo;  Let us examine that. Why should I head the pole in a year or two any more than now?  Is it that the Opposition are hiding something, that they are afraid everything will turn out well for the country, so that the money will be in the kitty to give out to the old age pensioners and all the other recipients of social welfare benefits?  That is what the Opposition are afraid of.</P>
    <P>Are they afraid that time will prove that the Government are right, that the Government will have a chance of vindicating their policy, and is it that the Opposition do not want to give them that chance?  Deputy Donegan says to the people: &ldquo;We will not let you know what our policy is because you might vote against us.&rdquo;  In any event, I am not worried if there is an election to-morrow.

      <P>When the Taoiseach was speaking this morning, he set the standard because he gave it as his opinion that there were only two sides here: the patriots on his side and the anti-nationals on the other.  That was a very inaccurate way of putting the whole problem because, as has often been said before, the patriots are not all on the one side.  We all have our faults, and we all have our merits.  The Taoiseach should be man enough to admit that a lot of the faults in this House lie with the Party he leads.</P>
      <P>He referred to the National Productivity Council and he pointed out how wonderful it would be if employer-labour relations brought about the situation in which productivity and wages could be tied together.  He said that excluded agriculture. One of the big problems in this country is that the agricultural worker is excluded from everything. About 80 per cent of the agricultural workers are still getting only £6 per week for a 50-hour week.  Yet, they will be asked to pay this turnover tax as well as everyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in anyone trying to suggest that people go into shops and buy pounds worth of commodities and, therefore, they pay only 6d. in the £.  We all know that the poorer people are the more likely they are to <Col N="1259" /> buy items of food in small quantities. The Minister has said that the shopkeeper is entitled to collect his tax on everything, in any way he likes.  Of course, he will collect it on the small items as well as the big items, despite what Deputy Sherwin said.  The result will be that people will find themselves paying a tax which will not represent 6d. in the £ but very much more.</P>
    <P>It may be said that everyone must pay his share but surely the Minister will admit that this tax was brought in primarily to catch people whose incomes are so small that they are not caught for income tax.  I am sure the Minister knows that no matter how we look at it, a person who pays £6 per week on the necessaries of life will pay 3/- at the very least, and as was suggested earlier today it may be nearer to 10/- per week, in tax.  That is £26 a year.  If everyone were asked to pay income tax at that rate there would be uproar in the House.  A few moments ago Deputy Sherwin said that it would be rich people only who would be caught with this tax on food. I think he referred to them as the &ldquo;chop and chicken&rdquo; people.  He said they would have to pay more than the person buying batch bread, for example.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin was not here when the Minister made his statement that the amount which would be paid on the foodstuffs was one per cent because, he said, if foodstuffs were excluded, the turnover tax would have to be increased to three and a half per cent.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  Surely that blows sky-high Deputy Sherwin's argument that the &ldquo;chop and chicken&rdquo; people would pay millions in tax on food.</P>
    <P>No one will buy the argument Government speakers have been trying to put across that the purpose of this tax is to pay extra social welfare benefits.  We all know there is a proposal to increase certain social welfare assistance by 2/6 per week from 1st November.  We also know there is a proposal to increase the children's allowance.  The first child will now get 10/- a month, which does <Col N="1260" /> not represent 2/6 a week, because 10/a month is £6 a year, and it must be divided by 52 and not 48.  There is nothing extra for the second child, and for each succeeding child there is 4/- a month, which is nearly 1/- a week.</P>
    <P>If the Minister suggests that the purpose for which this turnover tax is being put on is to pay those social welfare benefits, surely the sensible thing would be to forget about increasing the social welfare benefits, and forget about the turnover tax. The Minister knows well&mdash;possibly the members of his Party do not know quite so well&mdash;that the amount which will be collected will cover far more than the social welfare benefits.  The amount which it is expected to collect from the tax this year is £3½ million.  Spread over four months that is quite a sizable sum.  I am sure the Minister also knows that in the four months, November, December, January and February&mdash;the months immediately after the tax is imposed&mdash;nothing will be bought except the bare necessaries of life.  If he hopes to collect £3½ million in the first four months, I wonder would he be prepared to say tonight what he hopes to collect in a full year, because £10½ million does not seem to me to fill the bill.</P>
    <P>Maybe there is a lot in what Deputy Sherwin said about the suggestion that the Government by holding off for a couple of years would have a lot of money to spend and would therefore be able to give tax reliefs.  If they want to give tax reliefs, let them do it now and do away with the turnover tax.  That is the only tax relief they have been able to give and that will settle it, once and for all.</P>
    <P>I was hoping that the Minister for Justice would remain here a few minutes longer so that I mght find out whether the amount collected in turnover tax would be used to pay the proposed increase to the Guards.  I understand that there is a recommendation to give an increase and there seems to be great secrecy about it. Nobody wants to say anything about it until the Dáil goes into recess and it will be three months before any <Col N="1261" /> awkward questions will have to be answered about it.  Perhaps the Minister will find the answer to that one.</P>
    <P>During the discussion of amendments on Committee Stage, there was considerable confusion.  Two amendments were put down, one of them by the Minister about raising an amount of £500 by £250, and a similar amendment referring to the same section, the same subsection&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, a different subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the same line. The Minister will not get away from that because it is on record: the same section, the same subsection and the same line.  It suggested raising an amount from £500 to £750.  Before the question was put, I asked the Ceann Comhairle was the effect not as follows: if amendment No. 23 were carried, then amendment No. 24 could not be moved. The Ceann Comhairle is on record in the Official Debates as saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, that that was the position.  Yet we had the two gentlemen, Deputies Sherwin and Leneghan, who proposed increasing the £500 to £750, trooping into the lobby to vote against their own amendment with the Minister for Finance and the Government.  The Minister said very graciously: &ldquo;All right, boys. On the Report Stage, I will introduce an amendment increasing the amount to £750.&rdquo;  He very cutely twisted it round and in the Bill now is an amendment which could not be accepted when it was put down by two members of the House but was accepted the following night when it was put down by the Government.  That sort of thimble-rigging will not do</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it very clear and definite that the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle was that if amendment <Col N="1262" /> No. 23 were carried, amendment No. 24 could not be moved.  Therefore, they were on the same thing.</P>
      <P>The question has been asked about the turnover tax: how much will it cost the ordinary person?  I have already referred to what it is going to cost the poorer people&mdash;and practically everybody in the country is in that category&mdash;who buy items in small quantities.  I interrupted Deputy Donegan to say that the trade unions will insist, wage pause or no wage pause, that their members get full compensation for the loss they are going to suffer.  As a result of that, there will be an increase in costs and I suppose a further increase passed along to the consumer and the blame for all must rest with the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>I wonder also as a matter of interest whether the Minister is aware that already, in an effort to beat the tax and to have increases before the tax comes along, quite a number of items, particularly in chemists' shops, have been increased very substantially since 1st July.  Of course they can continue to do that and I am afraid they may do the same with groceries and other items after 1st November because the Minister for Industry and Commerce has very effectively salted away the only piece of legislation which would keep prices down, that is, the Prices Advisory Body.  He has made very sure that it will not be used and in reply to Deputy Corish here this afternoon, he made it clear that there was no intention of having the Prices Advisory Body or other legislation for the purpose of keeping down prices, no matter what way they went after the 2½ per cent tax was put on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other thing which I would like the Minister to try to explain because the other evening I am afraid he was a bit confused about it and eventually the House was as confused as he was: the question of different types of prices applying to building materials, particularly paints which are a common thing at certain times of the year.  If I am right, the Minster said that if somebody goes to a shop to buy paint for a new house, <Col N="1263" /> it will not be subject to tax but if he goes to the same shop and buys paint to paint an old house, windows, doors or what have you, it is subject to tax. If that is so, perhaps the Minster might be able to explain how on earth he proposes that that is going to work. I am sure there are a number of other instances to similar effect.</P>
    <P>The question of a referendum was raised and the Taoiseach and Deputy Dillon agreed that there would be no chance at all of having a referendum on this point.  They made the point, the pretty good point, that you cannot have a referendum on everything and that Deputy Norton was wrong to suggest it.  I should like to point out, however, that this is not a simple matter which is being brought before the House, because it is something entirely new.  It was bad enough after the firm promise that the food subsidies would not be removed to have them removed, but we now have for the first time in this country legislation to tax food.  Surely it is not unreasonable that there should be some reference to the people who have elected the Government?  If they do not want an election, why not do it by way of referendum to find out whether the people of the country are agreed that this is the way to do it?</P>
    <P>There has been awful talk about what RGDATA wanted and what other trade organisations wanted.  I am one of the people who think that RGDATA have their own problems and other trade organisations have theirs, but we in the Labour Party are interested not in the traders but in the consumers and in the people who just will not be able to meet the tax without severe hardship.  Whether a solution will suit RGDATA or suit other people is a matter for themselves and we do not want to quarrel with them in that way.  As I said on Wednesday night last and now say again, the Labour Party are against the turnover tax so long as it is imposed on food, clothing and medicine.  I want to make that very clear.</P>
    <P>An amendment was discussed here last night and was defeated.  It referred <Col N="1264" /> to pools.  I do not want to debate it again but I think the Minister should even at this late stage have second thoughts about taxing the people who are trying to help the unfortunates of the country.  I do not know whether I made the point clearly enough, but the people who run pools will not be paying 6d. in the £ tax but 6d. in the share of profits which they will be able to make, that is, 6d. on 5/- or maybe even at times 6d. on a half-crown, and I am sure the Minister will admit that is a very much higher tax than the 2½ per cent he is talking about.  These are charitable organisations who should by right be getting a big subvention from the Government because they are doing the work which ought to be done by the Government and local authorities.  They are getting no subvention and thanks to this, they will be paying tax on whatever few shillings they succeed in collecting from the generous people of the country who up till now have been keeping them in existence.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another matter also, the moneys spent in grants to State organisations.  I think it was Deputy Donegan who dealt at length with this and I should like to mention it briefly.  The Government have themselves, either deliberately or otherwise, given a very bad name to a number of organisations in this country, to a number of firms, because of the fact that, instead of giving them the money which they needed, putting in a director to see that that money was properly spent and to report back to the Government if the money were not properly spent, they shovelled millions of pounds, right, left, and centre to people, without asking them to give any acocunt at all as to what was happening.  Then, when the money was gone, these people put a pistol to the Government's head, and said: &ldquo;O.K.  We have so many hundreds employed and we will throw them out on the road unless we get another million or a million and a half.&rdquo;  That happened not once but a dozen times. The Government could have solved that problem by adopting the procedure I mention.</P>
    <P>We believe that, if private enterprise <Col N="1265" /> is not able to tackle a job, the State should step in, but the State should not shovel money to private enterprise without any control, good, bad, or indifferent.  That is what has happened not once but on a number of occasions over the past couple of years.  The results are now coming in and someone has got to carry the can.  I shall not go into details of the Dundalk venture because it is unique and something we do not want to see happen again.</P>
    <P>Anyone listening to Deputy Sherwin would think that all the Fianna Fáil Deputies were on the dole and all the opulence was on the Opposition side of the House.  I am very glad Fianna Fáil Deputies are not on the dole.  The trouble with Deputy Sherwin is that, when he talks about political standards, he tends to fall into an error that some people make; he tends to judge others by his own standards. Now that is an unfortunate yardstick.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that the Taoiseach this morning did not make any mention of EEC.  I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating him on being very clever.  When the arrangements were made for the conclusion of business, it was agreed that the remaining Estimates, including the Taoiseach's Estimate, would be passed without discussion and would be dealt with in the next session.  The Taoiseach, therefore, would not have an opportunity of speaking in this debate and giving a general idea of what he thought was happening in the country.  He very cleverly, however, and quite legitimately, when the House allowed him, delivered his speech on the Taoiseach's Estimate on the Finance Bill this morning.</P>
    <P>I waited for him to deal with one matter.  I wondered when it would come, but he did not say one word about EEC.  In every major speech he made in this House and outside it over the past three or four years there was always a reference to EEC: we were in; there was some delay about getting in; we were round the corner; we would be in before the sixties were out or in the early seventies; everything would be grand.  He must now be going to pin his faith to another <Col N="1266" /> star because there was not a word about EEC this morning.  I was a little disappointed.  There have been developments over the past few days and I thought the Taoiseach might possibly have something to tell the House.</P>
    <P>He also made no reference to this scheme of tariff cutting about which he has been talking so much up to now.  I should like to think he is having second thoughts about this second round of tariff cuts due to take place on 1st January, next.  Surely the Taoiseach and every member of the Government must now realise that it is a little foolish to talk about cutting tariffs on goods imported here from countries which have no reciprocal arrangements with us.  Surely it is stupid to strip off tariff restrictions on goods imported here, competing with Irish goods manufactured here.  It was quite legitimate while there was a prospect of getting into EEC but it is a little stupid today when that prospect has grown remote.  It is foolish to smash the tariff barrier to enable foreigners to compete against our own manufacturers because that competition will ultimately result in our manufacturers closing their doors and disemploying Irish workers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not make any reference to all the jobs created.  He must be feeling a little ashamed of the record.  Now I consider the Minister for Industry and Commerce an excellent Minister, but he had a habit of not giving the figures for actual employment in an industry; it was always the potential employment three, four, or five years hence.  Before the three, four, or five years had passed, the industry in many cases had closed its doors, having got large grants from the State, and the potential employment never materialised.  I think the Taoiseach felt this morning it was wiser to stop talking about this kind of employment.</P>
    <P>I was also surprised that the Taoiseach should deliberately except agriculture from the National Productivity Council.  He made no reference to the fact that agriculture needs a shot in the arm.  Agriculture is very definitely <Col N="1267" /> in the doldrums.  Even the influx of foreigners, whether they buy Senator L'Estrange's land, or anybody else's property&mdash;Senator L'Estrange is as much entitled to sell for big money as anybody else&mdash;has not helped agriculture. They may pay double the price, but it makes no real difference. We all know the small farmer is not doing well.  We all know things have not improved for him in the past few months.  The very least we expected from the Taoiseach was that he would hold out some ray of hope.  All he did was to exclude agriculture from the National Productivity Council.</P>
    <P>When all this money it is hoped to collect is in the Government coffers, I hope the Government will take a look at State employees.  Local authorities and private employers have arranged for a reduced working week, shorter working hours and a five-day week.  State employees in offices or working on drainage or in our forests are tied to the old-fashioned working week.  It is time the Government stepped forward a little.  Questions have been asked about this matter by the more decent members of the Government Party urging that the five-day week be extended to State employees. The Government advise trade union officials to set a standard.  It is not the function of Government to set the highest standard.  So it is said.  Neither is it their job to set the lowest of standards, but that is what they are trying to do at present.  I do not think the change asked for would call for any expenditure of money.  Surely it is not too much to give to these workers a concession similar to that given to other workers all over the country?</P>
    <P>There are a number of other things I should like to say, but as the debate is supposed to finish at 10.30 and quite a number of other Deputies are anxious to speak, I do not propose to hold the House any longer.</P>

      <P>If I said anything unparliamentary, I withdraw it, but I will have a gamble with the Deputy on that part of it later on.  This game has gone on here.  First of all, there was an attempt, as Deputy Sherwin said, to bluff the public; then we had tears and cries of woe for the poor unfortunate shopkeeper who was going to be ruined.  Then Deputy A. Barry stands up on his hind legs and told us that he had four per cent on his turnover. Is that correct?</P>

      <P>I have here an advertisement of a sale by a very respectable gentleman in the firm of Monica Duff of Ballaghaderreen.  They are advertising ten per cent or 2s. in the £ discount off all regular priced goods.  It is marked in plain figures.  Now if Deputy A. Barry can only make four per cent profit on his turnover and the firm of Monica Duff can afford to give a discount of ten per cent, what profit must they have and what is 2½ per cent going to matter?

Surely they had a little more.  If they divided the profits, that would be 4s. in the £.  These are the people who came in with bands and banners talking about the 2½ per cent that was going to drive them out of business.  Deputy McQuillan said he was down town looking for socks.  It would be worth his and other Deputies while to ramble around these shops and find out what is happening. I gave an instance some time ago of a refusal by manufacturers to supply goods to certain shops because they would not charge the full profit and the full profit was stated to be 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>That is why we had the honest to God firm here that did not stock Irish socks.  Thirty-five per cent of the goods they sold were British goods because they had 63 per cent on them and only 50 per cent on the Irish goods.  Those are the people who are going to be ruined and robbed.  We have certain choices to make.  I heard the gentlemen from the Labour Party speaking on this matter before.  We also had an attack by Deputy Donegan on what he calls State companies, or State-subsidised companies.  Last Monday, the Taoiseach opened a new cheese factory in my constituency and Deputy Donegan's contribution to that was a statement in this House which was to help to sell the cheese, that 75 per cent of the milk going to the creameries could not be processed because it was too dirty.  Evidently the farmers, their wives and families, were producing milk that was unfit for processing because it was too dirty. That was his statement made in this <Col N="1271" /> House.  He then attacked Irish Steel Holdings Limited.  That company have a very funny history.</P>

      <P>We brought a deputation up here to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, to ask him to step in.  He stepped in, and as well as that, he told me: &ldquo;I am sending a Cobh man down in charge and he will make a success of it.&rdquo;  Mr. Christy Fitzpatrick was sent down in charge of that industry. The day the inter-Party Government took over, to our misfortune, there were 430 men employed there. The day they left, the number was down to 304 and if we had not the good luck that put them out that day, the place would be closed down now. They began trying to save money in this way: the company were told to buy second- and third-class scrap, that the first-class scrap, the railway lines, were to be exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was done by a Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That was Labour's contribution towards increasing employment in Cobh.  I heard a wail from Deputy Donegan in regard to employment and I ask him whether it is not better to have more boys and girls employed here in their own country even if, despite the 50 per cent and the 66 per cent profits being made by the shop keepers, we still have to charge this 2½ per cent turnover tax.  I do not believe there is a worker in the country who would begrudge paying 6d. in the £ so that <Col N="1272" /> the unfortunate fellow who is idle could find employment in this country.

      <P>I thought I had been dealing with the Finance Bill.  As far as the people in my constituency are concerned, they will not be bluffed or fooled by the kind of stuff being dished out here in regard to the 2½ per cent turnover tax.  The people can have the choice at any time.  Their choice would be very definitely what I pointed out.</P>
      <P>We have at the present moment in my constituency some five new industries being started&mdash;three of them in Cork county and two in the adjoining county of Kerry.  They will require something like £1½ million of State funds.  They will give employment, roughly, between 400 and 500 per factory in the factory itself but they will give employment to a couple of thousand more people on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear lip service being paid here repeatedly about the flight from the land but if this Government were defeated tomorrow all that effort would disappear overnight&mdash;just as they endeavoured to force the disappearance of Irish Steel and to cripple the sugar <Col N="1274" /> industry.  It would be done in the very self-same way and along the very selfsame lines.  Therefore, as far as this turnover tax is concerned, I do not think you will defeat any Government on it and I think you are thanking God that you will not.  That is my personal opinion.  I do not believe you are in earnest.  I do not see any danger or any notion of it.  Hang it, I should be sorry to miss some of them over there. They provide a bit of amusement for me from time to time.  I am getting old in that line now and I like to get a bit of amusement from them.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputy O.J. Flanagan coming to my constituency on one occasion.  He said to the fishermen there, in effect: &ldquo;Look, if you want anything, go to Deputy Corry and I shall give it to him.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me return to the subject of the debate, after Deputy Corry's digression.  I think that one of the things that the speakers on the Government benches have been trying to do all through this debate is to insist that they obtained a mandate to impose the turnover tax which is enshrined in this Bill upon the people. I am sorry Deputy Corry has left the House because he is really the only Fianna Fáil Deputy who produced any proof of that.  On the Committee Stage he was able to mention that in the gloom of a mid-Cork public house, towards closing time he was able to obtain a mandate from those present simply by challenging them to challenge him in the public house.  None of them did and Deputy Corry took that as a mandate from his constituents to impose the turnover tax on the entire country.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, simply by virtue of the fact that they are sitting on the Government benches, said that, no matter under what strategem or what auspices, they were entitled to do what they liked with the people and no matter what elements of the people might make their views known in no uncertain manner the Government had a mandate to do what they liked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that a Government may impose various taxes once they <Col N="1275" /> have been elected but we must bear in mind that for 40 years Governments have walked into the benches over there and have walked out after serving their office.  However, no Government so far ever attempted to raise revenue by means of a turnover tax such as the Government now intend to levy on the people.  As Deputy Dillon and others said earlier today, if the Government had gone to the people at the last general election and had informed them of their intention to do exactly what they intend to do in this House tonight they would not be sitting over there in a position to do what they intend to do tonight in the teeth of the feeling of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The worst of it is that this is not just an expedient to get £10½ million this year.  Speaking on 21st February last, the Taoiseach said the Government must look for taxes of a more stable nature.  &ldquo;Stable&rdquo;, in other words it will stay.  The worst of it is that most people know that it will not stay at the 2½ per cent level at which the Government now intend to impose it.</P>
    <P>The only good aspect of this tax is that it has aroused the public conscience. It has aroused the inquiring mind among the people.  The people are beginning to wonder why this tax must be imposed because the Government have been quite shameless about the manner in which they introduced it.  The Minister for Finance, on the occasion when he introduced the Budget, said he did not mind how the tax was levied so long as he got the money because he had to get the money.  He was quite plain and quite distinct in explaining to the people that the bottom of the barrel in every other direction had been scraped and at last they had to resort to this.  The Taoiseach told us the same thing on 21st February of this year when he explained it would not be possible to obtain extra revenue simply by raising the rates of taxation from the usual sources.  Despite all that, we have found member after member of the Government front bench glorying in the fact that they must spend more money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands came in here night after night and gloried in the fact that they had spent more money than had ever been spent before.  He promised the Irish people they would spend more money still in the future whilst they remained in office.  That is what the Parliamentary Secretary described as the progressive Party.  He was inclined rather to jibe at us.  I think he called us conservatives and reactionary.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary aspect of the entire matter from the point of view of those on the Fianna Fáil benches was that every challenge thrown out to those across the floor of the House related only to the question: &ldquo;Where would you find the money if you were in office for this extra expenditure?&rdquo; There has not been one breath of a suspicion of a thought in one Governmennt mind along the lines on which the public mind is running at the moment, namely: where can the economies be effected and how can we save money?</P>
    <P>One of the speakers here on the last occasion pointed out that we are not here on our own behalf or to say what we like but rather to mirror the minds of our constituents.  That does not apply only to Opposition speakers. It applies to every Deputy who voted on the intermediate Stages of this Bill. I am quite certain that if any Fianna Fáil Deputy went to his constituents and discussed this present measure with them he would be told to think along the lines which Deputies of his Party have studiously avoided thinking along during this debate&mdash;namely, not: &ldquo;Where are you going to find the money by way of alternative?&rdquo; but &ldquo;How are you going to economise?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands to promise more expenditure. People such as the NFA, members of RGDATA, the trade unions, chambers of commerce and, indeed, the Central Bank have all pointed out that only one attitude should be adopted towards our expenditure at the moment.  The Taoiseach says this is not a time for retrenchment and that it is a time for courage.  It is open to interpretation that what the Taoiseach is saying is <Col N="1277" /> what he often said&mdash;in other words, that he is ready to make a gambler's throw to see if he can pull the fat out of the fire even at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry spoke of the factories that have been erected.  If I were the Deputy, I should not speak in that way about some of the factories to which he referred.  It is all very well for the Government to pour public money into factory after factory.  I would ask the Deputies on the other side to reflect on the fact that thousands of workers in these Government-subsidised factories are living on a razor edge.  Injection after injection of public money&mdash;not the money of any particular Deputy in the Fianna Fáil benches but the money of everybody sitting in the public gallery and of every constituent who sent a Deputy to this House&mdash;is being made so that the Fianna Fáil Government will not be put into the embarrassing position of being told they started a factory purely for the sake of starting a factory, that they gave employment purely for the sake of giving employment, come what may.</P>
    <P>None of us needs to think very hard to advert in his mind to industries started in the most unpropitious circumstances, to industries started although similar industries all over the world were crumbling, to industries that were started despite the fact that words of warning were spoken from these benches and from businessmen throughout the country.  These industries are continuing not to flourish but to give employment because the money I spoke of already is being deliberately injected, come what may.</P>
    <P>That is why the Government are here scraping the bottom of the barrel. That is why they are trying to pretend they have a mandate.  That is why the Government at one stage were near defeat on this issue, but for the fact that two Deputies felt they did not want to leave this House at this juncture. Surely it is time for them, even at this late stage, to think of what the people are saying about them up and down the country?  Surely it is time for them to think of some economies, to see how money can be saved, to <Col N="1278" /> stop talking in terms of courage and that this is no time for retrenchment, when it is, indeed, a time for prudence? That is all we are concerned with.  Let us have prudence.  Let us think before we spend needlessly.  Let us put ourselves in the position of any prudent businessman or any prudent head of a household.  Let us cut our cloth according to our measure, be it painful or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I agree it would be difficult to throw out of employment some of the people in the small industries to which Deputy Corry referred.  These things might be necessary.  When Deputy Corry speaks about these people being given employment, they are being given employment at their own expense and at the expense of their fellow-Irishmen throughout the country. Whether that is good economics or not is for the people to judge.  I believe the people have now reached the stage of asking the Government to halt.  If they do not wish to do so, the day will come when every member of the Government Front Bench and all the backbenchers sitting so pleased with themselves at the moment will have to face the bar of public opinion. I do not believe that the Government injections of money into industries of a certain nature can continue over that period.  There will come a stage when the Fianna Fáil Party will have to answer at the bar of public opinion and then it will be much too late, not alone for themselves but for the country, to find they were wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Dillon's reply to the Taoiseach this morning.  I thought I might hear from him some constructive policy.  His first allegation was that the two Independent Deputies supporting the Government were the two buttons on the Fianna Fáil trousers. He wanted to intimidate them into not voting the way they felt they ought to vote.  He said he nailed his policy to the mast, that he had a good policy and that he always produced it before a general election.  He produced no policy here today and made no constructive criticism.  He acted in a most irresponsible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of my Party told the <Col N="1279" /> people where we stand both nationally and economically.  He did not tell the people, as Deputy Dillon told them, he was going to spend £77 million a year on various services and that there would be no increase in taxation. Could anybody follow a leader of that kind, who makes such a statement at the Ard-Fheis of his Party and then opposes this 2½ per cent turnover tax? When I asked him here how he was going to do all these things, all I got was the old personal abuse for which he is noted.  He lacks the gentlemanly conduct one would expect from the Leader of the Main Opposition Party.</P>
    <P>Members of the Fine Gael Party had motions down seeking increases in social welfare benefits.  They were supported, of course, by the Labour Party.  The people must realise the hypocrisy shown by Fine Gael and Labour in putting down motions of that kind.  I thought the Leader of the Labour Party would give some lead to the workers of Ireland.  Instead, he criticised everything that had been done.  He criticised the Taoiseach for not being definite enough, but he himself quibbled so much that in the end I did not know what policy he was advocating.  Fifty-three per cent of the people will benefit as a result of this Bill.  The remaining 47 per cent will also benefit because we are ensuring our people have sufficient purchasing power.  The Taoiseach said this morning that in two years the profit of shops had gone up by 13 per cent because of increased purchasing power.</P>
    <P>The last speaker, Deputy Barrett, is a decent and honourable man, and I knew he would try to be sincere, but if he were to take money from industry, cut down on housing, schools, and so on, would the traders of the country not be far worse off than they are? Would the purchasing power of the people not go down considerably? Would the people crying out against the 2½ per cent turnover tax not be worse off?  If our programme gets an opportunity to go through, we have no doubt that the purchasing power of our people will increase considerably during the next year or two.  If you <Col N="1280" /> are going to cut down in other things, you have to be prudent, but you cannot be prudent by throwing people on the scrapheap and taking their employment away from them.</P>
    <P>That is what is being advocated here by the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party and all the other people who have spoken here.  They cannot deny that.  What we are trying to do is to have a 2½ per cent tax on every commodity bearing equally on every section of our people, notwithstanding the fact, as the Taoiseach has already stated, that the prosperity of the nation has increased 13 per cent in two years. If that is the case why all this outcry here?  Why are we castigated?  Why have we been gibed at by the men on the other side of the House that we are not standing up and defending the Minister for Finance?  Of course we are standing up to defend him.</P>
    <P>We are standing up to defend what we believe is in the national economic interest.  We believe we are doing the right thing.  As I have said on numerous other occasions, we are putting the interests of this nation before those of our own Party and that is the only thing we can do.  We will stand by that policy.</P>

In 1948, when we were defeated, the Taoiseach, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, sitting in the seat that Deputy O'Sullivan is in now, said to the inter-Party Government then: &ldquo;We have given you over a country in a sound financial position.

      <P>It is a great pity that a serious matter of this kind should be made the subject of comedy. We have had speeches from Deputy Burke, Deputy Corry and Deputy Sherwin that could only be described as a mockery of Parliament, making a joke and a laugh of something that is a serious consequence to the people, particularly the poor and workingclass people.  This is degrading Parliament and is something that should be deplored by all Deputies with any sense of responsibility to their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to be brief in my condemnation of this despicable Bill now in <Col N="1284" /> its Final Stage here.  Listening for most of the day I heard speeches by those supporting the measure.  Many of the speeches went back to the days of the inter-Party Government to rehearse the old Fianna Fáil speech that was put in type for them for the past two general elections.  It was to the effect that the inter-Party Governments left the country in debt, with particular reference to the manner in which Marshall Aid money was spent.  Now that the Minister for Finance is in the House, let him correct me if I am wrong when I state the facts.  In three years, the inter-Party Government spent £18 million on housing, hospitals, drainage and land reclamation and in six months Fianna Fáil squandered £24 million of Marshall Aid. That can be proved.  If Fianna Fáil say that building houses for the poor, providing work, draining and reclaiming land, building hospitals and staffing them is squandering money, I am proud to be associated with it.  If we get in tomorrow, we shall do the same again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the money we are now told must be got, what money is the Minister looking for?  Since the inter-Party Government were in office, Fianna Fáil have put £63 million extra taxation on this country and we are worse off to-day than on the last day we were in office. For what do they want the money now?  We have no evidence of progress as a result of the additional £63 million already piled on.  Unemployment is a serious and growing problem: the cost of living is at an all-time record high level; emigration is serious and growing.  I wonder, during their trips abroad, do our Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries ever go down the streets of a British town on a Sunday morning and see in places like Cricklewood and West Hendon the very strong representation of Irish people?  All those young people will tell you that they arrived in the last year or two.  There are as many people from Ireland in London today as there are in the whole <Col N="1285" /> province of Connacht.  That is the proud record of Fianna Fáil in regard to the provision of work and the stemming of emigration.</P>
      <P>This morning, the Taoiseach called for harder work and greater sacrifice. When Fianna Fáil face the people at a general election this year or next year or the year after&mdash;it cannot be postponed indefinitely&mdash;the people will remember this.  This tax will not be forgotten by Christmas because it is an unnecessary tax, a tax on which the Leader of the Opposition has challenged the Government to go to the country and abide by the verdict of the people and he gave the guarantee that if he were elected, there would be no turnover tax.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance may sit in a trance but if he thinks he has nothing to worry about, if he thinks he can convince the people in the same way as he has convinced Deputy Leneghan and Deputy Sherwin, why not go to the people about this turnover tax, which is a new tax here?  We now face the position in which the baby will have its christening robes taxed, the milk for its bottle taxed; its First Communion and Confirmation clothes will be taxed. The wedding ring will not escape.  All his life that person will pay tax on everything he eats or drinks and wears, on the light and the fire, and when he dies his habit and coffin will be taxed and everything connected with his last end, even down to the nails that go into the coffin will be taxed.  This will mean a tax from birth to death, something that must be viewed with the greatest concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not tell us where the idea of the turnover tax came from. Why did not the Taoiseach this morning be honest to the House and the country?  The Minister well knows because the Taoiseach told him where the idea for this tax came from.  The Taoiseach had discussions concerned with the economic position of the country with a personal friend and the friend suggested: &ldquo;Why do you not <Col N="1286" /> have a turnover tax?&rdquo;  The Taoiseach paused and this influential friend said: &ldquo;I have experience of the working of the turnover tax abroad and next time I come over for a fishing holiday I shall bring you the details.&rdquo;  He brought the details to the Taoiseach and the turnover tax was born on a fishing lake in County Mayo.</P>

The Minister for Finance was once the Minister for Health and he told this House, in the hearing of most of the senior Deputies who were here when he was introducing the <Col N="1287" /> Health Act, that it would cost 2/- in the £ in the rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now it is 15/in the £ and £1 in the £.  Today the same Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, tells us this turnover tax will be 2½ per cent.  I venture to say this will wind up at six per cent, seven per cent or maybe ten per cent in the same way as the Minister told this House that 2/- in the £ would be the cost of the implementation of the Health Act. Heaven help the shopkeepers who think this will only be 6d. in the £.  Heaven help the farmers and the agricultural workers who think it will be only 6d. in the £.  Heaven help the labouring people and the unemployed who think this sham Social Welfare Bill will compensate them.</P>
      <P>This Bill to improve the social welfare services should be brought in at an increased rate, irrespective of the turnover tax or any other tax because the benefits are entirely too low, too mangy for the unemployed, for the widows and orphans, for disabled persons, for home assistance recipients, for the blind and particularly old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to the third point for the Minister for Finance.  When Dr. O'Higgins was alive and was a Deputy here, he and Deputy John A. Costello put down a motion asking the Fianna Fáil Government to increase old age pensions.  The Minister for Finance and the then Taoiseach said it could not be done because there was no money to do it.  There was a change of Government and the new Government immediately substantially increased old age pensions and reduced taxation.  Does everybody not know <Col N="1288" /> that?  It is on record.  Now they tell us they are looking for £13½ million of which they hope to get £3 million between 1st November and 31st March next.  I want to be placed on record as saying that it is dishonest.  It is diving their hands deep down into the taxpayer's pocket.  It is putting their hands into the purse of every housewife. It is extracting money dishonestly from that pocket and that purse without consideration and, more important, without a mandate from the people.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows this Government have no mandate from the people. This Government are known and will be known to posterity as the Sherwin Government, whether they like it or not.  Deputy Leneghan is jealous now because it is not the Leneghan Government but we must give the honour to the city man.  This Government have no mandate.  There was enough mention of the turnover tax at the last election and they lost hands down. Irrespective of any other reason they should be put out of office because of the increase which will occur in the price of milk, butter, sugar, bread and flour.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why Fianna Fáil always concentrate their energies on slashing food.  In 1952, they commenced the campaign and advocated dearer food for the people.  Everything that was on the shop shelves and in the shop windows, everything that goes on the old age pensioners' meagre table, they decided to attack.  They concentrated their attack on food the whole time.  Why?  Because we were told by one of the Ministers at the time, we were eating too much and drinking too much; the Irish people were living too well, looking too well and in the lap of luxury.  In order that the people might tighten their belts and eat less, the Government decided to tax food.</P>
    <P>During the general election campaign of 1957, there was a suggestion that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office, they would increase the price of bread.  Above all places in Ireland, where did the Leader of Fianna Fáil go but to Belmullet to address a meeting and in Belmullet he said: &ldquo;Somebody in Fine Gael says we are going <Col N="1289" /> to increase the price of bread.  If we get back, we will never increase the price of bread.&rdquo;  His exact words were: &ldquo;Why should we increase the price of bread, such an important commodity of diet for the people?&rdquo; Those were the words of the President, then Leader of Fianna Fáil, in Belmullet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, Deputy Leneghan was shouting him out of the town and heckling him. The general election took place and back went Fianna Fáil.  They were not back three months when they slashed the food subsidies and without any consideration increased the price of bread and flour.  Although we on this side of the House reduced the price of butter, they increased it substantially. In relation to the increase in the price of butter, they are today paying the British for eating our butter when our own people are forced to eat margarine because they cannot pay for butter.  Anybody who cares to look for Irish butter can get it for 2/7d. or 2/8d. a lb. in Manchester.  The best Irish butter can be got in the Tesco Stores outside London for 2/7d. a lb., while in this city it is 4/8d. and 4/9d. a lb. because Fianna Fáil are paying the British with our money for eating our butter which we cannot afford to purchase.</P>
      <P>This turnover tax is a savage blow to the poor of my area and very much so because of the numbers of working class people in the midland constituency which I represent.  I venture to say that no Fianna Fáil Deputy can take the platform on any Sunday morning, whether it is next Sunday morning or within the next 18 months, in any provincial town and defend increasing the price of milk, butter, sugar, bread and flour after removing the subsidies which gave them an extra £9 million to play around with, which they must have squandered because there are no results for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks here about a plan. The Taoiseach had another plan this morning.  When will we be finished <Col N="1290" /> with all the plans from Fianna Fáil? There was a plan in 1932.  At that time, the plan was to bring back the emigrants from America.  They had another plan later which meant that the people could not pass up and down through any of the towns at lunch time because there would be so many thousands of workers coming out of all the factories that were to be established that there would be traffic jams.</P>
    <P>That was the plan for 1933.  There was another plan for 1937 and 1938. This time it was the farmers.  Having whipped John Bull and slaughtered the calves&mdash;and the Minister for Finance played no small part in that regard; he was the official butcher&mdash;the plan now was to cut the throats of all the calves, sell them for 50/- a head, and give free beef to all the Fianna Fáil supporters in the country.</P>

      <P>Towards the end of that Dáil, the Taoiseach decided he would go to a dance in Clery's Ballroom.  When the dance was over, he decided he would produce another plan known as the Clery's Ballroom plan, but this was the best plan of all, because the plan he produced in Clery's Ballroom was nothing less than 100,000 new jobs in five years, if he could get back.  The <i>Irish Press</i> got to work and they published his speech in a free supplement for every reader and the plan he made when he was jigging around Clery's Ballroom.  Lo and behold, if he did not get back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The biggest joke, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, was that there were no 100,000 new jobs.  All he wanted was votes, and he got votes, and the whole country which was expecting 100,000 new jobs could go and dance the same jig as he had danced in Clery's Ballroom the night he announced his great plan.  There was never a word about the 100,000 new jobs since.</P>
      <P>The next thing was that there was another plan.  At the last general election, from every platform the Taoiseach said he was going to stop emigration and reduce the cost of living, but he never once said that there was to be a turnover or purchase tax. Since the Government got such a hiding from the people without mentioning a purchasing tax, what would they get today if they went to the people and mentioned a turnover tax?  After 20 years' experience in this House, I know very well that Fianna Fáil will try to hang on to office as long as they can.</P>

      <P>The Government are afraid to put this issue to the country.  When I listen to Deputy Corry and Deputy Burke, I am reminded of a person whistling loudly while passing a graveyard.  They are <Col N="1292" /> whistling loudly tonight saying there will not be a general election because of Deputy Lenehan and Deputy Sherwin.  They will try to hold on as long as they can.  I accuse the Government of cowardice.  They are windy and afraid.  They are afraid to look for a mandate from the people because this issue was already tested.  The only election that took place since the turnover tax was mentioned was the by-election in Dublin where the Government were completely and entirely disgraced.  I venture to say that there is no constituency in Ireland in which what took place in the recent by-election in Dublin would not be repeated.</P>
      <P>Many people would like a general election before this tax is implemented, but I would prefer to see the tax going ahead for a short while and then have a general election, because the people will not fully understand the tax until they feel the pinch.  When they feel the pinch, they will know who is responsible.  As I have said before, if the people sow nettles, they cannot expect roses to grow.  People get the type of Government they deserve.  If the people voted for a Fianna Fáil Government at the last general election, what could they expect, judging them on their record since 1932?  Our country must be the greatest in the world, because there are no other people who would survive under such a rotten administration for the past 30 years.  The only progress that was made in this country was made during the terms of office of the inter-Party Governments.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I want to repeat that because I feel some Deputies did not understand what I said.  As a result of that scheme, land was created.  Land which contained furze, bushes, rushes and rocks, land which was too bad to grow weeds, is now producing food for man and beast as a result of the inter-Party Government. There was the Local Authorities (Works) Act that drained the land and gave work to every county council worker in Ireland.  It was scrapped by Fianna Fáil the minute they got into office, with the result that every county council in Ireland had to increase their rates to make up for the Local Authorities (Works) Act money which we were giving them and which we will give them when we get back again.</P>

They do not like to hear these things and they are mad jealous.</P>
      <P>When I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands touring the country and welcoming tourists to fish in our lakes, I notice that he never once refers to the fact that it was Deputy Dillon who instituted the Inland Fisheries Trust that makes it possible for him to make his important speeches today.</P>

All opposed it but the very moment the change of Government came, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce could not be loud enough in their praise of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>

I should like to know if the papers published that interview correctly because this House is entitled to know what bargaining took place between the Minister for Finance and Deputy Sherwin and the only occasion on which we can get that information is on this Bill.  Surely the Minister for Finance heard the rumours afloat in this city that both Deputy Sherwin and Deputy Leneghan got £3,500 cash for their votes.

      <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance is listening attentively to what I have to say.  This Bill is evilly conceived and evilly disposed and it is a Bill which is being passed by the majority of this House, with a majority vote of the people against the Government.  Every voter in the last election who voted for Deputy Sherwin and Deputy Leneghan <Col N="1305" /> had Fianna Fáil candidates to vote for on the panel if they wanted Fianna Fáil, but they voted against them by voting for Deputy Sherwin and Deputy Leneghan.  Therefore the Irish people are being betrayed in this Bill.  They voted against Fianna Fáil by voting for the two men who are plunging this country into an additional £13½ million unnecessary taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Locke's put you out.  You went out flying in 1948 after that.  Everyone in this House knows that this taxation is unnecessary and that already this Government have put on £63 million taxation since they got back into office.  Despite that, there is record unemployment and emigration, and depression in agriculture. Today the farmers are begging. They cannot sell their wheat. They cannot sell their oats.  They cannot sell their barley.  They can sell nothing they produce.  Fairs are becoming depressed and there was no effort by the Government to negotiate properly with the British to guarantee prices for farmers' livestock and produce. England is our nearest neighbour, the best consuming public in the world, the best people for agricultural produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of this Government went over to England and came back with their hands hanging.  No wonder British members of Parliament are ashamed of those who go there with ministerial rank to negotiate on behalf of the Irish people.  Is it any wonder that recently it was publicly stated that the only man who ever went over, with commonsense, ability and intelligence, went there in 1948&mdash;John A. Costello, with Daniel Morrissey and James Dillon.  This Government are bankrupt of policy, of ideas for the future; they are stagnant, backward.  The first time the Irish electors get a chance they will wipe them off the face of the political map forever.  We have <Col N="1306" /> been reading the speeches of different Ministers almost every weekend to the effect that we never had it so good, that the people were never more prosperous. Side by side with those speeches was the report in recent months that we were one of the most backward countries in the world today, thanks to Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <P>To come back to this disgraceful Bill, I would go so far as to assert that in no other democracy in the world would such a measure be perpetrated without first consulting the electorate. Deputy Norton suggested a referendum. They are afraid of a referendum after the fate of the last one when they tried <Col N="1307" /> to steal the votes of the people so that Fianna Fáil would provide the Government <i>in saecula saeculorum</i>.  The Irish people, thanks to the trade unions and to every other section of the community, gave them their answer.  They were beaten badly on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time today, I asked the Minister for Posts <Col N="1318" /> and Telegraphs about the filling of a vacant post in the sub-post office at Rockchapel, County Cork, eight or nine months ago.  In reply, the Minister pointed out that the post was filled from nominees sent to him through the labour exchange; in other words, that the best qualified person was selected to fill the vacancy.</P>
      <P>In 1962, another vacancy occurred at Rockchapel and temporary men carried out the duties of that post over a pretty long period.  Of the two men actually employed in a temporary capacity, one was named O'Connor who was married with a wife and four children.  This man, being a member of the Defence Forces and genuinely unemployed, had his name supplied through the local labour exchange for relief work.  He carried out that work over a certain period and then the labour exchange submitted the name of another man who was in greater need of consideration for employment because he was the father of six children and was receiving greater benefit from the local exchange.  The second man was employed for a period of 28 weeks.</P>
      <P>O'Connor then went to the labour exchange and was in receipt of unemployment benefit from the time the second man was employed in that post. This second man who was employed, Nolan, was the father of six children. He was employed for 28 weeks in 1961 and for part of 1962.  He gave loyal and faithful service and he did the job at a time when the conditions were extremely difficult for anyone travelling in that locality, because bad as the conditions were in County Wicklow at Christmas, they were even worse around Rockchapel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was strange that when interviews were held for the previous post that was filled in 1962 both O'Connor and Nolan were called for interview and afterwards the two men were employed in a temporary capacity.  That proves that nothing could be held against these two men.  The two of them were married men; one had Army service and the other was the father of six children and was drawing £6 a week unemployment benefit.  However, when it came to filling this post the Minister <Col N="1319" /> decided, in his wisdom, to appoint a single man who was not even registered at the labour exchange.  I am anxious to know whether there is a change of policy in this regard.  We have always thought that as regards employment the recommendation of the local labour exchange was taken into account.  In many instances for other lines of employment we find from time to time that recommendations are being made by the local labour exchange and men are given employment as a result.</P>
    <P>However, that was not done in regard to these two men, one the father of six children, and the other the father of four children.  There is a third man I have not mentioned because I do not know the background very well.  He was also an ex-Army man and he did not get consideration either.  I believe, and so do the people in that area believe, that there was victimisation in this case because a man who gave loyal and good service to the post office for a number of years as did one of these men in particular, Nolan, got no consideration good, bad or indifferent.  The second man, O'Connor, who also gave faithful service was overlooked.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister will make a thorough investigation of this case so that the people in this locality will have their minds relieved in this regard because grave doubts do exist. I would further ask the Minister to state whether he received the necessary recommendation in regard to reputation from the person who was appointed.  Was he previously employed by the Post Office at any time and, if so, was there a recommendation sent in to the Department?  I trust the Minister will clear the air in regard to this appointment.</P>

      <P>Deputy McAuliffe in raising this matter on the Adjournment tonight makes reference to appointments to two vacancies, one that which occurred in 1962 and the other which occurred not eight or nine months ago but on the 18th April this year.  I did not intend to make any reference to the previous appointment, that of 1962, but the names for the <Col N="1320" /> 1962 appointment were submitted in the normal way from the employment exchange to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the person appointed by me was a married man with nine children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The person I appointed recently was, as I indicated today, an unmarried man.  His name was submitted also in 1962 for the first vacancy.  On this occasion there were five names submitted to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from the employment exchange including the name of the person I appointed and the names of people who have been mentioned here by Deputy McAuliffe. The facts reported to me and accompanying the name of each applicant are confidential and I am precluded from giving them here in the House. It is true that many people think that when a nominee from the employment exchange is taken on by the local head postmaster he is confirmed in the appointment.  That is not a fact.  The names are submitted to the Minister for the time being and it is the Minister's obligation to appoint to the post the person he thinks is best fitted to carry out the obligations and the person he thinks is the proper person to be appointed.  In this instance I was confronted really with two people, one of three married men and the son of the auxiliary postman who resigned, who was 71 years of age and who was in the service as postman in this area from 1911.</P>
