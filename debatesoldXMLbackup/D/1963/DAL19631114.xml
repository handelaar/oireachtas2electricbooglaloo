    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some further observations to make in regard to this Vote.  It is only right that I should express appreciation of the Department's intention to import certain breeds of cattle with a view to improving our herds here, and that provision has been made to have them quarantined on Spike Island.  That is definitely a step in the right direction because we are living in a world where it is only the best that can get tops at market <Col N="1557" /> level.  There is no point in trying to carry on with inferior stuff; there is no point in our having a breed of animal which is slow to develop, slow to put on flesh, and it is only by examining every avenue, including the importation of limited numbers of livestock, that the farmers can eventually get the best that can be got in any country in which they are competing.</P>
      <P>I should like also to express my appreciation of the great service the artificial insemination stations have done to improve our cattle, both beef and milk, so that we have not got the two qualities under the one hide as we had before, but each in its own live container.  The Department have had over the years a number of very useful premium schemes&mdash;premiums for bulls, premiums for mares, premiums for boars and for rams.</P>
      <P>These are very good schemes and are very helpful in keeping the types of animal I have mentioned well up to standard as far as breed is concerned. As I have mentioned premium boars, I have often wondered, now that we have two distinct breeds, plus one which is not so distinct, whether the Agricultural Institute might not like to deal with the problem to see what cross or crosses, to see what breed or breeds are the best for the farmer and for manufacture into bacon.  The pig industry is very important, particularly for the congested districts.  It is also important for a good many others who can afford it.  It is not uncommon now to see large numbers of pigs being bred, reared and fattened, either all on the same place or in different places. You may find a breeder getting out young pigs in one place and a feeder fattening them in another.  In the old days, pigs were fattened more by the small farmer than the large farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I much appreciate the farm buildings scheme.  There has been the suggestion of further increases in the grants and I suggest that the Minister should give a specially high grant to farmers with a valuation under £20 to encourage them to have better houses for their milch cows and suitable houses for the breeding, rearing and fattening of pigs.  Good houses are <Col N="1558" /> very essential for the economic production of pigs on the farm.  There is a big difference between the ratio of meal production in a cold, draughty house and in the proper type of house.</P>
    <P>I had great pleasure this year in seeing the three types of piggeries put up by the Institute at Moore Park.  I was amazed to find that the cheapest type produced the healthiest stock.  It may be a bit early for the Department to take it on themselves to give definite advice as to the best type of building for the production of bacon but I was very much struck by the cheaper type house.  I think the ratio of meat production was practically the same as in the others and the stock were healthy but that does not mean that it would remain so.  We would like to see the experiment carried further.  A good many people intend to put up houses for the fattening of pigs and they would appreciate it if the Department were able to give them advice with regard to the erection of a not very expensive house.</P>
    <P>Over the years, wonderful work has been done under the Land Project for the improvement of land and the majority of farmers have followed up by a course of fertilisation or, in some cases, by tillage, followed by the application of fertiliser and lime. There are, unfortunately, still a number of people whose land was drained and who did very little with it afterwards.They did not follow up either with lime or with artificial fertiliser. Public money spent on such people is wasted.  It is true that times may change and that someone else may come into occupation of the holding, or these people may get a change of heart and give the land the necessary lime and fertiliser.</P>
    <P>We also want advisory services in respect of the rare problems that may arise with any particular crop.  We have been going into decent and highgrade grass production in some places and in some instances there has been trouble.  The treatment of these problems is a veterinary job as it has regard to certain ailments which occur from feeding some of the very nutritious grasses which are now growing. <Col N="1559" /> Some research work should be done in the Department's veterinary section to produce a treatment, either by the hypodermic needle or otherwise, for the prevention of ailments such as red water, mastitis and grass tetany which occur in cattle.  There is a pressing need to combat these ailments.</P>
    <P>A peculiar position has arisen in regard to our veterinary service.  They are all hard at work in my area, which is part of the six counties not yet attested, testing cattle under the bovine TB eradication scheme and to my own knowledge, it is very hard for a farmer to get a vet for any other purpose. I knew of a farmer recently who had a milch cow suffering from timber tongue.  He knew a good deal about cattle.  He knew the drug for the cure of timber tongue but the chemist could not sell it to anyone other than a veterinary officer.  The cow was almost dead when a vet was finally secured. These drugs should be made available to farmers.  There is no point in eradicating TB in cattle if they are allowed to die from other causes.  This is not hearsay; I have personal knowledge of the cases of which I am speaking.</P>
    <P>I have read the survey team's report on the pigmeat industry.  I agree with many of the suggestions in that report but there is one suggestion with which I do not agree, that the inefficient bacon factories should be bought out and that the pig producer should help to pay for the buying out by way of levy.  My view is that any inefficient firm should be left to stew in its own juice.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission should set the highest standard possible for bacon at the factories and if some firms are not able to keep up to that standard, get them out.  They are a good riddance.</P>
    <P>I am also in full agreement with many of the suggestions made by the survey team on the dairying industry, but I do not believe the time is ripe, if it ever will be, for concentrating in a few centres the manufacturing of our milk into the various products. There are many objections to it.  The local creamery, along with being a source of employment, is very often in <Col N="1560" /> purely rural areas a centre where social activities can directly or indirectly be carried out.  Centralisation would cost a pile of money and farmers far away from those centres might find themselves, in the height of the season, with nobody to take the milk because there was a labour dispute.  Those are the dangers I see.  Naturally labour is entitled to look for its rights and the worker needs adjustment in his conditions now and then, but until such time as labour disputes can be avoided, it would be unwise for the Government or the Department to accept that suggestion from the survey team.</P>
    <P>We are living in a world of civilised nations and industries in civilised countries are highly organised.  The unfortunate farmers the world over seem never to be able to build a proper organisation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my idea of proper organisation although they are entitled to have it as far as I am concerned.  However, if we are to succeed, it is essential that our agricultural community be properly organised and that each section of agriculture should be organised independently of the other sections.  For instance, the livestock man should have his organisation and the creamery milk suppliers should have theirs. There should be an organisation of sheep owners, pig breeders and fatteners, poultry owners, and so on.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, these different organisations should have a national council to co-ordinate the different sections so that when farmers go to look for anything or when a section is looking for it, they will be in a position to speak with one voice.  I have been preaching this in other places for a number of years and I hope I am not looking for the impossible.  The farmers seem to be unfortunate.  Looking back to when the world was very young, I have been struck by the thought that there were only two farmers in the world.  They could not agree and one slew the other.  Is that the curse that is hanging over us today?  If it is, it is about time our people cast it off and organised for their own benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> It is possible to get plenty of organisations if you say you want an increased price for this or an increased price for that.  Good prices are very important but another matter is more important: the ways and means of getting those prices, proper organisations, using proper methods.  Perhaps also those sections I have mentioned could give advice as regards production and other problems.  I am as anxious to get proper prices for the farmers as anybody else, maybe more so; my only disagreement is in regard to the methods of obtaining them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and his Department may be spared long to provide the needs of agriculture and that the farmers will have sense enough to realise that fighting among themselves is no way to success.  I also hope that somebody big enough and strong enough will start to organise them on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a farming area and I want to say a few words on conditions as I know them in that area.  Dairying is the principal industry in my part of the country.  The majority of the people there are small farmers who cannot go into the pig industry in a big way. Time and time again, at meetings of the county committee of agriculture and elsewhere, we have asked that a higher price be paid for milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farmer in my area is dependent solely on the cheque he gets from the creamery.  In other parts of the country, farmers may get a creamery cheque for 12 months of the year.  The people in my district will get a creamery cheque for only seven months of the year.  It is a cold type of country.  It is not the same type of land as the land about which the previous Deputy spoke.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the price of milk because 1/6d., 1/7d. and 1/8d. is still a very small price for milk, seeing that the farmer and his family now have to pay 4/9d., I think, for the lb. of butter they have to buy.  If butter were at a reasonable price, it would not be so serious but the cost of living has soared so high that it is all-important <Col N="1562" /> that the farmer I am talking about should get special consideration.</P>
    <P>In the past, we had a fair measure of employment for the small farmer. During the winter months, he could supplement his income by going out to get employment.  With the introduction of machinery and now that things are done in such a big way, even that employment is killed.  That means that he has to depend solely on his income from his small farm.  He cannot depend on the poultry industry. During the past three or four years, the housewife might be lucky enough to go out to a good market but the chances were that the market would be very bad.  Therefore, the majority of people ceased to rear turkeys at all. That is the position in my part of the country.  That industry should be looked after better than it is.  We supply only three per cent of the needs of the British market.  I read an article not so long ago in which it was said that if an effort were made to get our Irish emigrants to buy even one turkey per family, it would step up our percentage.With Irish turkeys representing only three per cent of the British market, the position is very serious.  Something requires to be done to give the housewife encouragement to rear the turkeys and certainly to give her protection so that when she goes to sell them, she will be sure of a fair price.</P>
    <P>Eggs are almost out of the question.Housewives do not bother about them because from April until September, they are hardly worth collecting in the sheds&mdash;1/6d., 2/- and various prices but never higher.  A guaranteed price would give these people something to go on.  They could then either go into the industry or keep out of it.  As they are, they do not know what they will get and the majority of them keep clear of it. I have attended some of those auctions I am talking about.  It was sad to see people who had come long journeys with cartloads of turkeys having to go home again without making any sales.</P>
    <P>Schemes are put into operation but a farmer will not qualify under some of these schemes without having drainage <Col N="1563" /> work carried out on the land.  A scheme was sanctioned by the Department of Agriculture and applied to north-east Leitrim, from where I come. I have seen that scheme in operation and I worked on that scheme.  I carried out part of that scheme myself.  I have had to put drains in fields, in order to qualify for that grant, and one might as well put a drain across a tarred road.  The field was dry and hard and was starved for manure but it certainly did not need drainage.  That matter should very carefully be examined. Around the country, the same applies. We have the very best of land starved for manures.  It would be well if they were available at a cheaper price and if the advisory officers were a little more active, as I think they will be in future because they are being employed in greater numbers.  The position would then be greatly improved.  Hitherto, there was only one advisory officer for the north, one for the south, and so on. Let the adviser be more active and advise the people on the type of manure needed and by all means provide cheaper manures for the types of farmers I am talking about.  They are not able to meet the cost owing to the small income they are deriving from their creamery.</P>
    <P>I come now to the heifer scheme.  I complimented the Minister last week.  I have been in consultation with quite a number of people since and have been at a few fairs or have passed through them.  The majority of the people think that if the Minister had given a subsidy for the calf, he would have included every person who kept cows. Now, by starting with the heifer, it is possible that the farmer who was encouraged to make his farm a success heretofore will not be in a position to avail even of one £15.  The danger is that some people will make a great profit out of this scheme introduced by the Minister.  The scheme certainly is a great inducement and already there has been a marked improvement in the sale of heifers at the fairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not forget that if he had started with a subsidy for the calves, let it be small or large, or for <Col N="1564" /> a limited number of calves, it would still include every man keeping cows. That has been a great inducement to people across the Border to keep cattle.  They get a very substantial allowance and the result is they are determined to make sure that they have their cows and their calves and it is a profitable undertaking.  I would ask the Minister to look into that matter.  It is a new scheme and I suppose new schemes always have to take their course for a while until they can be improved.</P>
    <P>In my part of the country, there are many brood mares and there is a good demand over a very wide area for a thoroughbred horse.  We have none in south Leitrim, an area which is far removed from both north Sligo and north Leitrim.  There is quite an amount of money in brood horses at the moment and the county committee of agriculture have sent a resolution to the Department asking them to give careful consideration to this matter.  I am raising the matter now for the Minister's consideration, which I know will be favourable.  The cost of bringing a brood mare from, say, Bundoran to the Longford border is almost as high as the service fee of £10.  That is a very expensive undertaking and in some cases it takes two days.</P>
    <P>Another problem which we have in Leitrim, and which has come up on several occasions recently, is that the Department do not give any special Hereford bulls.  There are special Shorthorn bulls and special Aberdeen Angus bulls but there are no special Hereford bulls.  I would ask the Minister to consider this for my area because the Hereford is becoming very popular and people are anxious to have this breed.  To get the special term Hereford bull to Dublin or to the show at Carrick-on-Shannon is very expensive.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Land Project, Part B has been abandoned.  It did encourage farmers to work on their own land especially in regard to drainage. I would ask the Minister to consider restoring Part B.  The situation is very serious in parts of the country today, especially after the last three <Col N="1565" /> days of rain we had on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, and the land is in a desperate condition.  There is no drainage money from the Department or from the county council and the only way to get land drainage work done is by a group of people coming together and obtaining a Rural Improvements Scheme grant.  Other than that, there is not much money for drainage and I would ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should congratulate the co-operative stores and the NFA in my part of the country. In Manorhamilton, they played a very useful part in coming to the rescue of small farmers by giving them the foodstuffs which they required for their cattle to tide them over a period in which they had no ready cash coming in.  The co-operative stores and the NFA in Manorhamilton went to the north of Ireland and elsewhere and bought hay so that the cattle would not be lost.</P>
    <P>Last year, ground wheat, or unmillable wheat, was being sold at 28/- and 29/-.  Unmillable wheat that is stored in thousands of tons should be available at a smaller price.  There was a big subsidy paid for it but the farmers had to pay almost as much for it as they had to pay for Indian meal or some other type of meal.  I would ask the Minister to see if it is possible to have this unmillable wheat on sale at less than 28/- or 29/-.  We have at the moment the establishment of food-processing factories and the farmers of the area will be appealing to the Minister for cheaper manures.  Until I became a TD, I never knew that there were so many small farmers.  It will only be by getting the price for the crops he will grow for those factories that this type of farmer will survive.  He has not the same liberty in respect of cows and calves and if he is able to produce plenty of these crops for these factories, it will be his only hope of survival.  There is talk about making all these small farms into a bigger farm and providing some other livelihood for the small farmers.  That would be very difficult to do because the small farmer is just as proud and fond of his small farm as the big farmer is of his.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We might as well take our lead from the Leader of the Government himself.  We are always hearing Fianna Fáil attacking this side and talking about the great Fianna Fáil policies and the stupid policies that come from this side.  The Minister's brief is a confession of the failure of the continued fundamental Fianna Fáil policy.  For three decades, Fianna Fáil endeavoured to destroy the livestock trade in this country, but now we have a Fianna Fáil Government promoting a heifer scheme to increase our livestock.  I would call this delayed action restitution, but it is not sufficient restitution.  It will be an advantage to a man to get £15 for his heifer calves, that is, if he has a heifer. It should be the aim of Government policy to assist the not-so-well-off farmer.  We are told he has the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It is more important that people should be put in a position to buy the extra cattle they need.</P>
      <P>Down through the years also Fianna Fáil have hounded this side of the House with the meanest and vilest propoganda, particularly a former Minister for Agriculture whom they called &ldquo;the Minister for Grass&rdquo;.  That was dishonest and it did a grave injury to this nation.  During all their long term of office, they did nothing about grasslands.  Some people may say they were right.  If so, I should like to quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 5th September, 1963, where the Taoiseach is reported as presenting the prizes to the winners of the National Grass Production Competition in the Shelbourne Hotel Ballroom, Dublin. On that occasion he announced to the nation:</P>
      <P>For many years the products of our grasslands had been the sheet anchor of our export trade and in the prevailing market situation they constituted the best opportunity for increased exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> Nobody in the Government benches, therefore, can justify the Fianna Fáil continued neglect of our grasslands over the years and the destruction of our flocks and herds.  It speaks well for Irish agriculture that it was able to stand up to persecution by successive Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>In the Budget of 1957, with a great flourish of trumpets, a sum of £250,000 was allotted to the Department of Agriculture for the expansion of our agricultural markets and the opening up of new markets.  For six or seven years, nothing was done about it.  I asked the Minister questions here about how much was spent.  I was told £12,000 had been spent and that a few meetings had been held in Dublin. There was no such thing as expanding markets or looking for markets, no endeavour to find a market for our surplus wheat, our surplus bacon and our surplus butter.  In fact, the turkey market was allowed to die.  Then we started to get reports.  Recently we have been getting so many reports of surveys that we will have a library of them before we are finished.  We had reports from the survey teams set up by the Minister for Agriculture to inquire into dairy produce, reports on beef, mutton and lamb and on the bacon and pig meat industry.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with the latter first. Perhaps the people making these surveys are not as old as I am, but I remember how the equivalent of these surveys operated.  I was a victim of them.  This report recommends to the Minister that inefficient bacon factories be closed down.  It is hard to say what is an inefficient factory.  An enormous factory, sparkling in chromium, white tiles and machinery, might not pay, but you might have a man with what might appear to be an old fashioned factory, who could make it pay, who could produce better bacon and who, most important of all, would know the kind of pig he should process and how he could come by such pigs.</P>
    <P>The report of this survey recommends that the industry be &ldquo;rationalised&rdquo;. <Col N="1568" /> This is one of our new words.  They &ldquo;rationalised&rdquo; the milling industry, and closed all the small mills in the country.  Now they want to &ldquo;rationalise&rdquo; the bacon industry. There is a great danger in this.  The people who prepare these surveys never think of the human element.  Say the Minister agrees to their proposal and closes certain factories, leaving only four or five in the whole country, compensation will have to be paid to the factory owners and workers.  The compensation to the workers will not be sufficient to make up for losing their jobs.  I know small towns where there are efficient small bacon factories.They are a great boon to these towns, which would die without them.</P>
    <P>The survey team could not think of any other way of paying for these closures except by putting a levy on the pigs, meaning that the farmers will have to pay for it.  I asked the Minister a question on this matter only this week and I hoped he would make a definite statement on it.  The Minister is a clever and able debater.  He replied in such a way that I hardly knew where I was.  He said he was not sure whether the Pigs Commission had a legal right to do this but if they had not, they would have to bring it to the Dáil.  I put it to the Minister that the Pigs Commission are responsible to him and before they take any steps to rationalise the bacon trade or any portion of it, they should come to him and he should come to the House.  Two of the Minister's colleagues have got into a way of ducking their heads, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Transport and Power.  One says: &ldquo;That is a matter for CIE&rdquo; and the other: &ldquo;That is for Telefís Éireann; I cannot interfere with them.&rdquo;  I expect more from the Minister for Agriculture and I think I shall get it from him in that he will not allow the Pigs Commission their head.</P>
    <P>We must go by what has happened in the past.  The Pigs Commission was the child of the Pigs Marketing Board which came out of two Acts about 1935, 1936 and 1937.  That was the real destruction of the pig trade.  It put the <Col N="1569" /> pig out of the small farmer's yard.  It has been stated here that the numbers of pigs on small farms of less than 50 acres have fallen, the greatest fall being on the smallest farm, while the number of pigs on farms of over 100 acres has risen, the greatest rise being on farms of over 200 acres.</P>
    <P>One of the best sources of income for the Irish small farmers was taken away from him by two Acts of this House.  As a result, a Prices Commission was set up by the Fianna Fáil Government consisting of Messrs. C. C. McElligott, Thomas Johnson, S. B. Ó Faoilleacháin and Joseph Griffin. This document was signed by Joseph Griffin on 24th October, 1938, and shows what could happen a great industry when it is handed over to a few bacon curers.  It says on page 29:</P>
    <P>But, in our opinion, the scheme places the Bacon Curers in a position of undue advantage between the pig producers and bacon consumers, with the result that unreasonably high prices have been charged to the home consumers.  This has been due to the fact that the powers conferred on the Bacon Marketing Board have been utilised, by the Curers who compose the Board, for promoting the interests of the curers with insufficient consideration for the interests of the consumers or the producers.</P>
    <P>It is our opinion that the obligation imposed by the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Section 98), upon the Bacon Marketing Board to make production orders, which limit the quantity of bacon which each licensed curer is permitted to cure, both for the home market and for export, has had the effect of restricting competition between curers within very narrow limits.</P>
    <P>There would be the death knell of whatever is left of the pig trade in Ireland if the survey was carried out. You would have about four curers and the Irish farmer would be contracted probably to whichever one was nearest, and the price would be fixed.  I do not care what the Minister or his officials or the bacon survey team may say, the bacon curers would fix that price.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> What is happening about prices to-day?Who fixes them?  Fair competition fixed prices yesterday in Dublin market and for weeks and months past that has been the position.  Through that fair competition&mdash;I wish the gentleman in the Gallery would come down and make his speech here&mdash;to give an instance of how it works, you would have curers giving £12 per cwt. for the best pigs and the best pigs making £13 per cwt. on Dublin market as they did yesterday with no grading.  What is wrong with that?  Why should that be destroyed?  The only reason I can give is that one of the foremost men I knew in the bacon industry&mdash;he has now gone out of the bacon trade&mdash; actually moulded the Acts and sold the idea to the Minister's predecessor in a Fianna Fáil Government and he said: &ldquo;Thank God, this senseless competition is all gone.  We can now sit down and let them have it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister would not allow anybody to do that.  What was the result of this junta set up in those years?  The bacon curers were hauled before the Prices Commission as I have said and in 1934, when our agriculture was bleeding to death and when the Irish farmer could not afford to be done out of 5/-, this is what the Commission found:</P>
    <P>Taking the standard of profit to curers suggested by us in Paragraph 55, namely, 7 per cent on capital employed, it is clear that excessive profits were taken by curers in the period from 1934 to 1937, inclusive. In regard to each year we have made the following calculation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1934: The suggested standard of profit would represent in this year 1/8¼d. per cwt. of bacon produced, against 1/10¾d. per cwt. taken by the curers.  The excess profit taken was approximately £10,000.</P>
    <P>That is bagatelle in 1963 but it was a lot of money in 1934.  In 1935, they were getting into their stride and the excess profit was £39,000.  I want to draw the Minister's attention particularly to this to ensure that it can never happen again.  It was a real Dick Turpin or Jesse James act at a time <Col N="1571" /> when many unfortunate people were beaten to the ground, getting no prices for anything.  The Prices Commission found that in 1936 the standard profit would represent 1/6d. a cwt. on bacon produced, against 5/4d. a cwt. taken by the curers.  The excess profit taken was approximately £207,000.  We are sailing into the same waters again with the bacon survey team.</P>
    <P>In 1937, the excess profit was £52,000 because by then they had hammered the pig feeding industry so hard that pigs had become scarce. I was not able to get the figure yesterday for 1957 but I saw the bridge of Waterford white with pigs brought in from over the water to keep the bacon sellers going.  They had put the pig breeders in the Twenty-Six Counties out of business.  Yet, out of the few pigs that were there, they hammered £52,000 in excess profits. I want to repeat this: the profits I am talking about were excess profits.  I am not against profits by bacon curers or anyone else; people are entitled to profits, and good profits; but these were excess profits squeezed out of pig producers who were losing plenty of money, a great many of them losing what they really had not got and contracting debts which have never been paid.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with another side of the matter now.  In the year before the deluge, before Fianna Fáil came into office, we exported 700,000 live pigs. Then, of course, the man who never fed a pig, and the man who knows nothing about the bacon trade, the man who would have a prejudice at the time against anything for export, engendered a new policy.  I heard people screaming their heads off on public platforms: &ldquo;We will keep them at home; we will process them at home for our own people&rdquo;.  In the end, they nearly had to hang them around the people's necks because the majority of the pigs that were exported in the circumstances I have mentioned were not pigs suitable for the Irish bacon curer.  Of course, the gentlemen who were pouring out all this false propaganda all over the country did not know that.</P>

People on farms must judge by results.  They judge by what they are getting for their stock.</P>
      <P>I am warning the Minister now that a Fianna Fáil Government have been over this course with a bacon survey and I am warning the Minister not to go over this course again.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with live pigs now. Here is one for the Minister: it is right up to the minute&mdash; Wednesday, November 13th:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Producers Seek Support for Pig Store Trade.</P>
      <P>The greatest news pig producers could receive would be a promise of assistance to the export trade in live pigs, similar to the aid given to the pork and bacon exports, so as to help resume the country's trade in live pigs....</P>
      <P>Any restriction in the sale and marketing of live pigs would almost certainly sound the death knell of pig production.</P>
      <P>It would interfere with the competition I have been talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Paul Cunningham, Dublin, <Col N="1574" /> said that as a result of the endeavours of members of the Association in getting markets for live fat sows outside the country prices had risen from £4 10s. to £7 10s. per cwt. dead weight or from £10 apiece inside the last four or five months.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of thing we want. These people&mdash;dealers or dealing men, whatever you like to call them&mdash;have no subsidies.  They are not sent out on any trade missions.  They are handling £45 million worth of agricultural produce, finding a market for it, paying cash for it, and prompt cash, too.  Here in Dublin there is one of the most competitive markets in Ireland.  It seems as if you always have to come back to this House and to the Department of Agriculture to try to stifle that market because the whole idea is to do away with dealers.  If there is no dealer to bid for the cattle, what will happen if there is no dealer there to bid for the pigs?</P>
    <P>As I pointed out to the Minister, it can be seen what happened in the market, and I do not believe the Minister would be in favour of what this survey team have brought in at all.  The Minister is as close to this as any of us and he could see this for himself.  I want the Minister to see to it that no change will be made in the pig trade without its being brought to the notice of this House.  Of course, there is the whole business that the reward for doing these things is a very important thing.  The Minister, in his brief, did not like it.  He said:</P>
    <P>They appear to be a somewhat crude attempt to imitate protest meetings and marches which have taken place in some continental countries where radically different conditions prevail.</P>
    <P>If the Irish farmers want to protest, or if any branch of Irish industry want to protest, they are perfectly entitled to do it in any orderly fashion they want.  It is a sound bit of intolerance on the Minister's part to say that these farmers should not do that.  They must do these things and they must do them now in the light of the green light which has been given <Col N="1575" /> to the people in the urban areas.  Now that the Taoiseach has given the green light, will the Minister for Agriculture tell us he is prepared to give the green light to the farmers and that the farmers can stop making their applications to him for the adjustments that should be made in the various branches of the agricultural industry?</P>
    <P>We must see to this so far as the dairying industry is concerned.  Everybody is looking for better conditions in this country and they are right.  The only man who cannot be emancipated is the dairy man, and I would say the dairyman's wife and the dairyman's daughter.  They have to milk the eternal cow Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Christmas Day and Easter Sunday. They have to turn out and milk her. Their rewards are not commensurate with the awful conditions under which they have to work or the long hours they have to spend at it.  I often heard my friends from the city say that the farmer should do this and the farmer should do that, and the person talking would not be working 25 hours a week. I have an enormous respect for the Irish farmer and for the efficiency of the Irish farmer.  We are told, of course, that they will have to adopt new methods now or they cannot go on so far as production is concerned.  That is good.  At the same time, it is a mistake to discard sound old methods which proved themselves profitable over the years.</P>
    <P>I was here last night listening to Deputy Meaney congratulating the Minister, and other Fianna Fáil Minister, on the work they did and on how the land is being improved as a result of the new manuring schemes.  I do not know whether my memory is failing me or not but I was always under the opinion that the lime scheme was initiated by Deputy Dillon.  There was a lime scheme &mdash; and I have checked on it &mdash; bringing in a couple of thousand tons of lime away back. When Deputy Dillon came in, we got down to the real business of liming the land.  Then I heard Deputy Meaney say, to my astonishment, that he was complimenting a former Minister <Col N="1576" />&mdash; not Deputy Dillon &mdash; on the advisory services he was making available.I was of the opinion that Deputy Dillon was the man who went all out on this.  My memory does not fail me &mdash; I remember him over there in a storm of mockery and jeering from the Fianna Fáil speakers.  Then Deputy Meaney talked about the wonderful scheme &mdash; it is delayed action &mdash; and the £7 10s. a farmer was bound to get now for his calf.  His memory is very short.  I have great respect for him, and I like him, but I could be very tough on him.  I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I want to stick to the pig trade.  We had a mission sent to Spain, with a flourish, to sell porkers.  I am not sure of this, but twice I tried to get the Minister in the House on this.  I was not able to get the real figure so I have to tell what I was told.  I am told we shipped something like 8,000 porkers and lost £40,000.  I know a few unfortunate pig buyers who got £10 apiece; they get no subsidies; they were not sent out on any special mission; they got it themselves.  I am not against testing foreign markets or going for them but I submit to the Minister that this was not a good job, that the people who went out to investigate that market must have got some kind of price from the Spaniards.  Was it the State that lost the £40,000 on this?</P>
    <P>I was informed during the week that some time ago a consignment of very good cattle was sent to Germany.  They had to be slaughtered on the boat and a lot of money was lost by the dealers, or the <i>entrepreneurs</i> who sent them out.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to this.  The Germans ran out on their cattle quota a few years ago.  We are buying £10 million or £12 million worth of goods from the Germans and they are buying only £2 million worth from us.  The time has come to talk to them about that.  We are sometimes told the German market might not suit us, that the prices might not be right.  Since we are such good customers of the Federal Republic, that nation should have the decency to allocate us a quota.  If the people to whom they allocate it cannot <Col N="1577" /> fill it, then it could be thrown open to the trade.</P>
    <P>Of course I realise, as I always did, that the English market is the great market, but it is always good to have a few other irons in the fire.  The continental market is particularly good for our heavy cattle, our fat bullocks.  It has often helped to steady the prices of cattle here when their buyers came to the Dublin Cattle Market or to markets and fairs down the country.  Their bids have often helped to put a bottom in the market.  I submit the Minister's officials should consult with the livestock dealers and ask them for their opinion on the prospects in various countries of our selling in them.  In that way the Minister might find out where it would be profitable for us to attempt to trade, and if he found there was a wall against us in such countries, he could very quickly look up our mutual trading balances and say to such countries: &ldquo;We shall have to do something about this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like now to say something about the turkey market.  When we were sitting over there, and when the British turkey market went bad, we had here during Question Time each evening interruptions and screams from Fianna Fáil Deputies sitting here.  They were screaming at Deputy Dillon sitting over there, telling him he could control the market.  I know the Minister cannot control the market.</P>

      <P>There are a number <Col N="1578" /> of matters in the Minister's opening statement which confuse me.  In his references to the Common Market, which we are all anxious to join, he has this to say:</P>
      <P>German farmers face perhaps the most difficult problems of all, being confronted with the prospect of a lowering of prices and drastic structural changes in their whole farming economy in order to conform to the requirements of the common agricultural policy of the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>I do not know what information the Minister has but I am sure it is reliable, and I wonder, in view of that statement of his, whether it might not be advisable for us to change our tune and stay with the man we whipped, John Bull, whose market seems to be the one everybody is fighting to get into?</P>
      <P>The last point I should like to deal with is the sporting end of the Minister's Department, Bord na gCon.  I drew the Minister's attention to this body several times during Question Time.  The Minister is a hard man to hold during Question Time and he wriggled out of it when I first tackled him.  I had another go at him and he did not have to wriggle out of it this time.  The Ceann Comhairle did it to me that evening.  Now is the time to get at the Minister.</P>
      <P>I want to let the people know what happened when Bord na gCon were being set up and when they wanted managers.  Any innocent Deputy would think that the normal thing for them would have been to issue an official advertisement to the type of newspapers who deal with this business. Such an advertisement might be in the form of a two-inch double column or a three-inch single column &mdash; but no. Buried among the small advertisements in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 20th February, 1962, in the Situations Vacant column, appeared the following small advertisement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part-time managers required at at each of the following centres: Clonmel, Kilkenny, Dundalk, Mullingar, Navan, Thurles.  Experience of accounts, staff control and handling of cash essential.  Age 28-40.  Remuneration <Col N="1579" /> attractive.  Applications in own handwriting, with details, to Box 26335.</P>
    <P>Only the select and the initiated knew where to find that advertisement.  The ordinary John Citizen would never have found it.  I consider that was a deplorable way in which to fill these positions.  It created a closed borough. I asked the Minister for an explanation of that and I hope he will give it. It will be very hard to explain away that kind of conduct.  That was a disgraceful thing.</P>
    <P>I have not said anything about wheat or beet because there will be many people to speak about them.  I have kept mainly to the subject of livestock and livestock products and to our most important crop, now that we have the support of the Taoiseach for it, grass.  There was a title that used to be given to the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Paddy Hogan, the title of Minister for Grass.  Grass is now of the utmost value to the nation, the food that can be used for feeding the bullock which can be exported without subsidy or any other assistance.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, 5th September, at the National Grass Production Competition prize-giving at the Shelbourne Hotel, the Taoiseach said that for many years the products of our grasslands had been the sheet anchor of our export trade and that they constituted the best opportunity for increased export.  There is Fianna Fáil policy again.  It took them 30 years to learn that lesson.</P>
    <P>The Minister is facing something very serious with the bacon survey. They have brought in their report and I would ask him to read the findings of the Prices Commission against the first Bacon Marketing Board.  His officials can make it available to him, and they can point out the fact that when the pig trade was rationalised, the bacon curers were making excess profits.  When I mentioned that I was howled down by the late Deputy Derrig, God rest him, who knew nothing about the pig trade.  On that occasion the Prices Commission allowed the bacon curers a substantial <Col N="1580" /> profit and yet they took excess profits of £207,000 out of the unfortunate producers.</P>

      <P>When you look at farming in this country generally, you find that there are many different types.  There are all the different sizes of farms, the owners of which all have their own particular system of working.  There is a big variety of farming activities and when it comes to devising a policy of helping all of them, the Department had to think on a very broad basis in order to give help that would suit every type of farming.</P>
      <P>When he spoke here in introducing this Estimate, the Minister said that £39 million was being poured into agriculture in the coming year.  That is a very big slice of the national income &mdash; nearly 25 per cent.  Agriculture is our biggest industry and one that has not being doing as well as many farmers would like.  Naturally it has been getting the bigger share of the subsidies.  Many people feel that they are getting an income only when they see it in the form of hard cash but our policy has been to give indirect subsidies so that the farmers will be able to compete in the Common Market when we get into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago there was trouble about our butter subsidies because we were giving direct subsidies to help our farmers to sell abroad.  There was objection to that in England and also by the countries which supply butter to England.  If we were doing that with all our other commodities, there will have to be a big change when we enter the Common Market.  Agriculture is the slowest industry in which changes can be made.  Changes can be made in other industries and made <Col N="1581" /> in three or four years, but any change the farmers make takes a long time to show results.</P>
    <P>Changes cannot be made in agriculture overnight and one has to look very far ahead when making them. We have been giving indirect subsidies.In the case of fertiliser alone, one can see the tremendous increase in the amount being used.  Farmers have learned that with cheap fertiliser, their incomes can increase.  The results from phosphates and potash have been spectacular and there has been a big increase in the use of nitrogen fertiliser.  The increase in its use over the past few years has been practically 90 per cent.  The nitrogen is also a help to get crops growing, particularly in the older pastures.</P>
    <P>Where nitrogen has been used, it has increased production in meadows and has brought about earlier ripening of meadows.  It is also useful in hay-making.Nearly every year there will be at least four or five good sunny days in June when quite an amount of the meadow can be cut and when the food value is very high.  The month of July has tended over the years to be showery and whereas the rest of the hay can be made up at that stage, most of it can be cut in June when there is a fine spell of sun-shine, as the records have proved. Manure has been giving results, and will over the years to come, on quite an amount of our grassland, and production will improve.</P>
    <P>In that regard I would very much like to compliment the Minister on the £15 heifer subsidy.  Since he announced it I have had a good deal of inquiries; it has been very well received and will produce the results. The Minister has been asked why he does not give it in respect of every heifer.  It must be remembered we are looking for 1,500,000 extra cattle. Whether there is a subsidy or not, there will still be the normal number, maybe a slight rise, but in order to achieve an increase of the magnitude the Minister is seeking, this subsidy is offered as an incentive.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that we cannot import calves.  Our raw <Col N="1582" /> material is here and the calves must be bred here.  I am confident this heifer scheme will bring in the increased numbers required.  It will have the desirable effect of increasing the price of heifers, the trade in which has been rather dull for the past year or two. There will be another desirable effect. There has been a good deal of criticism in the English market that a percentage of our store heifers going over there are in calf.  Naturally if there is the possibility of getting £15, that heifer will be kept at home to produce the calf.</P>
    <P>It is a very wise plan to increase the number of beef cattle.  This is practically the only beef exporting country in western Europe.  Once we get into that market, I would say we have a fair chance of getting results.  To a large extent, beef that is used on the continent is cow beef.  Our cattle have no chance of getting in there on account of the high tariff against us. Our price is right and once those tariffs come down, I believe the people in Europe will develop a taste for our Irish beef which is one of the best in the world.  It is younger than that in countries like the Argentine and Australia and we have an advantage over most of these countries which export frozen beef, in that, first, it loses quite an amount of the flavour and secondly, the beef they produce is older.  With the increase in living standards in Europe, there is a market for our cattle.</P>
    <P>It has been reported in some of our newspapers in the past week that one of our advisers has said that it is impossible to reach this target of 1,500,000 cattle.  I believe it is doing harm to say in regard to a scheme with such long-term benefits and which will produce such desirable results for the farming community that it will not succeed.  We can take it the Department of Agriculture have gone into this thoroughly and we can expect to see the full results of it in ten or 12 years' time.</P>
    <P>The grants for new buildings such as haysheds will also prove to be wise expenditure.  It is amazing to see the number of haysheds that have sprung up in the past four or five years.  That <Col N="1583" /> is the result of careful planning by the Department of Agriculture.  The farmer is one of the first people to see whether something is a bargain or not.  With labour getting more difficult to acquire, it is not as easy to build these hay ricks out in the haggard.  Furthermore a hayshed is also useful for housing cattle. All these facilities will be needed for the increased number of cattle that will be produced in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the broadminded idea of the Department in seeking the best possible breed of cattle for us.  They brought in the Charollais and they are very careful not to let it out until they are certain it will suit the Irish conditions.They have to ensure that only the right type of cattle is used.  We have seen the result of very bad planning in regard to the beef Shorthorn over the past 50 or 60 years.  It is hardly necessary for me to mention that it became neither one thing nor the other; it became small and had none of the desired qualities.  Sometimes breeding societies are inclined to get finicky about a particular type of animal.</P>
    <P>Take the beef Shorthorns in Scotland, for example.  I think you could even say the same thing about the present Aberdeen-Angus &mdash; that the number is too small for producing the cattle and that a vast growth is needed. We need early-maturing cattle at present.Nobody can have a broader outlook on this matter, without any vested interest, than the officials of the Department who are there to see what is best for the country.  I welcome this trying out of new cattle and judging of results for themselves.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate that we live on an island.  It is easy to keep out some of the diseases that are prevalent on the continent &mdash; foot and mouth disease, fowl pest, and so on.</P>
    <P>Our Department can be congratulated on the good work they have been doing over the years in many spheres of agriculture.  I turn now to the question of sheep.  I feel there is a fair market for sheep in Europe.  We have exported quite an amount of sheep to France this year and we have developed <Col N="1584" /> a good trade with Britain as well.  I want to voice one or two criticisms.  If anything, we have too many crossbreeds of sheep competing for foreign markets.  I am aware that the Department are examining the position and are trying to find the best crosses.  We can have at least three or four that will suit requirements.  There is no use in trying to put a Galway ewe on the Donegal mountains, and so on.  You must have breeds that will suit the location and climate and use the crossing to get a lamb that will be the nearest to what is required.  The housewife has to be suited and we must try to produce something as near as possible to her requirements.  With the experiments that are taking place, I hope that, in time, it will be possible to produce about three or four breeds for crossing which will be suitable for requirements at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>We must try to produce the best pigs.  We are competing with the best pig producers in the world &mdash; the Danes. They have been able to produce a live animal of exactly the size and shape they require, just as if it were a piece of furniture produced from a factory. When the British shopkeeper buys a side of Danish bacon, he knows the exact weight it will be, and so on.  We must strive to achieve that target.  The Danes have been working on all that for 50 years.</P>
    <P>We have our pig-progeny testing stations.  We have started late but we have a chance of competing on the British market.  There is no use in trying to sell fat bacon across Europe or across Britain.  There was a time when parts of the west of Ireland used to take quite an amount of fat bacon but that area is getting smaller even in our own country.  The position is the same in Britain and will be the same on the European market.</P>
    <P>We need to encourage the setting-up of co-operative pig-fattening stations. Pigs can be fattened there in large numbers.  The feeding can be controlled so as to produce the Grade A and the Grade A Special bacon.  Those fattening units have not the facilities to produce the bonhams.  Nobody can provide the individual attention or produce bonhams as cheaply as the <Col N="1585" /> small farmer.  He is able to give personal attention to the farrowing house.  One might like to see very elaborate houses but still if what are in use are warm, then the fundamental requirement is there.</P>
    <P>Over the years, the small farmer has been able to make a house that is warm for sows and he can produce the bonhams better than anybody else.  It is very difficult to produce them in large numbers as efficiently as he is able to produce them on his farm.  The trouble is that he has not the buildings or the capital to fatten the pigs because it is at that stage that the pig must have an exceptionally warm house and it takes an amount of capital for feeding from the eight to ten weeks' stage up to bacon weight.  Therefore, the small farmer has a ready-made market for his bonhams with the fattening station.</P>
    <P>At the other end of it, factories can cut their costs a great deal more.  I know that at certain stages they could actually give as much as 10/- a cwt. more if they were sure of getting a regular supply of bacon.  With a big number of fattening units, factories could get an even flow of pigs.  Take, for example, a factory in Dublin.  Possibly on a Monday a few pigs would come in; on Tuesday a little more because there might be a few fairs in the country.  On Wednesday a huge supply comes forward which overflows to Thursday and there are some more on Friday.  The difficulty is the irregularity.The factories have to keep the same number of men employed the whole time.  It is necessary that the factories be kept going at full strength all the time.  To a large extent, our competitors have achieved this desirable state of affairs.  With the profit on pigs so small, the number are required and efficiency is essential.</P>
    <P>From the time the pig is mated right up to the time it is killed, there must be efficiency to keep it going and to be able to produce the type of bacon that is needed on the export market.  The pig end of it is achieved through management and feeding.  Our Department of Agriculture are to be congratulated on the introduction of some very fine Landrace boars which can be <Col N="1586" /> used for crossing with our Large White sows.  I feel our Large White sow is the basis we shall need because she will produce a bigger litter and is a better milker than the Landrace and, with the crossing, we shall get the grading and the type of pig that will increase the growth and fattening of our pigs. Every encouragement should be given to these large co-operative units throughout the country.  The one dread the small farmer has is that when he produces pigs and bonhams, he will not be able to sell them.  It is difficult to go from one fair to another and it is difficult to build up a trade for very small numbers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement that there is to be one agricultural inspector for every 800 holdings.  This advisory service has been held up to some extent by the county committees of agriculture not providing the finance. In the eastern counties where a penny will bring in a pound, there has been some achievement in this regard but in the western counties where the penny does not bring in so much, they have not been so successful.  In the next six months, there will be a big increase in the number of advisory agricultural inspectors, particularly in the west. The instructors should concentrate on the farm management angle rather than advising a farmer how to grow a field of wheat or grass.  It is from the overall results that the farmer gets his income and it is no use advising him to grow corn or grass if he does not know how best to utilise that advice. With a good knowledge of farm management, he will be able to get the greatest benefit from his labours.  They have been turning to this aspect in the past year but greater emphasis must be placed on it.  I should like to congratulate the firms that have been running competitions and offering prizes for farm management.  They are to be congratulated for encouraging farmers in this regard.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne have achieved a great deal of success over the past year in the marketing of milk and milk products.The idea of putting a brand name, &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo;, on our product was a good one.  It is something that will catch the housewife's eye when <Col N="1587" /> she is shopping.  Fundamentally, all Irish butter is the same and it is only in this way that we will have a chance of achieving something and disposing of any surplus that may build up.  You could never build up a trade in butter from one creamery or another and it has all to be sold as Irish butter.</P>
    <P>The sale of our product should be encouraged in Africa where there are new, independent States and in which one commodity which is in short supply is milk.  Milk either in powdered or some other form should have a market in these countries eventually.  I hope that possibility is being explored.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that the butter is being sold all over the world.  Granted that some of it is not getting a fancy price but when people acquire a taste for it, the price will go up.  There was a time years ago when there was a good market in England for Irish butter but we lost that market because we could provide butter only in summertime and had not a constant supply to give them during the winter. The result was that people turned over to New Zealand or Danish butter in the wintertime and developed a taste for that butter which is quite different from our own butter.  When we started to increase production after the war, we found that people in England were not too keen on our butter.  On one or two occasions here we imported some Danish butter and the people objected strongly to it.  It is the same with our butter in England.  People's taste for it has to be developed.  It is an extremely good product, one of the best we could ask for.</P>
    <P>In regard to horticulture, the Sugar Company are to be congratulated on trying to develop a market.  Horticulture can fit easily into the farming pattern, especially in the case of small farmers who can get a high income from a small amount of land.  There is a market for horticultural products as can be seen from advertisements on television for various kinds of English and foreign soups and canned goods. With our climate and soil, we can produce the vegetables for these foods. As the standard of life rises in Europe, <Col N="1588" /> they will be looking more and more for instant foods, foods which can be made up in a very short space of time.</P>
    <P>In Europe, more and more girls and women are living in flats.  When they return from work, they need something which does not take long to cook, something prepackaged and ready prepared.  The standard of living both in Britain and on the continent has been rising, and people are more and more demanding this type of handy, semi-luxury type food.  More married women are now working, and they too, require ready-prepared and packaged foods.  Although this is an extremely competitive market, in which some very large firms are participating, I believe we have the article and that we will succeed in getting our share of it.  In addition, it is a line which leaves much room for development in the future.</P>
    <P>As we cannot afford to leave any portion of a farm producing nothing, so also must we make every part of the country pull its weight.  Every bit of land must be made to produce something.  Even the mountain land must be brought in by producing sheep.  I know that in this regard excellent results have been obtained in some places by the use of fertilisers, and we must encourage that development.The fencing scheme will bring beneficial results, particularly to the farmers in the west and in the mountainous areas.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute has done remarkably good work since it was set up.  It has been channelling information to the advisory services and investigating every aspect of Irish agriculture.  The only criticism I would make is that it has struck me that they have an extremely large acreage to carry on their work, and I wonder if they need all these farms to carry out their experiments.  Most of their work is concerned with plots, and the acreage does look rather big.</P>
    <P>In one or two places &mdash; London and Brussels, for instance &mdash; we have agricultural counsellors attached to our embassies.  I feel that more of our embassies should have these counsellors. <Col N="1589" /> If you have a man on the spot with an agricultural background, he will have a better idea of the situation than an official without an agricultural background, and he will be able to find possible outlets for our agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>The results achieved under the Bovine TB Eradication Scheme can only be described as amazing.  They were brought about as a result of co-operation between the farmers and the Department.  It was no mean feat to be able to clear in four or five years 20 of our counties, the areas in which was the main movement of cattle.  I feel that within the next couple of years we will be able to get the same results in the south.</P>
    <P>Very good work has been done under the Land Project over the years, but I often feel there is unnecessary delay in the case of joint schemes in getting them out to the people concerned.The Boyne drainage is going on in my constituency at present.  They have to consult with the Board of Works so that their bridges and levels will be the same as those of the Board of Works when the Board comes to do the Boyne arterial drainage.  My only little criticism, therefore, is that I feel some of the joint schemes could be hurried up.  It usually means a number of farms cannot be drained until this work is done.  I know they do get preferential treatment to a certain extent but, even so, it is taking quite a while.</P>
    <P>Bord na gCon have achieved quite a lot in the few years they have been in existence.  They have secured a ready market for the type of dog practically unsaleable a few years ago &mdash; the moderate animal, which was always very hard to sell.  They have been able to secure markets in Italy and America in addition to the existing market in Britain.  Greyhound racing is the small man's sport.  He cannot think of having horses.  But if he can have a bit of fun with greyhounds and make some money at the same time, more power to him.  Bord na gCon have succeeded in removing any little abuses which existed, and the industry is now going extremely well.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish the Minister <Col N="1590" /> well in his new heifer scheme.  I think the £15 subsidy will achieve the results he hopes for in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very often difficult to follow the mental processes of this Government.  It was only last April the Taoiseach was assuring us, at Column 318 of Volume 212, No. 2, of the Official Report in regard to the turnover tax, that it would result in little, if any, increase in the cost of living. He said:</P>
      <P>Deputies have asked what will be the effect of this tax upon the retail price level.  That is not easy to forecast.Indeed, the effect on prices is far more likely to be exaggerated than otherwise.  If the full amount of the tax is passed on in respect of all prices, if the general price level goes up by the amount of the tax, then an increase of around two per cent may be counted on, allowing that the tax does not apply to things like rents, transport services and so on.</P>
      <P>At that time we prognosticated that the impact of the turnover tax would be very severe on the cost of living and the consequences that would flow therefrom.</P>
      <P>Despite the Taoiseach's optimistic forecast and in spite of the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> which he published in February, 1963, we are now informed that it is necessary, in order to maintain social justice, that there should be a substantial increase in industrial wages.  That is probably true as a result of the increased cost of living, but it is noteworthy that when the Government were trying to freeze wages and incomes and published <i>Closing the Gap</i>, they based their claim for the necessity to freeze wages on the graph published on page 4 called &ldquo;Diagram 1: Indices of Weekly Earnings per Wage-earner Engaged in Manufacturing Industries between 1958 and 1962.&rdquo;  They described the gap they were concerned to close as being the difference between the weekly earnings of the industrial worker and the output by wage earners.  The wage earnings figure stood at 128.4 and the output figure at 117.9.  They said this gap of 10.5 points constituted a menace to the economic future of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> The latest available figures, related to the end of June, show that the output of wage earners is now estimated to be 123 and the weekly earnings of the industrial worker are estimated to be 132.  The gap is still approximately the same as it was when the White Paper was published.  But now we are told by this Government that what constituted an urgent and immediate menace to the economic future of the country in February is all right and the Taoiseach calls for the ninth round of wage increases.</P>
    <P>Just as the Taoiseach says, whatever our economic calculations were last February, whatever my prognostications were last April, the cost of living has gone up to such an extent that a ninth round of wage increases in industrial wages is inevitable.  Has anybody here adverted to the fact that, if the increase in the cost of living is such as to force the Government to swallow their own words, their prognostication and warnings in the sphere of industrial earnings and to concede that a ninth round is urgently necessary, if social justice is to be done, there is no proposal anywhere to make any corresponding provision for the thousands of small, self-employed farmers who have to meet exactly the same increased cost of living and who are apparently to have no adjustment in their revenues to meet the extra burden?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the net result of the situation into which we are drifting now is that the gap which was wide enough, between the standard of living of the farmers and that of the industrial workers before the Government's latest excursion, is now to be further widened.  For a country whose principal natural resources consist of 12 million acres of arable land, I suggest that is a very grave development in our circumstances.  One of the consequences is that large areas of the country are becoming denuded of population simply because the traditional pattern of life which has constituted the foundation of our kind of society, a property-owning agricultural community, is being destroyed by the fact that this differential in the standard <Col N="1592" /> of living they are permitted to enjoy and the standards of the residents in towns and cities is becoming so wide that no young people will undertake the responsibilities of agriculture in the future, to the growing detriment of the principal natural asset we have, the land.  That is one of the strange and disastrous by-products of the Government's economic policy but it is one the House should not lose sight of because I think it will create very serious additional problems over and above those that already afflict us.</P>
    <P>My experience has taught me that in seeking to expand agricultural output, the most powerful encouragement the Government or anybody can provide is to ensure a profitable outlet for increased production.  When I was Minister for Agriculture, it was certainly my experience that any line of production which yielded a profit would very quickly get the output from the farmers.  Only when they were confronted with the prospect of producing at a loss did that output tend to dwindle.  I am convinced that the present situation of the agricultural industry urgently demands as it has done for some time, an effective advisory service for all farmers.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Meaney speak yesterday about the immense success that had attended what he was pleased to describe as the intensive agricultural advisory service provided for his creamery area in Cork.  There are few Deputies who did more to prevent an adequate service being established in this country than Deputy Meaney.  I am convinced that the provision of such a service constitutes the keystone of enduring progress in the agricultural industry in future.  I believe the present Minister has come to realise that, but foolishly, and for purely political reasons, he baulks at the steps necessary to give effect to such a scheme.</P>
    <P>The basis of such a scheme should be to relate individual agricultural advisers each with his own particular territory.  Nothing is more discouraging for a man acting in the capacity of agricultural adviser in rural Ireland than be given an indeterminate <Col N="1593" /> area with very little prospect of being able to cover it adequately and never having the satisfaction of being able to show the result of his exertions in the community or area which he is charged to serve.  I have always believed that the proper basis for an adequate agricultural advisory service is the rural parish, which is the natural social unit in our rural society.  There are 800 such parishes in this country.  I believe that if we initiated a scheme based on one agricultural adviser to every three parishes, it would provide one adviser for approximately an average of 1,000 farms each.</P>
    <P>As the scheme developed, I believe we would find it eminently worthwhile to expand it in most areas in the country to the point of having one adviser for every parish, which would be the equivalent of approximately 300 farms.  We could start tomorrow with 300 advisers handling three parishes apiece and we could aim ultimately at having about 800 qualified officers in the field when we reached the stage of having one for every 300 farms.</P>
    <P>No money could be better invested than money invested in such a scheme and, until such a scheme is in operation, there will be no effective communication to the farmers of the growing volume of valuable research which is becoming available from the Agricultural Research Institute, which we set up during our last term of office. It is a tragic thing to see the volume of material that is being made available by the Agricultural Research Institute, both from its own resources and from its mobilisation of information from other institutes abroad, and to realise that the people for whom that information is discovered, or accumulated, are not getting it because there is not an adequate service to bring it to them.</P>
    <P>Whether that service is provided by the Department of Agriculture in collaboration with the county committees of agriculture does not very much matter, but certainly there ought to be a common purpose in the service. There ought to be effective power in the Minister for Agriculture to see that the service works properly and there ought to be effective power in the <Col N="1594" /> Minister to ensure that, wherever the service is operating, it is operating as it should operate adequately to serve the people for whom it is intended.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that, until you can relate the service of an adviser to a certain area for which he is himself responsible, and from time to time review the success or failure of his efforts, you can hope for no satisfactory development of an advisory service in this country.  Now, when I speak of reviewing his efforts, I do not mean going to inspect the work done only for the purpose of finding fault.  I think that for a man to be working hard to achieve increased production and better standards in an area which he is serving to reach the conclusion that nobody gives a hoot whether he works well or ill is the most discouraging thing that can happen to a man.  I think if an adequate supervision were available, and where good work was done, a man knew it would be appreciated, that would do a great deal to help in securing an effective distribution of the amount of information without which our farmers cannot effectively exploit the land on which they live.</P>
    <P>We have reached the conclusion, which, I am convinced, is right, that there is not the least use giving advice to small farmers designed to enable them to expand production if the small farmers to whom the advice is given cannot afford to take it.  Anyone who has had any experience of small farmers in this country knows their constitutional reluctance to enter into credit liabilities, particularly when interest charges are involved, and I am convinced, as my Party are convinced, that it would be well worth while, if we are seriously intending to make an effective break-through in expanded agricultural production in this country, to invite the small farmers to enter a scheme wherein there would be made available to them credit up to £1,000 interest-free for schemes of increased production prepared in consultation with the agricultural adviser operating in their district.</P>
    <P>I am shocked to discover the Minister for Agriculture, speaking on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, in- <Col N="1595" /> dulging in the idiotic calculations which are set out on page 10 of his manuscript.  I must not, Sir, go behind the Minister; the Minister speaks for his Department here and therefore I must attribute to him personally the idiotic calculations set out on that page.  He speaks of 200,000 farmers, each borrowing £1,000, the total cost of which would be in 25 years £188,667,000.  These are figures which are becoming for an arithmetic class of the first or second standard; they are not worthy of a Minister for Agriculture in this House.</P>
    <P>The facts are that we have in this country about 250,000 farmers between five and 150 acres, of whom 120,000 have less than 30 acres.  In fact, I suppose if all the farmers borrowed on the same day a sum of £1,000 each, the likelihood of difficulties arising would be formidable; but, in fact, if the sum of £8 million it is now proposed to invest in a nitrogenous fertiliser factory were invested in a revolving fund for the purpose I have in mind, plus the lending resources of the joint stock banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation, there would be no strain whatever on the available credit in this country.  Every farmer would have to prepare a scheme for increased production in consultation with his agricultural adviser.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been printed and shouted about.  It has been explained a thousand times.  It seems to me a rational proposal that, if you want increased production, you have got to plan to get it; and, if your adviser advises you how to get it, as I envisage the problem, there is no use the adviser giving the farmer advice that the farmer cannot afford to take. I want the adviser to be in a position to say: &ldquo;If you are prepared to work with me to get that increased production on your own holding, to the advantage of the national output and of your own family, I am in a position to recommend you for the credit necessary to achieve it and, what is <Col N="1596" /> more, you will get a loan interest free.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is there anything extravagant or unreasonable in that proposition?  If we are prepared to lend large-scale industry almost unlimited sums of money, not to speak of substantial grants running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, is it not reasonable to say to a small farmer, who is prepared to embark on a plan to expand his production on his small holding: &ldquo;If that costs you £300, £400, £500, £600 or £1,000, I, the agricultural adviser, am not only prepared to show you how to do it but to assure you that you can get the credit there for it and pay it back in instalments, without being charged interest on it?&rdquo; Is that unreasonable in the light of our dealings with large industrial enterprises in this country? I cannot see that it is.  On the contrary, I am convinced it is right, and if we are serious in wishing to keep our people on the land and give them some hope or prospect of bridging, at least a part of the gap, which separates their average income to-day from that of the industrial worker, there is no other way in which we can do it.</P>
      <P>I absolutely refuse to accept the Fianna Fáil philosophy that the only way of preserving society in this country is to drive the people off the land and consolidate the holdings. That was Lord Lucan's way.  Do not let us forget that the man who first suggested that in this country was Lord Lucan and he came to be known in this country as the Great Exterminator.Our people fought with their bare hands on the Lucan estate and all the resources of the British Government were brought against them, until, in the heel of the hunt, our people drove Lord Lucan out of the country instead of Lord Lucan driving out our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resources of the Government today are even more formidable than those Lord Lucan had available to him.  I am no more in favour of driving the people off the land to-day than my grandfather was in favour of doing it 100 years ago.  There is no greater illusion than to abandon the <Col N="1597" /> land, or our people who live on it, in the belief that we have got to follow the example of certain other countries to-day, who have abandoned agriculture in favour of an exclusive concern for industrial pursuits.  We have something infinitely precious in this country. We have a way of life and a system of society which we ought to treasure and it is largely founded on the property-owning farmers of Ireland, who are responsible to nobody but themselves for the administration of the land which is vested in them.</P>
    <P>I want to say again that despite the discreditable, dishonest, and, in my submission, disreputable calculations, which the Minister for Agriculture has disgraced himself by producing for the edification of poor old Deputy Burke of North Dublin, the suggestion we intend to implement, by way of provision of credit for farmers who are prepared to undertake schemes to increase production, in association with the advisory services which we intend to establish, is a sound scheme, if we are serious in our desire to enable the 250,000 small farmers of this country to participate in, and to expand, production to the degree necessary to make a real break-through to agricultural expansion.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am convinced that we can have no enduring success in an effort to expand agriculture on the basis of our property-owning farming community, unless we are prepared to help the farmers to build for themselves houses which will bear some relation in the accommodation made available to that of the houses provided for industrial workers by the municipalities of our various towns and cities.  The plain truth is that, in respect of a great number of houses in rural Ireland, time slipped by and these country dwellers are living to-day in the houses in which their great grandparents were living 100 years ago.  There have been adjustments and improvements but, substantially, the accommodation and structure of the houses relates closely to what was there 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>That is obviously an undesirable situation in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves.  The conservative <Col N="1598" /> temperament of our people, isolated until relatively recently from contact with modern developments, made that situation acceptable.  Now, with television in every country village and our people coming more and more in contact with modern methods of living, the plain fact is girls will not marry into old-fashioned country houses with none of the modern amenities available therein.</P>
    <P>How are we now to resolve this problem?  It is not difficult.  All that is necessary to do is to say to any small farmer in the country: &ldquo;If you want to build a new house &mdash; not necessarily because your old house is inadequate but because it is out of date &mdash; make out the plan, extract from the local authority the housing grant you are entitled to and from the Department of Local Government the housing grant you are entitled to, and indent upon the Land Commission for the balance of the cost, in the knowledge that that balance will be added to the land annuity,&rdquo; in the same way as an annuity would be added to the land annuity under Land Project B before the Fianna Fáil Government took it off.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to refer to the Government's anticipations in connection with the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  There is nothing more corrupt or rotten than fraud.  This document, the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> is very largely a fraud.  Its origin is very well known to me.  I have here a document which was published by the OECD early this year called <i>Policies for Economic Growth</i>.  It so happens that I was charged with the responsibility of presenting this document on behalf of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to the Council <Col N="1600" /> of Europe at Strasbourg last March.  It represents a commentary on a decision taken on 16th and 17th November, 1961, when the first Ministerial Council of the OECD agreed on the desirability of establishing a target for economic growth.  We had set, as a collective target in respect of the decade 1960 to 1970, a growth in real gross product of 50 per cent for the 20 Member Countries together.</P>
    <P>That document has been in existence since the beginning of this year.  It was, in fact, published on 28th November, 1962.  What has actually happened is that the Government in their Budget imposed the turnover tax and discovered a reaction so violent that they made up their minds that some diversionary stratagem must be presented in order to get the public mind off the turnover tax and its inevitable consequences.So somebody in the Department of Finance was charged to get out quickly a <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  What happened was that they took this policy programme of the OECD adopted by the Member Countries in 1961, and proceeded to fit in whatever figures were expedient in order to present us with the prospect of our achieving that goal. When you come to examine the figures in detail, you find that very few of them are of a concrete character.  They are very good aspirations until you come to page 28, where the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> sets out:</P>
    <P>Cattle, live and dead, is our principal farm product, both in total output and in export value; and it is also, fortunately, the product for which increased export demand is most likely.</P>
    <P>So we have travelled a long way since the days when they were slaughtering the calves and selling them for the price of their skins, 10/- apiece.  We have now suddenly discovered that cattle, live and dead, are our principal farm product, both in total output and in export value.  There was a time when a bullock in this country used to qualify for the term &ldquo;traitor&rdquo;.  We are all weary of listening to the Fianna Fáil dirge about the bullock, the stick and the <Col N="1601" /> dog.  What a wonderful conversion is here, but what havoc has been wrought in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The programme goes on:</P>
    <P>A major aim of the second programme is to raise the output of cattle from 1,046,000 in 1960 (1,065,000 in 1962) to 1,500,000 in 1970 &mdash; an increase of 454,000 or 43 per cent, almost all of which will be for export.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture says that is perfectly easy; I say it is mathematically impossible.  Let the event see who is right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not misquote me.  I said the weapons are there.  The stock is there and there is no physical, no technical or other obstacle of that nature to our achieving that goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it is pure eyewash and eyewash of a most malignant character because nothing is more easy than the tendency that has always manifested itself in Fianna Fáil, to try to prove the farmers are lying down on the job.  The idea is to set a goal which every rational person connected with the livestock trade in this country knows to be impossible of realisation, and then to say the farmers do not pull their weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>Wait a minute.  This is not the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> we have had. The <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> published in November, 1958, at page 15, had this statement:</P>
      <P>The objective of the policy will be to increase cow numbers progressively to at least 1,500,000 in 1964.</P>
      <P>That was the objective set in the White Paper then, at a time when the bovine tuberculosis scheme was just under way.  Of course we have failed, by nearly 200,000, to achieve that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it any harm to have an objective and to strive to attain it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No harm at all, provided it is honest and attainable, but <Col N="1602" /> it is most injurious to set programmes which everyone in the country knows to be fraudulent.  It knocks the heart out of anybody who really wants to help.  I want to see, and every other rational person in the country wants to see, the livestock population expand indefinitely to the utmost capacity of the land to carry it, and when I see the Minister for Agriculture solemnly nodding his head in assent to that proposition, it is hard to keep my patience because it is not so long since he and his colleagues were describing livestock advocacy as violent treason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything to be gained by adverting to the fact that the Minister has been a cattle dealer.  It is greatly to his credit if he was.  Neither is anything to be gained by adverting to the fact that I have been associated with the land all my life.  We are speaking here as representatives of our respective policies and I do not think I am uttering any libel on Fianna Fáil when I say that as a result of 16 years of their administration, when I took office first as Minister for Agriculture, the people were getting less for a calf than they were getting for an old hen.  The first thing I did as Minister for Agriculture was to close down a factory in Millstreet which had been set up for the purpose of slaughtering calves for the purpose of disposing of their skins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was at the end of 16 years of Fianna Fáil, when the livestock industry of this country was nearly wrecked. It still remains obvious that every rational person wants to see the cattle population, the sheep population and the pig population raised to the maximum figures the land is capable of carrying.  Insofar as Fianna Fáil have undergone a conversion, I welcome it, but let us set ourselves realistic goals if we are to set ourselves goals at all, because we shall be only deceiving ourselves otherwise.  Let us attempt <Col N="1603" /> what can be done and thus secure the support of everybody to ensure that it will not be followed by a period of disillusionment and that nobody will be given an opportunity of pointing the finger of scorn at the agricultural community and tell them that they did not reach the objectives set for them in the attempt to expand to gross national productivity.</P>
    <P>I now come to consider the first proposal the Minister put before us of a grant of £15 per heifer.  As far as I understand the scheme, it is that given a basic year, this year, according to how many cattle you have tested under the bovine T.B. eradication scheme, if you have six cows and add two cows in 1964, you are entitled to a grant of £30 from the Government.  If you had 20 cows in 1963 and buy 40 heifers and let them in on the land to calve, then you get £600.  Thereafter the first man's basic rate will be eight and he will get no further grant unless he increases that number and the other man would now acquire a basic rate of 60 cattle and could get no further grant unless he had more than 60 cows and heifers on the land.</P>
    <P>I think that will benefit some of the larger farmers who have the land on which to put the heifers and who can afford to buy them.  I do not think it will do much for the small farmer.  He cannot afford to buy the heifers and he will not have the land to increase his stock particularly if he is a good small farmer who is already keeping the maximum number of livestock his land can carry.  It has another aspect. It will be a great hardship on the six or eight cow man at present who sees the man with 20 cows buying those 40 heifers and calving them and who realises that not only is there now within reach of his relatively wealthy neighbour a grant 30 times as great as he himself can get but also that the immediate consequences are that the milk output of his large neighbour is going to add materially to the total exportable surplus of milk products which is at present being financed as to one-third by a levy on the milk cheque of the small farmer as well as the big farmer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> Deputy Donegan pointed out on behalf of this Party that since this milk levy scheme was adumbrated, a radical change has taken place in the export of butter.  When this House agreed to the proposal that the export bounty on creamery products would be financed as to two-thirds by the Exchequer and one-third by the producer, the average export bounty payable was in the region of £10 per cwt.  The average export bounty payable at present, according to the most recent date for which we have figures, is about £5 per cwt.  When the Exchequer accepted liability for two-thirds of the subsidy, that meant they undertook to find approximately £6 6s. per cwt for every cwt exported.  The producer was required to find the balance.</P>
    <P>Now the total subsidy is substantially less than the two-thirds which the Government undertook to pay.  We are going to introduce a heifer scheme which will increase the total volume of butter going out.  Is it reasonable to say, now that the position has so radically altered, to the smaller farmer that his milk levy will have to bear the expense of exporting the larger output of the larger farmer who has got a grant of £600 for his 40 heifers?  I suggest that the Minister should consider the position of the small farmer and that it is not unreasonable to say that if the industrial worker is to be invited to participate in the ninth round of wage increases, and if the large farmer is to have virtually unrestricted access to the heifer subsidy scheme, the burden of the milk levy should be taken off the shoulders of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he comes to the House with proposals to that end, he will find a great measure of support.  The sooner it is done, the better it will be.  There is time now to do it in preparation for the new milk season which opens in February or March.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be an intolerable situation that the present income gap between the small farmer and the industrial worker should be further widened over and above what it is already.  This cancellation of the levy, which would be no further burden on the Exchequer, <Col N="1605" /> would be some small contribution towards closing that gap.</P>
    <P>People often forget, when they become too intoxicated by the neverending talk about industrial exports and all that we are doing by tax exemptions, exemptions in income tax and corporation profits tax, towards helping industrial exports, the relative importance to our economy of our agricultural and industrial exports.  In the first six months of this year, live animal exports represented approximately £25¼ million.  Foodstuffs represented £28.5 million.  That gave a total of £53.75 million for foodstuffs and live animals.  The total value of manufactured goods exported amounted to £20.4 million.  In respect of live animals and foodstuffs, there were very substantial increases as compared with last year which, in fact, operated to keep the balance of trade in some control.  In the first six months of this year, the increase in the value of live animals and foodstuff exports was approximately £7 million.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that in the whole economic picture of this country agriculture is more than pulling its weight so far as exports are concerned and it is urgently important that we should continue to push in that direction.I agree with the Minister for Agriculture that one of the main hopes we have for enduring increased exports is the livestock industry.  I use the word &ldquo;enduring&rdquo; deliberately because in connection with the figures I have given for total industrial exports for the first six months of the year, one item of £1.2 million is in respect of a ship that we sold to Canada.  We cannot sell a ship every month and some of the ships we sell cost us a great deal of money before we find a buyer.  But livestock exports and food exports, I agree with the Minister, have every prospect of enduring and expanding, if we can produce enough of them.</P>
    <P>I want to add my voice to the anxieties expressed by Deputy Thaddeus Lynch in regard to what is proposed for the pig industry.  Nothing is worse than a long period of uncertainty.The rumour circulating is <Col N="1606" /> that there is some plan in somebody's mind designed to achieve two ends: one, the virtual elimination of the pig jobber and the other, a material reduction in the number of small bacon factories in the country.  We have been through all this before.  We had a scheme 25 years ago in which we were going to rationalise the bacon industry and compensate a number of small bacon curers in order to induce them to get out of the business.  A considerable number of them took their compensation and got out.  I spent my time afterwards, when I was Minister for Agriculture, dealing with urgent applications from some of these people to get back in again, and a very difficult problem it was to deal with.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a good thing to be closing down small bacon factories. Some of them are as efficient as, and even more efficient, than, some of the larger factories.  Far from closing down small bacon factories, which have a very valuable local labour content, my objective would be to try to maximise supplies in order that the capacity of all these factories would be fully exhausted.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with helping some of the older factories who are prepared to put some of their own money into the business of modernising themselves. Some of our Irish bacon factories are antediluvian in their equipment.  However, I remember when I was Minister for Agriculture, one of the most antediluvian factories in this country was under the strongest possible pressure, as a matter of high urgency, to reform its procedures, as being a factory most urgently in need of modernisation, and yet from my personal knowledge, I can say that the bacon produced there commands a readier market than any other factory in Ireland.  Those two facts are hard to reconcile but there they were.  Nevertheless from the aspect of enduring international trade, there is no doubt that in the long run factories in this country must be modernised and brought up to date, and any help we can give them is very well given.</P>
    <P>I demur at a proposal to eliminate <Col N="1607" /> all the small factories and to carry on a process of rationalisation which will do a great deal of harm, create unemployment for the people who work in the small factories, cause immense inconvenience for the producers who live near these factories and who at present can effect deliveries without having to worry about transport of their produce from the farm to remote factories, and yet gives us no guarantee that the end-product of the industry will be any better for the elimination of what are generally known as small factories.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to suggest to the Minister that some element of competition in this business is good.  Pig jobbers have been engaged in this work for generations and serve a very useful purpose.  No pig jobber will buy a pig unless he knows some place where it can be profitably disposed of. They act in the Dublin market and elsewhere as a constant check on any attempt at combination to pull down the price payable to farmers for pigs.</P>
    <P>We all know that under the guarantee system of prices for pigs set up by myself when I was Minister for Agriculture, farmers are guaranteed a minimum price for Grade A and Grade A1 pigs.  If a pig does not fall into one of these expensive categories, the loss can be absolutely crushing. There is no doubt that the pig jobber has operated to alleviate very materially the loss in which a small farmer would be involved if his pig were graded B or was otherwise outside the categories of A and A1.  For that reason, the Minister should be very slow to approve any proposal which would operate to eliminate the pig jobbers from the life of the country.  I am convinced they are discharging a useful function and constitute a most valuable check on any attempt to exploit the producer.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before, and I am sorry there is no reference to it in the Minister's statement, that I believe the expansion of pig production could be very materially contributed to by the development of pig-fattening farms, preferably associated with co-operative enterprises.  With the present stiff grading of pigs, the fattening of pigs <Col N="1608" /> has become a highly skilled operation, requiring specialised types of housing. I do not say it is impossible to finish a pig without that kind of equipment but it is a rather haphazard venture to try to get the top grade for pigs without modern housing of a certain design and without special feeding procedures which require a considerable degree of technical skill.</P>
    <P>I am greatly attracted by the suggestion, which I believe is operating on a limited scale in certain areas, that co-operative societies, creamery societies or similar societies purchase progeny-tested sows and issue these to small farmers who are prepared to buy them, and provide, further, the service of a progeny-tested boar so that the small farmers will produce the bonhams and that the central station stands ready to accept the bonhams at 10 or 14 weeks' old, according to the practice of the district, at a guaranteed price of 2/-, 2/2d. or 2/4d. per lb., whatever the special circumstances of the enterprise will allow.</P>
    <P>In my judgment, if farmers are given the opportunity of producing pigs with the certainty of a rapid turnover and a guaranteed outlet, at a prearranged price, we shall get a vastly increased output of pigs.  We are anxious to ensure that that increase or the bacon produced therefrom will be of a standard calculated to command the best market in the international markets in which we must trade.  The only way of providing that would be to ensure that the co-operative authority would make available progeny-tested pigs either from our own resources or imported from Northern Ireland or elsewhere.  There is no use in providing progeny-tested sows if we are not prepared to make available to the farmers keeping them the services of a progeny-tested boar. This procedure would result in a very valuable expansion of the pig population and in a very substantial expansion of our bacon exports in which I believe we should be able more and more effectively to compete with alternative suppliers of the British market.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting thing that we <Col N="1609" /> have lived to see the day when the world price for barley is beginning to pass out the domestic guaranteed price for barley.  I understand now that the barley produced in this country is probably costing less than barley of similar quality purchased on the international markets.  There was a time when I doubted if that could ever be so.  I rejoice, then, that the price of feeding barley which has been fixed in strict relation to the price payable for pigs is now virtually an economic price.  I cannot persuade myself that in that situation there is not scope for a vast expansion in the production of feeding barley in this country.  That provides a great prospect for tillage of an economic kind in this country.  It provides today not only a virtually ideal raw material for the bacon industry but it is now reasonable to anticipate, with the growing international market that is developing in grains and cereals, that it might well become a primary export itself.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in view of the climatic conditions in which we operate we ought to promote to the limit of our capacity &mdash; and how readily we could do it if we had an adequate advisory service operating in the country &mdash; the growth of feeding barley, bearing in mind that the climatic conditions of this country which can so frequently be fatal to a wheat crop are relatively insignificant in regard to the barley crop which, even when it is weathered by adverse weather conditions, can still be saved and profitably used as coarse grain for animal feeding.</P>
    <P>I heard, in the course of the Minister's introductory observations the announcement that he had proposals in mind to set up an island quarantine station at Spike Island.  Have the international regulations in regard to quarantine been radically altered? That concept was repeatedly considered by me when I was Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I suppose everybody who becomes Minister for Agriculture asks that question the first time he comes up against the habitual delay that exists in quarantine stations in Liverpool or <Col N="1610" /> in the other principal ports in Britain. On all occasions I was told that our disease-free status depended on certain internationally-recognised regulations which imposed upon us the obligation to notify the international authority and all other Governments with whom we have veterinary agreements of the occurrence of any outbreak of certain diseases within our territory.</P>
    <P>I was told that if we had a quarantine station on any of the islands off our shore and if there did turn up a case of foot and mouth disease, rabies or one of the other notifiable veterinary diseases in animals, it would deprive us of our invaluable status as a disease-free country which is at present of incalculable value to us in that it gives us access to a number of countries from which the exports of all other continental countries in the way of livestock are excluded.  We have access to these markets because we have the record of long periods of immunity from certain internationally-recognised veterinary diseases.</P>
    <P>Do we stand in danger of losing that valuable qualification if we set up, even on an island, within our own territory a quarantine station where outbreaks of these diseases might in fact take place?  I apprehend we should and, if we do, then I think the game is not worth the candle, and this proposal to set up a quarantine station on an island within our own territory should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I should much rather seek to buy land on the Isle of Man or on the mainland of Great Britain and set up a quarantine station there if that could be brought within the scope of the veterinary regulations.  I can conceive of veterinary regulations permitting a kind of free port into which you bring your cattle and there keep them immune from all contact with outside animals or people for the appropriate period and then ship them on to Ireland, thus providing us with our own quarantine accommodation either in Great Britain or on the Isle of Man. I should much prefer that arrangement than to put it in our own territory if that involved the risk of losing our disease-immunity reputation.</P>
    <P>I cannot dismiss from my mind the <Col N="1611" /> belief that the present Minister for Agriculture is not a very effective figure in office.  I assume he is doing his best but I do not think much of it.  In common with a number of his colleagues, the greatest service he could do the country would be to join them in a protracted period of Opposition in this House, if he did not elect to return to his green pastures in County Cavan and make up his mind that he had done enough damage for one lifetime to permit of his resting for the remainder of his days.  I am sure he must be the worst Minister for Agriculture that any country in Western Europe has had to endure but he could do the country one great final service and that is to quit &mdash; and I exhort him to do that as soon as may be.</P>

If the entire programme they would set out on if they had a chance of getting into power at present is based on what they tried to build up then, there would be a very bleak outlook for the nation.  I noted in particular the attempts being made by Deputy Lynch to cover the period back to 1932, to what he termed &ldquo;the year of the flood&rdquo;.  If the national upsurge and tide of anger which led the people to turn out the Government of the day can be called a flood, the Deputy aptly described 1932 as the year of the flood.  All the speakers on the opposite side halted their backward march at the year 1932 and made no effort to cover the years before that, the events which led up to 1934 and the slaughter of calves brought about by an attempt by England to enforce the economic stranglehold which she was trying to get on our nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take Deputy Lynch and the other speakers back further than 1932 but first I should like to correct a statement made by Deputy Lynch.  He said that 700,000 pigs were exported in 1932 and when I asked him the price, he said that it was £5. 10. per cwt.  The actual price for pigs in 1931 <Col N="1612" /> was 53/- per cwt and that can be seen in Table 233 of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, 1933.  That shows the value of statements emanating from the far side, wild statements which have no foundation in fact and which do not cover the disastrous years preceding 1932. I have a clear recollection of returning from England in October 1931 and finding at Killorglin fair, on 18th November, people taking their pigs home because they could not sell them, even though the price was 30/- a cwt., live weight.</P>
    <P>I can go back further, to the years 1924 to 1927 when it was my business to know the conditions that existed in a certain trade and when butter was being sold at 4d a lb. and when we were only producing less than half of what we are producing today.  We still had to export two-thirds of it because the people could not afford to buy it in the years which Deputy Lynch and other speakers are carefully avoiding, the years that led to the stringent hair-shirt policy of the Government of that day, the Cumann na nGaedheal Government from which that Party springs, and which brought about the disastrous result in 1929 and 1930 of 1/- being taken off the old age pensioners.That was the economic progress that Party were trying to promote. They were ably backed by alien and royalist forces to try to keep the position that existed even before the fight for independence.</P>
    <P>The people who propagated that kind of economy stated in 1934 that the Bord na Móna scheme and every other scheme of national importance was haywire, that the Government were mad, throwing money down the drain, although they were the schemes which saved us during the war and brought national wealth.  Now the people on the opposite side are trying to latch on to these schemes and trying to do bigger and better than ever. They are entitled to do that but at least we can lay a certain amount of claim to the fact that those schemes were initiated by the people in 1932 when they got rid of the policies that existed and demanded this type of progress <Col N="1613" /> and brought about a position in which they no longer had to export the necessaries of life and are able to avail of top-class conditions today.</P>
    <P>We have in my county formidable farmers who are on the forward march.  They are producing one-sixth of the country's entire milk production which means they are producing one-sixth of the young cattle.  We have two major bacon factories producing pigs in a large way and the people are clamouring for advice, which they get.  Recently the Minister brought about the position in which the advisory services have been brought to a certain standard.  In Kerry the total is 80 and already we have 70.  As chairman of the county committee of agriculture, I am very proud of the efforts of our people.  We are on the forward march.  We are not looking for interest-free loans but there are certain things we want done and which are very necessary.</P>
    <P>We have a mountainous county, with a big number of small rivers which are putting a large acreage out of production and I would ask the Minister to arrange for certain intermediate drainage schemes to be initiated to help us out.  Our very small holders who are on the maximum production should get some form of subsidy.I am referring to people who have about £4 valuation and have four or five cows.  They are able to earn about £300 a year at the maximum and they require a little more where they have families.  In Kerry, 72 per cent of our holdings are under £5; 84 per cent are under £10; and 96 per cent are under £20.  We are a county of small farmers, of smallholders who are doing a very good job in maintaining their holdings.  We are producing to the very maximum.  If we can improve the position of land flooded here, we will greatly assist the productive efforts of our people.  I know new housing plans are on the way to assist small farmers.  That will relieve a lot of our troubles in Kerry and we are grateful for it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the period 1932-33. That was the period when American bacon was imported into this country at 65/- per box of six cwt.  It was <Col N="1614" /> sold from 2d. per lb. down.  Deputy Lynch boasted of the large number of pigs we were exporting at that time. But we were importing the worst type of bacon, the flitch of bellies, pure fat meat.  At the same time, we were exporting our own top-grade bacon because our own people could not afford to eat it.</P>
    <P>Both sides of the House should join together to ensure the continuing progress of our nation.  Our people look with pride on the position we hold in the world today.  Statistics prove we are the best-fed nation.  By and large, we are a peaceful, progressive country. Some of the statements made here have been of no assistance to the people in their aims.  Any Party seeking the support of the people by such efforts cannot expect to get very far.  The people are entitled to a statement of what will be done to help them, but so far they have not had that from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the turnover tax, but no reference has been made to what alternative system will be used if the turnover tax is abolished.  I understand that when the question was put to some of the prominent leaders opposite, the reply was: &ldquo;You cannot unscramble an egg.&rdquo; This means the tax could not be dismantled.If that is the position, the Opposition should state clearly what policy they will follow to find the money necessary for national progress.</P>
    <P>Our people want to go forward. Many of them in England are anxious to come home.  There is a great feeling of hope in the future of the nation, but some of what we hear on the floor of this House is of no assistance.  I would sincerely ask the people opposite, however they may disagree with us on other matters, to put up to the Irish people a policy that will ensure the forward march of the nation. We cannot build our hopes for the future on statements such as those made by Deputy Lynch, who said that in 1931 bacon was £5 10s. per cwt.  I promised I would give the figure.  The figure is &mdash; you will get it in Table 233 of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, 1933 &mdash; 53/- per cwt.</P>

      <P>Butter was 4d. per lb from 1924 to 1930.  There was a reduction from 10/- to 9/- in the old age pension.  All this led to an upsurge in the Irish nation to break the shackles which the foreigners were trying to impose with the help of the royalist people in our own country.  That brought about the Economic War.  The people waded through that and came out winners.  The people who tried to back the royalists at that time are now trying to be the top nationalists.  I am not holding that against them.  I am asking them to ensure that the progress of the nation continues by producing a policy to find the money to finance the schemes before the country at present. If that is done, it will not matter which side controls the affairs of the Irish nation.  The people will be content no longer with vague promises; they must be given the facts.</P>

      <P>As a forward-looking Party, we certainly had the best backward-looking speech I have heard in Dáil Éireann since I have had the privilege of being here. This Deputy who has just spoken went back prior to 1932.  According to him, there was no agricultural production here, no prosperity, no stability, until Fianna Fáil came to office in 1932.  I believe the Deputy believed that.  It is a terrible thing to think that in the major political Party in the country today, there is a Deputy who could get up and make such a nonsensical speech.  I think Deputy O'Connor, in trying to evaluate the agricultural situation as he sees is, believed what he said.  I wonder if the greater number of the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party believe that sort of nonsense and if that complete and utter nonsense is put across at Party meetings, when they are discussing agriculture, to the rank and file of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>In recent years a substantial increase in the volume of business at the Land Registry, coupled with the time required to recruit and train the extra staff needed, has made for less expeditious disposal of cases.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision to which the question appears to refer, and which has been accepted by this country, is in Article 1 of the Fourth Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  The Article reads as follows:</P>
      <P>No one shall be deprived of his liberty merely on the ground of inability to fulfil a contractual obligation.</P>
      <P>That principle has long since been accepted in Irish law.  An order by the court to pay a debt is made only after the debtor has been given the opportunity to show that he cannot pay or can pay only by instalments.  Even then, by virtue of paragraph (c) of Section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940, the court is prohibited from ordering the improsonment of a debtor who appears before it and shows that his failure to pay, in accordance with an instalment order granted by the court, was due neither to his wilful refusal nor to his culpable neglect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine that one of the aims of the Department of Agriculture would be to produce here at home all the feeding stuffs requisite for rearing and feeding livestock.  Last July, I asked the Minister for Agriculture if he would indicate the imports of feeding stuffs and the answer was that from 20th August, 1962, to 31st May, 1963, we imported 82,808 tons of maize.  The question was further answered by saying that some of these imports were in relation to an agreement with the United States of America whereby they took sugar from us and we took maize from them.  That may well be embodied in a trade agreement but it highlights the fact that we are importing a considerable amount of feeding grain.  I should like to pose this question to the Minister: does he think it possible for us, as I am sure he must, with our climate, with the land available and the necessity for rotation of crops, and so on, to grow and produce all the feeding stuffs necessary for home requirements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week Deputy Clinton asked the Minister a question somewhat on the same lines and I find there are still heavy imports of maize.  Is our own home-grown stuff not adequate to feed our livestock?  Is it not sufficient to make up the necessary compounds which may be manufactured by different firms to enable us to give full nutrition to our livestock?  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but the reason we are not getting the feeding stuffs here is that the price paid to those of us who grow feeding stuffs in the tillage counties is <Col N="1656" /> less today than it was three or four years ago.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that it is not economic for farmers to grow feeding barley with a floor price of 37/- a barrel.  As against that, I should like the Minister to take into account the fact that the farmers are dependent entirely on the decisions of the merchants or whoever takes in the barley &mdash;the grain dealers in this country &mdash; as to moisture content and have no redress whatsoever in that matter.  The majority of farmers in my constituency in the past season got something in the neighbourhood of 32/- a barrel for feeding barley.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister if he could give me the prices of grain within the EEC and in other European countries as a whole.  We in Ireland have the lowest price for feeding grain in Europe.  The dispute within the confines of the agricultural discussions in the EEC today relates to feeding grains.  It is between France which has the lowest price for grain and Germany which has a high price.  The French price is considerably in excess of our price.</P>
    <P>The old argument is produced that we must be economic, that we must be competitive, that we must have the grain at a price so that we can produce, rear and market pigs in competitive conditions with other countries.  If all the other countries get a higher price for feeding grain than we do, how is it that we cannot be competitive, how is it that we cannot produce more pigs, how is it that we have not a rapid advance in pig production? How is it that we have not our barley requirements if it is economic for the farmers?  The answer is that it is not economic.  It is time the Minister realised that point.</P>
    <P>It is not realistic to ask our farmers to continue to produce a commodity the price of which has not changed since the present administration came into office about five or seven years ago when they fixed it.  Since then, there have been several increases in wages.  The costs of machinery and transport have gone up.  Rates have gone up.  Every overhead charge in relation to everything the farmer produces has gone up and yet he is asked <Col N="1657" /> to produce barley at the same price as obtained five or seven years ago.</P>
    <P>We have heard much talk about the balance of payments.  Is the answer to all this not that we have to import grain because the Minister for Agriculture is carrying out a scheme produced by somebody on paper to give cheap and economic feeding for pigs while, in return, we pay considerably more for the compound feeding stuffs in relation to the price given to the farmer for his product?</P>
    <P>I have studied the Minister's speech in so far as I could do so in the time at my disposal.  I could not find anything in it to cover the agricultural economy as a whole in relation to the turnover tax.  It may well be that the reply might be that agricultural machinery is not embodied in the tax, that foodstuffs are not embodied in the tax.  At the same time, the tax will produce extra overhead charges.  It will put an increased rate charge on the farmer.  It will put, as obviously must come, a further increase in wages for farm labourers on those who employ farm labour.  Has the Minister any answer for Dáil Éireann as to what he proposes to do in relation to that?</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion about the heifer scheme.  I must confess that I am rather confused in relation to the scheme.  I understand, and I think my colleagues who have been speaking here have taken the same interpretation of it as well, that the Minister proposes to give to farmers a subsidy of £15 per heifer over and above the milking stock they already have in existence.  He qualifies that by saying he expects some almost stupendous increase in livestock in this country and in agricultural production generally.  That may be so.</P>
    <P>I criticise this scheme in that you will find that the average small farmer is already carrying stock to his fullest capacity.  He is already milking his four or five cows or whatever the number may be.  His husbandry and economy are bound up with those few cows he is able to keep.  Therefore, it is very hard to see how he can expand his economy.  It may well be that when you go up the scale there are other <Col N="1658" /> farmers who perhaps were growing wheat &mdash; having been instigated to do so over the years by the Fianna Fáil Party who have spent a considerable amount of money in advising people to grow wheat.  It may be that some of those people will divert their activities from the growing of wheat to the production of more milk in order to get the subsidy.  The small farmers are the bulk and the backbone of our economy and I do not see what this subsidy will do for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give further clarification to the House.  He says that a person has four or five cows and if he keeps another two heifers he will get £15 when the animal has calved. Quite a few people keep heifers in the ordinary run of events.  They may keep four or five cows and may rear or carry on their farms perhaps ten or 15 heifers.  It is quite a usual custom with some people to allow maybe six heifers to calve on the farm.  They do not necessarily retain on the farm the 10 or 15 heifers but may retain and very probably do retain the 10 or 15 calves.  For the purpose of rearing these calves, of giving them necessary nourishment from whole milk, a certain number of heifers are kept.  Do they qualify for the subsidy or not?  Do they qualify for the 15 calves they keep or only for such heifers as they retain?  If not, would the Minister indicate to the House how long these heifers have to be kept?</P>
    <P>If people have a heifer and it calves and they sell the calf and sell that heifer and somebody else puts that heifer into his herd and milks it, who gets the grant or does anybody get the grant?  The Minister should make that perfectly clear to the House as there is endless confusion on the subject generally.I do not know whether or not it will achieve the desired effect but I think that the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, does know because of the reply to a question I asked him recently in relation to milk. I asked him a question in relation to the statement by the Secretary of An Bord Bainne that there may not be sufficient milk to meet the market requirements it then provided for in <Col N="1659" /> the United Kingdom and overseas.  The reply of the Minister for Finance was that he believed that the subsidy for calves would secure sufficient milk to ensure that we would have expanding milk production.  I am very dubious on that point.  But, even if it does, I do not think, at the same time, on the figures I have available to me here, that the Minister's forecast is accurate. I take it that these statistics are correct, being drawn from official sources.</P>
    <P>To put it in a nutshell, we entered this year, 1963-64, with a surplus of 35 million gallons of milk, making, with the estimated production of 331 million gallons, a total production of 366,900,000 gallons.  The foreseeable markets available to us will absorb that in its entirety with the exception of about one-third of a million gallons. Does the Minister consider that that is a safe margin to carry on and if he does how is this country, if it is successful in acquiring an expanding milk production, going to meet those requirements?  I am happy to say that in the secretary of Bord Bainne we have a very active man who is looking for markets and doing what everybody else in every other country is doing, travelling around and searching in the emergent countries for markets.  If he is successful I do not see how our present production will be able to meet the demand in new markets.</P>
    <P>To come back to conditions in my own area.  We had a creamery working a system which they had worked since 1937.  The farmers were able to send cream to the creamery; they were able to retain the milk; they were able to feed their cows and production was going up, sales were increasing and they had no surplus. There was a demand for this butter from the Inch Creamery throughout the length and breadth of the country and it was bought from them by Bord Bainne and exported with the greatest facility imaginable.  I fail to understand the policy of the Minister in shutting down that creamery.  First of all, we were told that there was considerable risk that the New Zealanders would get to hear of it and that <Col N="1660" /> nationally and politically we would be in difficulties in the world butter markets.  Surely the aim above all is to keep the milk production going.  In one fell swoop the Minister, by that action, reduced the developing power of this creamery to make butter and sell it on the market.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that farmers who are making deliveries to creameries from a distance find it far easier to send cream than milk.  They were not injuring anybody in any degree.  As I say, first of all we were told that it would raise national complications in the world markets.  Secondly, we were told that they were not producing clean creamery butter, that there was no proper control over it.  There is not a scintilla of evidence to show that or that what they were doing was having any effect on any other creamery, nor were they in excess in that they were piling up butter that could not be sold. They were producing butter which had a free sale all the time.  For that reason I cannot understand why the Minister took the action he did and disrupted the entire economy of County Wexford. Perhaps it was a decision taken on paper by somebody.  Perhaps it was something that had been decided on in principle by somebody reviewing the background, but the fact remains that the Government took that decision. Apart from the harm it has done to the farmers, I venture to say it has done more harm politically to the Government than anything else they have done with the exception of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister devoted a good deal of his speech to the matter of the importation of Charollais cattle. I wonder what really induced the Minister to fall for the importation of Charollais cattle.  Is it that he considers that the breed of cattle for beef which we have in this country is not sufficient to keep us going?  Is it that he wants to do something new or that somebody sold him the idea?  The Minister should tell the House is it the intention to breed pure bred Charollais cattle because if it is not the intention there is going to be nearly as high a calf mortality rate as there <Col N="1661" /> was in the famous years, to which we refer today with bated breath, of 1932 and 1936.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the impact will be if the Charollais breed is crossed with shorthorn or other breeds and whether the calf is going to be in excess of the size of calves delivered here.  Does the Minister consider that the mortality rate may be very high?  I wonder if whoever was responsible for this notion has considered that.  I wonder why these cattle are imported.  Have we not got good breeds already, good dual-purpose shorthorns, which give us as good beef and stores as anywhere in the world?  Why go in for an experiment such as this when we have not already got enough of our requirements for the production of milk, beef, livestock and so forth?</P>
    <P>I often wonder what the Minister's views are in regard to the growing of wheat, the policy of Fianna Fáil has varied so much over the years.  At one time we were sneered and jeered at&mdash; and some of us are very sensitive over here&mdash;that we were grass farmers but now apparently Fianna Fáil have become grass farmers and we are to rear as much livestock as we can. The British market now is the be-all and end-all on the horizon for the Minister for Agriculture and his advisers.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words on the subject of wheat.  Last year was a bad weather year and this year was a bad weather year.  Last year, there were heavy surpluses of wheat in the world and there was no market whatever for wheat.  More than 50 per cent was turned down by the millers as unmillable.  This year commenced very much the same as last year and wheat was surprisingly unmillable. There were farmers whose wheat went in two loads from the same field, the same type of grain.  Yet half of it was millable and the other half unmillable.</P>
    <P>Then the situation changed suddenly.The Chinese have had failures of their harvest in six successive years, and they found they had no grain. The Soviet Union, which has been concentrating on heavy industry, has failed to get any production whatever. <Col N="1662" /> Farmers will not produce by the whip; they prefer to produce as free men. The Soviet Union, therefore, was short of grain, too.  Heavy purchases of wheat were made by the Chinese and the Soviet Union.  The bulk of the Canadian crop had been bought by the Chinese the year before.  They came on the market this year and bought the greater part of the Australian surplus as well as a great deal from the United States.</P>
    <P>Therefore, wheat, far from being a surplus commodity in the world &mdash; although there is still a small surplus &mdash; hardened and began to fetch a good price.  Then it transpired that the millers, who turned down everything last year because they could buy cheap wheat in the world, found wheat was becoming dear.  Surprisingly, they took the Irish wheat, because it was cheaper for them to take it rather than buy it outside.  Yet we are assured that there is good control and that everything is fair.  Every Minister for Agriculture on those benches over there when asked a question has always assured the House that everything is all right and that the farmers are getting a fair deal.</P>
    <P>Last week I asked the Minister for Agriculture what happened to the unmillable wheat, and was it mandatory on the millers when they turned down wheat to sell it to An Bord Gráin. The answer was &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I pressed him in every way I could.  In one supplementary, I asked him:</P>
    <P>Am I to take it that, where wheat is rejected as unmillable, the millers are free to dispose of that wheat as they wish?</P>
    <P>The answer I got was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  In a nutshell, the position is that the millers at present have a complete monopoly. They can turn down any wheat they want to turn down, and no one can say a word to them.  They can turn down this barrel of wheat today, and tomorrow they can sell it to Russia. There is no redress for the farmer. The question was answered by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture.  The millers can sell it and do what they like with it.  There is no protection for the Irish farmer against this wheat racket.  That <Col N="1663" /> is the only name I can find for it.  It is not a matter of its going on this year or last year; it has been going on for years.  People have been growing rich at the expense of the Irish farmer. There is only one person in Dáil Éireann and in the country who can do anything about it, that is, the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Every other year farmers could get their sacks from whomever they wanted.  They were then free to offer their wheat to whatever buyer they wished.  If they were dissatisfied with the price offered to them they were free to offer their wheat to somebody else.  This year somebody introduced a regulation &mdash; I understand it was issued by someone who controls the sack output and is associated with the wheat trade itself &mdash; by which no farmer can sell his wheat to anybody except the person who gives him the sacks. I questioned the Minister on that and wrote to him about it.  I warned him of what was happening.  How many farmers in this country have their own sacks?  This is a further monopoly.</P>
    <P>If the sacks come originally from a particular mill, you have to sell your wheat to that mill, whether they accept it as millable or not.  You have not the opportunity of offering it to somebody else and having another chance of having it judged.  If that is not monopolistic control, detrimental to the interests of the farmers and to the growing of wheat and against the principles of fairplay, I do not know what is.  To reiterate, there is only one person who can control that, that is, the Minister for Agriculture.  Yet he has done nothing throughout the present season.  I defy anybody to say that state of affairs does not exist here. It exists in my own county.  I know it, and I can prove it.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has considered the wider question of world agricultural policy, whether he has considered, in basing his policy, that there are changing conditions within the world today?  Last year I heard a speech by Mr. Mansholt, the Assistant Vice-President of the EEC Commission, who is also responsible for agricultural matters within &ldquo;The <Col N="1664" /> Six&rdquo;.  I have rarely heard a more pessimistic speech in my life.  He indicated that wheat was in surplus, that milk was in surplus, that sugar was in surplus.  The only thing there was any hope for was the sale of meat generally.  The policy of the present administration appears to be to expand our sales as much as possible within the confines of the British market.  I welcome that.  It is a welcome conversion that has come, as great events always come, gradually over the years. We cannot expect things to happen overnight.  They now realise we have alongside us an export market in which we can sell.  But that should not be the be all and end all of our efforts.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has considered the potentiality for sales and the fact that there have been definite changes within the arena of world politics?  We all know that, if everyone in the world today were to have full nutrition, there would not be anything like enough for everybody to eat. We all hear with regret that there are as many as one thousand million undernourished people in the world today.  If you have a surplus of food within the high-cost production countries, such as the United Kingdom, Europe and North America it seems an easy thing that you should be able to sell it to the other part of the world. But we have to take a realistic view of the situation and try to meet it as it arises.</P>
    <P>That there are definite signs of changing conditions is very evident. It is evident that, if the United Kingdom pursue their policy to get into EEC, they cannot go on with their present agricultural system.  They cannot continue their deficiency payments, which they, as a rich industrial nation, can afford to pay so as to get forced production &mdash; produce far more and buy, as a result, less from the agricultural producing countries than they should.  It is also true that in the great battle developing within the EEC at the moment in regard to agriculture, the Germans cannot continue the system they have.  They are doing much the same thing as the other highly wealthy, industrial countries are doing, giving huge sums in subsidies, <Col N="1665" /> grants and subventions to get false extra production.</P>
    <P>It, therefore, seems that the United Kingdom, if she is to change her policy, will probably produce less than heretofore and that her market will be expanding.  For that reason, it is necessary that we should be alive to the fact that other countries are seeking that market and an increasing share of it.  There was nothing in his speech to indicate that the Minister is alive to these conditions.</P>
    <P>It is also true that the expanding economy of the EEC itself will produce an ever-increasing demand for agricultural produce, much of which they themselves are producing now. To date, there is sufficient potential market there to supply meat to three million people and that market is increasing as the population of EEC is rising but meat production is not going up at the same rate.  Even if it were, the rising standard of living there would ensure a greater purchasing potential.</P>
    <P>The South American states have been large exporters of meat in the past and their population is growing perhaps faster than any other part of the world so that they will soon cease to be exporters of meat.  That will give a further potential for exports of meat and probably of a dressed variety which would give greater employment to maintain people in rural Ireland.  I do not know if we have made any attempt to tap the market of the Arab world.  I say this because every country that has diplomatic representation there is doing all it can to gain these markets.  I do not know if we are active in that respect.  The potential to buy is there and increasing all the time.</P>
    <P>Recently at the European FAO Conference, which I had the honour to attend, it was decided to remove all duty on raw materials coming from overseas and emergent countries to enable them to have greater purchasing power so that they could buy agricultural produce from the big producing countries in Europe and North America.  It has recently been indicated in all the discussions taking place at international level among those <Col N="1666" /> concerned with international agriculture that these emergent countries are being encouraged to employ their own resources for expansion within their own countries.  Again that gives a growing potential to buy.  Is the Minister aware of and has he made any efforts to get these markets?</P>
    <P>There are other changing situations. Four or five years ago, there was a huge butter surplus in Europe.  We had a cold year and a dry year.  Then the Italians came into the market and began to buy and there was no butter. That should have been a warning to the Minister and the Government that this situation could recur.  It has recurred and there is actually a shortage of butter on the world market at present.  All we can get, apparently, out of the British market is an extra 5,000 tons although we have a most favoured nation clause in our trade agreement and it would seem we are entitled to get more.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that unless the Government are prepared to follow changing world conditions, prepared to go out and seek something, nobody will come and offer it to them.  Everybody else is doing that.  In Nigeria, with its population of 35 million and an economy just beginning to develop, there is a growing purchasing power. Beef has to be carried 500 miles ex port from Northern Nigeria to feed the populations along the coast.  They are already buying meat and I understand New Zealand is exporting to them across the world.  I do not think we have done anything about this market and I trust the Minister, if he troubles to reply to the points I raise, will correct me if I am wrong.</P>
    <P>I was glad to know as a result of a question I asked yesterday that some Minister, even though it is the Minister for External Affairs and not the Minister for Agriculture, is to go abroad soon to have discussions with EEC. Perhaps it has dawned on this Government at last that EFTA countries are coming together and trading, that their purchasing power is increasing, that their trade with each other is increasing; that the EEC is growing stronger in economic virility every day and that there is purchasing power to <Col N="1667" /> be sought for; that the Kennedy round of negotiations for free trade is being discussed and that it means something to this country; that the old traditional measure of just exporting to your next-door neighbour with no overseas competition is gradually disappearing; that agriculture faces a new world, new markets and new conditions.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that horticulture has swept on to the market and created a growing purchasing power. It was practically non-existent heretofore, merely a small section in the Department of Agriculture.  Are the Minister and his officials aware of this?  I think these are the things we must work for, new markets, new ideas and new production.  The only really live effort I see being made &mdash; and I want to pay it this tribute &mdash; is being made in the packaging and sale of Irish products abroad.  Packaging is most important nowadays and that has been realised by An Bord Bainne; they put this new &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; butter on the market and it has been selling very successfully in foreign markets.</P>
    <P>We must be up and doing where these things are concerned and the Minister and his Government must be up and doing.  If the Minister does not direct right policy and support the interests of the farmers, Irish agriculture will not expand.  It is the Minister's duty to look for markets for agricultural produce.  It is no use saying the markets are not there.  They are there.  I hazard a guess that, with the extraordinary change I have seen in the demand for agricultural produce in the past two years even, there are facing us continually improving markets for all forms of agricultural produce, as well as meat and horticultural products.  These are things we can produce eminently satisfactorily. It is up to the Minister and his Government to look for markets.  If they are not prepared to do so, then they should get out and let in someone who is so prepared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMedler" hpid="Mr. Medlar Mr. Medlar">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Medlar</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years here, I have listened to the contributions to <Col N="1668" /> this debate from both sides of the House, one side paying the Minister compliments and the Opposition criticising him.  Very seldom have I heard anything at all constructive, in the broadest sense of the word.</P>
      <P>The last speaker blamed the Minister because we may have to import animal feeding stuffs this year.  Let me give the House my experience as a practical farmer.  Last year, I grew close on 20 acres of barley which produced 400 barrels.  This year, the same acreage produced 300 barrels. That position obtains all over my part of the country.  We are one of the biggest grain-growing areas in the Twenty-six Counties.  I have heard that in some areas firms send out sacks to their suppliers.  That does not obtain in my constituency.</P>
      <P>I have heard arguments here based on statistics, the same statistics being interpreted differently according to the speaker's inclination.  Practical farmers, like myself, treat these statistics almost with contempt because we know they are not in accord with the facts.  I have heard prices quoted here for years past.  Unfortunately, we go back to the distant past much too frequently, blaming one another for what happened at one period or another.  One thing for which I condemn the Opposition is their habit of comparing wartime conditions, whether it be the Economic War or the more recent World War from 1939 to 1945, with the conditions that obtained when Cumann na nGaedheal were in power or the Coalition were in power. I do not intend to refer to these particular periods at all.  I have my opinions.  All the speeches of all the politicians in Ireland will not change facts.  The farmers know the facts. When they hear the old trash delivered here and off platforms throughout the country, it is no wonder they become cynical about politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thankful for one thing: I welcome the change of thought that has come over the farmers and landowners of this country.  I saw the day when we had two schools of thought with regard to land policy.  We had the older school which believed in free trade, buying in the cheapest market <Col N="1669" /> and selling in the dearest one.  We know what the consequences were. These people believed that what they called our verdant permanent pastures should not be ploughed; if they were, their fertility could not be restored for 100 years.  Landowners held that view quite sincerely.  I am not talking just about politicians.  There were men of different views everywhere.  Landowners were even prepared during the war to pay fines and go to jail rather than plough up their verdant pastures.  They advocated walking the produce off the farms &mdash; faith in grass and maize meal. That is on record.</P>
    <P>There was a younger school of thought, scientifically-minded people, with whom I was glad to be associated. The late Deputy Hughes was also associated with them.  They stated that grass should be treated as a crop and should be re-seeded every four or five years.  They maintained that the alleged best pasture land, untreated, in County Meath was 50 per cent weeds. There are people who tell us now, despite the advances that have been made, that if our productive potential from the land were brought to its optimum, this country would be capable of maintaining double its present livestock population.  How is this to be brought about?  That is the problem.  I believe its solution is the key to success.  The Leader of the Opposition has very strongly advocated and supported the idea that no land scientist or inspector should go in over a farmer's boundary until invited and, apparently, our present Minister agrees with him in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not at one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMedler" hpid="Mr. Medlar Mr. Medlar">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Medlar</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall refer to that in a moment.  The Minister stated recently that 30 per cent of the farmers have invited inspectors in.  I am assuming another 30 per cent have brought their lands up to the standard required for maximum production.  I suggest that power should be given to agricultural scientists to move in on every farm in the Twenty-six Counties, make a soil survey and instruct and advise each farmer as to how his land should be <Col N="1670" /> treated for the purpose of increasing production.  If, after a period of five years, a farmer fails to carry out the instructions&mdash;family circumstances should, of course, be taken into consideration&mdash;his name should be placed on an index and handed over to the Land Commission for that body to investigate, with a view to acquisition and the handling over of that land to someone who will play his part on a team dedicated to producing the maximum from the soil of Ireland.  Until that is done, we shall be carrying too many drones.</P>
      <P>I offer this much sympathy to the Minister.  During the war years, when the Minister said he would send in an inspector to compel these bad farmers and bad citizens to do their duty and grow wheat, he was told off by the Opposition.  What happened then behind the closed doors of the Fianna Fáil Party?  The Minister for Agriculture was criticised by members of our organisation.  They said he had not done his duty because he had not sent in his inspectors or the Land Commission inspectors to those land owners who were not farmers.  It was suggested he should have sent in his inspectors to acquire those lands for division and he was severely criticised for not having done so.  Therefore, the Minister was criticised from the left and from the right, and I leave it to the public to decide which side was right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition have been crying for years that there are too many inspectors.  It is a cry they should not be proud of.  I am afraid I have departed from the suggestion I made earlier about soil surveys, but I have here the opportunity of suggesting that these surveys should be carried out, whether the people like it or not.  The inspectors should move in on the farmers and carry out these surveys. I am afraid we are a bit too sleepy with those people.  It has been suggested that the good land which is not used properly should be handed over to those who are prepared to work it, to the young, virile workers of the soil. I have no reason to disagree with that suggestion and I have no lack of confidence in the ability of those young <Col N="1671" /> people to compete with the best in any country in Europe.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the philosophy of one such young person, a young man who gave a lecture recently to a meeting of farmers.  I entirely agreed with him, but there were some means from the body of the hall.  He said we have the best soil in Europe, the most suitable soil for high production.  He said we have the most suitable climate, the most accommodating rainfall.  We need not therefore offer any bouquets to our farmers for being able to compete with farmers thousands of miles away from the markets we deal in.  I shall conclude by asking the Minister seriously to consider my suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit it is the easiest thing in the world for a Deputy to get up here and criticise a Minister and his officials.  While I have some hard things to say to the Minister because of the way my constituency is being treated, I believe always in giving credit where credit is due. Having done that, I shall point out what remains to be done.</P>
      <P>I wish to say in connection with the Minister and his officials and his advisory services that I have met with nothing but courtesy and efficiency.  It has always been a pleasure for me to go to them at any time.  I wish to have that placed on record.  This is a Department which affects my constituency quite a bit and I can say quite sincerely that it has been a pleasure to approach the officials here in Dublin and those down the country as well.  Being in a congested area, we have dealings with many of the Department's schemes such as the Farm Improvement Scheme, the Bovine Tuberculosis Scheme&mdash;we have now eradicated that disease &mdash; the Land Project and so on, and I wish particularly to extend my compliments to the Department's officers in the country. They have always displayed the utmost efficiency and willingness to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend dealing today with the special problems that affect my constituency insofar as the Department is concerned.  As a young boy &mdash; I was <Col N="1672" /> born on a small farm &mdash; I had experience of exactly how the economy of such a farm was worked out.  I realise that the problems in Sligo-Leitrim may not be those of other parts of the country.  In my constituency, there are 17,000 holdings, of which 13,000 are under £20 valuation. The remarks I make will be concerned mainly with those 13,000 families.</P>
    <P>I can remember the time when the housewife's budget on such a farm centred around the basket of eggs she was able to take to the travelling shop or the local shop.  Groceries were bought with the proceeds of these eggs, and perhaps there would be a few shillings to spare.  I can also recall the Christmas budget, when the housewife had a flock of turkeys out of which she provided the Christmas fare and perhaps had a few pounds to spare.  These things are gone now. In the west of Ireland today &mdash; the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach will appreciate this &mdash; the income that was lost in that way is recouped through remittances from emigrants in England and America.</P>
    <P>In order to develop agriculture in my area, we must take into consideration the fact that we get more than average rainfall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>And some landslides.In order to develop agriculture there in a way that will be of use to us economically, some provision must be made to get rid of that surplus water.  In South Sligo, where I live, there are 117,000 acres of agricultural land subject to flooding.  These are not my figures: they are taken from statistical abstracts quoted here in the House.  Sixty years ago, that area was far down in the priority list.  It was No. 7.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that.  I merely wished to point out in passing <Col N="1673" /> our position in that respect in South Sligo.  I had not intended to develop it.  The application of fertilisers and lime to the land there is useless because of lack of drainage.  I know increased production is required if we are to enter the European Economic Community with a chance.  It is all very well to talk of 13,000 small holdings but quite a lot of those are subject to flooding.  The people on these holdings cannot increase production or cannot avail of the lime or fertiliser schemes to any appreciable extent.  It would be a waste of time and, instead of getting increased returns, they are getting decline returns, due to waterlogged lands.</P>
      <P>The problem in the west of Ireland in respect of agriculture cannot and will not be solved within the framework of existing legislation which is formulated for the country as a whole. Our problems in the west of Ireland are special problems and what applies to the farming community in the midlands and the south bears very little relation to what applies in the west. I would suggest to the Minister that he set up for the west of Ireland and other congested areas a special committee with representatives from the Land Project office, the Land Commission, the bovine TB eradication section, the Office of Public Works and the county committees of agriculture. I suggest that such a committee be set up as a State body, financed by State funds, and that it be authorised to spend money on schemes which it would formulate and send to the Government for sanction before Budget time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am aware, the Department of Agriculture have no authority to deal with special problems.  Their hands are tied and we have special problems that arise and need to be dealt with week after week.  A committee such as I suggest could plan 12 months ahead and, having formulated their plans, could send them to the Government for sanction.  Agriculture in the west is largely affected by apathy.  Time was when the sons of small farmers were competing with one another as to who would get the farm.  Today it is a fact that <Col N="1674" /> none of the farmer's sons wants to succeed to it.  They ask you: &ldquo;What would we be doing here?  What good is it to us?  We would never make a living here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That apathy of mind should be dispelled.There is a living to be made on small farms if the people are properly encouraged by the Department.I welcome the extension of the advisory services in this connection and I hope they will be some help in dispelling the apathy that appears to exist among those people.  To operate those small farms properly, you need intensive planning, intensive study and intensive encouragement.  An effort should be made to get those people to realise that there is a living on their farms, if they are properly worked.</P>
    <P>A lot of lip service has been paid to the west of Ireland but lip service is not a good incentive to work.  We want a little action and encouragement in the form of something concrete being offered to us by the Department. It is hard to realise that the Government are prepared to take a chance and spend millions of money on projects like the Verolme Dockyard in Cork or the Avoca mines.  If any Government are prepared to take a chance and spend millions of money on doubtful projects like that and even if they regard the development of the west of Ireland as a doubtful project, would it not be as well to spend some millions in developing the west rather than on the projects I have mentioned?</P>
    <P>I understand the Department is contemplating the development of veterinary research stations.  If such a project is envisaged, I suggest that Sligo should get a station for the west.  In spite of our small farm difficulties, we are the biggest cattle exporting area in the west and our sheep stocks are increasing.  An attempt is being made in Sligo to go in for intensive dairying and if the Department is establishing veterinary research stations, I would suggest that one be set up in Sligo as it is the centre of the north-west.  If the Land Commission take over the Lisadell estate, there are beautiful buildings on it which would be suitable for such a station.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I think comes <Col N="1675" /> within the jurisdiction of the Minister is the cattle boats which go across-channel from Sligo.  They have been turned down as being unsuitable and a big effort is being made to provide a modern type of boat for the export of cattle from Sligo port.  I hope the Minister will do everything in his power to facilitate that.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest difficulties for the small farmer in the west in trying to develop agricultural output is lack of capital.  From the number of cases with which I deal week after week in relation to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, I know for a fact they have no capital.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation might be a little more flexible.  I do appreciate they are tied up with regulations.  I know of a case where a farmer applied for a long-term loan which involved buildings.I understand that for stock it is a short-term loan, seven or eight years. When the money was obtained, the first part of it was spent on cattle and the second part was not made available because he had not carried out the building end of the contract.  There should be some liaison between the Agricultural Credit Corporation and, say, the county committees of agriculture to satisfy themselves that this money is being spent to the best advantage of farming.</P>
    <P>In regard to the heifer subsidy.  I do not think it will be much use in the west at all.  The small farmer in the west has his farm fully stocked.  This heifer scheme was a well conceived scheme but I would suggest that alterations should be made.  The average farmer in my constituency has four or five cows at the most.  If a farmer has one bad cow which is certified by a veterinary surgeon as a loss to the farmer and to the country, giving a bad yield of milk and so on, this scheme should apply to the replacement of such an animal.</P>
    <P>It appears to me this scheme was conceived in respect of the Midlands and especially the south of Ireland where the incidence of bovine tuberculosis was very heavy.  I do not know the details of the scheme but I thought that if reactors were got rid of there, <Col N="1676" /> this subsidy must go to the replacement of a cow in a case like that. I would like to believe otherwise but I do not think this scheme will affect my county very much at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress upon the Minister that we have a special problem in the west which is not a problem in other parts of the country.  I hope the food processing factory envisaged for my county will be a success.  I believe this is one of the ways in which we can help ourselves when we do not get the help we expect from Government sources.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one final suggestion. If the Irish Land Commission took over the Lissadell estate &mdash; I have already mentioned veterinary advisory services but if that fails &mdash; I suggest the Minister for Agriculture should seriously consider the establishment of an agricultural school there.  The buildings are there and all the facilities that would be required are on the spot.  There is no agricultural school, so far as I am aware in Cavan, Monaghan or Galway.  There is a wide open gap there with big possibilities for an agricultural school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is a seasoned and capable speaker and he is only too well able to make the best use of any material at his disposal.  On this occasion he must have had very little material. I listened to his speech in introducing the token estimate for his Department and also the Supplementary Estimate. I never heard a more doleful or disappointing speech.  He spoke here like a broken man because all his efforts had failed, because he was now Minister in a Government who never had any faith or interest in agriculture, that had never done anything for agriculture and had no intention of doing anything for agriculture in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He told us he was now engaged in trying to help this community of lame dogs who had failed him over various stiles and that it was a very expensive business.  In fact, he felt the only thing to do now with this tottering industry was to prop it up in any way and in every way we could.  He almost apologised to the rest of the community for having to impose this <Col N="1677" /> enormous expense on them.  It did not appear to occur to the Minister that the farmers themselves as taxpayers provide a considerable amount of this money and that in every country in Europe and, indeed, certain countries outside Europe they have farm supports and farm subsidies to the same extent and even to a greater extent than we have in Ireland.  That is the proper way to look at it.</P>
    <P>We do not hear the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, bewailing here the fact that so much subsidy and so much assistance has to be provided for industry. Rather is he inclined to regret the fact that more industrialists are not availing themselves of the various schemes.  I said that this was a depressing and an uninspiring speech.  It is an open confession of failure, coming at a time when a Government who were in office in this country for over 25 years should have had the agricultural industry at the peak of its productiveness and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Most of the Minister's speech was devoted, first of all, to decrying the credit policy of the Fine Gael Party. He said this question of a £1,000 interest-free loan to the small farmer was quite a ridiculous idea.  The people concerned are small farmers unable to make their units economic without it or unable to avail themselves of the agricultural advisory services provided for them.  I want strongly to disagree with that view.</P>
    <P>There is little use in going into a small farm and advising the farmer to carry out all the improvements to his holding that would provide him with a decent livelihood if he just has not got the wherewithal to do it.  Even if credit is provided through other channels&mdash; and it is very difficult to get it through other channels &mdash; in such a case it will be too costly for the man to start to get his feet off the ground.  The Fine Gael proposal is an excellent way of giving this man the start he requires. He is below rock-bottom at the moment and it will take a lift to bring him up to the surface.</P>
    <P>The other prominent element of the Minister's speech was I think his telling us that now, after 30 years' persuasion, <Col N="1678" /> the Government have at last come round to seeing that grass and more grass is the salvation of Irish agriculture and that the British market is the only outlet for our production.  It has taken a long time for that to happen.  In the meantime, it has cost this country a lot of money.</P>
    <P>There is something ironical about the fact that the same man who, as Minister for Agriculture here 30 odd years ago, slaughtered the calves is now providing a grant to encourage the production of more calves so that we may have more cattle for export.  The conversion that has taken place is really unbelievable. In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Thursday, 5th September, 1963, the Taoiseach is quoted as saying: &ldquo;Grassland products &mdash; sheet anchor of the export trade.&rdquo;  There is no doubt about it: even the Taoiseach now believes that there is something in grass and that there is something in livestock.  Even a death-bed repentance is worth while.</P>
    <P>Last year, speaking on this Estimate, I pointed out that cows were being removed artificially through the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and that it would require some artificial assistance if these cows were to be replaced and if we were to have any appreciable increase in the number of cows in the country.  I think that the same advice was given by the Leader of this Party and by Deputy Donegan.  I am glad to see a scheme has been introduced: it is a step in the right direction.  However, I fear that that step is just not sufficient.  If the Minister is to realise the target he aims at he will have to do a good deal more.  In the first year, he will get a response which he certainly will not get in the second year.  As Deputies from the west of Ireland generally have said, the scheme will not be of any great assistance to them, unfortunately, because I think the scheme is a good national move.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the position of the small farmers in this country being unable to avail themselves of the opportunity to get this extra £15 for each extra heifer they keep.  Most of them are carrying cows at the present time to the limit of their capacity in sheds and perhaps in other surroundings. <Col N="1679" /> The question of capital enters as well.  I believe the scheme will bring the increase the Minister is hoping for but it will bring an increase mainly in suck calfs.</P>
    <P>One thing that was not quite clear from the Minister's statement was this. He said that when a heifer calved and was taken into the herd the owner would then get the £15.  I know quite a few people who keep a number of heifers, calve them down and then sell the heifer.  I do not know who, in that case, would get the grant.  Perhaps the Minister, in replying, might tell us something about it.</P>
    <P>More was expected from the Minister when he was speaking.  There was nothing in his speech to give our farmers confidence, hope and stimulation.In the course of his speech, there were very many notable omissions.  For instance, there was no mention at all of the Agricultural Institute.  The Agricultural Institute is doing excellent work under difficult conditions.  It has not all the space it requires.  It has not, in fact, I think, sufficient money to do all the work it would like to do. However, I have seen the results of some of its work and I was very impressed.I visited some of the Institute's farms during the year.  They deserve great credit for the work they are doing.  If the results of the research they are carrying out could be brought down properly to the farmers and if they could be induced and assisted to make use of the information disclosed through these research centres, it would be of wonderful assistance. Perhaps I shall come back to that later but I now go on to deal with the omissions.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company has not been mentioned nor the wonderful developments in production and processing about which we heard some time ago. Something seems to have gone wrong in so far as the people in Glencolumbkille and other places were promised that if they got decent subscriptions from the farmers, they would get £ for £ and would join with them in developing these growing and processing centres.  It is well over 12 months since we heard that this was <Col N="1680" /> going ahead and that the farmers in that poor area had subscribed a large sum of money.  I understand that the position is that the Government have not come forward with their part of the capital and that an Foras Tionscal have given no grant.  If that is so, it is regrettable.  The Minister should use his influence to see that this goes ahead because it is at least one attempt to do something for the poorer parts of the country instead of paying mere lip service to them.</P>
    <P>I know there are many other areas in which it was proposed to set up these centres.  In County Dublin, we were trying to organise a grading and packing centre.  We received every assistance and advice that we could hope for, both from the Department of Agriculture and the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society. We got very little promise of financial assistance but I think that is hoped for and it is something that should be encouraged.  It is an area where traditionally the people's livelihood comes from market gardening and this type of crop growing could be extended considerably if some encouragement and some financial assistance were made available to them.</P>
    <P>Grain has not been mentioned either. In fact we have reached the stage that while in the past wheat figured very largely in the Government's policy, now it is nearly regarded as a dirty word.  I do not know what the Department's policy about wheat is for the future.  We should always aim at having a small surplus of wheat.  It is still a very valuable crop and even in a bad year, a valuable food, if not exported at an uneconomic price as has been done in the past.</P>
    <P>Pigs have not been mentioned except in so far as there was a reference to the negotiations &mdash; let me say, reasonably successful negotiations &mdash; which have taken place recently with the United Kingdom.  We are in the position now so far as pigs are concerned that we know we have a market.  The reorganisation of the Pigs and Bacon Commission has been a successful operation and we have put in a first-class manager.  Already the signs of his work are evident but in what position <Col N="1681" /> are we in relation to pigs?  We are at present producing fewer pigs than we were producing in 1929.  This indicates beyond yea or nay the fact that we have failed absolutely to do anything for the pig industry over the years.</P>
    <P>I remember when speaking here before about the lack of effort which was put into the development of this branch of farming over the years, I said we were producing approximately 1½ million pigs, while in Denmark, which is a little more than the size of Munster, they were producing 12 million pigs and were planning to produce more.  Deputy Gilhawley said that there was a lot of lip service paid to the congested areas.  This is one obvious way, properly organised, by which many farmers in the congested areas could be made economic holders in the morning.  There has never been an organised effort.  How are we to work it?  I have always thought it was quite simple and now I am convinced that it is quite simple, but it will never be brought about until we improve housing, tell these people how to build their houses and the type of house and give them generous grants.  The present grants are not bad but this must be done on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>Feed must be provided in sufficient quantities and at wholesale prices.  I always insist that farmers are entitled to get their raw materials for their industry at wholesale prices.  In most parts of the west of Ireland, if a farmer wants a few bags of meal to feed pigs, he has to travel 20 or 30 miles and pay two prices.  There is no reason in the world why this could not be organised on a regional basis with the processing centre and a sufficient number of producers brought into the scheme to keep the centre in full production and make it a viable unit.</P>
    <P>I went to some trouble to look at the Jordan piggery and I believe it has a wonderful future in this country. When we realise that one man in the north of Ireland produces annually 28,000 pigs in a very simple type of piggery, a very cheap piggery to construct, you can imagine how many <Col N="1682" /> farmers would get an economic livelihood from pig production in the congested areas.  Straight away I see there is a living there for at least 60 farmers, small uneconomic holders. If this centre were set up with sufficient storage, sufficient advice and sufficient veterinary services, it must succeed. We are in the position that we can sell more pigs than we can produce. It is a sign of the success of the reorganisation of the Pigs and Bacon Commission that this has become possible.</P>
    <P>In October this year, we had as many, if not more, pigs than we ever had in October before.  At the same time, the price of pigs was never so high. Speaking to a lady in the catering business in a very big way, she told me that in a fortnight the price of gammons went up to her by 100/- a cwt.</P>

      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment to-day, Deputy M.P. Murphy gave notice he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 31 on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would hope the Minister has regained his composure, because he did not seem to be in a good mood yesterday. I am hopeful we will approach this question in a more co-operative spirit than that which prevailed on the last two occasions we discussed it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret it is mandatory on me to avail of the adjournment to raise this matter.  I feel such a problem as this could be discussed more effectively at other levels.  However, the Minister's attitude to this question is incomprehensible.When asked to do so in this House and by representative organisations, he would not make any representations whatever to Messrs. Rank.  When organisations, particularly the local urban council, requested him to meet a deputation in regard to <Col N="1683" /> the proposed closing of the mills, he refused to do so.  It is not easy to understand the Minister's attitude, particularly since these mills are located in the area where he was brought up.  It is out of place for the Minister to adopt the dictatorial attitude he has adopted to this question.By virtue of his office, he has certain delegated functions.  Surely one of these is to meet representative groups to discuss matters of major importance.</P>
    <P>I believe this could be termed a matter of major importance because it deals with the closure of a mill which has been in operation for many years and which, up to now, has given much-needed employment in the area of Shannonvale.  When it was announced by the owners of this mill some short time ago that they were of a mind to close it, the people of the district naturally were dumbfounded.  They made representations to their public representatives, local authorities and other voluntary organisations with a view to averting the closure, if possible.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, no good came of these representations, because the Minister was adamant and would not make the slightest move to help these people.  He would not even inquire from Messrs.  Rank if there was any hope of saving this mill.  It is peculiar that he expressed no concern whatever. I regard that as a grave dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister.  A few weeks ago, I asked him here to use his good offices with Messrs.  Rank with a view to averting a closure.  That was the time he gave me and the organisations concerned the information that he did not propose to do so and that he was not legally obliged to do so.  He had no regard whatever for any moral obligation that might exist.</P>
    <P>The question being dealt with at present concerns the quota system in operation for flour mills.  In his reply yesterday the Minister stated that the quota for Shannonvale was 29,759 barrels.  Such a high quota is an indication of the importance of this mill. It was one of the major mills in Cork in bygone years.  In the latter part of his reply, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> As the flour mill quotas are related to the 12 monthly period, 1st September to 31st August, assessment of a mill's adherence to its quota obligations cannot be undertaken until the end of this period.</P>
    <P>It was part of the Minister's function to make that query.  He was legally obliged to do so.  I assume the Minister has taken it for granted that Messrs. Rank have complied with the regulations. But we do not know.  The Minister has told us he cannot ascertain whether they have or not until after 31st August, 1964.  The mill will then be long closed down and the men employed there scattered, possibly to England and other places.  What I had in mind when I asked the Minister to ascertain whether the quota regulations had been adhered to was the information in respect of the year ended on 31st October, 1963.  Up to yesterday the Minister did not know if the regulations had been contravened, because he did not trouble to find out.  He more or less implied that in his answer.</P>
    <P>It is possible this company have adhered to the regulations.  We do not know.  However, the Minister should be more watchful of his duties, because we know since the Dáil assembled we have had questions about alleged laxity on the part of the Minister in dealing with regulations governing other bodies.  I refer to the questions relating to insurance, where it is alleged the Minister was lackadaisical, with financial loss to a big number of people.</P>

      <P>On 30th October, Deputy Esmonde tabled a question to ascertain from the Minister the number of flour mills operating in this country.  He was informed that the number of mills was 24.  I should like to know how many of these are in the Rank group because the reply does not give that information.  The mill I refer to is under the name of Messrs. Bennett and Co., the former owners who sold it a long time ago to Messrs. Rank.  It is reasonable to assume that most of the 24 mentioned <Col N="1685" /> by the Minister in his reply to Deputy Esmonde are now in the hands of a limited number of companies and that the monopoly system has been helped greatly by the Minister's attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The quota system was introduced by the Minister's Government in 1933, supposedly to help small mills and to keep those employed in small mills at work.  Let us see how the Government have attended to their duties since then. They have allowed organisations that want a monopoly of flour mills, such as the organisation involved in this question, to buy up the smaller mills and to buy their quotas for no other purpose than to close down the mills and wipe them out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to quotas.  We know the quotas of small mills have been swallowed up by the big organisations.  In this case, the Minister told us that so far as the quota for Shannonvale Mills is concerned, it is no longer required and has been extinguished.  Then the monopoly group has no competition from that mill.  That is why they bought it, to wipe out the competition.  I am sure that they did not intend, when purchasing this or other mills, to keep them in production.  What they wanted and paid money for was to create a monopoly.  We have the fruits of this system, as I had occasion to tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture, in the enormously high prices of certain products such as flour and wheaten meal.  I do not propose to go into this at present.  I am satisfied from my own personal experience of milling wheat in a small way that there are enormous <Col N="1686" /> profits.  Buying a stone of wheat at 4/- and selling it at 8/- means 100 per cent gross profit and we know the net profit to the miller is enormous.</P>
      <P>The Minister, by virtue of his attitude on this matter, is condoning and approving that system which is detrimental to the public and particularly the consuming public.  In West Cork, as the people in many other places are doing, we are fighting very hard at present to develop our resources and as far as possible avoid centralisation of industry.  I need only mention, in support of that, the big survey of West Cork which has been produced after a great deal of work and industry by a number of experts with a view to getting advice on development on the West Cork area, so as not only to hold the employment we have but to increase it, if possible.  At the time those Cork organisations were discussing this survey and its possible advantages, the blow came in regard to this relatively important industry in West Cork.  It was to fold up as a result of Messrs. Rank having bought the mill from the former owners.  One can see how incensed the people of West Cork are at the treatment they have got and are getting from the Government.</P>
      <P>Is it to be assumed that there is no longer any need for industries to continue in relatively small districts such as Shannonvale and other districts where they have existed over a long period?  Is it to be assumed that it is Government policy to wipe out industries in such areas, allegedly on the grounds that they are uneconomic, and transfer them to Dublin, Cork, Limerick or some other centre?  If that is so, it is a bad day for rural Ireland.  How are the workers to exist in these areas if the Government persist in their attitude?</P>

Rank whether this company has adhered to the regulations.  He does not know. He states in his reply that the flour milling quotas are related to the year ended 31st August.  That implies that he does not know.  Surely that is a grave dereliction of duty on his part, something on the same lines as the Equitable Insurance Company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As in the case of the other company, if by any chance this company have contravened the regulations, what would be the result of the Minister's laxity?  It would be much graver than his alleged laxity in the other business.  It would mean this mill was wrongfully closed down, that the workers were disemployed wrongfully, that no longer do jobs exist for 25 men in the area.  An application was made to the Minister and &mdash; that is what he is given his salary for and has a big office in Kildare Street for, to inquire into matters that come before him and his Department &mdash; he does not know whether the regulations were observed.  He may <Col N="1688" /> know now.  He may have inquired since I gave notice that I would raise this question on the Adjournment but up to the time he answered this question he was not sure.</P>
      <P>The implication was that he was not going to inquire until next September when the Shannonvale mills would be almost forgotten in the area and the men employed there would have scattered to different countries.  Is that not dereliction of duty on the Minister's part?  I am asking him if everything is in order and if the Minister accepts responsibility in this matter, why should he not meet the local bodies? Why not say to Clonakilty UDC, the local authority adjoining the area: &ldquo;I shall meet you or get a senior representative of my Department to meet you and explain the position.&rdquo; Surely, if the Minister had a good case, that was the way to go about it? If he had done that, there would have been no need to take up the time of the House this evening but he did no such thing.  He did not inquire whether the regulations had been complied with.  He assumed they have been but he is not too sure.  He made no effort at all to discharge the moral obligation which I think he has.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Murphy fails to understand is that the consumption of bread and flour has been decreasing in this country, as it has been decreasing in other countries where the standard of living has been improving.  In 1933, quotas were fixed in respect of the milling quantities in mills throughout the country.  The purpose of fixing these quotas was to ensure that mills would not transfer their quotas from one mill to another and thereby jeopardise employment in different parts of the country.  A mill was required to mill not less than 90 per cent of its quota.  Mills were not permitted to transfer quotas from one mill to another, except on two occasions when the mills were in close proximity to each other and in circumstances in which the employment in the respective districts could not be affected by the transfer alone.</P>
      <P>The mill in question was purchased by the Cork Milling Company about, I think, 1935, at a time when it was about to close down.  The Cork Milling Company are part of the Rank organisation now and I want to assure Deputy Murphy that down through the years the Rank organisation have made every effort to maintain the mill in production.  They have carried out certain improvements there.  They have made certain alterations in procedure. I also want to assure him that I have been in touch with the circumstances obtaining in this mill through the Adaptation Council set up for the flour milling industry.  The reasons given by the owners for the closing down of this mill have been potent ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding all their best efforts they have found they cannot maintain this mill in economic production.  At the same time, they have in different parts of the country mills which are economic in their production but which have been unable to mill the quantity <Col N="1690" /> of flour up to their capacity.  I do not think it is unreasonable that an owner of a factory premises, if he finds production uneconomic, should not be obliged by anybody to continue in that uneconomic production.  Unfortunately that was the case here.</P>
    <P>I want also to refute the suggestion of Deputy Murphy that I am not aware as to whether mills throughout the country are complying with the law. The Ranks mills, the mills the property of the same company as owned the Shannonvale mills, have been milling within the law and the latest returns I have for the last year indicate that that is so.  Even if they transfer the quantity of flour that they could have milled in Clonakilty to their other mills, Ranks would still not exceed the quota allotted to them in these other mills. They have, in fact, an excess capacity of some 133,000 barrels in their other mills, and that is four times the quota alloted to the Clonakilty mill.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Murphy has said, we are trying to promote industrialisation throughout the country and I would be doing a disservice, I think, to that programme, and I certainly would scare off, I believe, prospective industrialists if I were seen to oblige people to carry on uneconomic production.  Unfortunately, there are some 20 to 25 persons immediately affected by this closure, but I am informed that the mill owners are in direct consultation with the trade unions representing these men to provide suitable compensation schemes for them.  I agree that is not a very satisfactory substitute for a steady job, but the fact is that, were it not for the take-over, this mill would have gone out of production long ago, without any possibility of redundancy compensation for these men.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy berated me for my refusal to meet a deputation.  If Deputy Murphy would read the letter I sent to the Clonakilty urban district council in reply to their request that I receive a deputation, he will see that I pointed out in that the economic facts of the situation.  In those circumstances, I did not see that any useful purpose could be served by my receiving them.  I am conscious of the obligations of the people of <Col N="1691" /> Clonakilty to pay rates to keep their local authority going and I believe I would be imposing a burden on the people of Clonakilty were I to invite a deputation to come to see me in circumstances in which I knew there was nothing I could do to insist on this mill continuing in operation.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Murphy I am very conscious of the difficulties that will be created in the area.  I appreciate fully that there is a need for greater industrial employment in the area.  I have had several consultations with people representative of the area with a view to promoting industries there and I shall continue to do all I can to encourage the establishment of suitable industries, not only in Clonakilty but throughout West Cork generally.  Incidentally, I might remind the Deputy that that is not the place in which I was born and reared. I was born and reared in Cork city.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Murphy will, in the ordinary course of his duties, come to my office any day, I will discuss the merits of this whole position with him.  I think that would be far more effective than his getting up here and berating me as he did.  He admonished me not to lose my temper with him as, he said, I did yesterday. I do not remember losing my temper yesterday but, having issued that <Col N="1692" /> admonition, he proceeded to let off steam himself.  Letting off steam is, I suppose, the privilege of a Deputy, especially here in Leinster House. However, he has now let off steam and his remarks will be quoted in the journals which circulate among his constituents.  To that extent he will have achieved his immediate purpose.</P>

      <P>Statistics of dentures supplied by health authorities in the years prior to the year ended 31st December, 1956, are not available in my Department as health authorities were not required to furnish such figures prior to that date, and I do not think that it would be reasonable to expect health authorities to examine their earlier records with a view to extracting the information, if that were feasible.  The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the years 1956 onwards is being assembled.  If the Deputy repeats his question in a fortnight's time, I expect to be in a position then to supply him with the available information in the form requested.</P>
