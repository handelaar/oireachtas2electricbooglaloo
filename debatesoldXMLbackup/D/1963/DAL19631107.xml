    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned yesterday evening, I was <Col N="1088" /> pointing out that the responsibility for the carrying out of the capital punishment rests not with the judge who condemns the person or with the executioner who carries out the execution or even with the prison officers, but with the whole community.  I described the whole affair as barbarous.I do not believe the right to take away life should be vested in the State.  No matter how heinous the crime, the whole State is debased when a human being is dragged to the scaffold and his or her life taken away.</P>
      <P>I do not think that solves anything or that it improves matters in any way. While attempts have been made from time to time to try to prove there is a deterrent in capital punishment, I think the Minister is very wise in accepting that that is not so.  I think it has been proved that it is not a deterrent.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to retain the death penalty in respect of certain matters but I think the Minister might have a second look at that and decide that it might be abolished even in those cases.  When we talk about heinous crimes, surely it is difficult to judge the degree?  In any event, as was pointed out yesterday by Deputy Michael O'Higgins, if it is not considered a heinous crime to kill a night watchman inside a building, why should it be considered a heinous crime to kill a police officer outside a building? The case is made that the policeman is not armed; neither is the night watchman.  If we are going to do away with capital punishment, let us do away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as overthrowing the State is concerned, it is foolish to ask people to accept that it is such a crime because it has happened again and again, mostly with popular support. If the people feel so incensed with the powers that be as to incite a revolt and if during that revolt people are killed, surely it is wrong to say that those responsible for the revolt should be executed?  Does that gain anything for the country?  The Offences Against the State Act is mentioned here.  I would have hoped that we would never have a reference to that Act in this House <Col N="1089" /> again.  It is true that people who have been executed, as they call it&mdash;there is another word for it&mdash;under that Act were Republicans and we have all claimed to be Republicans from time to time.  Please do not let us hear any more about these so-called executions.</P>
    <P>There is one question I would like to pose to the Minister and, although it may seem to be a jocose one, I am serious about it.  Is there any possibility of improving the methods by which people who commit murders can be apprehended?  As Deputy Norton said here about a year ago, they will soon be able to form a murderers' club, there are so many of them knocking about.  Is that because of the fact that somebody is afraid that if they are caught, they will be hanged?  Nobody has been hanged in this country since 1954 and before that it went back to 1950.  It does seem to me as if a remarkable number of people have been charged with murder, a smaller number convicted and that for years capital punishment has not been put into effect.  The Minister has been well advised to go on the line on which he is going but he is not going the whole way.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins has said here that his Party have decided to leave the matter to a free vote.  The position of the Labour Party is that we have also decided to leave it to a free vote so that the Government need have no fear of a defeat on that score. Penal servitude has been substituted for capital punishment in a number of cases and the Minister gave figures about that last night which did not seem to me to tally with figures he had given earlier.  In reply to Deputy Ryan on 24th October in column 324 of the Official Report he said that in 1925 somebody served 17 years and 2 months; in 1926 somebody served 6 years and 5 months; in the same year 6 years and 4 months; in the same year 6 months and, in 1927, 2 years and 7 months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The war finished in 1944 or 1945 and in 1946 somebody served three years and seven months. <Col N="1090" /> In the same year, somebody served five years; in 1948, six years and one month; in the same year, three years; in 1949, four years and eight months; in the same year, three years and four months; in 1951, 11 years and six months and, in 1954, six years and one month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Were all these murderers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume they were.  The question asked was if the Minister would state, in respect of each person whose sentence of execution for murder was commuted to a sentence of life imprisonment since 1925, the term of imprisonment actually suffered by such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then what is the Deputy quarrelling about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave figures in respect of which he said that the average term served was 11 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said was that the longest period served since 1946 or 1947 was 11½ years, the shortest term three years and the average six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say, now that he has decided to commute the death penalty to imprisonment, that he considers a sentence of three years is punishment?  If we are talking about a deterrent surely it is unreasonable that somebody sentenced to death for murder should be released after three years and allowed to appear again amongst the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir A. Esmonde Sir A. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir A. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly to commit another murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the State has been leaning over backwards in an attempt to be lenient to these people.  I am definitely opposed to capital punishment but there should be punishment to fit the crime.  Somebody who commits a murder should not be let loose after three years.  The Minister should have a look at the whole matter and see whether in fact we are getting soft as far as these murderers are concerned.  There is <Col N="1091" /> another argument against capital punishment and that is the number of people who have been condemned in the wrong.  While we can always say that the State will ensure that no mistake will be made there are records available to show that in this country, and even more so in England, many people have been executed and their innocence was proved afterwards.  The number of such cases in this country is small but in England an extraordinary number of people have been executed for murder and subsequently it was proved that a mistake had been made and that the person had told the truth when proclaiming his innocence.We have come a long way from the time when a young boy was executed for stealing a few potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Stony Brennan was executed for stealing a turnip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And somebody else for stealing a cake or a piece of bread. Executions for sheep stealing were quite common.  When the execution of such people was stopped, it was said that that was a big step forward but it is a pity that we have had to wait until 1963 to abolish capital punishment almost completely.  It must be a terrible thing for everybody concerned to find that, after a person is executed, proof can be produced that, in fact, the person did not commit the crime and that his statement that he was innocent should have been accepted in time to save his life.  At least the fact that the death penalty is being replaced now does ensure that there is an opportunity given to a person to prove his innocence even after he has been sentenced.  There is the other problem about somebody who puts up a big fight and as a result that person is in and out of the death cell for a considerable period.  It has occasionally been said that perhaps such a person would be better dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what way we look at it, the Minister must be applauded for bringing in this Bill.  The only quarrel we can have is that he did not say: &ldquo;No more State executions: no more legalised murders in this country.&rdquo; No matter what we may say, the taking <Col N="1092" /> away of life is an act of murder. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider the matter very deeply before this measure goes through its final stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with other Deputies who complimented the Minister on the Bill.  Those who were in the House on a previous occasion will recall that when an effort was made to secure the passage of a Bill of this kind, it met with very determined opposition by certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party of the day: I cannot recall now whether or not they were in Government&mdash;I think they were.  Some of the opposition was very bitter.</P>
      <P>It is not today or yesterday that enlightened thought throughout the world has come to the conclusion that retributive justice in the form of hanging&mdash;taking a human being, leading him up 13 terrible steps and stringing him up by the neck&mdash;has, in fact, no deterrent effect whatever. Anybody who was told about it and anybody who has been in a jail as a prisoner, as I have been, on the morning of a hanging must feel very deeply about this matter.  I recall one such occasion when a man was going to his death not for any cause or glorious ideal, and so on, but simply because there was a fault in his make-up which, for one reason or another, compelled him to take the life of somebody who apparently was very dear to him.  It brought very forcibly to my mind and I am sure similar experiences have brought equally forcibly to the minds of others the futility, the criminal waste and the terrible barbarism of the whole affair.</P>
      <P>Many writers for almost the past 100 years, possibly before that but certainly for almost 100 years, have advocated eloquently, with great skill and passion, the abolition of capital punishment.  It is only right to say now, I think, that one unfortunate Dublin man&mdash;a genius and brilliant wit&mdash;struck possibly one of the greatest blows against capital punishment when he wrote &ldquo;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&rdquo; with which, I am sure, members of the House are familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> It is a very pleasing thing to see that a step is being taken here now by the Government to bring this terrible business to a conclusion.  I agree with Deputy Tully in what he has to say in regard to the qualifications and limitations which are put upon this abolition.  It is very difficult, I think, for any Minister, if he starts to separate crimes, to make up his mind or for any group such as a Cabinet to make up their minds, as to what should or should not be capital offences.  However, the Christian and humane thing is to abolish it altogether.</P>
    <P>I think it is time to regard murder for what it is.  It is time we came to see the murderer for what he is&mdash;a person with a defective brain.  When he commits a crime which is contrary to all the laws of nature and of God, he is doing something which he is forced to do by some want in his very being.  Therefore, it is not right that he should be made to pay such a penalty for something in respect of which he probably&mdash;very probably&mdash; had no control whatsoever.  It may have come by reason of his blood, breeding or environment but certainly it would appear to me that it comes from circumstances which he cannot possibly control.</P>
    <P>Thinking this matter out on many occasions, it has seemed to me stupid to suggest that any murderer who sets about the commission of a crime really envisages what the final end will be. Even with those who successfully, for a period, conceal the crime and set about concealing it with the cunning associated with a certain form of insanity, it has always seemed to me that they can never possibly really have envisaged what the punishment can eventually be because had they given it a thought, the crime would not have been committed.  Therefore, hanging, as a deterrent, is no deterrent whatsoever.  It is rather a coincidental thing that almost 100 years ago&mdash;I think just over 100 years ago&mdash;the last public hanging in England took place. The last man hanged, of course, in England was an Irishman&mdash;a man called Michael Barrett, a Fenian, at Clerkenwell.  The scenes outside the <Col N="1094" /> prison and during the night while the crowds awaited their Roman holiday, were scenes of drunkenness, fighting and rioting.  There was the sale of special window seats to the ladies of the town and the moneyed people of London.  All that led up to the eventual final awful end of Michael Barrett. Incidentally, he spent the whole period of his time awaiting death in a jail without being visited by a single person, Irish or anybody else.  Any person reading a description of events at that time must realise that the act of human sacrifice which is inherent in capital punishment panders to the very lowest savage instincts in our make-up.</P>
    <P>I do not think that when the hangman retired to private practice behind prison walls, the effect of this immoral act upon society as a whole thereby ceased.  We have not, happily, thanks be to God, read for some number of years in this country that so and so &ldquo;was duly executed according to law this morning&rdquo; but we read of it happening in England.  Every time we read that sort of message in the daily papers we are degraded thereby, realising that in an age that appears to have reached the very apogee of development in matters scientific and even in appreciation of art and culture, we still cling and have clung to this terrible piece of savage exhibitionism which is called capital punishment.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably has had difficulty in getting this degree of abolition accepted.  It is a step in the right direction.  I know there are people in the country who will become violently heated about the proposal that hanging should be abolished. They believe it is a deterrent; unconsciously they enjoy the thought of it, I suppose.  I join with other Deputies in complimenting the Minister and I hope he will find it possible to expand the terms of this Bill so as to reduce capital punishment further or eliminate it entirely from the laws that govern our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on taking this further step along the road to better standards in regard to the dreadful question of killing our fellow men.  One's approval must be qualified by the regret that he has not been able to go to the full extent of getting this proposal that one may judicially murder a fellow man, that one may kill another human being with the full consent and approval of the law, entirely abolished from the statute book.</P>
      <P>The strange thing, as Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, about the Minister's proposal is that he made probably the most compelling case that can be made against the conception of killing human beings as a penalty for what they have done.  The strange illogicality of his conclusions is that, having stated the case against retaining capital punishment in respect of certain capital crimes, he then goes on to say that in respect of those which are retained here, capital murder, none of these arguments is relevant.  I wonder if the Minister would deal with that point in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must also be congratulated&mdash;and their predecessors&mdash; on the fact that the use of capital punishment in what we could call normal murder cases has been abandoned in recent years.  I suppose that in a democracy it is the right way to come to a decision&mdash;to try to remove a matter which is of a controversial nature and about which people have very deep feelings and emotions, from national debate.  I suppose, in effect, that is what has happened by the agreement on the part of successive Governments to commute the sentence in a number of cases and so <Col N="1096" /> prepare the public for the decision formally to get rid of the whole penalty of capital punishment and avoid the emotional tension raised by such a debate when it takes place at a national level.</P>
    <P>I am slightly surprised that the Government, led by the Taoiseach, have not taken the step to get rid of capital punishment altogether because as far as I know and have heard, one of the nicest and one of the good things that can be said about the Taoiseach, rightly or wrongly&mdash;so far as I know it is true&mdash;is that he has always been an opponent of capital punishment and has done his best where possible to influence the Government against the imposition of that penalty.  I am surprised that he has not taken the opportunity, now that he is head of the Government, to get rid of capital punishment altogether but I suppose one must proceed in this rather cautious way.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister must see that when he says capital punishment has been shown to be not necessarily a deterrent, it is very difficult to go on to say in respect of certain crimes which he names, we will retain it because in these particular circumstances presumably he believes it would be a deterrent.  That is a complete <i>non sequitur</i>.  It seems to be completely illogical and I do not know how he related it to these crimes at all. It is hard to see how he believes that in certain circumstances a particular penalty could be a deterrent and in other circumstances need not be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to Deputy Dunne's point about the human being who commits a murder in any circumstances, that he must be a psychopath.No normal person could take another human life.  He must be momentarily abnormal or, as Deputy Dunne said, have a built-in abnormality in his personality; it must be a person who has some grave defect in his own standard of moral and ethical values.  Because of this, I have, naturally, great sympathy with the person who finds himself on a capital charge and is then led to execution. To me, such people have as little control over their acts as any individual <Col N="1097" /> in our mental hospitals whom we treat with the greatest care and consideration.</P>
    <P>This is shown particularly in our treatment of patients in the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum.  It seems to me that the correct approach to the capital crime is shown in the name of that particular hospital.  Up to quite recent years, it was called the Criminal Lunatic Asylum.  Then the contradiction became apparent and we accepted it as a mental hospital for sick people. It is my view that these people are sick and require care in hospital, and not any form of punishment, particularly punishment of this kind.  Of course, they must be isolated from society.  Of course, society must be protected against them.  Imprisonment, until the authorities are satisfied it is safe to release the individual, is the device used in many other countries and in none of these is society faced with any serious increase in the incidence of murder.</P>
    <P>Looking at the matter from an ordinary layman's point of view, I find it really strange that any individual can kill another.  I do not understand how anybody can kill an animal, much less a human being.  I do not understand how people can kill another human being.  Without any disrespect to the Minister&mdash;I am sure he is a humane man&mdash;those people are the Minister himself, the judge, the jury and the executioner, and all of us here who assist in passing legislation which allows judicial killing.  I am perfectly sure the Minister is a very humane man, just as humane as I am myself, and I am quite sure he would shudder at the thought of killing anybody.  I do not think it is morally right we should bring in laws here which impose on somebody else the responsibility of doing for money, as part of his job, something we ourselves would not dare to do.  I am quite certain the Minister would not hang anybody under any circumstances.  I am quite certain the Minister would not hang a woman under any circumstances.  I am quite certain the Minister, and none of his colleagues, would hang a person who had fainted.  I am quite certain the Minister would not, as Deputy Tully <Col N="1098" /> pointed out, hang someone who was carried screaming hysterically to the place of execution.  I am quite certain the Minister would not put a rope around that person's neck and hang him.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should give that power to anybody, to a psychopath, because I believe any executioner or any man who kills another is a psychopath.  Just as I believe the individual who kills a fellowman is a psychopath at the time of the killing, so I believe the executioner who takes on this job, for reward, and who kills another human being, for reward, must be a psychopath.  The man who can do that, and do it by the hundred, as the Pierpoint family have done it for generations, belongs to a mental hospital just as much as the individual who commits the crime.  I believe it is very wrong of us here to formulate laws which allow such a person to indulge in his particular form of mental self-admiration inherent in the killing of another human being.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can exonerate himself from this ultimate crime by passing this law here.  I do not think that a member of the judiciary can exonerate himself from the crime involved in killing a human being.  It is interesting to note the one little point that the macabre incident of putting on the black cap is to be removed in the appalling formality of sentencing a man to die.  It appears to me that this is just a sop to the conscience of some members of the judiciary, at least one of whom is opposed, as I know, to capital punishment.  This must be some slight sop to the consciences of the judiciary to enable them to remove themselves as far as possible from the dreadful ceremony associated with putting a person to death; even if it is only this tiny association of the black cap, associated with the executioner's black cap, to that extent they must remove their distinguished selves and allow the dirty work to be done then by the executioner behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>In some ways one wonders whether it would not be better if the whole dreadful ceremony were dragged out into the public light and these things <Col N="1099" /> were done in public, as they were in the past, in order to show society the dreadful things we do in its name as a result of the dreadful proposals the Minister is still retaining in this Bill. We would then see that hanging is a most terrible form of execution, leaving aside the interval between the actual sentence of death and the acute mental strain involved in waiting, with every second inexorably ticking away, until one is brought out and killed; leaving all that aside&mdash;it is incapable of evaluation by any human being&mdash;it seems to me that the carrying-out of the execution itself, as Deputy Dunne has pointed out, has a very serious reaction indeed on both the prisoners and the prison officers.  It is a rather dreadful job at the best of times and it is not even an efficient form of execution.</P>
    <P>There are occasions&mdash;this has been stated by the executioner&mdash;when things have gone wrong and when the man or woman has remained hanging on the end of the rope until his or her neck broke.  It is not an efficient form of execution.  I know a doctor friend who had the horrible job of watching executions in another country.  He told me that, on one occasion, because of a mistake, the unfortunate man started to climb back up the rope.  Even if that were not true, even if there were not the possibility of people having to go through the death agonies by inefficient killing, it still seems that it is very wrong indeed that we should continue to retain capital punishment.</P>
    <P>One of the depressing things to me has been that we are a Christian-professing country and that while we profess to believe in the teachings of Christ and His way of life, our practices seem so completely opposite to His teachings.  There is nowhere in which this is so dramatically shown as in our taking the decision that not only will we exact punishment but that we will exact retributive punishment as well.  This is the complete antithesis of anything we have been taught or learned from a study of the life of Christ, of His attitude to humanity, which was always one of pity, sympathy, understanding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> No one would deny that we have the right to protect ourselves from wrongdoers, from sick people, as most of these people are, but I know of nothing which gives us the right to say that not only will we punish but that we will punish in this retributive way.  That seems to be a continuing failure in our society.  When we should be exemplifying the true Christian way of life which we profess, in this our pattern is closely adapted to that of our neighbours, the most conservative society of Great Britain.  That is so in this and in most other matters. Twenty-five years ago, a Royal Commission told them in Great Britain there would be no increase in crime, in capital murders, if they got rid of capital punishment; but the wild backwoodsmen of that conservative society over the years have been able to impose their will against the liberal conscience of many of the ordinary people in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>It would be more in keeping with the European tradition if we were to accept that the whole idea of judicial killing should disappear from our society.  When one reads of a judicial killing, one is left with the feeling that the whole of humanity in that society has been in some way contaminated by the act.  As to the keeping of judicial killing for offences against police and prison officers, is there a precedent for it?  Surely this is a non-existent crime here.  Even it were a reality, as I said earlier, has judicial killing a serious deterrent effect?  If it is accepted that as far as we ordinary members of the public are concerned judicial killing, judicial hanging, is not a serious deterrent, then why should it be a deterrent in respect of these other crimes?</P>
    <P>One of the problems that arise in these forms of crime is the difficulty experienced in getting juries to convict in clear-cut murder charges where they themselves object to the whole conception of judicial hanging.  There are many examples of this and precedents which show there is a reluctance on the part of juries to convict in clear-cut cases of murder because of their objection to the fact that the individual will be killed as a result of their decision.  I would ask the Minister, <Col N="1101" /> who is quite obviously sympathetic to this whole proposition, to be more daring, more considerate, in his assessment of the present needs and to hold that there are no circumstances in which one can justify the killing of a human being&mdash;that the individual who kills is a psychopath.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to hold that the mind of the individual who kills in the heat of a moment of anger, of fear of capture, of frustration at prison life, is momentarily deranged. We can take the whole panoply of State authority, starting with the Minister for Justice and the Oireachtas, and going down through the courts of justice, the prison authorities, the medical profession, and then formally consider the proposition that an individual should be killed, should be hanged until dead, and try to accept that as a rational proposition, a rational act of rational beings.  That would be merely to accept the standard of the psychopath whom we are killing because of his identical act.  At least he has the excuse, the explanation of his madness, of his derangement.  We have no such excuse for our act.</P>

      <P>Because of the subject we are discussing, I do not propose to comment on what transpired earlier.  This is a matter on which Deputies on different sides have most deep-seated, conscientious views. It is a matter on which one can feel extremely deeply, and though I may feel differently from others, I accept they are just as sincere in their conscientious approach to it.  I am opposed to this Bill.  I do not think this Bill is any improvement at all on the existing procedure.  I can see an argument, though I might not agree with it, for the wholehearted approach to the problem of capital punishment that we have heard this morning from Deputies on my right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no argument whatever in favour of the proposals contained in the Bill to segregate certain types of murder and to say they are to be murder carrying capital punishment and that others, such as the deliberately premeditated murder of an old woman living alone in a desolate part of the <Col N="1102" /> country for the sake of the money she may have in the house, is to be classed as carrying lesser responsibility than the types set out here.  I cannot see how anyone can justify the proposition that the types of crime, which we all abhor, set out here are considered to carry a greater degree of responsibility than the crime to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>We are, of course, long past the days in which punishment was considered as an act of vengeance, an act, in the minds of the people then carrying it out, of just vengeance.  That is gone.  The retributive character of punishment to which reference was made by one Deputy is no longer considered as being the reason for punishment by anybody who gives any thought to the problem at all.  The only reason for punishment is the fact that it acts as a deterrent against the commission of crime against the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>No matter how you look at it, a crime against an individual in the community is a crime against the community as a whole and in my opinion, there is no doubt whatever that the existence of capital punishment does act as a deterrent against the premeditated murder, as I have mentioned, of an old woman living alone in a desolate part of the country.  I believe the system we have in which it is the duty of the Government to consider carefully each individual verdict of that sort, while not perfect, is the best system there is to deal with the problems thrown up by the death of a citizen of a country.</P>
    <P>I know from personal experience the difficulty one has as a member of the Government in making up one's mind on the file that comes before one with recommendations after someone has been condemned to death for murder. It is not a task that any Government or any Minister for Justice who has to make a recommendation likes but it is undoubtedly preferable to the segregation that exists in this Bill in which certain crimes are taken out and set apart, regardless of whether they occur on the spur of the moment or with premeditation and in which a person would really want to be a lawyer in <Col N="1103" /> advance to consider what was the deterrent before he decided whether it was worth while to commit or to avoid the commission of a crime.  I cannot see how this will solve anything.</P>
    <P>I can see there might be a case for a wholehearted approach in respect of the deep conscience that obviously some people have in relation to this matter but what we must consider&mdash; and I know I will be termed a reactionary for so stating&mdash;is the deterrent effect.  If we do not in conscience consider whether we can do without that deterrent, we are not facing up to our problems in this Bill.  They are not pleasant problems to have to face but this Bill does not take account of circumstances as they exist.  It does not take account of the deterrent effect that exists at present because of capital punishment but selects certain crimes without selecting premeditated crimes of, perhaps, greater degree but certainly of equal degree.  For that reason, I for one feel it would be wrong to pass the Bill and that the Bill, if passed, will create much greater problems for those who have to administer it and for the community as a whole than the system we operate at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the proposals in the Bill.  This is a subject on which there have been for a great number of years, not only in this country but in Britain, particularly, views which have been very hotly contested, on which opinions have been held equally strongly in favour of capital punishment and against it.</P>
      <P>This Bill falls between two stools. It differs to some extent from what is at present the law in Britain but although it differs, it follows in many respects the decision taken there some years ago to abolish the death penalty for certain types of murder.  So far as I am aware, the decision taken then has been the subject of very considerable criticism since.  Those who have examined it recognised that it was a compromise decision.  This piece of legislation here is also a compromise and in a matter of this sort, I do not think it is possible to operate what is, in effect, a compromise decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> It is not necessary at this stage, and it would not achieve anything in considering the matter, to discuss the pros and cons of it at any length.  So far as this country is concerned, we have evolved what has been described in the course of this debate as a satisfactory accidental compromise which enables the Government to review the verdict where a person is convicted of murder.  The Government have the advantage of considering not merely all aspects of the case but also any recommendations which the jury may have made in connection with the verdict.  In addition they have the advantage of considering any observations which the judge may make, and in such cases judges have on occasion made recommendations or, when asked, have given their observations on the verdict.</P>
    <P>One thing should be said in the course of this debate: I do not think any Government lightly decides to enforce the death penalty.  I have had the experience of being associated with two Governments over a period of six years and on each occasion&mdash;naturally there were not very many&mdash;when the question of the enforcement of the death penalty had to be considered, it was a subject above all others which exercised both the conscience and the attention of members of the Government.My recollection is that only on one occasion during those six years was the death penalty invoked.  The statistics given by the Minister, and statistics available since the establishment of the State, would indicate that only as a last resort do Governments enforce the death penalty so that there is ample proof that members of Governments regard it as a very serious matter and that the death penalty is not lightly imposed.</P>
    <P>I do think, however, that the deterrent effect of the death penalty is still a powerful one.  In fact, the Commission which inquired some years ago in Britain into the matter considered this from a variety of angles: as a deterrent, the question of punishment and also the question of reform.  The deterrent aspect of capital punishment was the one which was regarded as the most powerful and after a very exhaustive examination of the subject on <Col N="1105" /> which conflicting opinions&mdash;strongly-held conflicting opinions&mdash;were given the Commission came to the conclusion that the deterrent effect of capital punishment was still an effective instrument in the administration of justice.  Undoubtedly in the Council of Europe investigation into the matter, a somewhat different conclusion was arrived at and it did not hold with the deterrent aspect to the same extent.</P>
    <P>This is a matter in which you either abolish the death penalty or you retain it.  It is difficult to decide.  Undoubtedly there are different types of murders, different degrees of responsibility and so on, but these can all be considered by a jury and judge before whom the case is tried, and finally by the Government.  A judge or a jury, depending on the manner in which the murder has been committed, may bring in a recommendation to mercy.  As I said, that can be reconsidered subsequently by the Government.  The criticism which has manifested itself in Britain in recent years is sufficient reason it seems to me why we should not attempt a compromise decision.  We have evolved here a satisfactory system under which the Government can review the matter after the trial.  The system has proved both workable and satisfactory and there is no case at present for the partial abolition of the death penalty. It seems to me that it is difficult to justify the abolition of the death penalty for certain cases and its retention for others.  As I said, this is a matter on which Deputies have to decide as a matter of conscience.  It is a mistake to abolish it and for that reason I am opposed to the proposals contained in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a curious nightmare quality about an occasion such as this.  We are all aware of the human reaction to death by killing and its dreadful consequence of execution by the people.  We are aware of that in a curious nightmare way.  We are at the same time completely divorced from anything except a mental conception of it because such a thing never happens to us or to anyone we know.  We have no contact with this, or so we think.  But it is as <Col N="1106" /> real as anything that takes place in society today.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of regret to me that the benches of the House are somewhat empty.  It would be a good thing if the Government announced, as the other main Parties have announced, that their members were free to make a decision on this themselves.  That would be a good thing because it would permit no mental evasion of any kind of what is involved here and it would also place on the shoulders of members some of the kind of responsibility that attaches, for instance, to the Minister for Justice on one of those dreadful occasions when he must decide whether a judge's sentence will be carried out or not.</P>
      <P>In this whole dreadful subject, hysteria is much nearer the surface than in anything else and I can regard with very great respect the utterances by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Cosgrave because they indicate a kind of responsiblity of purpose and mind which has made human society become a reasonably viable thing.  The very kind of case which Deputy Sweetman quoted, the murder of an aged person, or the dreadful deaths children meet with, shows how near to hysteria we could become in the general thinking of the matter, how much emotion would control us, how savagely we would strike out at those who do these dreadful things.  Striking out at them will not restore to life those who died by their hands and does not deter those who will do these things in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However we may shudder at what happens, we can no more control what is going to be done tomorrow or next week by some schizophrenic, by some afflicted human being, who kills.  We cannot affect these actions by demanding retribution for something that happened in the past, by saying that tomorrow morning in one of our prisons a man will die because he has committed a sin that is as old as Cain. We cannot do any more to the killer than he has already done to himself. In fact, he has killed himself as far as society is concerned, as far as the promise of his life is concerned.  He has sentenced himself to death.  He <Col N="1107" /> will always be shunned.  He will always have to carry that rope, not physically, but mentally, around his neck.</P>
    <P>That is why I think that on an occasion like this, with all its nightmare quality, it is a pity that more Deputies are not in the House and that the Government do not announce that every Deputy will have to make a decision on this matter in his own way and, in that way, have to bear some of the responsibilities that judges and Ministers have to bear when these dreadful decisions have to be taken.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion, with a great deal of caution and with, indeed, some doubt, that I agree with the proposal in the Bill that we should not have the death sentence and I am somewhat moved in the direction that we should consider for all purposes discarding the death sentence, because the accounts of those who kill cannot be paid in this way and I do not believe society is protected by killing after a killing.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, there is the whole horrifying paraphernalia of execution and the demands on those who are to administer the death sentence.  They are too great a price to have to pay. I believe that none of those who have ever taken part in one of these frightful occasions would agree to retain this weapon in the hands of society.</P>
    <P>I do lean very strongly in the direction of ensuring that an average penal servitude should be a great deal longer than the average that the Minister has quoted.  I believe it should be possible to ensure that incarceration would be for a lengthy, almost a hopeless, time. The idea of a killer walking out of prison after three or four years is an affront to all our feelings.  I do realise that those feelings are inherited deep feelings from the past, that we are governed by primitive forces in this matter, the forces which made society say&mdash;in fact which even made religion say, 4,000 years ago&mdash;that an eye should be demanded for an eye.  We have inherited that kind of thing.  If we have now got to the stage that we feel our minds could permit us to agree that killing is not a satisfaction <Col N="1108" /> for a killing, I do not think I have got to the stage yet where I could say that a short prison sentence is quite enough.  The account is greater and longer than that.  I shall support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This House has already made the case for the abolition of capital punishment.  We are elected here to express the views of the people. They have been expressed.  They differ widely and deeply.  The people are the jury in this case.  As I said, the case has been made for the abolition of the death sentence because, where there is disagreement, the benefit of the doubt must be given.</P>
      <P>We have, as we say, a civilised society.  We cannot rightly retain capital punishment.  Premeditated murder is diabolical; premeditated capital punishment by the State is equally diabolical.  One is prone to ask oneself what is meant by premeditation.Is it momentary or is it over a long period?  Men have been hanged on the score of premeditation alone.</P>
      <P>It is a long time since we hanged anybody in this country.  There are those who make the case that without capital punishment, crimes of murder will increase.  I do not see how that claim can be sustained, having regard to the situation as we know it.  There is no outcry for the retention of capital punishment.  We do not hear of people signing petitions to have a man hanged.  We hear of them asking for the exercise of clemency by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Capital punishment, like murder, is nauseating.  It is barbarous, antiquated, outmoded.  It has outlived any advantage it may have had, if it ever had any advantage.  The State demands its pound of flesh, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.  When it goes so far as to demand, at times, three lives for one, the law of Moses falls by the wayside.  I cannot condone murder nor can any man in this House condone murder.  Very few would be prepared to condone capital punishment.You can have two tragedies instead of one.  The scaffold in this country has been used too often by the foreigner.  There is a bad taste left in the mouths of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> Reference has been made to political crimes.  I do not know what can be meant by political crimes.  What would constitute a political crime?  What we have seen condoned by the leaders of the far side of the House at one time was made a case for capital punishment within a few years.  Men have been misled, and led so far that they went to the scaffold.  They were hanged by an English hangman after being led there by the very men who sentenced them here through this House to death.  We have seen men taken from the very scaffold.  We have seen it proven on constitutional grounds that they could not be hanged. This question of political murder is one which confuses me as to what it can mean.  Does it mean a change of heart on the part of certain people?</P>
    <P>It has been proved that innocent men have been hanged in other countries and how slow the State was to make inquiries afterwards.  Nothing could be done to restore the innocent man to life once sentence had been carried out.  This, I say, was judicial murder.  If the State must have its pound of flesh, possibly, to a certain degree, I could state that the guilty party could be considered as a guinea pig to further the cause of medicine. I said &ldquo;to a certain degree&rdquo; but that is a matter for further consideration and I think the State would have its pound of flesh and possibly medicine would be helped to save many other lives.</P>
    <P>As I said, we had more murders, or more hangings formerly in this country than we have had for the past few years.  At that time murders were on the increase.  For the past few years &mdash;for many years&mdash;there has not been a hanging in this country and murder is not on the increase.  Therefore, the case is made for the abolition of capital punishment.  It might be no harm to record that Western Europe, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Western Germany, Holland, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland all have abolished capital punishment, and it cannot be proved that murder is on the increase there.  It is past time that <Col N="1110" /> something were done in this country for the abolition of capital punishment and on that I am with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We, I think, have rightly decided in this Party that the question of capital punishment is a matter going so deeply into the conscience of each individual Deputy that he should be left free to act in accordance with his own conscience in respect of this matter without any feeling that that reflects on his cohesion with a political Party.  Accordingly, members of this Party will vote as each individual deems it his duty to vote on the problems presented to the House by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to this Bill.  I could understand a Bill which proposed the total abolition of the death penalty, but I am opposed to a Bill which does not seem to have any relation to principle at all.  The Government have been persuaded to adopt, in part at least, the approach of the British Government to this problem.  I think the solution chosen by the British Parliament was a bad solution for a very difficult problem which confronts every legislature in the world.  In my judgment, as so often happens, I believe we have worked out for ourselves in Ireland a satisfactory means of dealing with this most difficult problem in that we have preserved a system where, if a man or a woman be convicted by a jury of the awful crime of murder, the courts declare with full solemnity the supreme penalty for that awful crime but the Executive retains its right to exercise the prerogative of mercy and, in practice, habitually does so.  I think it is a good thing that society should have portrayed before it, by a court of law, with the fullest possible solemnity, the immense gravity and iniquity of the crime of murder and I do not believe it is any unreasonable hardship to impose upon a person, who has been found guilty by a jury of the crime of murder, that he should endure the ordeal of coming under the threat of execution by the society to which he belongs and which, by his act, he has betrayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the loose talk of people who speak of judicial murder, <Col N="1111" /> and so forth, is founded on erroneous pleas.  I believe that in every Christian dispensation it is conceded that society has the right, under defined law, to execute the individual, if the safety of society should require it.  The first question is: does the safety of society require it?  Here we come up against the vital flaw which I discern in this Bill.  The Government say the safety of society does require the retention of capital punishment if it is to be effectively protected from certain crimes.  We are immediately confronted with the dilemma that the person who murdered an unarmed nightwatchman is not liable to the supreme penalty, whereas if he mistakes the uniform of an unarmed garda for that of an unarmed nightwatchman, he is liable to the supreme penalty.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with very grave matters.It does seem to me an astonishing proposition that the murderer could produce in his own defence the proposition that he murdered this man by mistake, that had he known he was a garda, he would not have murdered him.  He murdered him only because he was a nightwatchman who was not protected by the supreme penalty of execution.  One begins to wonder if such a defence were made to the court, would the court have regard to it, because if the man was accused of the crime of murder&mdash;or whatever other crime he was accused of&mdash;if it were a nightwatchman, not a garda, he was free to murder with relative immunity so long as he was no more than a nightwatchman.</P>
    <P>We also have the strange provision that if you murder a diplomat in this country, you are liable to execution under this Bill.  Why it should be a graver matter to murder the third Secretary in an Embassy accredited to this country than to murder your own mother-in-law or your mother is something I find it extremely difficult to understand.  In matters of such fundamental importance as this, we must be clear in our minds that we are following some recognisable plan in legislating.</P>
    <P>Deputies are much moved, and <Col N="1112" /> rightly moved, in the consideration of so grave a matter as this by the statistical material made available to them by the opponents of capital punishment.One of the most striking statistics always advanced in a discussion of this subject is that in countries where capital punishment has been abolished, there has been observed no increase in murder.  If we are to examine the true deterrent effect of the supreme penalty of execution for murder, we have to ask ourselves: can we attain to any real valid statistic in this matter, because the deterrent effect of this ultimate sanction is to prevent murders that might otherwise have taken place?</P>
    <P>None of us can tell in this society or any other society what murders would have taken place if capital punishment were not in operation.  It is these murders which have not taken place which show the deterrent effect of the retention of capital punishment as the extreme sanction of the law.  I find it hard to persuade myself that there are not a great many people amongst those who give themselves over to violence who are not deterred from this supreme crime by the knowledge that the sanction of capital punishment is still available to the State if they are found guilty of the crime of murder.</P>
    <P>It appears contrary to reason to suggest that the abolition of capital punishment is not likely to produce in the minds of persons given to violence the vital difference between the violence necessary to promote a felony followed by the sudden belief, however illusory, that the only prospect of conviction is the recognition and identification by the victim of the violence and the determination, if there is no ultimate sanction of capital punishment, to &ldquo;polish off&rdquo; this victim, and on the established record, probably not adding a day to the average period of the subsequent detention in prison.</P>
    <P>We are informed here today that persons sentenced to imprisonment for life on the remission of the penalty of death have served an average of six years and some as few as three years.  I find it hard to believe that the person who grows accustomed to <Col N="1113" /> that knowledge and has committed some brutal crime of physical violence will not be tempted to take the further step of murder if he believes that this opens up for him the prospect of a possible escape from conviction of any crime at all; whereas the additional risk of his further crime is merely that instead of serving seven years' penal servitude, he may be sentenced to imprisonment for life, which on the record, gives him a good prospect of in fact being called to serve no more than he would have been called to serve if he were identified and convicted of the original assault.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne advances the thesis that really a murderer cannot help himself.  I want expressly to demur from that proposition, which I believe is pregnant with great danger to society in the whole world.  There is a kind of neo-Pelagian belief spreading throughout the world which maintains the thesis that human nature is perfectible divorced from grace.  I believe that is a complete illusion.  I believe human nature is predisposed to sin and without grace cannot control that predisposition.  It is a complete illusion to say that people who yield to temptation do so only because they cannot help themselves.  It is common knowledge to us all that most of us know that from time to time we do not resist temptation, but we know in retrospect that if we had really tried we could have done so.  Fortunately, it comes to few of us to be tempted to the crime of murder.</P>
    <P>But if we lay down the proposition that we are not to be answerable for our own actions&mdash;which I believe is the logical end of the proposition propounded by Deputy Dunne&mdash;we are travelling on the road which ultimately leads to Auschwitz and Belsen.  I suppose most people would have said 30 years ago that one of the most civilised people in Europe could not conceivably arrive at the stage which, in the name of their Government, horrors such as were perpetrated in these establishments of Auschwitz and Belsen could take place, but they did.  I should imagine that few people would ever have thought that things could be done in Russia that have been <Col N="1114" /> done, that millions could have been slaughtered and outrages perpetrated, but they have taken place.  I suppose those familiar with the exquisite civilisation of China back over 3,000 years or more would have confidently prophesied that the horrors perpetrated in that country in the past ten years were unthinkable&mdash;the slaughter and murder of millions of people&mdash;but it can happen.  If we once accept the proposition that those who commit dreadful crimes do it because they cannot help it, we are opening the road to the realisation of such horrors all over the world.</P>
    <P>People can control their temptations. If we are to live in society at all, people must control them.  It seems manifest to me that those who claim the right to immunity from that obligation must be controlled by the society to which they belong, if society itself is to survive.  So we are back to the original question: has this a deterrent effect?  There is such a thing in the Divine plan as retributive justice and I am not prepared to accept the proposition that in considering the whole duty of the State relative to those who commit crimes against society deterrents must be the State's sole preoccupation.  Whether in the nursery or in the school or in the day-to-day life of society, there remains the just and proper association between duty and retribution.  In invoking the appropriate retribution for crime, every Christian society will wish to see justice tempered by charity, but, in the last analysis, if we are to protect society from what might otherwise disrupt it, I feel that the retention of the power in the State by law to execute the murderer is necessary.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Government are in a position which is neither logical nor defensible because the dilemma I have already proposed to them arising from the partial abolition of capital punishment seems to leave us without any proper principle at all.  I could understand it if the Government came along to us and said that they were going to abolish capital punishment entirely for a period of five years and said that they were going to review the <Col N="1115" /> whole question at the end of that time in the light of experience.  I believe the better alternative would be to say: &ldquo;We have worked out a system pragmatically which suits our circumstances and which provides that where a citizen is found guilty of murder by the criminal courts of this country society will witness, and he will suffer, the ordeal of the court declaring with full solemnity that he is condemned to the supreme penalty for the awful crime of murder and that he should be brought face to face with the fact that his life is forfeit and that he will know the anguish, which is part of the retribution for his crime, of depending for survival on the exercise of the prerogative of mercy by the Executive for the time being.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under our system, we have removed that awful responsibility from the shoulders of any individual Minister. It is shared now by the entire Government of the day.  It is a proper dispensation and it works.  I think the unprincipled and confused purpose enshrined in the Minister's Bill has nothing to recommend it and I will suggest to the Minister then, rather than pursue this case which is so manifestly divorced from any principle, he should take back this legislation to the Government and suggest that before bringing it again before the House, the House should have some fundamental principle to which it could adhere and that there can be only two alternatives: first, to abolish capital punishment altogether and, secondly, to retain it and to review, if necessary, the category of crimes for which it should be retained.</P>
    <P>When that is done, I do not think you can possibly put the crime of murder in any minor category to be decided by the House.  How does the Minister seriously suggest that you can retain capital punishment for offences against the State, for the crime of treason against the country or for the murder of a diplomat and not have it for the supreme crime of murder of one's neighbour?</P>
    <P>I understand, although it is not provided for in this Bill, that the M'Naghten Rules dealing with mental <Col N="1116" /> incapacity are to be reviewed.  I think that is an important decision but I want to sound this note of warning&mdash; we must remember that whatever legislation the Government submit to the Oireachtas, its ultimate interpretation is a matter for the courts.  I doubt if, under our existing law, anybody who is what we ordinarily recognise as insane, is ever sentenced to death for murder.  Here again a working basis has emerged over the years and we must be extremely careful, if we seek to work out some other formula, to be sure that the new formula does not contain far greater hazards than the existing one.</P>
    <P>We have got to bear this in mind, that while there have been great advances in psychiatric medicine in our time, there can be the greatest difference between experts of comparable authority as to what the psychiatric impulses of a person may be.  The present position is&mdash;and it is important for Deputies to bear it in mind&mdash;that the person charged with murder before the courts of this country is not required to prove himself innocent. The position is that the State must prove beyond all reasonable doubt that he and only he has committed the crime charged against him.  We all know of the existence of cases at the present time where we have every reason to believe that the police authorities are well aware of the identity of a criminal, even of a murderer, but also know that they have not the material or the evidence on which they could reasonably hope to convince a jury beyond all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant.</P>
    <P>I think that some people regard us as too scrupulous in that regard but it is good that that heavy burden should rest on society in so grave a matter and that the criminal at the bar should have that protection that it remains the duty of the State to prove his guilt and that in no case shall the burden of proof of innocence be shifted on to him.  But let us walk warily when we proceed to change the existing rules, imperfect as they undoubtedly are, defining what mental responsibility is in accordance with the crime because if we widen this by this statute excessively, <Col N="1117" /> we may create a situation in which the effective administration of the criminal law becomes virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>The statutory definition of mental incapacity sufficient to discharge a person from responsibility for the actual act of which he has been found guilty is an extremely difficult thing to define and no matter how precisely or carefully we do it, we shall not know until in practice it transpires how the letter of our law is interpreted in the administration of the courts. I mention that matter in the light of what the Minister has stated to the House in regard to the Government's intention to review the M'Naghten Rules.</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes to a division, I will vote against it because I believe it is rooted in no principle and because I believe that our pragmatic resolution of this whole problem which we have worked out for ourselves and which at present operates is the best solution of a difficult question under Irish conditions and in an Irish background.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke of bringing this Bill back to the Government and, say, abolishing capital punishment for five years.  I cannot understand the difference between what the Minister is doing now and what Deputy Dillon suggests he should do.  We are dealing with a problem that has concerned all enlightened countries.  As a result of their experience, a number of countries have abolished capital punishment.  It is quite a long time since anybody paid the death penalty in this country for murder.  In view of the experience we have gained, I feel we should fall into line with more intelligent public opinion in other countries that have hundreds of years of experience of government and that are older in government administration than we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not introduced this Bill lightly.  He has gone to a great deal of trouble to find out the best method of easing the position regarding capital punishment.  If, as a result of the easing of capital punishment for a certain category here, we find ourselves <Col N="1118" /> with more murderers, then enlightened society and Governments usually change their minds as a result of later enlightenment.</P>
    <P>However, until such time as that happens, the Minister was very wise to introduce this measure.  In our experience in this country, we have very few calculating murderers who make arrangements coolly and calmly to murder.  We have the usual type who are involved in a row or who get into a temper or who, possibly, under the influence of drink commit the capital offence.  In history, also, we now know that innocent men have suffered capital punishment.  When the fate of a man's life hangs on circumstantial evidence, which criminal history has proved not always to be correct, the circumstances can be very terrible.  A man may have been in a particular place when a murder was committed.  He may have no alibi but may be completely innocent.</P>
    <P>All that has been proved in criminal law in the United States and in other countries.  We intend to make an experiment and an experiment can be changed.  I am all for having a charitable experiment and a more enlightened view on matters of this kind.  In supporting this Bill I feel I am doing so from the most compassionate motives possible.</P>
    <P>We should give this Bill a chance. If, as a result of our experience we find we are being too charitable, then we can change our minds, on greater enlightenment.</P>

      <P>The thing that strikes me very forcibly about this Bill is, in the first instance, that the major Opposition Party are free to vote as they will.  The Labour Party have expressed the same opinion.  In the introduction of radical legislation such as this for which, personally, I see no great public demand, nor did the Minister give us any evidence of it in his opening address, it seems the Government should at least throw the matter open in their own Party.  I suggest to the Minister that opinions have been expressed to me by Deputies in the Minister's Party who shall be nameless indicating that there is a <Col N="1119" /> considerable volume of opinion in Fianna Fáil against this legislation. Further, if the Minister stops to consider the question, if this were to go to a national referendum&mdash;and it is a radical alteration in the existing system&mdash;what does the Minister think the result would be?  Does he expect he would get anything like a majority?</P>

      <P>I could challenge the Minister to do so.  I think the answer would be the direct opposite.  Be that as it may, everybody is entitled to his views.  I have listened to the arguments so far in this debate and I feel, in common with other Deputies, that it is a pity far more Deputies have not spoken on such a vital matter.  I listened particularly to the previous speaker, who was the only Fianna Fáil member to stand up to support the Minister, and I can only describe his arguments as in the main puerile.  If you introduce radical legislation such as this, you should have some indication from the public that they want it.</P>
      <P>There are certain reservations which were very ably referred to by Deputy Dillon, Leader of my Party, in regard to people whose murderers would be hanged.  Other people can be the victims of the most sordid crimes imaginable and the perpetrators will not be hanged.  They can rob, plunder and pillage a defenceless widow and will not be hanged for it, but if they shoot a policeman, they are to be hanged.  Murder is murder in any circumstances.  I believe the legal position under our Constitution is that before a person may be executed or even condemned for murder, two vital factors that must be proved are that there were full intent and malice aforethought; in other words, a premeditated murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister studied criminology?Has he gone to the trouble of reading famous murder trials that have been edited and published?  If he does, I think he will find that the majority of them are sordid stories from beginning to end.  Ninety per cent of those who have been convicted for <Col N="1120" /> murder have been enemies of society practically for their entire life.  We are introducing legislation to protect these people.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy should express his opinion on this issue and I believe that anyone who is tried for murder has the full opportunity of defence and every opportunity of getting the benefit of any doubt there is.  It would be foolish to deny that there may have been odd cases in the history of murder trials where full justice has not been done but in our circumstances the individual is entitled to full rights of defence, free legal assistance and all the benefits of any doubt.  If there is any question of his mental stability being impaired, he is invariably acquitted.  I think that ties up with the M`Naghten rules referred to by Deputy Dillon.  If there is any doubt cast on, or rebuttal of the evidence, any reasonable jury&mdash;and Irish juries have proved themselves to be reasonable&mdash; will give the benefit of the doubt.  Nobody can reasonably say we are condemning people to capital punishment when there is an issue of doubt and to suggest we might do so is in a sense denigrating our juries who I think can stand up to those of any country.</P>
    <P>Hearing the Minister introduce this Bill, one would imagine we had been hanging people wholesale here.  I was quite shocked this morning when a reply to the Parliamentary Question was read out.  I had not known this before but it appears that since the war the average period of detention of those condemned to death for murder and reprieved, was six years and in one case an individual spent only three years in jail.  It seems to be a very small penalty if I murder my neighbour if I go to jail for only three years.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister tell the House, as there may be some apprehension on this question, who was responsible for letting a murderer out after only three years?  If murderers, as they have been in the past ten years, are condemned to death and reprieved, who takes the decision subsequently when they are released?  Is it a Government decision or a decision of the Governor of the prison or of the police authorities? <Col N="1121" /> The public are entitled to this information.</P>
    <P>A further avenue of escape for a condemned person lies in the fact that the prerogative of mercy rests with the Government&mdash;actually, I presume, with the Minister as the executive concerned.Is it not true that all cases where an individual is condemned to death are brought before the Government and that each member of the Government has the right to vote and it is on the majority decision that a murderer is executed or not?</P>
    <P>The Minister has not made a reasonable case for this Bill.  I do not see why he has introduced it.  It is not as if we were hanging people wholesale or as if there were a public demand for the measure.  As Minister for Justice, I presume the Minister sees all the petitions and representations about these things.  He intervened just now to say that if there were a referendum on this matter, there would be an overwhelming majority in support of the Bill.  I should like to know on what grounds he bases that belief.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that among the cases to which capital punishment will still apply are murders of policemen.Some of my colleagues have pointed out that an unarmed nightwatchman, a bank porter or such people are not covered by the Bill. What is the position in regard to a plainclothes policeman, a detective doing his duty, who is murdered?  Is the criminal to be hanged?  Does the detective enjoy the same protection as a uniformed policeman?  I should be grateful if the Minister would take what I have said as constructive criticism and reply to some, at any rate, of the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with this Bill, except in so far as I do not think it goes far enough. Judging by a good deal of what has been said here, there is still with us a great amount of what I describe as the 1916 to 1922 mentality.  At that period, life was worth very little apparently and executions were the order of the day.  There are, I think, still people in this House who have not moved very far from that period, judging by the speeches made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> I remember, on one occasion, a particular newspaper calling out for executions.  It is an amazing situation that in this great Catholic and Christian country, nineteen hundred years after the teaching of the Gospel, we are still in the position that we carry out what can be described only as judicial murder.  I do not mind whether a man murders a policeman or an ordinary civilian; I maintain the punishment should be the same.  There should be no discrimination; there should be no difference.  But, even after this Bill is passed, if a man murders a policeman, he will be executed.  That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who believe in being soft with criminals.  I do not. We have too many criminals.  On the other hand, I cannot understand how anybody in this year, 1963, can make the kind of discrimination we have here with regard to penalty.  We are living in what is supposed to be a Catholic and a Christian country.  It is about time, I think, we abolished capital punishment.  If&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;a situation ever did arise in which capital punishment might have to be reintroduced, then I am sure the Minister for Justice for the time being could come before this House and get the necessary powers.</P>
    <P>Right now, I think the Minister should ensure that he goes down in history as a man of high intelligence and sound common sense by abolishing the death penalty altogether.  There are no really serious crimes against the State.  Very often, when a policeman is murdered, it is, at its worst, a question of manslaughter.  I do not think we have anyone today who is out to murder policemen, or anybody else, but it does happen as it has happened and will happen.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the penalty does not always fit the crime where our courts are concerned.  I have seen a man get six months for stealing a £5 note.  From what the Minister has said, he gets three years in jail if he murders a man.  By no stretch of the imagination does that make sense.  If the figures available to the Minister are correct and the average term a murderer spends in jail is right, it is <Col N="1123" /> time serious thought were given to the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways.  If a man goes out and murders a policeman, he will be executed; if he murders the policeman's brother, he will get only three years in jail. That does not make sense to me.  I doubt if it makes sense to the Minister. I think this merits review.  If it is made public that the most a man will get, if he commits a murder, is three years, I wonder what the possible consequences will be?  I doubt if they will be beneficial.</P>
    <P>There must be some substantial deterrent from the point of view of punishment, but I doubt if execution is the answer.  Neither do I think letting murderers out of jail in such a short period is the answer.  Those guilty of murder should get a life sentence and the reviewing of that sentence should be taken very seriously, and not lightly as it appears to be at the moment.</P>
    <P>I think this whole matter needs very serious re-examination.  The Minister would want to give some further figures to reassure people that the matter is not being dealt with lightly. Most of us would like to know in the case of a life sentence what happens afterwards.  I do not think the Minister has done anything at all to clarify the position one way or the other.  In one way, that could perhaps be taken as the best argument there is for the retention of capital punishment.On the other hand, I agree the Minister is doing the right thing in abolishing capital punishment, but I believe he should go the whole way. He should reconsider the matter and do away completely with the death sentence.  I see no reason why it should be retained at all.  We are a stable, civilised country.  I do not think there is any serious danger of a revolution or the mass murder of policemen.  I suggest the Minister abolish the death penalty once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same thing. Who wants this?  The record of the State, as far as hanging people is concerned, over the past 25 or 30 years will bear examination.  We have hanged very few people in this country. We must consider all the safeguards we provide for a man charged with murder, be he an habitual criminal or an ordinary citizen up to the time he committed the murder.  We provide him with the opportunity for a defence and he goes through the courts.  He then has an appeal to the Government of the country and no matter who they are, they are humane men who will, if they find any loop-hole or extenuating circumstances, reprieve that man.</P>
      <P>It seems to me a good thing that where you have a brutal, cruel premeditated murder, there should be adequate punishment to meet the crime.  We should not be afraid to take the responsibility.  We have heard Deputies here talking about good and enlightened people but let me tell them that a lot of these enlightened people who have taken the sting out of the punishment are overrun now by teddy boys, by gangs of murderers, and they are holding up their hands in horror. A great reason for the incidence of serious crime in many countries has been the namby-pamby way they have been administering justice in these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been reading about people being beaten practically to death, but the criminals responsible are let off with small penalties or are discharged under the Probation of Offenders Act. In this Bill we are dealing with murderers.We are not dealing with people who have never had a thought of committing a murder.  The purpose of this Bill should be to see that would-be murderers have it in the back of their heads that they will hang if they commit a murder, whether it be the murder of an ordinary citizen or of a man in uniform.  Here I should <Col N="1125" /> like to say a word in respect of the men in uniform who guard our banks and very often our lives.  Are we to permit a person who murders one of those men in uniform to think he can do so and have his freedom in three years, because that was the effect of the Minister's statement?</P>
    <P>We must be prepared to punish people who break the law of the country.  We must accept our responsibility in this matter.  I wish here to draw the Minister's attention to the effect of two cases in England where the criminals suffered the supreme penalty.  One was the case of Craig and Bentley where a policeman was shot.  It was not the young fellow who shot the policeman who was hanged but the fellow who shouted: &ldquo;Let him have it.&rdquo;  There was also a murder committed during a smash and grab raid in London.  A decent citizen, trying to stop the gang, put his motor-cycle in front of them.  They shot him. They were sentenced to death and hanged.  Immediately after these hangings, there was a wholesale abandonment of arms by the criminal world: guns and other weapons were found in dustbins and thrown into corners throughout London.  The underworld were getting rid of their arms.</P>
    <P>We are not without some boys here who will say to themselves if this Bill becomes law: &ldquo;I will not be caught; I will shoot it out and will have to serve only three years.&rdquo;  I say this legislation is not necessary.  I am not saying I want people hanged when I oppose this Bill.  I do say the power of reprieve or otherwise should be in the hands of the Government.  They should have the power, in a case of wilful, brutal murder, to refuse to reprieve the murderer.  What I am objecting to is the cutting away of this power from the Government of the country.</P>
    <P>This Bill is but a start from the top in the softening out of punishment. We are attempting to soften the whole thing out.  We must accept our responsibilities in this matter, because the reason the law cannot be enforced is that we are too soft on law breakers. They get off with light sentences and I am now asking the Minister and those responsible for the administration of <Col N="1126" /> the courts to consider more seriously their duty to protect the people of Ireland who pay their salaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pretty clear from the debate that in principle the House is overwhelmingly in favour of the abolition of capital punishment.  Indeed, the main criticism which has been levelled against the Bill is that it does not go far enough.  In this connection, Deputies have concentrated on the very narrow and limited field in which capital punishment is being retained, and I want to emphasise at this stage that the field in which capital punishment is being retained for murder is a very narrow one indeed.</P>
      <P>We propose to retain the death penalty only in very limited, definite, clearly defined categories of offences.  It is true to say we are in favour of abolishing the death penalty for all practical purposes.  The exceptions are of a minimal nature.  They are set out in the Bill, and as Deputies know, they cover treason, political murder, murder of a garda or prison officer in the course of his duty and the political murder of a visiting head of state of a foreign government.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the Leader of the Fine Gael Party is aware of the distinction made in the Bill in respect of the last type of murder.  When speaking, at any rate, it seemed to me he was under the impression that any murder of a diplomatic representative would in future merit the death penalty.  This is not so.  The Bill specifically provides for the death penalty only in respect of a political murder of such a person. I want also to mention to the House that it seems to me that this type of offence is one with which we are never likely to come face to face in reality. To a great extent, I regard the inclusion of this category as not very much short of academic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State, we have never had a single case of the murder of a Garda or a prison officer in the course of his duty other than political murders.  Therefore, to a very large extent, this also is a very restricted category.  We have, of course, unfortunately, had political murders, <Col N="1127" /> both political murders of ordinary persons and political murders of Gardaí in the course of their duty.  It is quite possible to make a clear and precise exception of this type of murder.  There can be circumstances in which a political organisation or an organisation of some sort would, as a matter of policy, embark on a course of action which would involve the murder of members of the Garda Síochána or prison officers in the course of their duty.  That type of murder is completely different from the normal type of murder with which we are dealing and in that situation undoubtedly it would be true that the retention of the death penalty would be a deterrent.  Its value as a deterrent in what Deputy Michael O'Higgins referred to as the individual murder is very doubtful.</P>
    <P>There is, I admit, force in the argument that the Bill is lacking in consistent adherence to principle because we are not abolishing the death penalty entirely.  However, as I explained in my opening remarks, we have had to have regard to our duty as a Government, at this time and in these circumstances, to decide what is necessary for the preservation of law and order and the security of the State.  We have reluctantly come to the conclusion that at present it is necessary to retain the death penalty for the very limited number of offences set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that the Bill would be much more capable of being defended in principle if the abolition were complete but I do want to make the point as strongly as I can that, in effect and in practice, the abolition which is proposed in the Bill is almost complete and that the categories of offences for which it is being retained are of very little practical importance or significance.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the argument which has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition and some of his colleagues to the effect that the present situation is satisfactory and that we have evolved here pragmatically, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, a method of <Col N="1128" /> dealing with this problem which is suitable to our circumstances and which works well.  I am afraid I disagree entirely and I want to suggest to the House that the present situation is completely unsatisfactory.  It is unsatisfactory, to my mind, from two points of view.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, this method may be criticised in so far as it undoubtedly tends to bring the courts and the judicial process into disrepute. We have time and again the spectacle of our courts solemnly pronouncing the death penalty with all the awesome, impressive trappings and surrounding circumstances, while at the same time there is a wide public realisation of the fact that this means nothing, that it is merely an empty formula.  There has not been an execution carried out for nine or ten years and everybody knows it is most unlikely in the vast majority of cases that this sentence so solemnly pronounced by our courts will be carried out.  That is undesirable and undoubtedly leads to a situation where the courts and the judicial process are to some extent denigrated.</P>
    <P>The present situation is undesirable from another point of view.  The decision whether or not a man is to hang has, in effect, in recent years been transferred from the courts to the Cabinet.  We know full well that the Government are, by virtue of their special position and authority, the final arbiter as to whether or not the prerogative of mercy should be exercised.  The situation has now evolved to the point where a decision whether or not a person is to be hanged for the crime of murder is an Executive decision and not a judicial one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is not an accurate way of stating it?  The decision whether a person is not to be hanged is an Executive decision; the decision whether he is to be hanged is a judicial one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately, the decision as to whether he is to be hanged or not rests with the Government.As I said in my opening remarks, it is desirable that the <Col N="1129" /> Oireachtas should lay down clearly by law in exactly what circumstances persons are to be executed and in what circumstances they are not, and it should not be left to this process of Executive decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think one could.  I would not be inclined to go that far.  It seems to me that the Leader of the Opposition and some of his colleagues are not on good ground when they claim that the present situation, which has evolved more or less automatically and without anybody consciously bringing it to what it is is a satisfactory one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave made a statement with which I must disagree very strongly.  He said that we must either abolish the death penalty entirely or not at all.  I think there is no basis in logic for saying that.  Let us look back on the history of this.  This is an evolutionary process.  As was mentioned during the course of the debate, at one time people were hanged or executed for all sorts of crimes, many of them trivial, but as the social conscience developed, as our ideas in these matters became broader and more humane, more, perhaps, progressive&mdash; although I do not like the use of the word &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; in this context&mdash; the scope of the field in which the death penalty was invoked became narrower and narrower.  The whole process is one of developing, of evolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave might as well have said, away back in 1861, that at that time it was an illogical thing to abolish the death penalty for all sorts of minor or trivial offences and that the proper thing to do would have been either to abolish the death penalty entirely or retain it.  Deputy Cosgrave is wrong in his approach in that respect.  As I said, this is a matter in which over decades and centuries mankind's approach evolved slowly and gradually and I think that is what is happening here. We have now arrived at the point where we can, for all practical purposes, abolish the death penalty but we are reluctantly retaining it in a very <Col N="1130" /> limited number of specific categories of offences because the consideration which Deputy Dillon mentioned, the right of society to protect itself, necessitates our doing so.</P>
    <P>I must say I find myself in complete agreement with the Leader of the Opposition when he says that the solution which the British have propounded for themselves is a bad one.  I hope that neither he nor I will be taken as being discourteous in criticising, in any way, the action of another Parliament but in this type of situation, I think it is legitimate for us to do so.  The solution which the British have propounded is completely and entirely unsatisfactory and in our whole approach to this problem, the Government were determined we should not make the same mistake.  We have succeeded in that.  We have abolished the death penalty in 99.9 per cent cases, if not, in effect, entirely.</P>
    <P>These are the principal remarks I wish to make on the conclusion of the Second Reading debate.  On Committee Stage, when we come to examine more closely the specific exceptions which the Bill provides, we can go into them in greater detail and see what the justification for each exception is.  I think I am correct in my assumption that the House is overwhelmingly in favour of the principle of the Bill and it would be the wish of all Deputies that it should at least be given a Second Reading.  There may be some discussion later as to whether the exceptions we have provided should be extended or any particular one deleted from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill to amend and consolidate the law relating to the registration of title to land.  Its main purpose is to provide for the extension of compulsory registration to all land <Col N="1131" /> in the State, including mines and minerals and incorporeal hereditaments.Provision is also made for certain amendments of the substantive law relating to registration and for the introduction of various changes in registration procedure.  Accompanying the Bill is a very full explanatory memorandum which I trust Deputies will find helpful.  Explanatory side notes have been inserted in the Bill itself showing the provisions which are new to the law and the existing statutory enactments which are being consolidated.In view of the information thus furnished I do not think it is necessary for me to go into any great detail on the individual provisions of the Bill and I propose, therefore, to confine myself to a general elaboration of the principles involved.</P>
    <P>We have in this country two separate and virtually exclusive systems for recording transactions in relation to land&mdash;the system of registration of deeds operated by the Registry of Deeds and the system of registration of title which is operated by the Land Registry.  The former system, which was established by an Act of Queen Anne passed in 1707, provides for the registration of all deeds and conveyances affecting land and renders unregistered deeds fraudulent and void against registered ones. The practical effect of this is that a search in the Registry of Deeds will disclose the existence of certain classes of dealings with land, thus facilitating the deduction of title by private investigation.A purchaser may use the system to inform himself of such dealings, with the assurance that all dealings of the same class which are not recorded in the Registry will be treated as fraudulent and void unless he has actual notice of them.  The system does not relieve the purchaser from the labour and expense of examining the deeds and documents which constitutes the title or from the risk of misinterpreting their legal effect.  It affords him no assistance in respect of dispositions made by will or arising under an intestacy.  And, what is of more immediate practical importance, an equitable mortgage by <Col N="1132" /> deposit of title deeds, without writing, is unaffected by the Act of 1707 and takes priority over a registered deed. This is because the Act is concerned exclusively with the priority of instruments <i>inter se</i>.  This type of mortgage is a common and useful form of transaction in this country and the fact of its being outside the scope of the Registry of Deeds represents a major defect in the system.</P>
    <P>Registration of title is a system of State registration of ownership of land whereby all relevant particulars concerning the land and its ownership are entered on special registers maintained in the Land Registry.  Those registers are kept in the form of a book or folio in three parts; the first part gives a description of the property, the location, acreage, mapping references and so on; the second part contains details of the ownership; and the third part shows the burdens, if any, affecting the property.  In conjunction with the registers there are maintained registry maps on which plans are drawn of each parcel of land of which the ownership is registered.  The identity of any registered land is established from the particulars in the register and the plan on the relevant registry map.  Each new transaction affecting the land is notified to the Land Registry and the appropriate alterations in, or additions to, the register are made.  A purchaser for value from the registered owner gets exactly what is entered on the register, namely, the title to the land, subject only to the defects and limitations, if any, noted on the register.  The title shown on the register is guaranteed by the State, which is bound to indemnify any person who suffers loss through a mistake made by the Registry.  A land certificate may be obtained by the registered owner on application and this document constitutes proof of his ownership of the land.  It replaces the old documents of title, but, unlike the latter, is clear and simple and may be easily understood by lay persons.</P>
    <P>The system of registration of title has been operating in this country since 1892.  When, during the second half of the nineteenth century, the Land Purchase Acts were enacted and tenant occupiers began to buy out the <Col N="1133" /> interest of the landlords in their holdings, it became clear that a cheap, simple and effective system of recording transactions in land was needed if the titles of the new proprietors were not to become involved in inextricable confusion.  The system of registration of deeds was unsuitable and inadequate for the purpose.  What was needed was a system whereby the ownership could at any time be ascertained in an expeditious and satisfactory manner, and registration of title admirably fulfilled this need.</P>
    <P>The Registration of Title Act, 1891, established the Land Registry and made registration of title compulsory in the case of all land bought out under the Land Purchase Acts.  The system has been operating very successfully ever since and it is estimated that approximately 80 per cent of all land in the State&mdash;chiefly rural land&mdash;is now registered.  In the main, only urban land remains subject to the system of registration of deeds.  Provision was made in the Act of 1891 for the voluntary registration of title to land but the facilities of the law in this respect have not been availed of to any marked extent.  As a means of recording and facilitating dealings in land, registration of title is vastly superior to registration of deeds.  The position of a purchaser under the two systems may be likened to that of a schoolboy who is faced with solving a difficult mathematical problem.  In the one case, he finds, so to speak, that the sum is worked out for him and the correctness of the answer guaranteed.  In the other, he is provided with some of, but not necessarily all, the clues as to how he should tackle the problem and then has to go and work it out for himself, with no guarantee that he will get the right answer.  A register of title tells plainly who is the owner of the land and what are the charges affecting it.</P>
    <P>The Registry of Deeds, on the other hand, can do no more than disclose certain individual dealings the investigation of which will be necessary for the purpose of deducing the title to the land.  Registration of title abolishes the inconclusive, expensive and repeated examination of title by private individuals and substitutes one <Col N="1134" /> final and authoritative examination by the Land Registry.  It removes the possibility of fraud by duplication or suppression of deeds and also the possibility of <i>bona fide</i> mistakes as to past title or existing burdens affecting land. On first registration, many defects of title which are the subject of tiresome, recurrent inquiries are permanently cured.</P>
    <P>Registration of title is in essence a system of simplified conveyancing. One of its biggest advantages is that the forms used for sales, mortgages and other dealings are readily intelligible to the layman.  The transfer of land becomes, as it should be, a painless, simple and inexpensive process.  A vendor can enter into a contract immediately and unreservedly.  The matter need not be delayed while his legal advisers ascertain the state of the title.  A purchaser can at once safely accept the title offered and there is no need for the specific provisions relating to title that are usually contained in contracts for the sale of unregistered land.  As the work involved is considerably simplified, conveyancing costs are reduced.  Above all, the system provides State-guaranteed security which private conveyancing by deeds can never give.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of Government, one of the great merits of registration of title is the invaluable assistance that it can afford, both to central and local authorities, in providing a definite basis for taxation and valuation, in the operation of a sound system of agricultural credit facilities or facilities for the provision and repair of houses, and in such matters as the administration of planning legislation.</P>
    <P>Encouragement of registration of title is, therefore, a sound administrative policy.  Indeed, the advantages of registration of title are widely recognised throughout the world and the system is well established in many European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Hungary, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, most of Canada and many of the States of the American Union. Inquiries indicate that the system has been operating satisfactorily in all <Col N="1135" /> these countries, in some cases for a very considerable time.  The system is in course of establishment in England and Wales and is becoming widely accepted there as cheaper and more efficient than unregistered conveyancing.Its introduction in Scotland has recently been recommended by the Reid Committee, who were appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland to consider the merits of the system.</P>
    <P>The system of registration of title at present operating in this country is essentially sound, and any shortcomings that have manifested themselves over the years are matters of detail that can be remedied by the adoption of the proposals contained in the Bill.  I am completely satisfied that the merits of the system are such as to warrant its extension to all land in the State. Unfortunately, experience here and in Britain shows that a system of voluntary registration will not succeed.  One reason for this is that landowners are reluctant to incur the initial expense and possible risk of submitting their title for investigation.  It has also been argued that the conservatism of some members of the legal profession tends to prevent them from adopting the system on behalf of their clients.</P>
    <P>The only way, therefore, in which registration of title can be extended to all land is by compulsion and, accordingly, provision is made in Part III of the Bill for the gradual extension of compulsory registration to all land. In the main, the property affected by this proposal will be that comprised in urban areas.  I envisage that, ultimately, although not for some time, the system of registration of title will completely replace the system of registration of deeds and result in the closing of the Registry of Deeds.</P>
    <P>The principal new machinery for the extension of compulsory registration is contained in sections 24 and 25 of the Bill.  Section 24 provides that the Minister for Justice may make orders applying compulsory registration to individual counties or county boroughs or parts thereof.  In an area in respect of which such an order is in force <Col N="1136" /> registration will be compulsory on the occasion of any conveyance on sale of freehold land or grant or assignment on sale of a leasehold interest.  To ensure ample warning for all who may be affected, the operative date for an order will have to be not earlier than six months after the making of the order.  Section 25 provides the sanction for the enforcement of compulsory registration.  The effect of the section will be that, in any case in which registration becomes compulsory, a conveyance on sale or grant or assignment on sale will not vest the estate or interest purported to be conveyed, granted or assigned unless, within three months, the purchaser becomes registered as owner.  This period may be extended by the Registrar or the court where circumstances warrant.</P>
    <P>One advantage of introducing compulsory registration following a sale is that the title to the land will have been examined by the purchaser's solicitor and the documents of title will be available.  The investigation of the title by the Land Registry will thereby be greatly facilitated.  Another advantage is that applications for first registration will be kept to manageable proportions.Quite obviously, the rate at which compulsory registration can be extended will be limited by the capacity of the Land Registry to handle new registrations and it will be necessary to proceed cautiously in the initial stages so as not to overburden the system.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 23 of the Bill for compulsory registration of all land acquired after the commencement of the proposed Act by Government Departments, State-sponsored bodies and local authorities.  This provision will apply irrespective of whether the land is situated in a compulsory registration area.  I consider that it is only fitting that public bodies should set a headline for private landowners by helping to extend the system of registration of title as rapidly as possible to all land in the State.</P>
    <P>Existing procedure for the registration of urban property, that is to say, voluntary registration, provides only for registration of ownership with an absolute, or good, title.  While it may be anticipated that in the majority of <Col N="1137" /> applications for first registration under the new compulsory provisions, the owners will be able to show a good title to their property, it is inevitable that some doubtful or defective titles will occur, the registration of which with an absolute title would prove difficult and troublesome if not impossible.</P>
    <P>To enable titles of this kind to be registered in compulsory areas without undue difficulty or delay, it will be necessary to amend existing registration procedure so as to provide for the registration of ownership with qualified or possessory titles.  Suitable provisions to this effect are contained in sections 33 and 40 of the Bill, which relate, respectively, to freehold land and leasehold interests.  These provisions will enable a qualified title to be given where it appears to the Registrar that the title can be established only for a limited period or subject to certain reservations.</P>
    <P>Where neither an absolute nor a qualified title can be given, the Registrar will be able to give a possessory title on the basis of such evidence as may be prescribed.  As the name implies, a possessory title will be dependent upon actual occupation of the land, or upon receipt of the rents and profits issuing out of the land, and not necessarily upon a documentary title.  Registration with a possessory title will not prejudice the enforcement of any rights subsisting or capable of arising at the time of registration and, that being so, a purchaser will have to investigate the title prior to registration in the same manner as if the land were unregistered.  Registration with a qualified title will not prejudice the enforcement of rights specifically noted on the register as excepted from the effects of registration.</P>
    <P>In the case of leasehold land it is proposed that registration may also be effected with a good leasehold title. This would be appropriate where the title of the lessee to the leasehold, as distinct from the title of the lessor to the freehold, is sound and can be approved by the Registrar.  The precise effect of registration with each class of title is indicated in sections 37 to 39 and 44 to 47.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> It is, of course, the aim that, in due course, all titles on the registers should be absolute ones, and machinery is, therefore, provided in section 50 for the conversion of qualified and possessory titles into absolute or good leasehold titles and for the conversion of good leasehold titles into absolute titles.  The process of conversion may be carried out either in consequence of the production of additional evidence as to the title, or as a result of the lapse of time, or both.  The Registrar is to be given a general power to convert where he is satisfied as to the title.  In addition, in the case of urban land registered with a possessory title, there will, after 15 years, be automatic conversion of the title on the registration of a transfer or other disposition for value.  The period of 15 years is selected as an adequate and appropriate period within which third parties may substantiate claims or by the expiration of which defects in title may be deemed to be cured.  By comparison, the ordinary limitation period for actions to recover land is 12 years.</P>
    <P>In the case of land bought out under the Land Purchase Acts, that is to say, most rural land, special arrangements are provided in section 50 to expedite the elimination from the registers of the notices of equities to which the bulk of such land is subject.  I should perhaps explain, for the benefit of Deputies who are not familiar with the subject, that land bought out under the Land Purchase Acts is registered subject to equities because, owing to the large number of transactions under the Acts, the Land Commission cannot and do not examine the title of a purchaser to his previous tenant interest in the land.  Instead, the fee simple vested in him by the Commission is deemed to be a graft on his previous interest and he is registered &ldquo;subject to equities&rdquo;, that is to say, subject to the rights of any other persons having claims against this previous interest. Existing law provides for the cancellation of the notice of equities on application by the registered owner, but the number of cancellations effected annually is relatively small and it is estimated that about threequarters of all existing registered holdings are <Col N="1139" /> subject to equities.  Indeed, this is one of the main shortcomings in our present system of registration of title, as the existence of the notice of equities throws on persons dealing with the registered owner the onus of investigating the title prior to first registration.</P>
    <P>I consider it desirable, even essential, for the satisfactory operation of the system, that equities should be cleared from the registers as quickly as possible.From an administrative point of view, the ideal solution would be the completely automatic cancellation of all equity notices in cases where the land has been registered for, say 30 years, which is the extended limitation period for actions to recover land in cases of disability.  I have carefully considered the possibility of adopting such a solution but reluctantly decided to reject the idea on the grounds that it could lead to injustice, and even serious injustice, in many cases.  For example, the person whose ownership is registered subject to equities may be a tenant for life under a settlement.  The interest of the remainderman in such a case is protected by the equity notice, and automatic cancellation of the notice would mean that he would be deprived of his lawful property.  The equity notice may also cover restrictive covenants created before first registration, such as covenants against objectionable trades in a residential area. These covenants operate for the benefit of other property in the district.  If the equity notice were automatically cancelled, a purchaser would not be bound by the covenants and would be able adversely to affect the property rights of his neighbours.  On full consideration, therefore, I thought it better not to provide for absolutely automatic cancellation.</P>
    <P>In my view, the best alternative way of dealing with the problem is that proposed in subsection (3) of section 50 of the Bill.  Briefly, what that subsection provides is that there should be semi-automatic cancellation, at the discretion of the Registrar, in two types of cases; first, on the occasion of a change of ownership or the creation of a charge where the land has been registered for more than 30 years, and, <Col N="1140" /> secondly, on the occasion of a transfer or charge for value where there has been a previous registered transfer for value more than 12 years before.  In the first case, the period of 30 years is selected because, as I have said, it is the maximum limitation period for actions to recover land, being the period applicable in the case of disability.The second type of case is so devised as to ensure that the title will have undergone two careful and independent scrutinies, separated by a period adequate, in the ordinary course, to cure any latent defects.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that, under these proposals, cancellation of the equity notice will be virtually automatic in the great majority of cases, while, at the same time, the Registrar will have discretion to leave the notice undischarged in the exceptional case where it appears to him that cancellation would cause injustice to a third party.  I believe that these provisions will represent a considerable improvement in the present law and that they will result in a steady and significant reduction in the number of equity notices.</P>
    <P>In addition to establishing machinery for the extension of compulsory registration, Part III of the Bill provides for various amendments of registration procedure and of the substantive law relating to registration.  The object of these amendments is to cure defects, which, over the years, have manifested themselves in the existing law and generally to improve the system of registration of title so as to enable it to cope with the conditions expected to be encountered in registering urban property.  The proposed amendments, are, for the most part, technical in character and do not involve any substantial matters of principle.  I propose, therefore, to refer very briefly only to a few of the more important ones.</P>
    <P>Section 49 relates to the acquisition of registered land by adverse possession against the registered owner and proposes to give the Registrar the power to register a squatter as owner without a court order declaring his title.  I consider that there is no good reason why persons who have acquired a title to registered land by adverse possession <Col N="1141" /> should be forced to incur the trouble and expense of applying to the court for an order declaring their title.  Under existing law, cases based on adverse possession are regularly dealt with and decided by the Registrar on applications for first registration and for the discharge of equities and where the personal representatives of a deceased registered owner claims to have acquired by possession the shares of the other next-of-kin.  In effect, section 49 proposes that what are at present known as &ldquo;section 52&rdquo; applications will in future be made to the Registrar and thus dealt with in the same manner as the other cases of adverse possession to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of section 61 proposes to relieve the Registrar of the responsibility of ensuring that the personal representatives of a deceased registered owner are acting correctly and within their powers under an assent or transfer.  At present, on the production of an assent or transfer from the personal representative it is the practice of the Registrar to examine the will of the deceased in order to satisfy himself that its terms are being properly interpreted and implemented.  If the owner died intestate the Registrar similarly satisfies himself that the rules of intestate succession are being observed.</P>
    <P>I consider that it is not appropriate that the Registrar should have any responsibility for ensuring that the personal representatives are acting correctly in such cases.  His position <i>vis-à-vis</i> personal representatives should be the same as that of a purchaser.A purchaser from personal representatives is not concerned with the terms of the will of the deceased or the observance of the rules of intestate succession but is entitled to assume that the personal representatives are acting correctly in selling the property of the deceased.  It is no part of the duty of the Registrar to supervise the administration of estates; and if a disposition of registered land is made which is not in accordance with the terms of the will or the rules of intestacy the responsibility must be solely that of the personal representatives.</P>
    <P>Section 81 provides that a right of <Col N="1142" /> residence in or on registered land, whether a general right of residence on the land or an exclusive right of residence in or on part of the land, shall be deemed to be personal.  This provision is designed to cure the anomalous situation resulting from a majority decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the <i>National Bank v. Keegan</i> [1931] I.R. 344, in which it was held that an exclusive right of residence, such as a right to the exclusive use of a particular room or rooms in a dwelling house, conveyed an equitable life estate in the property, entitling the grantee, for example, to let the rooms to strangers.  In the vast majority of cases this would be quite contrary to the intentions of the parties.</P>
    <P>The accuracy of registered titles will continue to be guaranteed by the State. Thus, section 118 of the Bill provides for the payment of compensation by the State in respect of loss incurred by registered owners and others as a result of official errors in registration. Paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of this section is a new provision and provides that a person who suffers loss by reason of the inaccuracy of any office copies of a register or registry map, or of documents or plans filed in the Land Registry, shall also be entitled to compensation.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the devolution of registered land on the death of the registered owner and the rules of beneficial succession to such land where the registered owner dies intestate.  The provisions of this Part are mainly for the purpose of consolidation.  In relation to succession on intestacy, however, an important change is proposed in section 109 which provides that all registered land shall descend as personalty to the next-of-kin.This will chiefly affect freehold land in urban areas when it becomes registered under the new compulsory provisions.  Instead of, as at present, descending as realty to the heir at law, it will, under the new proposals, be distributed amongst the next-of-kin.Existing compulsorily registered land already descends in this manner.  I may say that Ireland is among the last of the countries of the <Col N="1143" /> Western hemisphere to maintain any vestige of the old feudal system of descent to the heir.  The system has been abolished in the Six Counties, in Britain and in the United States.  I have recently obtained the approval of the Government for a scheme for a comprehensive Administration of Estates and Wills Bill which will <i>inter alia,</i> provide for the complete assimilation in this country of the law respecting real and personal property, so that all realty, whether registered or unregistered, will devolve and be distributed as personalty.  In the meantime, I am proposing that the change should be effected under this Bill as respects all registered land.</P>
    <P>So much for the provisions of the Bill itself.  I should like to refer now, for a moment, to the organisation which will be responsible for administering the provisions of the new legislation, namely, the Land Registry.  To enable the Registry to cope with the additional work which will arise as a result of the extension of compulsory registration it will be necessary to augment the existing staff&mdash;legal, mapping and clerical&mdash;in the central office and to provide additional accommodation. Plans for this purpose are already in hand.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunately true that, in the past, transactions in the Land Registry have tended to be subject to delays&mdash; in many instances very considerable and, I have no doubt, very frustrating delays.  I want to emphasise, however, that these delays have been due to shortage of staff and other administrative factors and not to any defect in the system of registration of title.  It must, of course, be appreciated that registration of a title in the Land Registry can never be effected as expeditiously as the registration of a deed in the Registry of Deeds.  In the one case an examination and investigation of title has to be carried out by the Registry staff; in the other, all that is involved is the filing of a document. Nevertheless, I am very conscious of the fact that an improvement in administration in the Land Registry is essential, and I have already had arrangements put in hand to have the <Col N="1144" /> staffing and accommodation problems effectively dealt with.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I am glad to be able to say that, as a result of improvements carried out within the past 12 months or so, there has been an appreciable reduction in the length of time taken to handle registration business.  I can assure the House that I will not be content until the Registry is operating at maximum efficiency and an expeditious service is being provided throughout the full range of the Registry's activities.  It is my intention to ensure also that the organisation of the Registry will be brought up to and maintained at a pitch adequate to enable it to cope with the increased volume of business anticipated as a result of the extension of compulsory registration.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the cost of operating the Land Registry is at present recoverable in the form of registration fees and the net charge on public funds is not significant.  The existing policy of, so far as possible, fixing Land Registry fees at such a level as to make the Registry self-supporting will be continued under the new legislation and, indeed, this policy finds expression in Section 14 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes suggested that the fees are unreasonable and excessive. This criticism is, in my opinion, completely unfounded, as the following example chosen at random will serve to show.  In the case of a typical suburban dwelling-house the market value of which is, say, £3,000 and in respect of which the poor law valuation is, let us suppose, £30, the fee on first registration in the Land Registry would be £4 5s. 0d.  On a subsequent registered transfer on sale the fee would be £12 6s. 0d.  I think most Deputies will agree that by no stretch of the imagination can either of these fees be said to be excessive, either in relation to the value of the property or having regard to the advantages accruing to the parties from the registration of the title.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered, also, that registration fees constitute only one of the items going to make up the costs and outlay involved in the transfer of <Col N="1145" /> property and that, when account is taken of legal fees, the total cost of transferring registered property&mdash; assuming the title to be an absolute or good one&mdash;is appreciably lower than in the case of unregistered property.  In the case of the house mentioned in the example which I have already given the total costs involved in the transfer on sale, that is to say, the combined costs of the vendor and purchaser, would be of the order of £202 if the property were registered as compared with £266 if unregistered.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that if the legislative proposals embodied in this Bill are adopted they will constitute a farreaching and valuable reform.  In those areas of Britain in which compulsory registration has been introduced &mdash; about one quarter of the country &mdash; it has been operating satisfactorily; and there is no reason to doubt that a system that has already proved itself in our own country over the past seventy years can be extended successfully here also.  The late Mr. Justice Madden, who was the author and sponsor of the Act of 1891, once stated that &ldquo;in order that any system of registration of title should be efficient and successful...it must be compulsory, not optional&rdquo;.  Land is vital to the needs of society and to the economic activity of the nation.  It is essential, therefore, that titles to land should be clear and certain and that land should be capable of being transferred in a cheap, simple and secure manner. What this Bill proposes to do is to extend to the whole country the system which has proved itself superior for all these purposes, namely, registration of title.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, in many respects, a technical and difficult one and it is for that reason that I decided to issue a longer and more detailed explanatory memorandum than is usually called for in the case of Bills coming before the House.  Of its very nature the measure is one which is more suitable for discussion on Committee Stage, and on that Stage I will, of course, endeavour to furnish any additional assistance which the House may need in dealing in detail with the various provisions.  I may add that I shall <Col N="1146" /> welcome and give careful consideration to any suggestions for the improvement of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can understand this Bill, two principles only are incorporated in it.  One is that it is desirable to consolidate and bring up to date the various enactments dealing with the registering of lands, commencing with the Registration of Title Act, 1891.  Everybody must agree with that principle.  That Act, as far as I can recollect, has been amended once&mdash;by the Registration of Title Act, 1942&mdash;but there have been some judicial decisions in the interpretation of the Act and of the principles to be followed carrying it into effect which have somewhat surprised people&mdash;not because anybody challenges they are correct but because the effect they have had is somewhat apt to suggest that matters have arisen in consequence which were not anticipated in the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second principle which is involved in this Bill is the principle of compulsory registration.  In theory, of course, there can be no possible doubt that it is desirable to have registered land.  Whether the practice lives up to the theory is a matter that is to be considered otherwise.  But the theory of having title to land registered statutorily and with the authority of Government backing is a thing we can all understand and appreciate.  We accept the view of Mr. Justice Madden that for a system of registration to be operative and successful, compulsory registration is essential.  It is clearly an essential prerequisite, and although the existing voluntary provisions in the 1891 Act have been used from time to time&mdash;and I can speak with personal experience of having used them and found them efficacious&mdash;at the same time it is clear they would never be used to the wide extent required if we were to get universal registration.  So far, then, as those two principles are concerned, we agree that this Bill should have a Second Reading.  That does not mean to say, <Col N="1147" /> however, that we do not feel there are ways in which in various matters of detail the effect of the provisions of the Bill could be amended on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to that I might say at this stage, rather than coming back to it later, we in this Party feel this is essentially the type of Bill, like the Companies Bill, that should be considered by a Special Committee.  Every side in this House paid tribute the other day to the manner in which the Special Committee set up to consider the Companies Bill had dealt with that peculiarly difficult and technical Bill. The consideration of that Bill by the Special Committee was most successful in its result and everyone on every side of the House who was on that Committee felt that across the table was the correct way to deal with that matter.  I would urge on the Minister therefore, that when the consideration of the Committee Stage of this Bill comes up, he send it for consideration to a Special Committee.  In any event, it is clear its consideration will be so highly technical in the various clauses that there would be few people in the House with the administrative experience to be able to appreciate what is involved.</P>
    <P>Frankly, in relation to the Special Committee idea, since the Companies Bill was sent to the Special Committee, I have come to the conclusion&mdash;and so have other members of my Party who sat on that Committee&mdash;that, if you are to have a Special Committee on a completely technical Bill such as the Companies Bill or this Bill, it would be wiser and more desirable to have that Special Committee a Joint Committee of both Houses.  It does not seem to make sense to have the examination of a purely technical Bill with no political Party significance dealt with, first, by a Special Committee of the House and then dealt with either by the other House in full meeting or by a Special Committee there.</P>
    <P>It seems, without derogating in any way from the independence, dignity or stature of either House, that if this House deems it desirable to send a Bill to a Special Committee, it should <Col N="1148" /> be made a Special Committee of both Houses and thus have the benefit of total examination in that way.  I hope the Minister will consider sympathetically and accede to that suggestion. There are in the other House many people of technical experience of this kind and it would be of greatest assistance to the closest examination of the Bill that it be sent to a Special Committee where the technical people can examine it, always remembering that the Bill will come back both to this and to the other House for ratification and vetting in any way which members of either House may see fit.</P>
    <P>I will frankly admit that sometimes I feel the technical people are rather inclined not to see the wood for the trees and there is always the danger that examination purely by technical people will lead to some defect that will be detected by a general body of commonsense approach which we see from this side of the House, with the exception of one or two people up there.</P>
    <P>The Minister made certain comments in his remarks on the Bill to which I should like to refer without going into any great detail.  He says in the beginning that the purchaser can use this system of registry with the assurance that dealings of the kind not recorded will be treated as fraudulent and void.  That is not quite accurate.A dealing can be void but it need not necessarily be fraudulent and it is not accurate to class all void dealings as being fraudulent.</P>
    <P>He goes on to talk of equitable mortgage by deposit of title deeds. That is a cheap way to secure temporary accommodation and must be preserved at all costs.  It has been in use over the years and it is vital to ensure that this method will be operative in the future.  The equitable deposit of the land certificate will now be substituted for the deposit of the ordinary title deeds and we must make certain that this will be equally efficacious for registered land as would deposit of documents of title for unregistered land.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to claim as one of the benefits of the Bill that boundaries are marked on the official map <Col N="1149" /> in the Land Registry.  It is equally true that these boundaries are not definite and conclusive and although he says that the identity of any registered land is established from the particulars in the register and a plan on the relevant registry map, we must face the fact that these are not conclusive.  I am in some doubt as to whether the present system of mapping in relation to the Land Registry of the congested areas is such as to enable registration to be satisfactorily operative in urban areas. I am convinced that in the rural areas where you do not get into difficulties in matters of feet or yards, it is a simple and easy matter.  Where you get into difficulties in urban areas and where you have instances as in O'Connell Street, where the ground floor is in one leasehold ownership and the three floors above it in a different ownership, I am not sure that the device envisaged here is the right system to cope with that.</P>
    <P>It may well be that we may have to adopt in our detailed examination of this measure a slightly different approach towards the congested urban areas from that to be made to the wide open spaces of rural Ireland.  If we ever get to the stage to which they have got in France where the ordinary flat is not rented but bought, we can understand the position that may arise here.  The system of registration and mapping that would then be required here is something that needs considerable further investigation.  It is with regard to that kind of problem and its examination that the particular machinery of a Special Joint Committee which I have suggested would be most apposite.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong if I accepted without reserve the remarks the Minister makes about a purchaser safely accepting a title reference.  That is going too far.  In relation to any transaction for the purchase of a house or the sale of premises, the initial examination of the title is only one part of the operation.  It would be erroneous for the Minister to lead people to believe that the examination of the title is the only thing involved in that deal.  The negotiations in relation to the price are matters which require just <Col N="1150" /> as much skill and every bit as much honesty on the part of the agents and solicitors for the different parties as the examination of the title.  It has always seemed a peculiar thing to me that if I am instructed to buy a property for a client and to use my best endeavours to buy it at the lowest price, the lower I go and the more successful I am as far as my client is concerned, the smaller is the fee which I am entitled by law to charge.  That is neither here nor there in regard to this Bill but it would be wrong to think that the examination of title is the only thing involved.</P>
    <P>There is a system in operation outside Ireland, the Yorkshire Registry System and I do not know if the minister has any reports on the operations of that registration system.  If he has, I would ask him to make them available to those who are interested, just as I would ask him to make available the report of the Reid Committee for Scotland to which he has referred.</P>
    <P>In referring to compulsory registration, the Minister suggested, as is accurate, that section 24 gave him power to bring compulsory registration into individual counties, county boroughs or parts thereof.  I want to suggest that the last power given to him there is all wrong.  It is absolutely essential that there be complete and absolute certainty where compulsory registration operates.  The county and the county borough are administrative units which everybody knows and which everybody understands.  It would be entirely wrong to bring compulsory registration into operation in part of a county or part of a county borough because there would never be the certainty amongst the people as to whether the place was or was not within the part or without the part.  We all understand what administrative counties and what administrative county boroughs are.</P>
    <P>I am not clear what the Minister means by a &ldquo;State-sponsored body&rdquo;. Statutory Authority seems to me to exclude most of what we consider are State-sponsored bodies.  For example, Bord Fáilte is, I think, a board established by an enactment and I think it comes within the definition of statutory <Col N="1151" /> authority under paragraph (e) of the definition on page 8, section 3.</P>
    <P>There is the special Tourist Traffic Act by which Bord Fáilte was established.CIE would be another.  It seems to me that most of the State-sponsored bodies were established under the Companies Acts.  Bodies appointed under the Companies Act, where the Minister for Finance may under the company's Articles of Association have the right to appoint the directors, and so on, and where he owns all the share capital, do not seem to me included in that definition of a statutory authority.  I do not speak with any dogmatic emphasis, but if I am correct then something more than the definition of statutory authority should be included there.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand the provision in relation to qualified title and possessory title to which the Minister referred.  At present, registrations do take effect under a possessory title and, when proper proof is adduced to the Registrar, they are registered as full owners.  Therefore, why there should be that change for the worse, such as the Minister has outlined, I am not quite clear.</P>
    <P>Equally, I am not at all sure why there should be a difference between the 12 years' ordinary limitation period for actions and the 15 years provided in the Bill.  In relation to that, I agree entirely that the Minister is right in not wiping out the equities by some automatic slash as he indicated he considered and as he indicated he has abandoned.  Under subsection (3) of section 50 there will be a provision in the future that one can go in advance of a deal and ascertain by some means of notice or otherwise whether the Registrar will make a registration.</P>
    <P>As I read it, the Registrar may decide to register and waive certain aspects.  If there were a provision by virtue of which a person could come in and serve the notice&mdash;notices that would be operative&mdash;before the actual application for registration of the transfer then it would be a cheap and efficient way of dealing with many difficult titles in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> As I read the section, it can become operative after the transfer and purchase money is paid, which is not what we require.  Equally, the position of the <i>National Bank v. Keegan</i> is not what was intended and it would create very great hardships.</P>
    <P>The Minister has thrown some scorn on the old feudal system of descent to the heir.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission spend their time preventing holdings from being subdivided.  Part of the work of the Land Commission, particularly in the congested areas, is to build up holdings to economic level.  Whether it be the eldest son, the eldest son-in-law, or any child, there is a lot to be said for one person and only one person succeeding to the small farm&mdash; perhaps with certain obligation to pay out the remainder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I want to make the point there in certain respects that there was some sense in having one heir alone to a farm because the average farm in Ireland can support only the one person.If we provide, as I think perhaps we have to provide, that it must be treated as personalty always and must be divided, therefore, it will mean, in the pattern that exists&mdash;because people will not make their wills when they should do it&mdash;that part of the work of the Land Commission may be undone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the Minister referred to two things on which I shall touch briefly. One is in relation to delays in the Land Registry.  As one who has considerable experience as a Deputy and <Col N="1153" /> in my profession of the Land Registry I consider myself lucky to find in that Government office people with the courtesy, civility and anxiety to help the general public as we find there. They are always prepared to take out of turn any case where one can put forward a genuine argument that expedition is necessary.  However, it should not be necessary to do that.</P>
    <P>It is quite outrageous that conditions in the Land Registry are such, notwithstanding the Herculean efforts made by people there to catch up from time to time, that there must be six months' delay in a simple registration. The Minister says that in the past month things have improved but certainly up to three months ago a delay of six months in registrations where there was nothing untoward in the application was quite usual and was purely because of shortage of staff and accumulation of work.  Equally, it is utterly unreasonable to have any delay whatever in the provision of a copy of a document or copy maps, now that we have reached the age of photographic reproduction such as that which I think was used to produce copies of the Minister's speech today. There should be no reason why a copy folio should not be made available, with proper photographic means of reproduction, at the outside within three days.  I believe it should be made available within 48 hours.  So far as a map is concerned, there is a little more involved but it should not be beyond the wit of those who are interested in photographic reproduction to provide a scheme that would make provision of Land Registry maps a matter of easy, speedy delivery.  I say that in full knowledge of what happens and of the efforts made to meet special cases for Deputies, solicitors and the general public.  It cannot be allowed to go on as it is.  If it does, the system of compulsory registration we are considering here is an absolute farce.</P>
    <P>As regards the costs the Minister mentions, I think I could produce certain cases which show that costs work out in an entirely different way. The position regarding fees in the Land Registry has improved somewhat <Col N="1154" /> by the rationalisation done some years back but again what happens to some degree is that the fees charged by the Land Registry do take up, if you like, some fees that would otherwise be paid to solicitors.  So far as that is concerned certainly nobody would make any case against the Bill on that ground but it should be the aim of those who are working this compulsory registration to ensure that a certain, easy and reasonably cheap system is devised in regard to titles throughout the land.  That is a matter of administration.  It does not affect the general principles that I have mentioned of first bringing the 1891 legislation up to date and providing some method of compulsory registration in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not intervene at any great length as this is primarily a Bill for Committee Stage but I should like to endorse what Deputy Sweetman says about the system of copying documents in the Land Registry.  Not infrequently solicitors receive back from the Land Registry a bundle of different-sized copy documents varying from the size of a small envelope to a large brief-size paper.  The result is that these are pinned together by the meanest possible staple and it means that some very important documents not infrequently get mislaid.</P>
      <P>They are extremely difficult to read and even more difficult to manage.  It is to be hoped that if the Land Registry has to expand, as indeed it must, the most modern photographic equipment would be available.  I suppose it would be undesirable to mention any particular photographic equipment; it might savour of advertising that particular equipment but the system used to copy the Minister's speech is certainly much preferable and produces a far more legible copy than the antiquated system which obviously is operated in the Land Registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one of the High Courts, one judge has such an aversion to negative copies of documents, white print on black background, that he absolutely prohibits them in his court.  There is a certain amount of reason in this <Col N="1155" /> objection.  They are extremely difficult to read, even if the original is well produced.  Not infrequently documents and correspondence produced by the Land Registry in their original form are difficult enough but when the Land Registry will only produce to solicitors a white on black copy it makes the work still harder.  I hope, in the interests of everyone who avails of their services, that they will introduce the most modern photographic equipment and expedite the issue of documents as Deputy Sweetman suggests.</P>
    <P>We are aware that a number of branches of the Service are having difficulty in getting legal personnel to assist them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We may have to offer the Deputy a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be that the difficulties in recent times are due to the unwillingness of the Department of Finance to give to the legal profession remuneration equivalent to what they can obtain in private activities outside. If the State is going to take on itself the burden of examining title which does not at present lie on it, certainly so far as certain property is concerned, it must have a much greater legal staff.  I hope, therefore, there will be no undue delay on the part of the Department of Finance in agreeing to additional remuneration if necessary to attract members of the legal profession because they would need to be in there and familiar with the work of the Land Registry and registration of titles long before the flood of new applications for registration comes when this Bill is being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is such a large amount of arrears in the Land Registry at present, notwithstanding whatever speeding-up that the Minister and the profession are aware of, that staff could be well occupied now in just clearing the decks of all arrears.  It would be a great thing if, when the new system of registration comes into operation, it could be said that they were up to date at the time of inauguration of the new Act and that there were no arrears.  That is a goal I hope the Minister and the <Col N="1156" /> Department will endeavour to achieve.</P>
    <P>It is not without some misgivings that the legal profession view this Bill. The Registry of Deeds is an old world institution which has preserved a great deal of the old world courtesy and efficiency which is, unfortunately, lacking in the younger bureaucratic bodies. The legal profession are well aware of the difference in approach between the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry.  I do not know if it is the cold marble tiles of the Land Registry that have frosted the disposition of officials towards the public but certainly it lacks and has always lacked the warmth, charm and encouragement that have always been found in the Registry of Deeds.  Perhaps it is something for social scientists to study; certainly it is something of which the legal profession are keenly aware.</P>
    <P>I suppose some of the staff of the Registry of Deeds will be transferred to the Land Registry when the new system comes into operation.  I can only hope that the staff in the Land Registry will show a desire to assist rather than make things difficult as the position is in the Land Registry at present.  Those who will have the duty of examining titles should meet the wishes of the people who complete deeds and submit them rather than try to impose on the public their own particular whims and fancies.  That is what has happened in the past and it has delayed the work of the Land Registry which was introduced to expedite legal reference and which has had in many cases the reverse effect. While I make these general observations we wish this new idea well and the Minister may be assured he will get every co-operation and assistance from the legal profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say briefly before Questions that I am very grateful for the manner in which the two Deputies who have spoken have received this measure?  I shall certainly consider the question of the Select Committee as suggested.  I do not intend to reply at any length to the various points raised by Deputy Sweetman, except to say that I agree fully with him and with Deputy Ryan regarding the necessity for efficiency in the Land Registry.  Indeed, the <Col N="1157" /> whole purpose and object of this Bill will be defeated unless we can provide an efficient Land Registry that will fulfil all our requirements.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman mentioned the Reid Committee report.  The report was, of course, published by the Stationery Office in London and we will certainly make a copy available to the Deputy.  It is desirable, I think, that we should retain the power to bring a whole county, or portion of a county, within the ambit of compulsory registration and, in that regard, we could avail ourselves of the electoral area as a unit.  There should not be any difficulty about that.  The other points raised will be gone into fully on Committee Stage and I shall, therefore, leave them until that Stage is reached.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that a hospital could not be built in this area unless the necessary funds were provided by the Dublin Health Authority.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the consideration of this matter, it is necessary to bear in mind that the primary cause of cancer has not yet been discovered.  For some years there has been considerable emphasis on the correlation of cigarette smoking and lung cancer.  More recently researches appear to indicate that atmospheric pollution plays a greater part than had earlier been established.  It is possible, however, that cigarette smoking and air pollution are only aggravating factors.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government has been given comprehensive powers in Section 10 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962 to control atmospheric pollution by compulsion.The Minister for Health has not coercive powers in relation to the control of cigarette smoking and I do not consider that it would be desirable that I should seek them.  The decision to smoke or not to smoke is a personal one, to be taken by the individual.  The danger of cigarette smoking has been pointed out innumerable times in Dáil Éireann by me and by other Deputies and has been the subject of considerable publicity in the press.  As a result, I think it is correct to say that the decision of each individual in relation to smoking has been taken in the light of knowledge of the inherent danger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is satisfied that milk producers are sufficiently compensated financially to ensure that adequate milk will be available to meet the demands that are emerging on the world markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that milk producers like producers of any other commodity would like to have higher prices if they could get them. I do believe, however, that the treatment of producers so far in our circumstances has been reasonable.  The <Col N="1162" /> steady increase in milk production over recent years surely affords some evidence to support this view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, no doubt, seen the statement made by the secretary of An Bord Bainne in which he said that markets were secured and it was possible production might not be there to meet them.  Has the Minister any further statement to make on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>While acknowledging that it is a good move on the part of the Minister, does he not consider it is a little late in view of the fact that the markets obtainable may not be met by the present milk production within the period?  The Minister has no answer to that, apparently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to wheat of the 1963 harvest.As announced on 10th September last, arrangements have been made for An Bord Gráin to purchase from millers and others dried feed wheat of the 1963 harvest at a price of £23 5s. per ton on 31st December next.</P>
      <P>Unmillable wheat of the 1963 harvest may be disposed of by millers at their own discretion or held for sale to An Bord Gráin on 31st December next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it possible that the millers, while rejecting that wheat, <Col N="1163" /> could possibly sell it to countries, which have been seeking wheat in recent months, at millable prices?  If that is the case, has the Minister any control whatever over the situation from the point of view of protecting Irish farmers who grow wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, control over the export and I think the danger visualised, as it were, by the Deputy can be watched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us if he realises that in recent weeks there has been a demand for wheat, and, therefore, would he not consider it possible that millers could reject wheat sent in by Irish farmers and subsequently sell that at a remunerative price to the detriment of the primary producer, the Irish farmer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>What can they do?  Would the Minister indicate what defence the Irish farmer has if his wheat is rejected?  Is there anything to stop its being sold overseas as millable wheat, if the millers decide to do so?</P>

      <P>I agree this would be very desirable and I should like to see it achieved.  May I say that in answering supplementary questions last week on this subject I said that on receipt <Col N="1167" /> of the accounts of this company which showed the company to be insolvent I immediately applied to the court for the appointment of an auditor to look into the affairs of the company?  I should have said a liquidator, who in fact, was an auditor.  The firm of auditors who were at that time acting for the company were appointed by the directors on 14th February, 1963, to fill a casual vacancy.  It has been suggested by this company that my replies last week could imply that this firm was unsatisfactory and were removed by me on application to the High Court.  I want to say now there was no such implication intended by me nor could it be justified in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware of the widespread public uneasiness regarding the growing political bias of Telefís Éireann, as exemplified by the banning of an interview with Mr. Con Lehane and the portrayal of an anti-Fine Gael and anti-Labour interview on 30th October last; and if he will have steps taken to ensure unbiased presentation of news and views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if, in view of the public disquiet regarding the independence of Telefís Éireann, he will ascertain in accordance with section 26 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 (i) who decided to withdraw the recent edition of <i>An Fear agus a Scéal</i>, and (ii) at what time on the evening of the scheduled telecast it was decided not to show the programme, in view of the fact that at 6.30 the continuity announcer reminded viewers to watch <i>An Fear agus a Scéal</i> at 10.30 p.m. that evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to <Col N="1171" /> take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any public disquiet of the kind suggested in these questions and I do not, therefore, see the need for any special action on my part.</P>
      <P>I naturally regard it as important that the injunctions of the Broadcasting Authority Act about the objectivity and impartiality of public affairs programmes should be strictly observed.In practice, however, it is sometimes difficult to do this in a fashion that will do justice to the event or subject being discussed and will at the same time satisfy everybody, particularly those who are closely involved.  I know this only too well from the criticisms I receive from time to time from all Parties in the House including my own.  This may well be a fair indication that Radio Éireann is endeavouring genuinely to meet its responsibilities.  I think it is, and I can only encourage them to continue to ensure that programmes dealing with matters of public controversy are as well balanced as possible.</P>
      <P>The decision not to broadcast the edition of <i>An Fear agus a Scéal</i> in which Mr. Con Lehane was interviewed was taken by Radio Éireann on its own initiative for reasons which were given in a statement issued by the Director-General.  I do not feel that it would be proper for me to question the level or the time at which this particular decision was taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that fair play is not understood in the Fianna Fáil philosophy, would the Minister not have regard to the obligation: do unto others as he would wish others to do unto him, because a day will come when others will be in control of Government in this country and they may be tempted to adopt the mean type of biased presentation of news and views which he is standing over?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have due regard to my own obligations under the Act.  The Deputy has expressed his opinion in respect of one programme; there are other people who have a different <Col N="1172" /> opinion altogether about that programme.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs say if he was aware beforehand of the ill-mannered and biased comments which were presented to the country through Telefís Éireann on the night of an important vote here and if he considers that it was fair that only one aspect of a political question should be put to the country on that occasion?</P>

      <P>If the Minister states that the programme is a matter for Telefís Éireann and not one for him, then I take it he is not aware of the smear that was used in the broadcast of 30th October and, therefore, he should take immediate steps to <Col N="1173" /> acquaint himself with the language used there.  A partisan, ignorant and brusque interview was given lambasting one political Party and allowing nobody else to be present to defend that Party.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three or four matters to which I wish to direct the attention of the House in connection with this Estimate.  One is the deplorable situation that has arisen in connection with housing.  About that, there has been much talk and discussion, but the fundamental fact to which this House should have regard <Col N="1185" /> is contained in the <i>Statistical Abstract, 1962</i> in which on page 204 is set out that between the years 1955, 1956 and 1957, there were 31,326 new houses built with State aid, with the result that we were told there were too many houses in Dublin and not sufficient tenants to fill them.  That is a fact which I recall with pride.  There are those who have sought to make it a reproof of the Government of which I was a member, but I accept it as our principal glory and I put that in comparison with the record over the past three years of the performance of the Government, for 1960, 1961 and 1962, in which 17,416 houses were built, a little more than half the number built in the corresponding three years.</P>
      <P>That is the reason the houses fell down on the people in Dublin, some of whom were killed and others of whom experienced the indignity of having their families broken up and placed in institutions because we had not roofs to put over their heads. I approve of any measure that is being taken by housing authorities to remedy that detestable situation but I cannot help wondering what the members of the Government Party would have said if in our time we had been reduced to installing families in the city of Dublin in caravans rather than leave them sitting in the streets.  This I declare to the House is the result of the considered policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>It was an economist's illusion that the national investment programme should be diverted from housing to other ends which were described as economic and self-liquidating.  It is an economist's illusion that you can have the right kind of progress in this or in any other country by leaving some of your neighbours in virtual destitution, and a family without a roof is destitute.  It is a shocking thing that as of today there are thousands of families in this city living in condemned dwellings, which frequently consist of one room, because they have been waiting for years to get accommodation from the local authority, for which they are prepared to pay.</P>

    <Col N="1186" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And in many cases their applications are refused on the ground that they have not got a large enough family to come within the category of persons worthy of immediate consideration.  That is a shameful record and it is one for which this Government should hang their head in shame before the people.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that there can be no enduring or desirable progress in this country based on the failure to house our people.  I am certain that we were right to make that a first charge upon our resources.  I am certain that we enjoyed a unique distinction in Europe and the world in 1957 when there were people found to say that we had built too many houses.  I wish we had the same boast to make to-day.  But we have joined the ranks of some other European countries who prefer skyscrapers to homes for their people.  We preferred homes for our people.</P>
      <P>I remember when the Minister for Local Government was first adumbrating the scheme for the 30 mile per hour limit, he said that in the initial stages, it was inevitable that errors of judgment would be made in the placing of the signs.  I do not think any reasonable member of the House would seek to charge him with <i>laches</i> in that matter because I think it is true to say it had to be settled by a process of trial and error.  I would suggest to him now that the time is overdue for some even <i>ad interim</i> review, even if he cannot yet undertake a comprehensive review of all the signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very understandable thing has happened.  There was consultation between the local authority officers, the Garda Síochána and probably representative people in particular areas, small towns and villages throughout rural Ireland and that has resulted in some cases in the 30 mile per hour limit sign being put at a distance quite unreasonably far out the road.  I think I know how that happened.  When they went to determine the site it was first put at the end of the village and then somebody said that there was a woman living there, that she had seven children and that it would be better to put the sign a little farther out the road.  Then someone else might <Col N="1187" /> have said that there were two families living on the other side of the road, that there were six children in one and eight in the other, and if those houses were not included in the speed limit area, there would be a row.  Eventually, the sign was erected at a distance of another perch out the road.  That process went on until in some cases there is a sign a quarter or half a mile outside a relatively traffic-free village or town.</P>
    <P>That is an inconvenience that reasonable people would bear with for a reasonable time, understanding that to get uniformity in the initial stages was virtually impossible, but it has given rise to this evil, that in many cases the signs are so irrationally placed that people are getting into the habit of ignoring them.  If they start ignoring them in any irrational location, the tendency develops to ignore them pretty generally.  If that should be allowed to continue unremedied, great harm will be done to the whole attempt to limit speed in built-up areas and an early opportunity should be taken to remedy obvious anomalies.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask me how is he to determine what are obvious anomalies.He could make it known that anyone who took the view that there were obvious anomalies should communicate with his Department and he would have these investigated and he could invest somebody with the authority to make <i>ad interim</i> adjustments of the placing of these signs. Otherwise, damage may be done to the whole concept of the speed limit and it may be very difficult to recover the general atmosphere of popular approval which this 30 mile per hour limit in towns and cities evoked.</P>
    <P>I know some Deputies have said that in the city of Dublin the 30 mile an hour limit has given rise to a sense of frustration and that has resulted perhaps in making people more accident-prone than they would otherwise be.  I am not qualified to speak with the same authority of conditions in Dublin as I am of conditions in rural Ireland because all the driving I do in Dublin is done in a very restricted <Col N="1188" /> area in the centre of the city.  I imagine there may be some sense of frustration during rush hours on parts of the Stillorgan Road, the Dalkey Road and the main arteries leaving the city but I have no doubt whatever that in general the speed limitation restrictions are a good thing and, provided we can avoid their becoming generally disregarded, they will make some contribution to a reduction in the number of road accidents.</P>
    <P>It is in regard to that problem that I want to make another observation. I read recently the report prepared by the commission set up to study driving under the influence of drink.  I have said in this House repeatedly, and I reiterate, that if we really mean to make an effective impact on the road accident record we have got to face the problem, not of the drunken driver &mdash;he is not the real problem.  The fellow who is footless and gets into a car and usually moves off at about five miles an hour is very quickly detected swerving all over the road and can be readily apprehended and brought to book.  The danger is the man who is convinced that he is not under the influence of drink.  He is the man who has taken just enough to persuade himself that he is the best driver in Ireland and he proceeds to show off, not only to his neighbours, but to himself, how good he is and at high speed meets with an accident that is lethal in many cases to himself, in which event the fact that he has had four or five whiskeys before he started on his journey is rarely if ever referred to; or else the accident may be lethal or gravely injurious to a second party.  The problem is how to deal with him.</P>
    <P>I see it suggested that we should have blood tests.  Here again I want to speak a word of moderate counsel.  I am all in favour of what is popularly known as the breathaliser, if that is a reasonably efficient test.  It does not seem to me to be any unreasonable intrusion&mdash;unreasonable intrusion&mdash;on a citizen's rights if he is arrested and charged with dangerous driving to ask him to breathe into a mouthpiece, but, when we come to the stage of authorising any garda in the country to arrange <Col N="1189" /> to have blood samples taken, then I think we are going pretty far.  Where taking blood samples simply involved pricking the top of a person's finger and drawing a drop of blood, I could conceive that being defended as being of so trivial a nature as not to constitute real trespass on a citizen's person but when you think of inserting a needle into a person's vein and drawing out a syringeful of blood, the plain fact is that one-third of the people asked to undergo that experience will faint. You may think it is very unreasonable for them to faint.  Whether it should be the law of this country that if you are apprehended on suspicion of dangerous driving, you must face a minor surgical operation, simply because you have been charged, is open to question.</P>
    <P>I know the argument can be made that the evil it is sought to remedy is very grave.  I agree.  I think the road accidents situation here is very grave. But I would urge on the Minister that the breathaliser test is in every sense a preferable one.  We should not allow ourselves to be driven to the point of introducing blood tests of the kind envisaged, unless there is no other device available to us to segregate the driver who has too much alcohol from the driver whose judgement is not affected by drink at all.</P>
    <P>The last aspect of that question I want to touch on is this.  The case is made very energetically by well-intentioned people that there is not any standard quantity of alcohol which you can say specifically must affect the judgement of a driver, that one man can take two glasses of whiskey and drive without his judgement being abridged, whereas another man might be materially affected by one glass.  I think we have to take up the position in that regard that that is admitted, and that the breathaliser test, or whatever test is ultimately adopted, will not be a test of drunkenness but a test of consumption, and that people who drive cars must make up their minds that no one must consume more than a certain amount of alcohol.  While we freely acknowledge there is a large number of people who could take that amount of alcohol and be in no sense <Col N="1190" /> drunk, for the common good, it has been determined there are so many people who would be affected by that minimum quantity of alcohol that nobody is to drive a car if he has taken it.</P>
    <P>There are many sensible people here who make it a rule that if they are driving, they do not drink, and if they drink, they do not drive.  I know from my own personal experience, even when I was a student, if four or five of us were going on a night's outing, one of us would &ldquo;go on the wagon&rdquo;.  The rest of us would regard ourselves as free to enjoy any of the entertainment going.  The next night we went out some other fellow would &ldquo;go on the wagon&rdquo; and the first fellow would join the company free to make merry to his heart's content.  I do not think it is an unreasonable stipulation in the present state of traffic on Irish roads to require that people who drive cars will accept that restriction of their freedom to drink. With the present state of our roads, I think it is reasonable to say to people who drive cars: &ldquo;Do not drink until you get home&rdquo;, or &ldquo;If you want to drink, get somebody else to drive.&rdquo; Even for those who do not accept that prudent advice, it is reasonable for the Legislature to say: &ldquo;We are going to fix an arbitrary level of alcohol consumption.&rdquo;  It is not an unreasonable limitation on people's freedom to require that they will observe it if they drive a car on the roads of Ireland.</P>
    <P>My last point is this.  I never tire of congratulating the Minister's staff in the Custom House for their willing readiness to help us all in overcoming difficulties experienced by our constituents in availing of the grants and other facilities in the Department.  But it sometimes occurs to me, when I see the number of letters I have to write to the Department about housing grants and the number which, I find on inquiry, to have been held up as a result of the failure by the grantee to carry out the stipulations required in the notification of approval of his applications, is the grantee sufficiently forewarned of the necessary conditions of a grant being made?</P>
    <P>I find two things coming up continually. <Col N="1191" /> One concerns a nine-inch wall.  You find fellows using seven-inch blocks.  That is a usual error. The difference between a nine-inch block and a seven-inch block cannot be very material in cost.  Yet you continually find country people with reconstruction work done and the grant blocked because they have used a seven-inch block instead of a nine-inch block.  The second problem I continually find is that they build a room on to a house or make some improvement and use either corrugated iron or corrugated asbestos for the roof. You are obliged to go to the unfortunate man, who has spent all the money he had and is now in debt to the builders' supplier or the contractor, and inform him that he will not get any grant if he does not take off the corrugated roof and put on slates or felt.</P>
    <P>If my experience is the experience of many other rural Deputies, I can fairly say to the Minister that there should be some special sticker or something put on the general conditions sent out, which are pretty long and involved, directing the attention of the grantee especially to the fact that there is a minimum size of concrete block which may be used and, secondly, that the material used in the roof must be strictly in accordance with specification and that the pitch of the roof must be in accordance with specification as well.  I believe if the attention of grantees were sufficiently and emphatically directed towards these two stipulations, there would be much less holding up of grants and much less unnecessary correspondence with the Department of Local Government in that respect.</P>
    <P>We have had a long debate on this Estimate.  That is as it should be.  It is an Estimate which affects the livelihood of our people in every part of the country.  If it serves, as I hope it may serve, to make the Government wake up to the disgraceful failure of which they have been guilty in respect of housing, no time spent upon it will have been wasted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJOKeefe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of saying a few words <Col N="1192" /> on this Estimate.  I made a number of unsuccessful efforts over the past couple of weeks to get in, and I must take this opportunity of thanking Deputy Carroll, who by his change of mind and unforgettable action last Wednesday, helped to prolong the temporary life of the Government.</P>
      <P>This debate so far has been more or less concentrated on housing, and the greatest part of the debate on housing was concentrated on housing in Dublin city.  I agree that housing in Dublin city is not alone a matter of major importance but a matter of major urgency.  Deputy Declan Costello stated here that there were over 10,000 families in need of housing in Dublin alone.  I can assure the House that since he made that statement and at the present time that number has gone up to 10,500 by reason of the fact that day after day buildings are being declared dangerous and police orders are being sought for the eviction of families from such houses.  In Dublin Corporation we have some of the finest architects in Europe.  We have some of the finest housing engineers in Europe and we have a town planning officer the equal of whom is not in Europe but notwithstanding all their efficiency and qualifications they are hindered in their efforts to build houses by the go-slow policy introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1957.</P>
      <P>When speaking here some weeks ago, Deputy Sherwin gave the impression that he had housed everybody who had been in dangerous buildings.  While I appreciate that Deputy Sherwin is a very sincere man who believes everything he says to be true, I often wonder does he know what he is speaking about.  I think there are more families now in dangerous buildings than have got accommodation out of them.</P>

      <P>While I do not expect that houses can be built overnight, <Col N="1193" /> we should see that small single-roomed flats or two-roomed flats are built so that old age pensioners will have some kind of proper flat offered to them when the homes which they have occupied all their lives are declared dangerous.  I would implore the Minister to do all he possibly can to see that people in that category are provided with proper accommodation in the later years of their lives.  It is not necessary to repeat all that has been said with regard to housing.  That subject has been well covered by Deputies from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look into the question of providing more traffic lights.  I live in the Crumlin area and I have been trying for some years to have lights erected at the junction of Clogher Road and Sundrive Road.  Lights are more urgently needed there than at many of the places where they have been erected. I would ask the Minister to look into the question of providing more traffic lights, particularly on the outskirts of the city.</P>
      <P>I would also ask him to have the number of school wardens increased. The money for their payment comes from his Department and, to that extent he has responsibility.  There is a number of schools where wardens would be most useful and many accidents to children would be avoided if they were appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this debate opened, emphasis has been laid by speakers from the opposite benches on the terrible housing conditions in Dublin.  They have adopted an offensive attitude in an effort to put the Minister and the Government on the defensive.  It is time we all grew up and admitted the facts that are well recorded.  The last speaker mentioned the go-slow policy of 1957 but surely he does not want to underestimate the intelligence of the people? It is quite evident that you cannot build houses overnight.  You have to plan for the building of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been associated with housing in rural Ireland since 1932 and I am chairman of a utility society that went into operation on their own when the <Col N="1194" /> first Housing Act was introduced here in 1932 by the former President, Mr. O'Kelly, who was then Minister for Local Government.  The Fine Gael Party would like to forget that they were the Cumann na nGaedheal Party up to 1932 and that in that time never a house was built in any part of Ireland, except in Dublin and Cork. Not a single house was built in rural Ireland.  Now they try to claim credit for all the building that has gone on since 1932 and they claim that Fianna Fáil did nothing.</P>
    <P>However, it does not serve the best interests of the people for either side to be looking for excuses.  We have a problem here and the people are not fools.  You cannot go on creating hysteria all the time.  That has often been tried before but eventually the bubble bursts.  The Minister has stated that a housing survey to date has indicated that 25,000 houses are required and that out of that number, 20,000 are needed in rural Ireland. With that problem facing us in rural Ireland, I think we should let the Dublin people fight out their own battle as to the pros and cons of their own problem.</P>
    <P>Housing in Dublin is a special problem and we should tackle the question of rural housing.  It was very encouraging to hear the Minister state last week that housing grants are to be increased by 50 per cent for farmers whose valuation does not exceed £25. For the first time ever, local authorities will now have power to build houses for small farmers whose valuation does not exceed £5.  That move was received with satisfaction in every part of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I heard a Deputy from the Opposition benches castigate the Government and condemn county managers.  Councillors get what they deserve from managers and <i>vice versa</i>.  I have had some years of experience.  As Chairman of the Limerick County Council for 14 years, I know the ups and downs of housing.  I know exactly what happened in the time of the Coalition Government when the managers went up to the Custom House and were brainwashed and were told to slow up housing.  That cannot be denied, <Col N="1195" /> Deputy Rooney looks at me and says it is not correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It happened.  You wanted money but you could not get it.  That was proved by the failure of your loans.</P>
      <P>The Minister has instructed county managers to prepare a survey of rural housing.  That survey has been prepared but I think it is not as comprehensive as the Minister might like it to be.  Some counties have gone ahead with it, while others have done so only partially.</P>
      <P>Some months ago, Limerick County was selected for a rural survey which was carried out by Dr. Noonan of Maynooth.  In its analysis of the position in County Limerick, and it applies to any county in Ireland, that comprehensive survey points to the drift of the rural population to the big centres and how it might be arrested. The thesis is called the <i>Fourth Interim Report on Social Provision and Rural Centrality in County Limerick</i>.  Dr. Noonan suggests that two very important factors should not be ignored. The first is not to denude the countryside of our rural inhabitants.  Where houses are bad, the people who are deep-rooted there should be rehoused under proper conditions.  Dr. Noonan's second point is to arrest the drift of young people who eventually get married and drift towards the city. That is the great danger threatening rural Ireland at the moment.</P>
      <P>After putting the position as he found it, so to speak, on the dissecting table, Dr. Noonan tried to find a cure or a remedy for what he discovered. In his analysis of the position, he stated his opinion, which I think will be backed very much by sociologists and others who have an interest in this matter that our population must in the future be centralised in and around large towns.  He outlined in his thesis County Limerick with its main towns and suggests what should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Noonan further suggests that in order to keep the people in rural Ireland, even in the centres he has outlined, <Col N="1196" /> we must industrialise those places, at the same time keeping the people as close as possible to their natural home surroundings.  The Minister and his officials in the Custom House may possibly have studied the report by Dr. Noonan.  Limerick County Council held a special meeting to discuss it and we agreed with it in principle.  We believe that in practice it will solve a problem which not alone is a Limerick problem but is one for every county in Ireland.  Therefore, when we erect more houses near those centres I am sure the Minister and his officials will understand what we have in mind.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increased housing grants that he has announced for farmers under £25 valuation, with a sliding scale for people up to £40 valuation, I should like the Minister to clarify this point.  Take people, other than farmers, under the £25 valuation&mdash;say, artisans or tradesmen who would like to build their own homes.  Would they equally qualify for an increased grant like the farmers?  It would be wrong to discriminate against sections of our people.</P>
    <P>It was also very important to hear the Minister state that where you have an acute situation in any part of Ireland where it is hard to get a site for a rural cottage a second cottage may be erected.  That problem is fairly common.  The value of land has increased.  Every acre is valuable to people with small holdings.  Even when a good price is offered, it is often very hard to induce them to sell. We had several cases in the county of making application by resolution to the county manager to have an extra cottage built on an existing cottage site but we were told by our legal adviser that we could not do so.  I understand that other counties were doing so and that when such proposals came before the Minister he had no objection and did not refuse the sanction.  That is good news to us in Limerick.</P>
    <P>At a very rough calculation made since I heard the announcement, I believe that between 40 and 50 such applications have been deferred in the Limerick County Council.  The news, <Col N="1197" /> in itself, is very encouraging.  Whether Dáil representatives or members of local bodies, we are all the time blaming the local authority or the central authority in the Custom House because the housing programme does not meet the demands of people who are getting impatient.</P>
    <P>Many people are looking to the local authority to build houses who could do so themselves if they had just that little bit of initiative.  I have been chairman of a utility society since 1932.  Notwithstanding the fact that our activities were interrupted during World War II we built 487 houses in West Limerick.  Those houses were for people the majority of whom would have had to be housed by a local authority if they had not had that little local initiative backed by the help and co-operation they got from the utility society.</P>
    <P>Let us remember, notwithstanding anything that has happened, that the whole economic climate in this country has changed.  There is a breeze of buoyancy and hope and determination blowing in the hearts and minds of our people.  That breeze is very invigorating at the moment.  Notwithstanding an odd thunderburst, such as occurred last week to try to put people into a state of hysteria, we shall go forward in our housing endeavours. Naturally, people will get a fright because of a thunderburst but that has passed away now and we look forward to a period of solid achievement.</P>
    <P>The people are regrouping and rearranging themselves to carry on as they are satisfied they should, due to the success of the first five year economic plan.  The people expect good leadership where they believe there is security.  Let us forget what Fine Gael did in Coalition and what Fianna Fáil failed to do when they took over.  We have a problem.  It is the problem of harnessing the new buoyancy, hope and confidence in the country springing from the new political structure.  We should try to get the people to do something for themselves instead of asking the local authority or the Department to do it for them.</P>
    <P>As a result of the success of the <Col N="1198" /> first economic plan, there is no town of any size anywhere in the country without a development association which is issuing brochures and advertising in foreign papers and generally trying to attract industry to their part of the country.  That is commendable and something of which we are proud. What we should do with these associations is try to harness their activities and form, inside their own parochial boundaries, utility societies.</P>
    <P>We have many farmers under £5 valuation who will qualify for houses but will have to wait a considerable time for the local authorities to provide them.  If there was a utility society&mdash; we now have two in Limerick where we had only one&mdash;it would do for them what the council should do, help them to get the increased grants and the extended loan from the Land Commission, which is now £500.  This may not be the place or time to congratulate the Minister responsible but this was something I have always fought for: I always thought the loan was too low.</P>
    <P>What have we to offer the £5 to £25 man?  An absolute gift of £1,400 to start to provide himself with a home. We have produced four-room serviced houses in County Limerick, through our utility society, for much less than £1,400.  Contractors may not like to hear that but we can supply proof. I do not want to enter into the discussion that we had about Dublin houses.  I took a neutral attitude and listened carefully to the points made. I have no reputation for throwing bouquets but I am convinced by Deputy Sherwin's argument as against those of other members of Dublin Corporation Housing Committee.  I accept what he said as a true picture of the position and that is as far as my interest goes in the matter.</P>
    <P>I was glad to get an opportunity to intervene in this debate, although I had to wait a couple of days for it because I would not be happy if I did not mention certain things.  When the Minister is replying, I should like to know whether people under £25, valuation, other than farmers, will qualify for the full, maximum grant. It is not part of the Minister's function to suggest to county managers that <Col N="1199" /> they should encourage the creation of utility societies in large towns and villages.  That can be done.  We were doing so well in County Limerick that the manager of the Shannon Development Company wrote to me for particulars about our utility society.</P>
    <P>People may ask what value is the society when one can get the application forms himself.  The type of people we were dealing with had not sufficient capital available to put into the building of a house.  They were not creditworthy as individuals and could not go to a hardware merchant with a specification of materials needed to start building.  As a utility society, we were able to act as guarantors for them.  We encouraged such people and helped them to get loans.  Their grants were increased by £10 because they built through a utility society and by £10 by way of supplementary grant. We were getting them £20 extra grants, in other words, and doing the work for them and all they did was to pay £1 membership fee.  It was a philanthropic work, if you like, and I would like to commend it generally.  I grew up with it myself.  I have a housing mentality and I understand the delays that crop up, no matter how well-intentioned a council or corporation may be.  From the plan to the material execution of it takes at least 1½ years.  You meet difficulties of title and other legal difficulties and a local authority must be particularly careful to make no false step.  They cannot go into a man's land to develop it as a building site without perfect title.</P>
    <P>If I had thought I would be given an opportunity to speak this afternoon, I might possibly have studied the Estimate more comprehensively.  In any case, let us forget what either side did in regard to housing: there should be a common platform between us.  I advise Fine Gael to be honest in their motives and attacks; these will not pay dividends otherwise.  Politically, our people are mature and there is no use trying to confuse them with figures. As sure as you do, that bubble will burst as the bubble that was created in Dublin North-East burst.</P>

      <P>It is amazing that Deputy Collins can address himself to this Estimate in such a way.  I am very grateful to him for the advice he gave.  He knows perfectly well that, whatever advice he gives, it is not just for our advantage.  Once before I heard him give advice and I know exactly what it was worth.  What amazes me, above all, is the way he calmly, and with cool deliberation, advises us to forget the faults of Fianna Fáil, the faults of Fine Gael and of the inter-Party Government&mdash;forget all the faults&mdash;and, then, immediately he goes on to say that from 1922 to 1932 Cumann na nGaedheal never built a house.</P>

Of course, that has been Deputy Collins's technique for the past 15 or 20 years but, prior to that, it was not exactly his technique.  In 1932, it was not his technique.  I listened to Deputy Collins then when he came into this House and his tongue could be very bitter.  I am glad that he has mellowed, like a great many of us, and I hope that he will go on mellowing.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not follow the Deputy in that because, if I did, I might be tempted to say things that are better left unsaid.  We are now dealing with the problem of housing and the administration of local government.It is now 40 years since I was a member of a local authority.  I <Col N="1201" /> parted company with it at a very early stage and it is true to say, therefore, that I have not full knowledge of the activities of local authorities.  Neither am I able to distinguish who is right and who is wrong in relation to the planning and building of houses.  It is quite clear that headway has been made.  Houses have improved, but there are still a great number requiring attention.  It is to these that we must now address ourselves.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that I have once more to come back to my old complaint but, before I utter the words of complaint, I want to say that I have always found the officials of the Department of Local Government, and the Minister himself, whoever he may be, both anxious and willing to help and very considerate.  They do everything within their power to expedite matters. Now, while the complaint I am about to make might be regarded as a reflection on them, it is really only an assertion of the fact that sufficient staff is not available to carry out the work requiring to be done.</P>
      <P>There is still undue delay in paying the first part of the grant either for reconstruction or for the building of a new house.  When one inquires as to the reason for the delay, or makes representations, one finds that the file is out with the inspector, or that he has not reported, or that it has not yet come in.  I have come to the conclusion that there are insufficient inspectors to carry out the work required. Secondly, when the work is completed, there is again undue delay.  The point I want to impress upon the Minister is that the local trader&mdash;I have said all this before&mdash;and the local shopkeeper are still the bankers in 80 per cent of our housing.  They are 80 per cent the bankers for the farmers.  They are carrying far too heavy a load.  It is amazing the number of times traders, and not the applicants, have asked to have representations made to expedite payment.  The position is that the applicant has got the work done, but the trader who supplied the material and the man who did the work are not paid.  I think that could be expedited a bit, if not a great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was struck by the case made by <Col N="1202" /> Deputy Dillon.  There should be some method of drawing the applicant's attention to the special requirements, especially those relating to roofing and the pitch of the roof.  Sometimes contractors or builders tell the applicant a particular kind of roof will pass: &ldquo;It passed in such a place. It was all right on such a house. I carried out that work for such a person, and it was passed.&rdquo;  It is most exasperating then when the applicant finds that the work does not meet the requirements and will not be passed. I think that there should be a red tag on the specification emphasising the work that must be done and stipulating the minimum requirements.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon that the size of the block, whether it be the seven inch block or the nine inch block, should be carefully set out.  When I ask applicants why they did not comply with the specifications and point out the work the inspector said should be done, it is amazing the number of times one gets the answer that the contractor did the work like this in such and such a place and it was passed.  Generally speaking, when one inquires, one finds that the work did not pass in the other case either. Indeed, if it passed in one place and was not passed in another, that would be a reflection on the whole inspection staff.  It is not, therefore, a correct presentation.</P>
    <P>While congratulating the Minister on the efforts being made in housing reconstruction and in the installation of water, I should like to urge that advance advice should be given to all applicants, particularly in the matter of the installation of water, as to the probable cost.  People may have to sink a well and many still rely on the diviner's estimate of the depth of the bore.  They estimate that it would cost £1 a foot, so that if they had to go down 250 feet the cost will be £250.  I submit that engineers or inspectors should advise applicants for water supplies as to whether it would be less costly to instal a tank system rather than bore a well.  That would be of great help to many people.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the question of traffic lights.  Within the past week, there have been two or three <Col N="1203" /> instances of traffic jams in the city of Dublin caused by the failure of traffic lights.  There should be some method of notifying the Garda when such failures occur.  Yesterday an instance of this occurred at Haddington Road and I was amazed that several serious crashes did not occur.  The red light remained on one side and the green on the other for at least 15 minutes. As a result, traffic was held up on one side.  It is only human nature that some of those held up should try to move through, but the cars from the other direction continued to go through the crossing at such a rate that the heart nearly went crossways in me.  Of course, I turned back and went the other way, but I was amazed that there was no method by which the matter could be rectified speedily. Traffic lights, generally, are a great success and I agree with the proposition that more should be erected.</P>
    <P>I agree also that the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; signs should be taken down.  They remind me of an occasion when troops were confined to barracks for a period but the date on which they might leave barracks was not specified.  As far as that order was concerned, they are still confined to barracks because though they were told they were confined to barracks they were not informed of the date on which they could leave again. It is the same with the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; signs: there is nothing to tell one when to go.  Of course, most people know what is meant but it can be very embarrassing to visitors to the country.  When they see the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; sign, they do not know what it means and they have been most critical of it.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the increased value of land and the difficulty local authorities have in finding sites for rural houses, I think local authorities should be permitted to proceed with acquisition of land despite the higher costs. Land will not get cheaper because, unfortunately, the purchasing power of money is depreciating and it is that depreciation that is causing the value of land to increase.  I submit that local authorities should be authorised, when land becomes available or when a farm is being divided by the Land Commission, to acquire areas and have <Col N="1204" /> them available later for the housing of people in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, our roads are improving.  I presume the local authorities are working to a plan and I do not know enough about it to be able to criticise it.  However, I believe the straight roads now being built are not bringing about the safety that was hoped.  I should like at this stage to suggest that more work be done in the provision of proper roads to farmers' houses.  Many of these are done through unemployment relief schemes, but in areas where there is no unemployment or where such a scheme would serve only one farmer, the work is not being done.  Proper roads to their houses would put the finishing touches to the amenities of farmers who have reconstructed their homes and who have had, among other things, water supplies installed.  One has to wear waders to get into some of those houses and that is a pity, seeing that so much trouble has been taken to put the houses themselves into proper condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice from the Minister's statement that he devoted a considerable amount of his speech to the housing position.  It is a very welcome portion of his speech because we have seen in recent times that there is a very urgent need for the improvement of our housing conditions here in Dublin.  A survey has indicated that nearly 10,000 Dublin families are waiting to be rehoused.  Those people must be very disappointed with the rate of Corporation house building over the past six or seven years.  In 1957, the year when the inter-Party Government handed over to this Government, over 1,500 Corporation houses were built and in the previous years, that was more or less the rate which resulted from the housing programmes.That figure of 1,500 Corporation houses dropped in 1958 and 1959 and eventually in 1960, only 277 such houses were built; in 1961, 392 houses and in 1962, 643 houses.  In other words, in the past three years, there were fewer Corporation houses built than in the year 1957 alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the population of this city and the large number of <Col N="1205" /> families pressing to be rehoused, we must face the fact that it is necessary to have at least 1,000 houses provided each year for tenancy by the working-class families who are not in a position to provide housing accommodation for themselves.  If a programme of 1,000 houses per year is embarked on by Dublin Corporation, aided, of course, by the Department of Local Government, it means that the 10,000 families now waiting cannot hope to be rehoused for at least another nine years, but, in the meantime, the position will be further aggravated by an increase in the population of Dublin and an increase in the number of families needing houses.</P>
    <P>I blame the Dublin Corporation, and indeed the Department of Local Government, for not waking up to the fact that Dublin city's population is increasing at the rate of almost 25 per day, approximately 7,000 people per year swelling the population of Dublin city and county.  It seems evident that the rise in population in Dublin city and county will continue at that rate and, if it does, the Corporation and the Department of Local Government must face up to the fact that a housing problem will be created by that increase in population.  Therefore, a minimum of 1,000 houses should be built by the Corporation for the housing of working-class families.</P>
    <P>If we take the life of a Corporation house at 70 years, by a mathematical calculation, it can be seen exactly the number of Corporation houses that must be replaced per annum in addition to the new houses provided which it is hoped will last a further 70 or 80 years.  In addition to that problem of replacement of Corporation dwellings as well as the provision of extra houses, there is the work of maintenance of the existing Corporation dwellings which in the normal way must be kept in repair because they are the property of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Many families feel that a scheme for the purchase of Corporation houses should be introduced.  However, it is a very big question and one that could not be decided without careful consideration of all the problems that such an arrangement would involve.  Deputy <Col N="1206" /> Collins was most unfair to the Fine Gael Party regarding housing prewar.We are prepared to give Deputy Collins's Party credit for the housing which they did in the seven or eight years before the war, but at the same time as they are taking credit for that housing campaign, they must take the blame for the small amount of local authority housing during the previous ten years.</P>
    <P>Looking at the number of Corporation houses and the development which has taken place here, we must admit that those schemes are a monument to the inter-Party Government, having regard to the period during which they were in office, approximately seven years, and the large number of houses provided within that time.  The vigorous housing campaign which was operated under the inter-Party Government is one that will not be forgotten by the working-class families of Dublin city and indeed the county, too.</P>
    <P>There is considerable hardship in Dublin County at the moment amongst about 1,000 families who are pressing for the provision of county council houses.  They are not financially in a position to provide housing accommodation for themselves.  There is also great difficulty&mdash;and I hope the Minister will find a way out; I believe he did make an announcement in relation to it some time ago&mdash;both in the city and county where the children grow up into their early twenties and there is no prospect of getting tenancy of a workingclass house provided by the Corporation or by the Department of Local Government because there are so many persons with a large number of children also pressing for tenancy of houses.  The result is that these young people who grow up in a Corporation or Dublin County Council dwelling, when they get married, take up residence in one room of that dwelling.</P>
    <P>Of course the official view is that the tenant is committing an offence by permitting a sub-tenancy to develop there but the position becomes still worse when a second member of the same family decides to get married and gets a further allocation of the very limited accommodation in that house. <Col N="1207" /> When such a house becomes available, particularly if you take Dublin County and if these conditions exist in a county council house in, say, Balbriggan, it is no consolation to tell those three families that there is a vacant cottage in Tallaght or Stillorgan and that they may be interested in it. The chances are that their employment is near Balbriggan.  It is unfair to regard these families as being illegal tenants or sub-tenants in that house which is tenanted by their parents. Those people are not considered for rehousing because there is an arrangement whereby a new county council house will not get the benefit of the State subsidy if a family who were sub-tenants of a council house are rehoused and put into a new county council house.</P>
    <P>That problem is growing and is becoming acute in many areas.  I know of a cottage in Swords in which 18 people are living.  There are three families in that house.  There are the parents and their children and two of the children are married and have their own children and there are also unmarried members of the family. They applied for the tenancy of one of the new houses in Swords but the houses were given out to families who had been four or five in a house.  They qualified for a new cottage but the other family, where there were 18 people in the house, could not get a new council house and had to continue living in the deplorable conditions which can exist where there are no services and a large number of people living together.  It is a problem that will have to be tackled by the county council and the Minister.  It is no consolation to tell these people that they are illegal tenants and therefore their claim for a new council house must be disregarded, having regard to the conditions which apply to the payment of a grant in respect of a new council house.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, the Minister made an announcement about the possibility of making an alteration in the regulations which prevent these deplorable conditions being solved.  The problem is growing because many of these <Col N="1208" /> houses have been built for 15 or 30 years and the result is that young families have grown up and cannot get housing accommodation elsewhere.  We must have regard not alone to the need for providing new council houses in areas where the population is increasing&mdash;it is increasing in Dublin county as well as in Dublin city&mdash;but in addition, to the ordinary work of replacing houses which become dangerous buildings.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Minister's statement that something like 1,100 people were affected by the collapse of dangerous buildings in Dublin city.  There are at least three times that number of people still living in dangerous buildings in the city.  That is a problem which the Department and the Corporation will have to face up to sooner than later.  We have scaffolding up in many parts of the city where buildings, on examination, have been found to be in a dangerous condition.  The people from these buildings will also create a problem in relation to rehousing.Mention was made of prefabricated houses or caravans to accommodate these people but so far the attitude here is that they will keep to the ordinary type of building rather than any kind of prefabrication or temporary dwellings.  That is a fair attitude until the merits of any alternative housing system have been examined carefully.</P>
    <P>In regard to the payment of grants for private houses, I should like to mention the fact that many people who are providing houses for themselves meet with great financial strain just when the house is being completed, because at that stage it is examined and the inspector finds there have been some omissions, some things left incomplete and which must be completed before the grant can be paid.  I feel it is unfair to withhold the full amount of the grant, whether it is the first 50 per cent or the second 50 per cent just because a few small items remain to be completed.  I am in favour of holding back a substantial amount of the grant but not the full amount because this causes financial embarrassment to the builder who has been put to the pin of his collar to try to scrape <Col N="1209" /> up enough money to go the distance he has gone.</P>
    <P>Very often when the house has nearly been completed the builder goes away and starts another job.  There is so little to be done that he calculates it would pay him better not to go back and finish the house for the man who is waiting for the grant and instead he proceeds with work elsewhere.  I am sure it is quite a common experience for the officials of the Department to find that in spite of their best efforts to try to complete their houses and comply with the regulations in order to qualify for the grant, people are let down by the contractors and in many cases have to go to law.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the payment of grants for the repair and reconstruction of dwelling houses.  It is very desirable that people should be encouraged to repair and renovate their dwelling houses and keep them in good condition.  The Department is making a very valuable contribution towards the maintenance of private houses.  The Minister also mentioned that there are more than 25,000 houses in the State which need to be replaced.  I assume the replacement of these houses is regarded as of immediate necessity. There are 20,000 of these houses in the rural areas.  Unfortunately, a vigorous housing programme has not been embarked upon in the rural areas.  If local authorities will not undertake such a programme the Department of Local Government should take the initiative.</P>
    <P>I support the view expressed by a previous speaker that the provision of good houses in rural areas is very important from the point of view of the State.  It ensures that people will remain in the rural areas.  People cannot be blamed for emigrating or leaving an area if housing conditions are bad or if they are unable to house themselves.  Every effort should be made to provide houses in suitable locations throughout rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>There has been a fair amount of housing development in most villages and towns.  Emphasis should now be placed on the provision of houses in rural areas with a view to encouraging people to reside there and to rear their families there and to creating <Col N="1210" /> economic activity in the localities.  If people cease to reside in rural areas, availability of labour for work on or in connection with the land will decline still further.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months over 10,000 people ceased to work on the land.  That trend is continuing and will be aggravated if people can find better housing conditions elsewhere. If comfortable homes are provided in rural areas families can be relied on to remain there if that is economically possible.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the assistance given by Telefís Éireann in publicising the schemes for the provision of water supplies in rural areas with a view to encouraging people to organise private water supplies. Publicity was also given to the value of providing water supplies where fire hazards exist.  Having regard to some of the programmes on Telefís Éireann in recent times, I should like to see the Department of Local Government doing very much more in the way of publicising worthwhile schemes which are of benefit to the community. The organisers of some television programmes broadcast lately should be ashamed when there is so much useful material which could be used by Telefís Éireann for the benefit of viewers.</P>
    <P>We can claim that there is a very high standard of building in local authority housing.  It is generally agreed that the specifications for these houses are of a far higher standard than those applied in private building. It is very desirable that the specifications for local authority housing should be maintained at a high standard.  At least, it is good example.  A proof of the high standard required in local authority housing is the difficulty of getting tenders from building contractors who find it more profitable to build private houses for which the specifications are not of such a high standard.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the present Fianna Fáil Party allowed the housing programme to decline as it has done since 1956.  There were 1,500 corporation houses built in 1957. Building costs at that time were much <Col N="1211" /> lower than they are at present.  A much higher rent must be paid in respect of a house built now than would be payable if the house had been built six or seven years ago. There is much higher bank interest involved.  If the tenants do not pay it, the other tenants of corporation houses must pay it and, if they do not pay it, the ordinary taxpayer must pay for the increased cost of building corporation houses now compared with six or seven years ago when the housing programme of Dublin Corporation was well under way.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the choice of names for paths, roads and streets and so on in Dublin city. Apparently a resolution was passed many years ago to the effect that the Irish language must be used in place-names for corporation housing schemes.  Many of the names put up are impracticable.  Residents may not have a good command of the Irish language.  Many of them do not understand it.  They are compelled to use the name that is put on the name-plate. They must have an address which is identifiable for postal purposes.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a place which it was decided should be called Craoibhinn Park.  The spelling seemed rather odd to persons who did not know Irish. A number of the tenants used the correct spelling but others failed to do so.  In some cases tenants wrote &ldquo;Crubeen Park&rdquo; on their letters. Others actually wrote &ldquo;Hyde Park&rdquo; on their envelopes because the late President Douglas Hyde was known as &ldquo;An Craoibhinn&rdquo;.  I give this as an example of the frustration and confusion caused to tenants by the application of awkward Irish names to these schemes and streets.  They get these names, whether they like them or not. They should be given a choice of using an Irish name or an alternative English name.  Bilingual methods are used in many instances, and in fairness to these tenants, these roads and schemes should be named bilingually. If there are tenants who wish to use the Irish name, they would then have the choice of doing so.  Under the present system, however, tenants are <Col N="1212" /> obliged to use a long, awkward Irish name, whether they like it or not.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention also the numbering of streets.  We have all had the experience of searching for a particular street at night or in bad light and, when we have at last found it, discovering that we cannot read the numbers on the houses.  We have to see in what direction the numbers are going.  The Corporation could give a lead in this matter by putting the number of the house in large figures on the gate pier outside, so that people on the street can read the numbers of the houses without having to walk right up to the door in darkness and still find they are unable to read the small number.  If the numbers were affixed to the gate piers outside, it would be of great assistance to such people as Department inspectors, postmen, gas collectors, ESB collectors and so on.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise should be encouraged among working class families, particularly those earning high wages who have been able to save a certain amount of money.  The local authority should buy sites and make them available to people who desire to build their own houses with the aid of loans and grants.</P>
    <P>Much time is wasted in the preparation of plans for local authority houses.  Generally speaking, the type of house to be built is known.  The type of house to be erected should be decided on, and we should have done with it, instead of having individual plans prepared for each particular house.  It is a dreadful waste of time preparing plans over and over again for the same type of house when we actually know the type of house that will be provided.</P>
    <P>Dublin county and city are being treated very unfairly in the matter of road grants.  Although our roads are carrying a huge volume of traffic from every direction, we get our grants on a mileage basis rather than on the basis of the volume of traffic carried. Since a census is being taken of road traffic at present, now is the time to consider the claim of Dublin County Council for a much larger road grant. In other counties, there is very little traffic, apart from the traffic within <Col N="1213" /> the county itself, because of the location of the county.  If a differential were introduced, we in Dublin would get far more in the form of road grants.  I think it is fair to say that only one-third of the money subscribed in respect of motor vehicles in Dublin city and county to the Road Fund comes back to be spent on the roads in Dublin.  Suppose we are subscribing over £2 million in road tax and getting less than £1 million in return for our roads, it is unfair that the remaining <Col N="1214" /> £1 million should be spent in counties which are getting £3 for every £1 they subscribe in motor taxation.  They are doing six times better than Dublin city and county.</P>
