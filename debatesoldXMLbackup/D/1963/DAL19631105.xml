      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if in relation to recent per capita increases granted to the various types of hospitals he will state (a) whether or not sanatoria qualify for this increase, and (b) if not, what is the explanation as to why a decision has been arrived at to exclude sanatoria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The revision from time to time of the rates of payments by health authorities in respect of the maintenance and treatment of patients in voluntary hospitals is for the purpose of reducing disparities between the revenue income and expenditure of the hospitals, which arise as a result of increases in running costs.  These disparities vary considerably as between one category of hospital and another, due largely to differences in the effects of developments in medical science and in the extent of changes of staffing conditions.  It is now clear, also, that the rates of payment hitherto in operation did not allow sufficiently for basic differences in the running costs of hospitals providing short-term treatment for acute illness as compared with hospitals serving long-stay patients.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the recent review of the rates of payments, it was found that, for the reasons which I have mentioned, an increase in the rate applicable to tuberculosis hospitals is not urgently necessary but that there is a compelling case for the increases which I have approved in respect of other hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is governed by the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attested Area) Order, 1960, under which the movement of reactor animals into the attested area, or within the attested area, is prohibited except where movement is carried out under special permit for immediate slaughter at authorised slaughtering premises.  The attested area of course now comprises the whole country except six southern dairying counties.  The movement of any cattle from a herd in which a reactor arises in the area is also prohibited except under permit until it <Col N="799" /> is confirmed that the herd is free from tuberculosis following retesting of the herd after removal of the reactor for slaughter.  These regulations apply equally to movement across the Shannon as to any other movement.</P>
      <P>The regulations are implemented by the staffs attached to the local district offices of the Department of Agriculture and with the co-operation of the Garda Síochána.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of no specific legal powers by which a farmer could compel a neighbouring farmer to give him an outlet for the drainage of his lands through the lands of the neighbour.Usually the matter is settled by mutual consent of the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>I cannot see any way <Col N="800" /> of meeting these particular difficulties which arise from time to time everywhere but not to any great extent. Sometimes the disagreement has to do with the amount of the contribution which the different parties have to make and there may be some merit on the side of the objectors.  It would be a mistake to say that the few objections that do arise have no merit.  However, this is not a question that has arisen only recently.  It is a very old question and has been examined by different Ministers of different Governments and it is not a question to which it is easy to find a reasonable solution.</P>

      <P>Mr. Tierney made a claim for unemployment benefit on the 11th December, 1962, which was disallowed on the ground that he had exhausted his right to unemployment benefit on the 8th July, 1960, and had not requalified in the meantime.  He was notified of the decision on the 22nd December, 1962, but did not appeal.</P>
      <P>He made a further claim on the 18th February, 1963, with which he lodged his 1963 insurance card bearing four contributions.  These contributions, together with twelve additional contributions on the 1962 insurance card lodged with the previous claim would, if valid, have enabled him to requalify for unemployment benefit.  It was held by a deciding officer, however, that Mr. Tierney was not employed in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts during the period to which the contributions on the 1962 card related.  As a consequence the claim made in February, 1963 was disallowed.Mr. Tierney was advised accordingly on 23rd May, 1963.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the decision invalidating the twelve contributions to which I referred earlier and, following an oral hearing an appeals officer, on 16th September, 1963, upheld the decision of the deciding officer.  Mr. Tierney was notified of this decision on the same date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the discussion on the Recommittal Stage at the Special Committee, Deputy Sweetman moved an amendment similar to this.  He explained that his object in doing so was to impose some penalty on persons who personated shareholders at general meetings and thereby caused considerable inconvenience.  I did not accept the amendment at that stage but, on reconsideration, I decided that there was no objection to it and, in fact, that it might be useful and serve <Col N="812" /> the purpose Deputy Sweetman had in mind.  I am now moving it as an official amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 66, to delete lines 28 to 38 and substitute:</P>
      <P>(1)  When judgment is recovered against a company and such judgment is subsequently converted into a judgment mortgage affecting any property of the company, the judgment creditor shall cause 2 copies (certified by the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds, as the case may be, to be correct copies) of the affidavit required for the purpose of registering the judgment as a mortgage to be delivered to the company within 21 days after the date of such registration, and the company shall within 3 days of receipt of such copies deliver one of such copies to the registrar of companies for registration in manner required by this Act.  By way of further precaution, the Land Registry, or Registry of Deeds, shall as soon as may be deliver a copy of the said affidavit to the registrar of companies.</P>
      <P>In this case also I am moving this amendment consequent upon discussions that took place in the Special Committee on the Recommittal of the Bill.  The section provides that where a judgment is converted into a judgment mortgage, the judgment creditor must send two copies of the relevant affidavit to the company against whom he has secured the judgment and the company must file one copy with the Registrar of Companies.  During the Recommittal Stage, a number of Deputies expressed uneasiness about the situation which would arise in the event of a company failing to send a copy of the affidavit to the Registrar of Companies.  In that case, the public would not then be in a position to ascertain full information about the company's liabilities and might enter into commitments which they might otherwise avoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> It was Deputy de Valera, I think, who suggested the form of amendment which would deal with this position and would obviate the danger of the public not being informed about a judgment being registered as a judgment mortgage.  The purpose of the suggestion made by Deputy de Valera was that a copy of the affidavit which changed the judgment into a judgment mortgage would be sent by the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds&mdash;in which offices it would inevitably be first registered&mdash;to the Registrar of Companies.  The principal object of the amendment, therefore, is to insert a sentence along the lines suggested by Deputy de Valera, and this was approved by all members of the Committee.</P>

      <P>It is my recollection &mdash;and I will refer to the report, if necessary&mdash;that the suggestion made by Deputy de Valera met the points raised by members of the Committee. However, I am incorporating now in this amendment the suggestion made by Deputy de Valera.  In addition, I have re-worded the subsection, making no substantial change, in order to incorporate properly Deputy de Valera's suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this amendment does incorporate the suggestion made by Deputy de Valera. The suggestion made by Deputy de Valera was that the documents to be registered in the Registry of Deeds by the judgment creditor should be transmitted by the registrar to the Companies Office.  That was my understanding of it.  This is an improvement, let me say, on the provisions of the Bill previously, but it is an entirely cumbersome improvement and one that does not go about the matter the right way.  It is almost nonsensical to provide in a Companies Bill that, &ldquo;by way of further precaution, the Land Registry, or the Registry of Deeds, shall as soon as may be deliver a copy of the said affidavit to the registrar of companies.&rdquo;  That is duplicating the work that has to be done here.  The Land Registry will transmit <Col N="814" /> to the Companies Office and the company secretary will have to make the registration again in the Companies Office.  Where on earth is the sense of the Land Registry in a registered land case doing the work if the judgment creditor has to pay a solicitor to duplicate the work?</P>
      <P>It is all being done in the name of the sacred cow of trying to get things in one form.  I agree that the basis of this Bill is that registrations shall be by the company in the Companies Office.  That is the principle, but it is not a sacred principle or a principle to which it is necessary to adhere.  It is quite unnecessary to have the duplication of the judgment creditor delivering to the company's secretary and the company's secretary going to the Companies Office and registering there and the Registrar of the Registry of Deeds transmitting it again to the Companies Office.  It is quite farcical and it will quite unnecessarily encumber the procedure and put on everybody quite unnecessary costs.  I know that some of the costs involved will be picked up by Deputy Colley and myself as solicitors, but it is unnecessary; and solicitors do not like taking unnecessary money.</P>
      <P>The suggestion to the Committee was that the judgment creditor should deliver two copies to the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds and that the Registrar in either of those cases should transmit them to the Companies Office for direct registration.It could be provided at the same time that when the judgment creditor was registering against the company, he would pay the fees necessary for registration in the Companies Office. If that had been done, a great deal of abracadabra could be avoided and the public properly protected.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 188, to delete all words from &ldquo;nothing in this Act&rdquo; in line 35 to the end of the section and to substitute: &ldquo;nothing in Section 170 or 299 shall be taken to require any person who has acted as solicitor for the company to disclose any privileged communication made to him otherwise than as such solicitor.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 387, which it is proposed to amend, deals with privileged communications.After certain investigations, for example, investigation into the affairs of a company under Section 170 following the report of an inspector or an investigation arising out of a report by a liquidator under Section 299, it may be necessary to bring certain prosecutions, and company solicitors are, by those two sections, obliged to give all the help they can in the proceedings.  Section 387 provides a saver, however, for privileged communications.  During the Recommittal, a number of members of the Special Committee expressed uneasiness about the wording of Section 387 <Col N="817" /> and I undertook to have it reexamined.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to exclude communications of <i>bona fide</i> privilege between a solicitor and his client.  That solicitor may act for the company and also individually for directors of the company and the purpose of the amendment briefly is, while not giving the solicitor privilege in the case of a communication made to him in his capacity as solicitor to the company, it does afford him privilege in the case of a communication passing between him and individual directors of the company in his capacity as solicitor for them.  That latter position is now saved by the amendment I propose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit difficult to follow the wording of this amendment as it is to be written into the section.  I am not very happy about it, but, like the earlier amendment, it certainly is a very great improvement on the Bill as it was originally, but unlike the other amendment, I think in this the Minister has gone to a great deal of trouble to meet the point that was raised.  I see his difficulty.  I see what he wants to avoid and what he wants to ensure&mdash;that in the liquidation of a fraudulent company, for example, information cannot be covered up.  I see that and I accept his anxiety in that regard, but I am not quite satisfied that a case might not arise in which the appropriate privilege would not be covered by this amendment.I think it goes as far as we can now legislate and if it comes to the last analysis, it will be a judge of the High Court who will have to rule on it and I do not imagine he will rule in too wide a fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Sweetman that&mdash;he may not have said this but I think it was what he was conveying&mdash;the amendment does involve to some extent an encroachment on the existing doctrine of privilege and, like Deputy Sweetman, I am not very happy about that development. On the other hand, I agree that the Minister has a difficult situation to meet and primarily my reason for <Col N="818" /> speaking is to put on record my appreciation of the manner in which the Minister has endeavoured to meet the objections that have been raised.  It is only right that tribute should be paid here to the efforts he has made to get this Bill through in a workable form and at the same time meet all objections raised.  He has succeeded to a very large extent.</P>

      <P>The only other matter I want to mention is one Deputy Sweetman emphasised in Committee and that I think could be emphasised again.  It is that the privilege is not the privilege of the solicitor but the privilege of his client. It is because of that that some anxiety was expressed about any encroachment but I think that all members of the Committee were satisfied that the encroachment is only to the extent necessary.</P>

      <P>May I add a postscript?I might have enlarged on this when introducing the amendment.  The solicitor I have in mind is acting for a company and may also be acting in a private capacity for the directors of the company.  The fraudulent practices that might come to light in the course of the type of investigation envisaged in these two sections are usually ones that the company itself would want to unearth and have duly punished.  It is possible that the directors of the company could have a controlling interest in it and because of their strong position, they might be able to use their influence to ensure that some fraudulent practices which could be disclosed by the solicitor could not be unearthed and prosecutions taken against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate at this stage to say a word in favour of the work which was done in the Special Committee.  In doing so, I think Deputies will agree that the Minister was both assiduous in his attendance and co-operative in listening to suggestions and recommendations made in the Committee.  That also goes for his staff who were equally assiduous in the help they rendered the Committee.  It is sometimes remarked that the procedure here is both cumbersome and out of date.  There will be general agreement, I think, that there are many changes which could be effected and which would make our procedure more flexible, thereby enabling business to be transacted more speedily.  One of the ways in which that can be accomplished is by a greater use of either Select Committees or Special Committees.The experience we had in this Committee was undoubtedly conducive to a reasonably speedy despatch of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, and I think it is right that it should be said, certain <Col N="820" /> limits to which the use of Special Committees can be extended.  One of the limiting factors is that, unless it happens that the Special Committees are dealing with matters not within the province of the same Minister, a Minister and a certain number of Deputies will all be obliged to attend a particular Committee because of their special interest in the work being undertaken by it.  To that extent, such a Committee imposes a considerable demand on the time and also on the ability of Deputies who undertake the specialised work involved in a piece of legislation such as this Companies Bill.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, correct to say that it involved not merely considerable practical experience, which some members of the Committee had to a considerable extent, but it also involved considerable research and reading on technical matters, on matters not particularly interesting from the point of view of those obliged to deal with the measure. For that reason, while I believe the use of Committees can, and will have, beneficial results from the point of view of getting business dealt with greater despatch, there is a physical limitation and those who sometimes criticise the procedure fail to appreciate the fact that Committees of this sort involve constant and regular attendance, not only by the Minister in charge&mdash;he, at any rate, has the advantage of a staff available to brief him and supply him with up-to-date information on the matters the subject of discussion&mdash;but also on the part of Deputies acting on the Committee, in addition to their ordinary attendance at the current session of the Dáil.  As I have said, the work involved very considerable research and application in order to be adequately versed in the matters the subject of discussion.</P>
    <P>Subject to these remarks, I believe the experience we have had on this Special Committee indicates that there are possibilities for extending the use of these Committees in future.  We can be reasonably satisfied, I think, with the work that has been done in framing the measure now before the House. I do not know whether the Minister can at this stage indicate whether he <Col N="821" /> expects to have many further official amendments for the Seanad, which amendments will, of course, have to come back here eventually; if that is the case, the matter will require still further consideration.  I should also be interested to know if the Minister is yet in a position to indicate when he expects the Bill to become law.  He undertook at the Special Committee that adequate advance notice would be given and I have no doubt he will adhere to that undertaking when the measure is being brought into effect by ministerial Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who served on this Committee, I should like to add my expression of satisfaction at the excellent way in which the Committee worked.  The Bill was not, of course, a political Bill.  It was a Bill which restless minds did not read with great avidity.  It was as dry as dust.  Many sections of it could not be less interesting than they were.  But it was all part of the task of trying to weave a piece of legislation that fitted into the activities of our companies and, from that point of view, I think the Committee did a very good job of work.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Chairman of the Committee were most reasonable. The Minister made amendments on the basis of their merits and not because of any preconceived view.  All the amendments were discussed from the standpoint of whether they would help the Bill or were unnecessary.  It was because of the give-and-take spirit which permeated the Committee that it was possible to evolve a Bill which, in the end, gave general satisfaction to those who constituted the Committee. Here, to-day, the measure is passing through this House calmly and with the approval of both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Cosgrave, I think it is a pity we do not use Special Committees more, especially in the case of complicated measures.  As far as my recollection goes, there were over 280 pages in the Companies Bill, 13 Schedules and about 400 Sections.  Weaving through these was no easy task.  It would, I think, have been impossible to deal with the measure in this House.  Resorting to the Special Committee was the method adopted to <Col N="822" /> subject this piece of legislation to microscopic examination, have its imperfections sought for, found and eliminated.  Ultimately, a very reasonable piece of legislation comes before the House for its approval.  The last Companies Bill was passed, I think, in 1908, well over 55 years ago.  It will probably be another 50 years before we pass another one.  It was desirable, therefore, that we should do everything possible to ensure that this Bill meets our reasonable requirements.</P>
    <P>The work of this Committee, and another Committee which functioned last year, the Electoral Law Reform Committee, shows that there is a very good co-operative spirit in the House to be utilised for the purpose of getting agreement on matters which are not the subject of exciting political debate. I had the pleasure of serving on both these Committees.  Considering that the problems were extremely difficult and complex, the Committees dealt with them with extraordinary expedition, on the one hand, and with a very high degree of unanimity, on the other. There was a general desire to produce two pieces of legislation which expressed the views and were founded on the experience of the ordinary Deputy and the ordinary man in the street.  I would urge the Minister now to use his influence with the Government to ensure that Special Committees are used where possible, particularly where there is agreement among all Parties to tackle these complicated questions thrown up by Bills such as the Companies Bill we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>I unfortunately was out of town on the last day the Committee sat and did not therefore get the opportunity of saying what I wish to say now.  The Committee were magnificently served by the civil servants whom the Minister brought to the Committee to assist him and the Committee in the work of examining the Bill.  There were a number of officials from the Department present and while normally I would not select the name of one official from the others for the purpose of extending any special measure of praise, I think in this instance it would be cowardice not to pay a special tribute to one particular official.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> I had never seen the official before and he is not a personal friend of mine. I did not in fact know he was in that Department, but I say now that that official was a travelling compendium on company law, as even relatively experienced Deputies will agree.  If a Deputy raised a query on Section 108, for instance, this official's immediate reply was: &ldquo;Oh, look at Section 127 and you will find this matter is covered there.&rdquo;  He had a most remarkable grasp of company law and if he had not been on that Committee, I say we would have been there for many more weeks in our examination of that Bill. The official to whom I refer is Mr. Holloway and I for one should like to place on record my appreciation of the magnificent services he rendered to that Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember the Solicitors Act.  I want to say a word or two on two aspects of this Bill.  At the final meeting of the Special Committee, I paid the tribute I felt was due to Mr. Holloway who proved himself a travelling encyclopaedia on the law. Though he and I differed on many things, it is only right I should say also that the work of the Committee was considerably facilitated by the manner in which Deputy Colley handled the work as Chairman.  It is not often we can say that about our opposite numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that this Bill goes now from this House a better Bill than it was when introduced into the House not so very long ago, considering its size.  I doubt if there has ever been as long a Bill enacted by the Dáil in our <Col N="824" /> 40 years of existence.  It would have been quite impossible for the Bill to have been given the consideration it deserved in the House here.  We were able in the Special Committee to give it our attention in a slightly more informal way, but, to a very great degree, we were able to give it far more time than would have been possible because of pressure of business in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is an example that should be there not merely for this Government but for all Governments, past, present and future&mdash;the manner in which a highly complicated, long and technical Bill should be dealt with in Special Committee rather than by attempting to deal with it here across the floor of the House instead of across a small table where we were able to get down and deal with the technicalities as we would not have been able to do so effectively in a Chamber such as this where matters of general policy rather than technical detail would be involved.</P>
    <P>The Bill came here as a result of the work of the Company Law Reform Committee, set up as far back as March, 1951.  It was set up by the then Attorney General, the late Mr. Justice Casey, largely because of the interest that had been expressed in the matter by the then Taoiseach, Deputy John A. Costello.  It is to some extent, therefore, the end in this House of the work that he initiated at that time.  The fact that that Committee was set up in 1951 and that the report was issued only in 1958 was not due to any dereliction of duty on their part but to the number of fatalities&mdash;many members of the Committee died during the time they were considering the matter.  The preparation of the Bill after that was not unduly delayed.  In fact, the Minister will agree that its consideration after it came before the House was as expeditious as possible, bearing in mind the importance of the matter and the complications that inevitably ensued.</P>
    <P>I pressed the Minister at the Special Committee to give advance notice, if at all possible, of the coming into operation of the Bill.  As a matter of fact, it contains a provision enabling <Col N="825" /> the Minister to bring it into force by way of Order.  It is true to say that the entire Bill will be brought into force on the one date&mdash;that it will not be brought in piecemeal&mdash;and I would urge the Minister now to name the date on which he hopes the Commencement Order will become operative.I appreciate it must be to some extent provisional because it must be considered by the other House and I should not like their consideration of it to be abridged in any way, but it is a matter of vital importance to all who practise company law, be they solicitors, accountants, secretaries or the companies themselves, that they should know a long time ahead the date on which the change-over will become operative.</P>
    <P>All of us keep substantial stocks of forms ready to meet eventualities; many of us keep type standing with printing firms to deal with memoranda and articles of association.  These are not things that can be changed lightly or quickly and if there is not adequate advance notice, there will be a great deal of quite unnecessary waste.  I would therefore urge the Minister today to give special notice of the date on which he now anticipates the Bill will come into operation, always bearing in mind its passage through the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express appreciation of the sentiments expressed by the Deputies as to the manner in which I and my officials handled this in Committee.  Particularly on behalf of my officials, I wish to express appreciation of the compliments that have been so ably extended to them and so well deserved.  This is perhaps the occasion, after the successful conclusion of a Bill of this nature, at least in so far as this House is concerned, when bouquets may be handed out.  I should like to say here and now that our discussions in the Committee were not always harmonious.Cross words were said occasionally, and not always between members on opposite sides but sometimes between members of the same side.  That, however, served to add quality to the measure that ultimately evolved from the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> Since bouquets are being distributed, it is only fair I should express my thanks to the Reporting Staff of the House and the secretarial staff provided by the Oireachtas staff.  As far as the Reporting Staff are concerned, they did a difficult job very well.  It was a difficult job because this is a highly technical Bill and many members frequently spoke quickly and often together, and the reporting staff succeeded in giving a very accurate report of what occurred in that Committee.Having said all that, I think we must confess that we were only doing our duty as expected of us by the public to whom we are ultimately responsible.</P>
    <P>As far as the date of the coming into operation of the Bill is concerned, I have in mind a date about three months after the passage of the Bill through the other House.  As Deputy Sweetman said rightly, we cannot anticipate the length of the debate in the Seanad.  That will depend on what view the Seanad takes of our work and on any further amendments I may suggest to the Seanad.  At the moment there is only one amendment I have in mind and if it is accepted by the Seanad, it will come back here for further debate.  In order to take reasonable account of any delays that may ensue&mdash;and I do not expect any real delays&mdash;I suggest, and it is no more than a suggestion, that the date of the coming into operation of the Bill be 1st April, 1964, which, I think, would be a suitable date in many respects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say, at least, that it would not be earlier than 1st April?  That would enable us to make our plans for this up to 1st April and after that we could see what transpires.</P>

I realise that this is being examined in the Department of Justice.It is extremely difficult for the persons who suffer from this practice to prove that certain goods and services were obtained through a particular company which they would never have obtained, had they not used its name and been recognised in the district court for this purpose.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm three Orders made during 1962 under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957 which provides that Orders made by the Government under that Act, imposing or amending duties, must be confirmed in the calendar year following that in which they are made.</P>
      <P>The Orders are:</P>
      <P>(1)  Imposition of Duties (No. 128) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1962.</P>
      <P>(2)  Imposition of Duties (No. 130) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1962.</P>
      <P>(3)  Imposition of Duties (No. 131) (Reduction of Rates of Customs Duties) Order, 1962.</P>
      <P>Order No. 128 (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) prescribed a new form of customs tariff based on the internationally-agreed Brussels nomenclature for use in classifying goods for customs purposes; it also revoked all then existing customs duties, except those on tobacco, beer, spirits, certain hydrocarbon oils, and wine which were excluded because of the number of consequential legislative changes which their inclusion would have involved, and re-imposed these duties, with certain modifications, within the nomenclature classification. This Order was made to bring our tariff code into conformity with the classification generally adopted by European countries, including those which are members of the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>Order No. 130 (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) made a number of necessary amendments of a minor nature to Order No. 128 which I have just referred to and also revoked, and re-imposed, in accordance with the new tariff classification, a customs duty on wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Order No. 131 (Reduction of Rates of Customs Duties) reduced by ten per cent all customs duties, with the exception <Col N="830" /> of certain revenue and agricultural duties, as part of the movement towards freer trade conditions, and in anticipation of our entry into the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of Orders No. 128 and 130 is to re-impose in their new form a number of customs duties which has been amended or imposed previously by way of separate Orders. There are seven such Orders in question, all of which were made in the year 1962.</P>
    <P>The first of these Orders, Order No. 121 (Braid), reduced the <i>ad valorem</i> rate of customs duty on braid (other than braid suitable for the manufacture of laces) from 100 per cent (flat), to 60 per cent (full), 40 per cent (UK and Canada), and was made in accordance with the recommendation of the Industrial Development Authority, after a tariff review under our Trade Agreements with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The second Order, Order No. 122&mdash;Iron and Steel Files&mdash;reduced the customs duty on iron and steel files from 75 per cent (full), 50 per cent preferential (UK and Canada), <i>ad valorem</i> with an additional customs duty of 1/6d (full), 1/- preferential (UK and Canada), the article, to 60 per cent (full), 40 per cent preferential (UK and Canada), <i>ad valorem</i>, with an additional customs duty of 1/1½d (full), 9d. (UK and Canada), the article.  This tariff reduction was also made in accordance with the recommendation of the Industrial Development Authority after a Review under our Trade Agreements with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The next Order&mdash;Order No. 124&mdash; Overcoats for Men or Boys&mdash;amended the customs duty on overcoats for men or boys so as to provide for minimum rates of 75/- (full), 50/- (UK and Canada), the article.  This change was made because the existing <i>ad valorem</i> rates were found to be inadequate to give protection against imports of low priced goods.</P>
    <P>Order No. 125&mdash;Knitted Undergarments&mdash;amended the customs duty on certain knitted undergarments so as to provide for minimum rates of 2/-(full), 1/4d (UK and Canada), the <Col N="831" /> article.  The existing <i>ad valorem</i> rates proved to be inadequate to give protection against imports of low-priced goods and a specific duty had to be imposed to protect the domestic producers.</P>
    <P>Order No. 126&mdash;Knitted Fabric&mdash; amended the customs duty on knitted synthetic fabrics to provide for minimum specific rates of 1/9d. (full), 1/2d. (preferential), per square yard.  Here again excessive competition from low-cost producers threatened the interests of the Irish manufacturers and made it necessary to provide more effective protection for the industry.</P>
    <P>Order No. 127&mdash;Miscellaneous Customs Duties&mdash;made some minor amendments to the Imposition of Duties (No. 114) (Miscellaneous Customs Duties) Order, 1961.  This latter Order is the Order which provided higher tariff protection for goods, imports of which are subject to quantitative restrictions, so that, in a situation such as would arise on this country's adhesion to the Common Market, when these quantitative restrictions would have to be removed at once, an alternative form of protection would exist.</P>
    <P>The last of these Orders&mdash;Order No. 129 (Wheat)&mdash;imposed a customs duty of 70/- (flat), per ton, on imported milling wheat.  The purpose of this Order was to appropriate, for the benefit of the Exchequer, certain surplus profit which would accrue to millers due to the above-normal use of cheap imported wheat following the bad harvest of 1962.  The Exchequer incurred heavy expense in coming to the assistance of wheat growers as a result of the poor 1962 harvest.</P>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated for the information of Deputies.  I shall be glad to give any further information that is required.  I may say, in respect of the three Orders which were made increasing the tariff protection, these were made as a result of unduly low-cost imports coming in here from low-cost countries.  They did not in any way tend to increase, or in effect did they increase, the prices of these commodities as prevailing on the home market up to then.  The main <Col N="832" /> purpose was to protect the employment already being given in these three industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this comparatively short measure, I think, affords an opportunity for asking the Minister to state what is the Government's policy on tariffs and quotas generally.  As I understand the Government's policy, and as I think the policy was generally understood when our application for membership of the EEC was at any rate current, the arguments in favour of reducing protection on a gradual scale were made on the basis that if this country became a member of the EEC by a certain specified date, it was necessary by gradual stages to reduce protection and eventually to aim at circumstances in which protection would disappear entirely.</P>
      <P>However difficult and whatever the consequences which were likely to emerge from that policy, it was recognised by industrialists, by manufacturers and by those employed in these undertakings that the ultimate prospects for the country of membership of the EEC were such that it was agreed national policy that, although very serious difficulties might emerge for individual industries and for those employed in them, with certain consequences for some of these industries faced with the competition of industrialists and manufacturers in member countries of the EEC, they might be, and very likely would, find the competition and the going too keen and ultimately find themselves driven to the wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as I have said, it was recognised that taking all these factors into account, the national balance of advantage, with the prospect of the far greater market available in the EEC, and particularly with the fact that Britain had also applied for membership and our very close trading relationship with Britain, whatever certain individual disadvantages there might be, was in favour of EEC membership, and that these tariff and quota reductions were consequential on that decision and involved in the terms of membership which would <Col N="833" /> apply, not only here but to other member countries as well.</P>
    <P>That situation has now radically altered, since the press conference last January by the French President. There is no immediate likelihood of either Britain or this country becoming members of the EEC.  It is for that reason that I want to question the wisdom of proceeding generally with tariff and quota reductions in the absence of any <i>quid pro quo</i> from member countries of the EEC.  As I understand it, the general aim is, by means of these tariff and quota reductions, to bring Irish industry into a more efficient state.  This is a very big question and it is not possible merely by tariff reductions automatically to achieve efficiency or to make industries more competitive.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is personally aware, from representations which have been made to him and to his Department, of the very great concern which is felt by certain manufacturers, traders and industrialists who, while endeavouring to make themselves efficient and as competitive as possible, find that the prospect of further tariff or quota reductions in certain cases will bring them below the border line, under which they will find they are meeting competition from manufacturers and industrialists both in Britain and on the continent who have had, in the past, far greater markets available to them; who have a longer tradition of industrial skill and experience and who generally have geared themselves to a higher pitch of efficiency because of the availability of a higher market and having available not only a bigger home market but the advantages which in many of these cases larger units have over some of the smaller concerns.</P>
    <P>I notice that in three of the Orders which are the subject of confirmation by this Bill, the rate of duty has been increased because, as the Minister said, they were faced with competition from low-cost producers which militated against manufacturers in this country. It is well, with that experience in mind, to ensure that we will not have to take remedial action in the case of some of the manufacturers who are now the subject, or expect to be in the near <Col N="834" /> future, of further tariff or quota reductions.I have in mind one particular case in my constituency, woollen and worsted manufacturers, but I understand it is applicable to a number of similar undertakings in other parts of the country.  These people feel the greatest concern about the prospect of further reductions.</P>
    <P>I believe we have to consider this from a number of angles.  We have to consider the ability of individual units to keep in production if they find that part of either their equipment or of their factory is no longer necessary.  If a factory has to be reduced below a certain level of production, then in some cases it may well be uneconomic for it to continue in production.  The reduction of duty may involve the disemployment of some workers and that in itself has a disturbing effect. Obviously it has a disturbing effect on those so affected but equally it has a disturbing effect on those who are retained in employment because once uncertainty is created it does not require much to extend such a very gloomy situation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, initially the original basis on which these tariff reductions were being made was that this country would become a member of the EEC. I do not know whether the Minister can indicate whether there is any time-table available for our prospects for ultimate membership.  I understand from the statements made in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> that it is ultimately expected that we will become a member in 1970.  That is a long time away and it does not seem to me that there is any valid basis for that assumption, other than the hope that by that time circumstances, either in France or elsewhere, will have so altered that not only this country but Britain and a number of others will have joined.</P>
    <P>It is true that the EFTA countries have announced a decision to eliminate protection between themselves by 1966.  It always seemed to me that that decision was taken in an effort to jump the gun over the EEC countries and was due to an effort to appear to get one up on the EEC countries.  On the other hand, I do not know whether <Col N="835" /> the Minister has any information which would indicate whether there is any change in policy in Britain on this matter.  Prior to the recent change of Prime Minister there, the man responsible for dealing with EEC and EFTA was the Lord Privy Seal, Mr. Health.  His appointment as such has been terminated and he has become Secretary for Industry and President of the Board of Trade.  I understand that he is responsible for EFTA matters but the fact that there is no longer a special Minister to whom responsibility is assigned for EEC negotiations would indicate, if not a change of policy, a lessening of the emphasis so far as Britain is concerned on EEC membership in the immediate future. That may be merely accepting the realities as they are and awaiting events before proceeding further with the matter but I believe there is a general view in this country that before we proceed with further tariff and quota reductions, we ought secure some <i>quid pro quo</i>, either from EEC member countries or from EFTA countries.</P>
    <P>Our position at the moment is we are not in the EEC and not in EFTA but we are proceeding and taking action on the basis that we will ultimately become members of the EEC.  That, as I said, may have been sound enough in the circumstances in which our application was still current. However difficult individual prospects for industrial concerns or those employed in them were, it is agreed that the national balance of advantage lay with taking the necessary steps.  That situation has now altered and the time-table for EEC is both vague and indefinite.  Whatever our ultimate hopes may be, there is no immediate prospect of membership becoming an actuality in anything like the near future.</P>
    <P>Because of the very great concern felt by a number of industrialists, particularly by those employed in the industries I have mentioned, particularly in my constituency&mdash;and there are many others wondering what is likely to happen&mdash;the Minister should give some indication.  On the one hand, <Col N="836" /> this piece of legislation will impose duties, confirm certain Orders and reduce some of the protection, but in three specific cases it increases it.  In the light of those two conflicting approaches to what might well be regarded as the same problem, it is difficult to discover what Government policy is on this matter.</P>
    <P>So far as bringing our forms of customs tariffs into what is regarded as the Brussels nomenclature is concerned, that is generally accepted as a desirable procedure.  Anything that introduces a system which is recognised internationally and which is applicable to European countries has advantages in it.  So far as that is concerned, I think the changes are desirable, but I think we should proceed very warily in regard to tariff and quota reductions, unless we get some <i>quid pro quo</i> from the EEC or EFTA countries which will ensure that if we take action here, we will create no disadvantages for the concerns involved or those employed in them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise on this memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill the Order made by the Government during the past year, the purpose of which is to bring down our general level of tariffs by ten per cent.  My purpose in doing so is to elicit some information as to the Government's policy in this matter.  So long as the question of our admission to EEC, simultaneously with the British, represented an early possibility that we would be in the European Common Market this year or early next year, one could understand making reductions in tariffs here so that when we went in we would have passed through part of the exercise which the European Economic Community have been going through in reducing their general level of tariffs so that by 1970 no tariffs will be left except whatever tariffs the European Economic Community decided to impose themselves against outsiders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in favour of travelling along with that exercise so long as there was a reasonable hope that this year or next year would see us into the European Economic Community.  I am <Col N="837" /> afraid that the whole situation has now changed, and changed in an intangible way so that nobody knows whether we are likely to be admitted this year or next year.  Our possibility of entering now seems to revolve, not around all the members of the Community, but around the temperament of General de Gaulle.  We have been assured by five of the six member States that they are bursting to have us in, that they are longing to get over all the difficulties, that they are striving openly and by stealth to get us in, but over all these efforts there is the long shadow of General de Gaulle who says that he is not at present prepared to admit the British into the European Community.</P>
    <P>He says that he does not want a very big European Economic Community, that Britain is not a European partner in the sense that he understands European partnership and that for these two reasons, he has reached the stage when he thinks the admission of Britain is something which France should not have.  In other words, he wants a tailored European Economic Community, a community tailored to the dimensions which he himself prescribes, tailored to the European outlook which he regards as necessary in order that Britain should be a fully-fledged member.  He wants a European community which quite clearly acknowledges the right and traditional hegemony of France.</P>
    <P>Nobody has stated in the public Press, either here or in Britain, that this is only a transitory attitude on the part of the General, that this is not a fit of pique on the part of the French, something to which we have been treated quite frequently, something that blows up quickly and disappears with equal speed.  This is the position which General de Gaulle has taken up and there does not seem to be any question of his departing from it, so that all we can do is to sit down and play patience with him and see if any shift in the world situation will bring about a change in his present mentality.  Many people say that we may have to wait until he has passed on, either to the Great Reaper or is discarded by the electorate.  There is no one prepared to foretell when he <Col N="838" /> will be prepared to rescind what he has said or what he is doing.  Whether you look at him through NATO spectacles, or through EEC spectacles or through the spectacles of nuclear war you can get no line on the General.</P>
    <P>He has set himself up as an unpredictable force in Europe and Europe now has to wait and see in what way he will move.  Somewhere in that indeterminable situation our interests are to be found.  We have to wait until he changes his views about Britain and, even when he changes his views about Britain, there is no indication that he will not become moody and temperamental with us on the ground that we would not be able to bear the burden of membership of the European Community.  He may take the view that this is a club for giants, for people with mental muscles, that only the strong people can survive the battle that EEC will make.</P>
    <P>He may take the view that a small country like Ireland, a developing country, but with many economic weaknesses, might not possibly face up to all the responsibilities which will be involved in membership of the European club.  If he adopts that attitude towards us even after he has conceded Britain's admission, we may still have another wait before General de Gaulle decides that we do ultimately measure up to the situation.</P>
    <P>It may very well be, of course, that other events of a world character may telescope completely the present European Economic Community.  It may very well be that this European Economic Community will never reach manhood in an economic or political sense.  I am not talking about a military sense.  In an economic or political sense, it may very well be that it will be overtaken by world events and will never reach the stage originally contemplated.</P>
    <P>But we are sitting here repealing our tariffs at the rate of ten per cent per year.  Ten per cent has gone; ten per cent will go in January; a further ten per cent the following January and then we will get down to the 15 per cent; and ultimately, after a number of years, all our tariffs against imports will disappear.  They will be <Col N="839" /> abolished on the assumption that General de Gaulle&mdash;not the French&mdash; will allow us into the European Economic Community.  If we were certain that he would, perhaps there is a case for continuing this policy of repealing tariffs, but we are dealing with an unpredictable gentleman such as the General has proved to be.  I judge him on nothing but his own actions.  They have mystified his own people just as much as outsiders. Judging by his own actions, it is quite possible that we may continue to repeal these tariffs by ten or 15 per cent as the case may be from year to year and may get no corresponding advantage from the other six countries. With every one of these Six, we are hopelessly in the red.  We buy from them five, six and seven times more than they buy from us.  In all these instances, we are buying, individually, from the European Economic Community a very much larger quantity of goods than they are buying from us.  Of course, if we reduce the tariffs by ten and 15 per cent and more as time goes on, we are giving them more and more facilities.  We are allowing their goods into our market, while they on the other hand give us no industrial or agricultural advantage in their markets.</P>
    <P>If we were making it easier for them to enter our industrial market whilst they were doing likewise for our goods in their countries, one might understand it, even though it has always seemed to me and will continue to seem to me until I have evidence to the contrary, that to give us equality of entry to their market for industrial goods, we having started late in the industrial race, is not nearly as advantageous to us as it is to them to be given the same type of entry into our market for their industrial goods, having regard to their highly mechanised background, high degree of capitalisation and the long technical experience which they have inherited.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we are unable to get our industrial goods into those countries at a lower tariff rate than operates at present, it might be understandable if we could get our agricultural <Col N="840" /> goods in there.  But we cannot get either industrial goods or agricultural goods in at lower tariff rates than at present prevailing, whilst we on our part are reducing our tariffs by ten per cent each year in order to let these six countries into the Irish market, such as it is for them.</P>
    <P>In time, it may very well be that the first ten per cent and the second ten per cent reduction in our tariffs will not be serious from the point of view of our producers here.  Anybody who has any knowledge of the tariff procedure in the Department of Industry and Commerce knows that it is not the full which is the effective rate of protection; it is the preferential.  That was put there because what was making the attack on the market here was the attack made by well-placed British products and consequently you had a rate of duty which caught the British and the other was little more than an embroidery rate.  So, the others were caught in any case on the British and could never get in on the difference between the British and the full rate.</P>
    <P>It may very well be that Irish industrialists will not be worried by the reduction of ten per cent or perhaps 20 per cent but after that, I have no doubt they will have occasion to worry. I have no doubt that they will have occasion to worry even with the 20 per cent reduction in tariffs, which might well be a serious blow to some Irish industries.</P>
    <P>There is an item dealt with here that has an interesting background&mdash; iron and steel files.  The duty on iron and steel files was an <i>ad valorem</i> duty. The tariff was drawn by all the experts who knew how to draw tariffs effectively, after getting a full explanation from the manufacturers of these commodities.It was thought an <i>ad valorem</i> duty would be sufficient to catch the imports which were virtually closing down the only Irish firm which made these commodities.  The tariff against British files was fixed in relation to the number of teeth in a file, that is, from the first sharp point you meet to the last sharp point you meet.  Let us suppose the stock practice was to make the file with 60 teeth. The British competitors made a new <Col N="841" /> file, one with 59 teeth and got in over the tariff wall and no tariff was payable on it.  Or there was another trick. A file has to be a certain width&mdash;let us say, a quarter-inch or five-eighths of an inch.  They changed the depth of it by a fortieth or a fiftieth, sufficient, in any case, to upset the tariff prescription we had imposed.</P>
    <P>It was because of the facility with which they did this that the only way of catching these goods was to put on a minimum tariff per article and that is how the minimum tariff per article in addition to the <i>ad valorem</i> tariff came to be imposed on these files.</P>
    <P>When trading in a world in which that kind of device is regarded as good commercial practice, you may very well find that any reduction in tariffs at all can be utilised to your own disadvantage and to the advantage of the country which wants to send its goods to yours, as practically every one of them wants to do.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I could understand this policy, and can still understand it, so long as there is an early entry on our part into the European Economic Community, but in the absence of any assurance to that effect, I begin to question the wisdom of the policy.  I think you have to prepare for that eventually and for a sudden change-about, which is always a possibility.At the same time, we ought not to have a fixed policy on this.  It ought to be as movable as the occasion necessitates.It ought to be as flexible as the interests of our industries demand and, of course, there is always the outside consideration that the British, in their new economic recovery&mdash;a recovery of which many of their people are prepared to say it is the best they have hit yet and is likely to continue&mdash;may discover that having regard to some of the obligations which the European Economic Community imposes upon them, they would prefer to be clear of it altogether and would prefer to make a deal with some of the emergent countries in the world with which they have had closer ties, perhaps, in the past than they have with some of the countries comprising the present European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>It may very well be that a new <Col N="842" /> Government in Britain might not be as enthusiastic about a European Economic Community as the present British Government are, in which case, whether we wanted to go into the European Economic Community or not, we might find the British not willing to go into it.  In this matter, our trading relations with Britain are so interdependent that economic sanity demands we should do whatever she does, and a separation of our trading interests would be disastrous from the point of view of this country.  In this matter all the right is not on one side and all the wrong on the other.  It is a matter of deciding what is the best policy to adopt in present circumstances and having regard to the imponderable situations that lie ahead.  I should like to find out, apart from the Taoiseach's new-found inclination to go over to the Free Trade Area, whether it is proposed to continue, without regard to the consequences, the policy of reducing tariffs by ten or 15 per cent, irrespective of how far away we appear to be from our membership of the EEC?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have expected on this occasion that we would have got from the Minister some background to the industrial policy of this country, not only in relation to Europe but to the world as a whole.  Only two things emerge from the Minister's short statement to the House: one is that we are still reducing tariffs by ten per cent annually, as was announced by the Taoiseach and the second, that the Government have awakened to the fact that a new feature has presented itself, that the low-cost production countries are beginning to put their goods on the markets of European and other countries to the detriment of home production.  The Minister then says we are imposing certain duties to deal with this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been negotiating and, according to the Taoiseach's remarks in America, are still negotiating for entry into the Common Market.  In view of the fact that we are facing this new situation of low-cost production, we might have had from the Minister an <Col N="843" /> overall statement on industrial policy. I should like the Minister, if possible, to clarify the situation.  First, are we negotiating for entry into the Common Market and, if so, are we negotiating on our own or in conjunction with the United Kingdom?  Has the Minister or any member of the Government, who must be actively concerned with this, any information as to any negotiations that are going on?</P>
    <P>I have listened to many questions posed in this House&mdash;not, I admit, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has not the direct responsibility for it, but to the Taoiseach&mdash; as to what our position is industrially, agriculturally and otherwise in relation to tariffs or any approach we may be making to bring ourselves within the sphere of any international body.  The reply is always entirely negative.  We are not having negotiations with anybody.Every country in Europe is tied up with some international organisation, with the exception, as far as I know, of Iceland and Ireland.  We only know from what the Taoiseach said in America that we are going to be in the Common Market by 1970.</P>
    <P>Is that why the Minister is coming back here and reducing tariffs at the rate of ten per cent annually?  Are we reducing our tariffs at the rate of ten per cent globally or in conjunction with EFTA and EEC?  If we are reducing our tariffs globally, how does that fit into the picture that we are introducing tariffs as against the low-cost production countries?  I entirely sympathise with the Minister's difficulties.I agree the situation at the moment is somewhat complex from every angle.  But when the Minister comes to Dáil Éireann with this important measure, he should have been able to tell us in a few short words what our position is generally.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to something in my own constituency.  A great deal of our control of imports and our trade generally is covered by the quota system.  Every facet of industry and of production has a tariff of some sort imposed, whether that tariff is operative or not.  In many cases, it is not operative, and control is exercised by <Col N="844" /> a quota.  Now we have this ten per cent reduction in tariffs annually, or whatever the rate of reduction will be in the future.  Will the quotas be reduced accordingly?  Will any industry covered by a quota be suddenly told: &ldquo;Your quota will be removed and you will have to move over to the tariff system?&rdquo; Are they to be told suddenly that some agreement has been reached with other countries, whether through the European Economic Community or in a wider sphere, in which the whole pattern of our industry will be altered?  If I were an industrialist &mdash;unfortunately, I am not; if I were, I would be a richer man today&mdash;I would feel very insecure as a result of the Minister's statement.  I would have no clear idea of what the future held for me if I were carrying on business behind a tariff barrier or within the confines of a quota.  As I say, I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister, because he has to carry on under the aegis of the Leader of his Party, who is conducting the operations, if any operations exist for our entry into EEC, and in that regard my guess is probably as good as the Minister's.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what Deputy Norton said about the overall position with regard to Europe being entirely at a standstill.  It would be very inadvisable for anyone directly responsible for negotiating on behalf of the Irish Government to assume that attitude.  One has to remember that France definitely adopted an inflexible attitude last January when she said that the United Kingdom could not get into the Common Market, that she would not negotiate further and that, so far as she was concerned, she would not consent to her entry.  We appear to have faded out of the picture straight away.  In spite of any remarks made by the Government, we are negotiating in conjunction with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Two features have emerged recently, and cognisance should be taken of both.  First, it is vital to the interests of France that there should be an agricultural agreement within the confines of the Six as speedily and expeditiously as possible.  To a certain extent, it is vital to Holland also, but not so <Col N="845" /> vital in her case because she has a good deal of trade with the United Kingdom.  It is also vital for the Six that there should not be any breach in the unity and harmony that has existed and that it should be developed.</P>
    <P>Other countries have expressed the opinion that they want the United Kingdom to come into the Common Market as soon as possible.  From time to time, leading European statesmen have said that, but bearing in mind the fact that France, if she wants to get agreement with her partners must give in to a certain extent.  I say this not to try to show all I know about it but to bring home to the Government that it is possible that France, realising that she must meet her agricultural commitments or must endeavour to get the Six to meet them, is bound to give in and, on the basis of that, I venture to suggest there are negotiations going on at the moment within the confines of the West European Union.  The discussions that took place the other day in the Western European Union, which consists of the Six only and the United Kingdom have been postponed to January but during that interval the experts are considering these matters.  I put it to the Minister that negotiations are likely to start soon.</P>
    <P>It is also possible, as Deputy Norton said, that the United Kingdom may have had second thoughts about joining the European Community on account of the advancing economic success of the other economic organisation to which she belongs, EFTA. Apart from that, there are trade negotiations going on all the time between the Six and the United Kingdom and I take a poor view of it that nobody on the Government Benches&mdash; there should be no secret about it&mdash; has given any indication that Ireland is having any negotiations with anybody or making any effort to get within this comity of nations which is gradually growing.  For that reason, I think it is wrong that the Minister should come in with such an important document as this and not give the House at least a résumé of Ireland's position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the European and the global negotiations that are going on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> The Minister referred to the fact that there is a tariff in respect of purchases of wheat.  Last year, when we had a bad season and the world price of wheat was considerably below the price of Irish wheat, it is a curious thing that the millers were unable to accept Irish wheat and bought <i>ad lib</i> on the foreign market.  I am glad the Minister is imposing a tariff on them so that at least the State may recoup some of the money gained by the millers.  It is significant that this year when the grain situation has changed suddenly and the price of wheat, as a result of purchases by countries that failed to get production due to bad Government, behind the Iron Curtain, China and other places, has gone up, the millers here were able to accept Irish wheat, although in 1962 they turned down 50 per cent of it.  I am glad the Minister is recouping some of the money that august body made out of the Irish farmers and I hope he will remember, if they are buying any wheat outside, to make them pay the full price of it so that Irish farmers will be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow on something which Deputy Esmonde referred to, the question of the possible effects of membership of EEC.  I have been corresponding with the Minister about the matter but when new duties are now being imposed, like Deputy Esmonde, I should like to know what the situation will be, when and if we do join EEC.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, if we are admitted, all quota restrictions will have to go at once and be replaced by new import duties.  That confuses me because I understood originally that all duties within the Community were to be abolished by 1970.  I am not sure how we are to arrange this if some industries are protected by quota at the moment and those quotas will go on the date of our admission.  I cannot see how they can be substituted by import duties, except at a very low level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also share with Deputy Esmonde some concern as to whether the whole question of our protection is being <Col N="847" /> slanted in favour of other members of EEC at the moment or whether we are adopting a policy more in line with President Kennedy's proposals for a general overall reduction of import duties.  It is wise that we should have some bargaining points to use when our negotiations are resumed but if negotiations are to be resumed only shortly before 1970, we shall have very little time to bargain.  If the Minister can give us any indication on these points, I should be glad to hear it, as I am sure other business people would. We are worried as to whether the protection of quotas having been withdrawn, we are going to find that the substitution of import duty would be of very short duration.  If that is so, it is something we should know about now so that we can plan accordingly. If the Minister can give us any indication, we would appreciate it.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we understand in the business community that the Minister is in a difficulty in that he is not his own master and the Government are not their own master as regards reopening negotiations.  There is tremendous speculation and obviously that must be the case for some time so that all we can reasonably ask is an indication as to how the Government's mind is working.</P>
    <P>At one stage in a previous debate, the Leader of the main Opposition, Deputy Dillon, asked the Taoiseach to speculate and the Taoiseach was unwilling to do so and said it was not his duty to indulge in speculation in public, but I am sure the Taoiseach must have some idea of what he proposes to try to do so far as the abolition of tariff protection is concerned.</P>

      <P>Some of the Deputies opposite, I think, spoke with their tongues in their cheeks or with a degree of naïveté that surprises me.  That remark applies particularly to Deputy Esmonde.  This Bill is one of limited application, and I do not know why anybody should feel so offended because I did not range over the whole field of industrial policy.  In so far as the remarks of Deputies have given rise to the need for some clarification from <Col N="848" /> me, I intend now to give that clarification on what our present tariff policy is.  I do not think there is any member of this House or anybody outside it, who thinks responsibly about our present economic position, who does not agree with the declared intention of the Government to seek membership of the European Economic Community. Having applied, I doubt if anybody would disagree with the measures generally taken by the Government to ensure that when we accede to the Community, we should be reasonably fitted for that accession.  One of the measures taken was a gradual reduction of our tariffs and the extension of our quotas consistent with that reduction.</P>
      <P>As the House and the country are aware, when we made our application, we proposed a certain rhythm of tariff reduction to the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community, pointing out that their rhythm of tariff reduction, having already commenced, and having been in operation for some two or three years, it would be unreasonable for them to expect us to enter at the stage of reduction they had reached whenever we did enter.  We proposed, therefore, a rhythm of reduction extending over the period ending 1969 which would, as we thought, suit us best and do the least possible amount of injury to our industries.</P>
      <P>The wisdom of doing that was obvious.  In the first place, it would ensure that our industries would not be subjected to the immediate impact of a severe reduction of some 30 per cent or 40 per cent in our tariffs.  And, as well as that, by adopting the reduction in the early years at the rate of ten per cent, we would ease our industries into the position in which they could withstand a more serious reduction in later years.  Above all, we wanted to ensure that, if we waited until we were members, we would not be subjected to the sudden impact of the degree of free trade existing within the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another purpose, one with which I think people generally agreed, that is, that the rhythm of reduction would, in any event, stimulate our producers <Col N="849" /> into a greater degree of productivity in their output and give them a greater degree of competitiveness.  It is for that reason that, notwithstanding the fact that our application for membership is now suspended, as is the British application, we announced the initial reduction of ten per cent in tariffs and intend to proceed with a further ten per cent reduction as of 1st January next.  Lest anybody is still under any illusion that that ten per cent is ten per cent <i>simpliciter</i>, it is ten per cent of the original rate; in other words, if the original rate of duty is 60 per cent, the reduction is ten per cent of the 60 per cent and the next ten per cent reduction will also be ten per cent of the 60 per cent.  The impact is not as serious as a ten per cent reduction of 60 per cent bringing it to 50 per cent and a ten per cent reduction of 50 per cent bringing it to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>We all agree generally, I think, that we cannot here in this island continue in economic isolation.  The world, as we know, is moving towards freer trade.  At the moment it is doing so through the medium of <i>blocs</i> of States. We cannot, however, ignore the fact that we will have to live in some way in that general economic setup.  At the present time, the countries of EFTA are proceeding towards a reduction of tariffs <i>inter se</i> at a faster rate than the countries of the European Economic Community, so much so that they propose to have their tariffs and other restrictions <i>inter se</i> eliminated by 1966, whereas the European Economic Community countries propose, as far as we know, to have these eliminated by 1967.</P>
    <P>The result of that exercise as between these countries is that there is a freer flow of goods between them. They are becoming more competitive within these Communities and are, therefore, in a better position to export to other countries.  If we did not have our special trading arrangements with Britain, we could not choose to ignore that movement; but because we have special trading relations with Britain, we particularly cannot choose to ignore the movement within EFTA because, within EFTA, the tariff rhythm is quicker, thereby enabling <Col N="850" /> countries which are members of EFTA to get access to the British market at a very fast rate.  In some cases, the tariffs EFTA partners of Britain have to pay are less than the tariffs which our preferential position gives us <i>vis-á-vis</i> Britain.  On that score alone, we would not, I think, be wise to ignore the situation.</P>
    <P>As we all know, our industries will have to depend to a considerable extent on increasing exports in order to survive.Not only that but we will have to depend on our industries increasing exports in order to expand our economy at the rate we propose.  It is obligatory on us, therefore, and on our industrial arm to become more and more competitive, not only to hold our position in the British market and in other world markets, but also to ensure that we will be able to hold that position against countries which, because of reduction of tariffs <i>inter se</i>, are becoming themselves more and more competitive.  If we did choose to ignore the movement, and refuse to make any downward movement in our protection, then I suggest that we would give no stimulus to our industries to proceed towards a situation of greater competitiveness and greater productivity in order to hold and expand our export position.</P>
    <P>That is one good justification for this announced policy of a ten per cent reduction, which has already taken place, and a further ten per cent reduction which will take place at the beginning of next year.  By 1965, it will be a 30 per cent reduction approximately in our overall tariff protection régime.  As well as that, and apart altogether from exports, it is giving our industrialists and those whom they employ a very necessary stimulus to achieve a state of greater competitiveness.</P>
    <P>For many years, from the benches opposite, my predecessor was taunted with accusations about the effects on industry.  The tune seems to be different nowadays.  The taunt is that we are giving away protection for our industries and getting nothing in return.  I submit we are getting a considerable amount in return in that our industries are getting this greater <Col N="851" /> stimulus towards improved efficiency and that we are holding in most cases, and increasing in other cases, our position in the industrial export markets.I think it is a worthwhile exercise if only for that alone.</P>
    <P>Industrialists have come to my Department to say that they welcome this exercise because it has stimulated them and encouraged them to greater efficiency than would otherwise have been attained.  The same applies to quotas.  Side by side with the reduction in our tariffs, it is proposed to expand quotas by the same percentage.  I wonder if Deputy Esmonde did not know that.  I feel sure he did but it is possible he has forgotten.  We did not allow to develop a situation whereby our quotas would suddenly disappear if we gained access to the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Back in 1961, envisaging a possible date of entry that would provide for a reduction in tariffs from January, 1962, we decided to replace quotas by protective tariffs because since the Common Market countries had eliminated quotas among themselves, we would be faced with the situation of the elimination of quotas immediately on entry. We imposed tariffs in place of quotas but immediately suspended the tariffs, allowing the quotas to continue to operate.  Side by side with the reduction of ten per cent in quotas, we reduced those tariffs as well by ten per cent, so there will be no sudden impact on the tariffs that will replace quotas, if and when we join the Common Market and are obliged to get rid of quotas forthwith.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the Taoiseach did not wait until he went to America to announce that we were basing our programme, our policy, on becoming members of the Common Market by 1970.  If Deputy Esmonde cares to read the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, he will see that it is stated quite deliberately there, and that was published several weeks in advance of the Taoiseach's visit to America.  That is still the basis of our policy&mdash;the assumption that we shall become members of the European Economic Community by 1970.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> I do not believe there is any change in Britain's official thinking.  It is not for me to expound what that thinking is, since I am not a member of the British Government, but even the other day the new British Prime Minister, in a speech referring to Britain's application for entry to the Common Market, gave no indication whatever that he or his Government proposed to abandon their application.  With regard to what is happening as far as Britain's application is concerned, I think I could safely say there are no negotiations at the present time, tradewise.  There has been established a means whereby Britain will keep in touch with development within the EEC through the Western European Union, of which, as Deputy Esmonde says, the Six and Britain are members.</P>
    <P>A meeting took place recently which the new Foreign Secretary, Mr. Butler, attended and I take it he continued to play whatever part Mr. Heath would have played if Mr. Butler had not become Foreign Secretary in the meantime.I want to say it is my belief that the appointment of Mr. Heath to the Board of Trade indicates no change whatever in Britain's thinking as far as her application for Common Market membership is concerned.  Rather it takes account of certain changes that have to be effected in the administration, and the fact that Mr. Butler seems to have been designated by the Prime Minister presumably to conduct the discussions in the Western European Union is an indication that his thinking about the Common Market and his desire to become a member of it have not diminished in the slightest.</P>
    <P>As far as Ireland is concerned, we naturally wish to keep in touch with developments within the Common Market and it is possible for us to do so through the normal diplomatic channels, and that is being done. Similarly, Denmark wished to keep in touch and they devised a system whereby they will be kept informed of developments within the Community. Norway is in a different position because of a change of Government which has caused an expression of a different policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Common Market, but as the Taoiseach <Col N="853" /> announced recently in the Dáil, discussions will take place between us and the Common Market countries in the very near future.  Accordingly, the position is that Denmark and ourselves, not being members of the Western European Union, could not keep contact through that medium. Each of us had to make our own arrangements and these have been made.  That is the position up to date and I do not think it needs further elucidation.</P>

      <P>Very shortly, but I would prefer an official announcement to come from both sides, which is the usual form for these matters to take. As far as the future rhythm of tariff reduction is concerned, as I said, it has been announced that we hope to achieve by 1965 this 30 per cent reduction of tariffs and quotas.  Nevertheless, I agree with Deputies opposite that we should not go into this thing willy-nilly, that the time will come when we will have to look around and see where we are going.</P>
      <P>At the present time, we cannot say we are not going in the direction we have set ourselves.  I believe the policy we have set ourselves is in the best interests of industry and of those who work in industry, but when we see that that policy may adversely affect our industries and those who work in them, then I think the House can rely on the Government to take full account of whatever adverse effects may emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only specific case raised here in regard to reduction in tariffs or extension of quotas was that raised by Deputy Cosgrave in reference to the woollen and worsted industry.  I am aware the woollen and worsted industry throughout the country conducted a widespread series of meetings protesting against the ten per cent increase in the woollen and worsted quotas. Naturally, they presented their own case to public representatives and trade union representatives as forcefully as they could.  They did not, of course, take into account that there is another <Col N="854" /> side of the clothing trade affected by import quotas of woollen and worsted cloth, that is, the makers-up, who also are very big employers of labour and whose interests would be affected unless they had reasonable access to the varieties which these quotas provided. I had to take their interests into account as well.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Cosgrave that I have invited the woollen and worsted industry, together with other affected people, to my office to discuss the whole position of the new expansion of the quota.  I do not know whether my invitation reached them or not.  I had expected to hear from them last week but have not heard from them.  However, I am still open to meet them.  I was surprised they did not come this week but I am not suggesting they ignored my invitation. It may not have reached them.  In any event, I have disclosed the position as clearly as I could.  I do not think any Deputy will require me to utter prophecies but I have given the Government's thinking based on the trend of events as we now see them and based on the best interests of Irish industry.</P>

    <Title>Adoption Bill, 1963&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to amend the Adoption Act, 1952.  The amendments that it proposes are not radical, and indeed are entirely in the nature of modifications to a statute which has worked remarkably well and which has already, in the ten years of its existence, brought its benefits to nearly seven thousand adopted children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Adoption Act should have <Col N="855" /> proved so successful is of course a tribute not only to the sound principles on which it was based but to the Board which administers the Act.  From the outset, the Chairman of the Board has been a District Justice: first of all Mr. Ó Donnchadha and, since April, 1962, Mr. Rochford.  The Chairman receives no remuneration for this work, and I am glad to acknowledge, publicly, the dedication that each in his turn has brought to this task.</P>
    <P>As for the other members of the Board, I find it difficult to express adequately the gratitude we as a community owe to them.  That membership of the Board is unpaid is well known.  What may not be so well known is the amount of time that members have to give to the work: it works out, on the average, as something of the order of a whole day per week, every week of the year.  Moreover, some of the meetings are held in various provincial centres and this, of course, means added inconvenience for the members.  This country is well served by people who sacrifice their time and leisure to voluntary work in various Boards of this kind but there can be few Boards, if any, which make such demands on the time of its members as An Bord Uchtála.</P>
    <P>Another most important factor in the successful operation of a system of legal adoption has been the great work that has been done in the past, and that is still being done, by those charitable organisations that actually find adoptive homes for unwanted children, and that are formally registered with the Board as adoption societies.  The majority of adoptions in this country are arranged by these societies and the proportion is increasing: they now deal with nearly 80 per cent of all placements.  They have the responsibility of caring for and maintaining unwanted children, including children who can never be legally adopted, and, where children are eligible and suitable for adoption, the society concerned has the task of seeking and finding families willing and able to adopt them.  It is these societies, therefore, that do all the basic work and the Board's role, <Col N="856" /> vitally important though it be, is supervisory only.  Without the societies, legal adoption in this country would be but a pale shadow of what it is.</P>
    <P>Although the 1952 Act, as it stands, has been a remarkably successful piece of social legislation, I believe that the amendments proposed in the Bill will bring some further definite advantages, and that these advantages can be secured without any attendant risks.  It is, of course, the easiest thing in the world to open wide the gates to more and more legal adoptions but this is a field in which pitfalls are numerous and the greater good of the greater number demands that avoidable risks should not be taken even if this means that adoption is not permitted in some individual cases where it might seem, on the merits, that there was every reason why it should be permitted.  To say that hard cases make bad law may sound like a cliché but it is not the less true for that.  I am, of course, speaking exclusively of legal adoption. The fact that legal adoption, which involves the permanent and irrevocable vesting of parental rights in the adopters, is not permitted in a particular case does not mean that the child cannot be adopted informally and given all the ordinary benefits of family life.</P>
    <P>Most of the amendments proposed in the Bill are based, directly or indirectly, on recommendations made by the Board and, although in some respects the Bill does not go as far as the Board recommended, I think that it goes most of the way and in some respects it goes even a little farther.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, no doubt, have seen the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated with the Bill and I do not think it necessary to repeat here what is already set out in the memorandum.I would like, however, to offer a few additional words of explanation in regard to some of the provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 2 proposes to allow the adoption of legitimated children in certain circumstances&mdash;but not where the birth has been formally re-registered under the Legitimacy Act, 1931. The main object of the section is, <Col N="857" /> as the explanatory memorandum indicates, a practical one.  As long as the law absolutely prohibits the adoption of legitimated children the Board has to have regard to the possibility, in individual cases, that the natural parents may have married in the interval between the giving by the mother of her consent to the adoption and the date the case comes before the Board for decision.  Consequently the Board has, frequently, to make last-minute inquiries, as a safeguard, even though the inquiries are often very troublesome for adoption societies and awkward and embarrassing for the mother concerned.</P>
    <P>Apart from that practical problem, there have been some cases where a child who was eligible for adoption when it was placed with the prospective adopters became ineligible because the natural parents married before the adoption order was made.  In some such cases, the natural parents find themselves unable to acknowledge the child and the barrier to legal adoption has no other result than that the child is kept by the prospective adopters without the benefit of legal adoption or is even sent back to spend its childhood in an institution.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment will meet these problems.  As I have said, it does not propose to allow adoption where the birth has been formally reregistered, and there are two reasons for this.  The first is that it is unnecessary, since the parents who take the step of re-registering the birth are thereby taking a formal decision to acknowledge the child as theirs, and they are not then going to surrender it to a third party.  The second reason is that, since it is unnecessary, it should not be provided for, because to provide for it would be to make an arbitrary legal distinction between legitimated children, as a class, and legitimate children, and the policy of the law has been to avoid such a distinction.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill proposes to allow the Board, at its discretion, to extend by up to two years the time for making an application for an adoption order. Under existing law, the application must be made before the child has <Col N="858" /> reached the age of seven: the amendment will permit that limit to be raised to nine, but only where the child has been in the family since before its seventh birthday.  The object of the amendment is to cater for the occasional case where, perhaps through an oversight, an application for an adoption order is deferred too long or in which an adoption society have not quite satisfied themselves as to the suitability of a prospective adopter.</P>
    <P>The Board recommended that, provided the child was with the family before its seventh birthday, the law should allow its legal adoption at any time up to the age of 21.  Having considered the matter carefully, however, and having had the benefit of advice from persons with long practical experience of adoption work, I came to the conclusion that an extension of two years would meet practically all, if not all, cases of the kind the Board had in mind, and that, on the other hand, it would avoid the difficulties that arise where prospective adopters delay indefinitely a decision whether or not to apply for an adoption order, with the result that the sense of security, which is one of the main benefits which legal adoption can bring with it, is lost.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress that the Board do not recommend any change in the law in so far as it requires that the child be placed with the family before it reaches the age of seven.  I am aware that there have been suggestions from time to time that this is too rigid, and that adoption of older children should be allowed even though&mdash;as is acknowledged by all who have any experience in this field&mdash;the prospects that an older child would ever be completely integrated in an adoptive family are so remote as to be negligible.</P>
    <P>Those who advocate provision for legal adoption of older children say that it would be advantageous even if it did not lead to complete integration. No doubt it would be, in some cases, though the advantages, when one gets down to analyse them, can easily be exaggerated.  The possible advantages, however, are only one side of the story.  The other side is the acknowledged fact that, when it comes to <Col N="859" /> adopting the older child, the risk that adoption will turn out to be a failure increases sharply with the age of the child, and it would need but a few failures of that kind to cast a shadow over the whole system.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude&mdash;and I believe that the Board agrees with this &mdash;is that we should not risk jeopardising the whole structure because of possible benefits in isolated cases, and I may say, at this point, that the same principle applies as regards other suggestions that have been brought to my notice from time to time, such as that we should permit adoption by spinsters or widowers.</P>
    <P>The next point of any significance is in Section 5.  The present minimum age limit for adopters, apart from relatives, is 30 years.  The Bill proposes to reduce the limit to 25 years where a couple have been married for at least three years.  This was recommended by the Board.  I should, perhaps, make clear that there is no implication here that a couple who have not a child of their own after three years of marriage are regarded as permanently childless.  In many cases, such a period would be too short to enable such a conclusion to be drawn while, in others, it might be known from the outset that there could be no children of the marriage.  The period of three years has nothing to do with the question of childlessness and is chosen as one sufficient to enable the couple to have adjusted themselves to married life, and to have had practical experience of the economics of running a house and so on, so that they will be able to form a considered judgment as to whether they wish to take on the responsibility of adopting a child.</P>
    <P>Section 5 also proposes to drop the present requirement that an applicant for an adoption order must&mdash; unless he has resided here for five years&mdash;be an Irish citizen.  As a safeguard against unsuitable adoption, this serves no purpose nowadays, especially since the scope of our citizenship laws was widened considerably by the passing of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  On the other hand, it <Col N="860" /> operates as an arbitrary barrier to some quite suitable adoptions.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill relates to religion.  Under existing law&mdash;Section 12 of the 1952 Act&mdash;the general rule is that an adoption order may not be made unless the applicant, or applicants, the child and the child's mother are all of the same religion.  The Board may, however, having regard to the special circumstances of a particular case, make an adoption order although all these persons are not of the same religion, provided each of them belongs to one of the following religions: the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland, the Religious Society of Friends in Ireland, the Baptist Union of Ireland and the Brethren, commonly known as the Plymouth Brethren.</P>
    <P>This special provision relating to members of specified religious was inserted in the 1952 Act at the joint request of the authorised representatives of those religions.  These representatives and the representatives of the Salvation Army have now jointly requested that the Salvation Army be added to the list.  I think the House will agree that such a request should be met, and Section 6 proposes accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 7 and 8 are really only drafting amendments and call for no comment.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is explained in detail in paragraphs 14 to 18 of the explanatory memorandum and I need not repeat the explanation here.  I should like to say, however, that it is an important section in that it proposes to remove an obstacle to legal adoption that was imposed, quite unwittingly I am certain, by the Oireachtas when passing the Children (Amendment) Act, 1957. The relevant provision of the 1957 Act was introduced by way of amendment in response to some suggestions that were made in the course of the debate, and it is quite clear that the House was not thinking at all in terms of the effects on children placed with a family with a view to legal adoption.  In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that, in its present form, Section 2 of the 1957 <Col N="861" /> Act, if consistently enforced by local authorities, would have gone a long way towards bringing the work of legal adoption to a halt.</P>
    <P>It would have meant, not only that prospective adopters would have been subjected to two quite distinct systems of inspection and supervision, one by the local authority and one by the Board, not to mention supervision by an adoption society as well, but that prospective adopters would have been obliged by law to ascertain and pass on to local authorities particulars which in several cases they did not know themselves, that they did not want to know, and that could, if known to them, be a source of constant anxiety. Of course, in any event, the mere fact of subjecting prospective adopters to two independent systems of official inspection is clearly indefensible and, as I have suggested, I am certain that the House would not have passed such a proposal in 1957 had its implications been realised.</P>
    <P>I am not overlooking the fact that, in other countries, local child welfare authorities carry out inspection of placements that are made with a view to legal adoption but, in these cases, that is the system of inspection that is used, whereas we in this country have a Board&mdash;not a court&mdash;with its own staff and its own specialised inspection system.</P>
    <P>The essence of the amendment in Section 9 is that if the placement of a child is subject to inspection by the Board, it will not at the same time be subject to inspection by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the significant points in the Bill.  As I said at the beginning, the amendments it proposes to make in the 1952 Act are not radical but they will bring some advantages and I think they are worthwhile.On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has indicated, this, generally speaking, might be described as a tidying-up measure.  There are, however, a number of important changes in the Bill, of which two at least are, in my view, not entirely desirable.  I <Col N="862" /> am very considerably surprised to see that one of the rather radical alterations, as I would regard it, which he proposes to make with regard to interim orders contained in Section 7 of the Bill is dismissed by the Minister in his statement as really only a drafting amendment which calls for no comment.</P>
      <P>Time, I think, will not permit me to say very much with regard to that this evening but I hope the Minister will not regard the new powers given under Section 7 of this Bill as merely drafting amendments.  I do not believe they are any such thing and I will give the Minister my reasons later.  Generally speaking, with the exception of the two matters I have in mind and about which I shall speak later, I approve of this measure as a worthwhile one in endeavouring to tidy up some of the matters which have been creating problems for the Adoption Board.</P>

    <Title>Increase in Social Welfare Benefits: Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that following a general increase in wages, a proportionate increase (apart from Budget increases) should be granted immediately to all those in receipt of social welfare benefits, because a general increase in wages is usually followed by a general increase in the cost of living.&mdash;(Deputy Sherwin.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on this motion the other evening, I was pointing out that wage increases, if they are justified by productivity, need not necessarily produce a rise in the cost of living and that even where an increase in the cost of living is influenced by a round of wage increases, there are usually other contributory factors as well and in fact it would not be possible to isolate the effect of the wage increase and grant proportionate increases in social welfare payments. Apart from that, there is the consideration <Col N="863" /> that a general round of wage increases takes some considerable time to develop and, of course, all the increases gained are not of the same amount, so that it would take a considerable time to collect the necessary information on which to base a proportionate increase and Budget time, which is really the most appropriate time for considering increases in social welfare payments, might have come and gone in the meantime.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to the consideration of the motion to look briefly at what has been happening in this regard.  It is clear that under this Government increases in all social welfare rates have more than taken care of increases in the cost of living and that not alone have we taken care of any rises that took place during our own periods of office but we have also covered the periods of Coalition Governments when, generally speaking, social welfare rates remained stationary while the cost of living continued to increase. Contrary to what Deputy O'Higgins said, the figures for the cost-of-living index over the years show clearly that it rose at at least the same rate during the Coalition Government's periods in office.  It was the social welfare rates that remained steady and not the cost of living during those periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give some examples of what has been happening.  Since 1947 the non-contributory old age pension has been increased from 15/- a week to 35/-, which represents 133? per cent increase over 1947 as against a 59 per cent increase in the index.  The rate of the widows' non-contributory pension went from 11/6d. to 33/6d. now, representing a 191 per cent increase.  In the case of a widow with a child, the position is similar and for a widow with four children, the non-contributory pension has gone up from 28/- a week in 1947 to 63/6d. now, an increase of 127 per cent as against 59 per cent rise in the cost of living index. The unemployment assistance man with a wife and two children living in an urban area received 28/- a week in 1947 as against 67/6d. a week now. That is an increase of 141 per cent again as against a 59 per cent rise in <Col N="864" /> the cost of living index.  In the case of a man living in a rural area, the position is even more favourable as the increase has been from 18/- to 59/6d. a week, or a 231 per cent increase.</P>

      <P>15/- a week.  If we go to the social insurance side, there is a similar trend.  In 1952, the rate of unemployment benefit and disability benefit payable to a married man was 36/- and it will be 72/6d. from January, 1964 which is an increase of 101.4 per cent over the 1952 rate when there was an increase in the cost of living index of 30 per cent.  It is obvious that the increases in social welfare rates more than compensate for the rise in the cost of living and, in addition, for any possible increase there may be due to the turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Deputies opposite seem to be concentrating on the position which they forecast will arise after the turnover tax, I can give examples which will show that even in that short-term view, the position has in fact already been taken care of and that the Government have effected an improvement in the position of every social welfare recipient.  The rise in the official cost of living index since August 1962 when the last increases were granted was <Col N="865" /> 1.3 per cent and even if the full effect of the turnover tax is to be felt, an increase of less than four per cent would suffice to compensate for the maximum possible rise in the consumer price index.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of non-contributory and old age pensions has been raised from 32/6d. to 35/-, that is, an increase of approximately eight per cent.  In the case of non-contributory widows' pensions, the increase again is eight per cent for a widow with no dependent child.  In the case of a widow with one child, the increase, taking the children's allowances increase into account, is 11.6 per cent.  For a widow with two children, the increase is 8.7 per cent and if she has four children, it is nine per cent.  In the case of unemployment assistance, the increase for a single urban recipient is 2/6d., that is, a 10.4 per cent increase, while for a married man, the increase is 5/-a week which is an 11.8 per cent increase.If you take children's allowances into account, for a man with one child, the increase is 7/3d. a week which is approximately 14 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course in rural areas again, the rates and the percentage increase would be higher.  The same applies to an even greater degree on the insurance side because there the increases which will be granted from January next are greater and the percentage increases are also greater.  With regard to unemployment benefit and disability benefit, the increase for a single person goes from 37/6d. to 42/6d., a 13? per cent increase as against an increase of less than four per cent in the consumer price index.  For a married man, the increase is from 62/6d. to 67/6d., an increase of 16 per cent and for a married man with one child, there is an increase of 12/3d. on the current rate to 75/6d., again an increase of 16 per cent.  For a married man with four children, taking the children's <Col N="866" /> allowances into account, there is an increase of 14/3d. on 104/6d., which is an increase of 14 per cent.  The same thing applies on the contributory widows' side.  The increase as from January 1964 for a widow with no dependent children is to 42/6d. as against 37/6d., an increase of 13? per cent.  For a widow with one child, the increase is from 53/- to 58/-, plus 2/3d. children's allowance, which is an increase of 14 per cent.  If she has two children, the increase is 11 per cent and if she has three children or four children, the percentage is similar.  The same thing applies with regard to contributory old age pensions.  They will have risen from 45/- to 50/- a week from January, 1964, that is, an increase of 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>In all these cases, not only can we show that over a long period the cost of living increase has been more than taken care of, but, even in the short-term view which some Deputies opposite seem to take, they have been more than taken care of.  As a result of these increases, social welfare recipients will have had diverted to them £6.38 million out of the national income, £4 million in increases in social assistance and £2.38 million in increases in social insurance.  The total cost to the Exchequer is in the region of £4.66 million a year so that I do not think anybody can say the present Government are neglecting their duty in this regard.</P>
    <P>While the motion is not practicable to implement, it is obvious that we have been doing considerably more than adhering to the principle recommended in it.  The present system of giving social welfare recipients their share of increased national income is more expeditious than that suggested in this motion.  The process of working out the average wage increases and the date of the beginning and end of a round of wage increases, matters that are not always easily ascertainable, and applying the result to the social welfare recipients would be a laborious process.</P>
    <P>This Government are committed in many statements made by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and myself not to the principle of giving <Col N="867" /> increases in social welfare benefits proportionate to wage increases but to the much more important principle of ensuring that social welfare recipients get their due share of increased national income.  Speaking on the Budget of 1960, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;The aim of Government policy is to keep expanding our social welfare services in accord with increases in national income as they are brought about.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is only really practicable to do this at Budget time because while increased national income does result in buoyancy of revenue it is only in that fraction of the revenue which will in future be provided by the turnover tax that the increased national revenue will be truly proportionate to the increasing national income.  It is also the practice at Budget time to assess the likely trend of the economy in the coming year so that as a general rule the buoyancy of revenue resulting from increased national income has to a large extent already been taken into account and fully committed.</P>
    <P>Increases in social welfare rates can be dealt with only at Budget time, if we are to adhere to the principles of sound finance which have distinguished this Government from the Coalition Government and which have more than anything else been responsible for the upsurge of the economy of the country.  It may be that one of the benefits of the introduction into our tax structure of an element which will truly reflect increasing prosperity will be that we can draft a formula under which it will be possible to provide automatically for social welfare recipients their share of that increased prosperity.  I shall watch the position in this regard but I think it is more likely that it will always be necessary for the Government to take a positive decision to increase the social welfare rates and, when taking that decision, also to take the decision to finance them, either out of buoyant revenue or specific taxation.</P>
    <P>So long as we have a Government committed to the improvement of social welfare standards, there is not much point in a motion like this.  With <Col N="868" /> wage increases, it is usually only a question of every group gaining roughly a similar percentage increase so that there is little prospect of any one group getting any significant improvement in comparison with another.  I fully realise that in the case of some of our social welfare recipients, it is desirable to effect a relative improvement in their position relative to the general wage rates. There is also the danger that if a motion like this were adopted, the principle enshrined in it would come to be regarded as a sufficiently high target to aim at instead of the much higher objective which we have set ourselves.</P>
    <P>Apart from the practical difficulties I have mentioned, there are considerations which make it impossible to comply with the terms of the motion which urges that following a general increase in wages, a proportionate increase should be made immediately to all social welfare recipients.  Each increase in social welfare rates requires the drafting of a Bill which has to be passed by each House of the Oireachtas.It is only then that all the printing and other administrative arrangements can be put into operation.  If this motion were to be adopted, it would be necessary to establish machinery to study the pattern of wage increases, to decide when a round has started and finished, not always an easy thing to decide, to collect the information necessary to calculate the average increase and to work out appropriate increases for all classes of beneficiaries, including allowances for adult and child dependants and to decide on appropriate increases in the contribution rates for the contributory schemes.  It would then, when all this preliminary work had been done, be necessary to draft the Bill and put it through all Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas before all the printing, posting and other arrangements could be put into operation.  To give an increase after doing all this could hardly be described as doing it immediately.</P>
    <P>If all that had to be done, it is hardly likely that the present process of examining the position in connection with the Budget would continue.  The present process is a much more suitable <Col N="869" /> one because the procedure for implementing increases granted in the Budget is now more or less automatic. The motion appears to visualise that there might be two increases in some years.  A decision to give an increase takes a considerable time to implement. With increases granted in the Budget, which is usually about April, it is found possible to pay the increases for the assistance classes only in August and for the insurance classes in January.  If there are to be two increases in some years, it would mean that arrangements for a second small increase would be put in hands before the first had actually been paid at all and we would have the position then of pension books and insurance stamps being out of date before they were issued.  We would have the system of these gummed slips being affixed on top of others and overprints on top of overprints.</P>
    <P>At present, then, we have a Government with a declared policy of effecting a relative improvement in the position of social welfare recipients generally and a Government with a record of eight Bills in six years effecting increases and improvements.  It appears to me that the adoption of the principle as advocated here, attractive though it may seem at first sight, would only have the effect of hindering the present more comprehensive process of improvement with, as I have said, also the danger of the more narrow approach eventually prevailing.  So, while I accept the principle that social welfare payments should not be allowed to lag behind wage rates, we have, in fact, got a higher objective than that.</P>
    <P>Then there is the fact that it is just not possible to do what is proposed. A round of wage increases often takes a year or more fully to develop and then you have to examine it, collect the information as to increases gained by various sectors, work out an average, draft a Bill, put it through the Dáil and the Seanad and go through all the other arrangements.  That would take some time.</P>
    <P>So I think the motion would, in fact, only have the effect of delaying increases which might otherwise be given at Budget time and that would be <Col N="870" /> attractive only to a Government that was anxious to save money at the expense of social welfare.  We are not anxious to do that.  We are always prepared, and it is our policy, to see that social welfare recipients get their due share of increasing national income.</P>

We were as wise when he sat down with regard to the Government's intentions relating to this motion as we were about Deputy Carroll's intentions last week when he sat down, having spoken on the motion in relation to the turnover tax.  Would the Minister inform us even now whether the Government are accepting or rejecting Deputy Sherwin's motion? Will he say specifically, one way or another, what the Government propose to do?  Are the Government accepting the motion?  If they are, naturally, the contribution of every Deputy following the Minister will be influenced by the acceptance of the terms of the motion by the Government.If, on the other hand, the motion is being rejected, obviously, another type of argument will have to be advanced.

      <P>The Government are not satisfied with the wording of this motion?  They are not prepared to implement it&mdash;to accept it?  Now we know.</P>
      <P>The Minister said wage increases need not influence the cost of living. Is there any member of the House who can subscribe to this point of view? Surely the experience down through the years has been that wage increases have affected and influenced the cost of living?  Is not the wage structure in our economy a predominant factor, at least, a noteworthy factor, in our costings?  Did we not have at one time a proposal by the Government to introduce a wages standstill order, under extremely heavy penalties, so as to help the economy?  That was the view of the Government then.  There were documents left after the present Taoiseach in the Department of Industry and Commerce relative to his proposals to implement a very strong policy, to pursue a wages standstill order under pain of the heaviest punishment for those who would transgress the laws that he intended to implement relative to the control of the cost of living, expressly for that purpose, as part of the big plan he had in mind at that time&mdash;one of the plans that were not allowed to come to fruition because of the wisdom of the people in 1947 in ensuring that he would not be any longer in that Department to pursue that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of this motion presuppose that following a general increase in the cost of living, there will be a general increase in wages.  It is also true that following a general increase in wages there would be an increase in the cost of living.  That has been proved times out of number.  It is not so long ago that the Taoiseach and the Government came before this House and asked the country to accept a pay pause, a pale version of the original grand plan to control wages and salaries.  There were presented to us at that time in the House the dire <Col N="872" /> effects that would fall upon the economy if wages and salaries were allowed to soar, with a consequential increase in the cost of living.  Now, a member of the Government who advanced that case so strongly through the House to the country informs us coldly that, in fact, wage increases need not influence the cost of living.</P>

      <P>What we know is that the cost of living has gone up. That statement is incontrovertible.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;even though they are producing more and working harder.  Deputy Sherwin's motion comes at a very suitable time because the thing which Deputy Sherwin apprehends has come to pass.  The Government have deliberately inspired a spiral of cost of living increases.  They have invited people to compensate themselves for the impact of the turnover tax and any trouble that may be involved in its administration, by employing increases they may decide themselves.  They are not limited to the terms of the 2½ per cent turnover tax in respect of which the Minister claims adequate compensation has been made to social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must know as well as every one of his colleagues, as well as <Col N="873" /> every consumer in the country, the increases that have taken place in essential commodities preparatory to the introduction of the turnover tax. For a month before the implementation of the turnover tax, was it not known to the housewives in the city of Dublin, in the city of Cork, going into every store and every shop, that the price of bacon, flour, tea, of every single commodity they have to purchase, has gone up?</P>
    <P>The Minister tries to persuade the House that in effect the social welfare recipients are better off in consequence of the compensatory benefits for which arrangements have been made to make up for the impact of a 2½ per cent increase in the cost of the necessaries of life.  I remember a time when another Minister for Finance, not a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, was discriminatory in his taxation when preparing his Budget Statement.  He took care to relieve the impact of taxation on the simple luxuries of the social welfare classes.  Plug tobacco, which is the main simple luxury of the old age pensioner, was excluded from the impact of taxation specifically to guarantee to the social welfare recipients that they could have their little luxuries.</P>
    <P>Has that been done now?  The Minister gave us a figure of £4.66 million in one year as being the charge this Government will have to meet in order to pay increased social welfare benefits.  For weeks and weeks, they have been challenging us and asking: &ldquo;Where can the money be got to pay the increases in social welfare benefits?&rdquo;We must omit social insurance, because that is not met from the Exchequer.  Despite all the talk, this is the amount involved in coming to the assistance of the social welfare recipients in the coming twelve months.</P>
    <P>To meet that, would direct taxation on luxuries equal to the increases of the past fortnight not bring in sufficient revenue?  I challenge the Minister to deny it.  The increases announced on the bottle of stout, the pint, cigarettes, plug tobacco and petrol would bring in approximately £6 million.  Somebody is now extracting this money from the <Col N="874" /> pockets of the consumer.  He is paying to the same extent as if the Minister had decided to impose specific taxation to do a particular job.  The country are paying the piper, but who is calling the tune?  If the amount being extracted from the consumer does not arrive in the coffers of the Minister for Finance, whose fault is that?  We had been told that these goods could not bear any further taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir.  It was not a difficult task because it was so obvious.  In view of its being so obvious, I am amazed that the Government could not accept the terms of the motion of their friend, Deputy Sherwin.  He obviously is fearful of the consequences of the Government in precipitating this unheard of increase in the cost of living.  People in organised labour and in State and semi-State employment are in the position to demand and secure their legitimate claims consequent on increases in the cost of living.  But that does not take into account those in the community who are self-employed, who will also have to pay these increased living costs but will have no increased income.  Those people who will legitimately secure increased incomes in order to maintain their ordinary level of living will cause the spiral to ascend still higher.  It is obvious that the mover of the motion had this in mind.  This is an urgent state of affairs and in the circumstances a request is made to the Government not to permit a worsening of the lot of the people in receipt of social welfare because of increases in the cost of living.  However, that is not being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a flood of figures from the Minister of comparisons of cost of <Col N="875" /> living figures, but until he was challenged he did not indicate that the last cost of living figure he used was in respect of August last.  He specifically omitted the fact it was since August last we have had this leap upwards in the cost of living.  This was not influenced by any external sources but was caused, simply and solely, by the policy pursued by the Minister and his colleagues in the Government.  The demand could legitimately be made that no matter how an increase in the cost of living was actuated these people should be protected from it.  But when it is deliberately caused by the calculated action of the Government themselves, surely it is impossible for the Government to withhold the necessary arrangements to compensate those affected so severely by the consequences of deliberate Government action?</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is surprising that the Government could not see their way to accept the terms of this motion.  It will be recalled that even when there were external circumstances affecting the cost of essential commodities&mdash;circumstances completely outside the control of any Government&mdash;deliberate action was taken to guarantee that the effect on these people would be minimised.  The House will recall that at a time when the cost of tea was increased special arrangements were made by the Government then in office, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to ensure that the lot of these people would be eased by providing them with a special ration of tea at Christmas time to compensate for the increased price they would have to pay for tea throughout the remainder of the year.  That is an example of where a Government were careful, even in the case of influences having their origin thousands of miles from this country, to play their part in guaranteeing that these people would not suffer monetary loss as a consequence of the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>Yet here we have the situation in which a Government are pursuing a policy of making it possible for people to be charged, as we know they are <Col N="876" /> being charged today, in excess of the proposed figure of 2½ per cent.  We have no indication from the Government, through the Minister for Social Welfare, that they intend to meet the situation relative to wage demands consequent on increases in the cost of living which will confront them in a short time, and as a consequence of which there may be a still further rise in the cost of living.  They should be prepared to meet that situation by ensuring that social welfare recipients' incomes will not diminish and that the value of the amounts which are at a particularly low level in comparison with other countries and which, unfortunately, we have seen fit to pay these people, will not be further reduced by having the value of their benefits further dissipated by increased costs of necessaries of life and of the simple luxuries which are not taken into account in the cost of living figure.</P>

      <P>The Minister was somewhat unfair to himself in that, in the 20 minutes I heard him speaking, he had been tying himself up in administrative knots.  As regards this motion and as far as possible in regard to social welfare, he invoked every administrative difficulty in an effort to show why this particular motion could not be implemented.  I do not know the reason for that.  As far as I can understand Deputy Sherwin's motion, it is couched in such general terms that it should be acceptable to the Minister and to the Government.  It reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, following a general increase in wages, a proportionate increase (apart from budget increases) should be granted immediately to all those in receipt of social welfare benefits, because a general increase in wages is usually followed by a general increase in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have many academic arguments on the last phrase, whether the increase in wages comes because there has been an increase in the cost of living or whether the increased cost of living came because of an increase in wages.  I think that is not what Deputy Sherwin was trying to get at but rather <Col N="877" /> acceptance by the Government of some plan to provide against difficulties that may arise in regard to the standard of living and to provide that there would be some overall plan to ensure&mdash;to use a phrase well-worn by the Government in the past few months&mdash;that those in receipt of social welfare benefits will get a fair share of the national cake.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin said at the beginning of his motion: &ldquo;following a general increase in wages.&rdquo;  That may not be the appropriate time or opportune time but what I read into the motion is that the Deputy wants to ensure that there will be some regularity in the payment of social welfare increases.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wants me to applaud him for anything he has done as Minister for Social Welfare for these people, I applaud him for it but I say the Government should accept this broadly worded motion, if they are to be consistent.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has tried to represent the Government as a planning Government.They want to plan most things. This may be only lipservice to the idea of planning, an idea which he probably got through listening to Labour members here for the past 40 years.  We always welcome a conversion in that respect or any respect but we want evidence of his sincerity in wanting to plan.  He wants to plan production, to plan for wages, but neither he nor the Minister for Social Welfare seems to be willing to accept Deputy Sherwin's suggestion to plan for social welfare and there is no evidence, despite what the Minister has said and despite the increases he has listed, of any regularity or plan to provide for old age pensioners, widows and orphans, sick people or unemployed people and the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has talked about administrative difficulties in providing regular increases coinciding with an increase in the cost of living or an increase in wages or increased production.He is talking of the difficulty of getting books, of having to put on stamps for the extra amount, the difficulty of implementing legislation, <Col N="878" /> the long delay in putting it through this House, the difficulty of getting a Bill through, then through the Seanad and then back here again and getting it signed by the President.  We know these things may be difficult but if the will is there, I suggest all his difficulties will be surmounted.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that they have taken care of the various increases in the cost of living index figure.  Conceding that without examination over the past five or six years since he became Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;it may well be&mdash;I think we should be much more ambitious as far as old age pensioners are concerned than merely keeping them in step with the cost of living. We are not concerned with the past but with the future and to some extent with the present.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his arguments about social welfare always seems to say what was not done by what he terms the Coalition Governments of 1948-51 and 1954-57.  I do not want to go back to those periods nor do I want to go back to the period during which Fianna Fáil were in office from 1932 to 1948, for 16 years when the old age pension stood at 10/-.  Let that be the last comment on that.  Our ambition for the old age pensioners and the like should be not merely to keep them in step with increases in the cost of living which would mean that they would never have a decent standard but I think our first task, perhaps even before Deputy Sherwin's idea is implemented, is to establish a good standard.Then you could give increases in step with the cost of living or increased production or increased wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not want any of these methods but he wants his Minister for Finance to have a free hand in every Budget to decide there and then what will be given and the usual thing&mdash;I do not say this in respect of the last Budget or the one before it&mdash; is for a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance to take care of everybody else first and if there is anything left, <Col N="879" /> devote it to the old age pensions.  We must get away from that.</P>
    <P>One gets the impression from the Minister for Social Welfare that this Government are the champions of the social welfare classes.  They try to imply that this turnover tax was introduced to meet the demands of the Minister for Social Welfare but Deputy O'Sullivan has shown, as was shown last week, that the turnover tax was not necessary to pay for the social welfare increases.  One gets the impression from various Ministers and from the Minister for Social Welfare that now that the turnover tax is introduced, a tax that will take in £11 million per annum, the old age pensioners are going to be better off. Surely it is a shabby trick, deceitful and fraudulent, that in any year in which we expect to get £11 million from the turnover tax and £5 million extra from other taxation, all we still give to the old age pensioner is 2/6d. a week.</P>
    <P>They may talk about the 2/6d.  I gave as Minister for Social Welfare in 1955 but we did not attempt to extract money from the pockets of these poor people by increasing the price of essential foodstuffs.  If they got an extra 2/6d. then, they were not being fed their own tail but got it as a result of taxes that did not affect them and, therefore, it was a real increase, and not just the miserable halfcrown, and I say &ldquo;miserable&rdquo; deliberately in relation to circumstances in which we raise taxation to the extent of £16, £17 or £20 millions through the turnover tax, the corporation profits tax, et cetera.  The Minister for Social Welfare should, I think, hear these figures again because he tries to give the impression that, as they get in more money, the old age pensioners and all other social welfare recipients get more.</P>
    <P>For the financial year 1961-62, of total Government revenue, social welfare got 16.9 per cent.  In 1963-64, when we are taxing tea, bread, butter, sugar, flour, milk and all other foodstuffs, it is still 16.9 per cent.  Who can say, therefore, that old age pensioners, and the like, are receiving their <Col N="880" /> share of the national cake?  One would imagine that in a year in which we expect to get so many millions by way of turnover tax, we would have departed from this miserable increase of 2/6d. per week.  I suggest that there must be and should be some yardstick by which we could measure increases to social welfare recipients.  Whether it should be, as Deputy Sherwin suggests, a wage increase or not, or whether it should be related to tax revenue, which would possibly be a good idea, or not, we still do not know from the Minister.  Whether we should relate it, as the Taoiseach wants to relate wages, to national production, we still have not heard from the Minister.He still wants a free hand to be able to keep the old age pensioners on tenterhooks until each Budget day so that the poor creatures will go on worrying as to whether or not, depending on the whims of the Minister for Finance, they will get an increase.</P>
    <P>As far as the Labour Party are concerned&mdash;the Minister or some Deputy in his Party may ask where will they get the money; &ldquo;when you people will not vote the money to us&rdquo;&mdash;I want to tell the Minister now that, if there is a direct tax proposal in this House, which the Minister for Finance states is to be devoted to social welfare recipients, the Labour Party will vote for it, provided it is not money taken out of the pockets of the recipients.  That is the main reason we refuse to give our support to a turnover tax which means taxing food and the necessaries of life for these people.  One or two years ago, we were criticised by the Fianna Fáil Party when we voted against their Budget proposals, but these, again, were proposals that included an increase to social welfare recipients, plus proposals for the raising of a relatively big sum of money, of which a very small proportion was to be devoted to old age pensioners and social welfare recipients; that was the reason we voted against those Budget proposals on that occasion.</P>
    <P>As far as social welfare recipients are concerned, this is a slap in the face to them by Fianna Fáil.  On the one hand, they have to pay tax on foodstuffs, whilst, on the other hand, tremendous relief is given to those in <Col N="881" /> the surtax group.  The Minister for Finance was asked a specific question here last week and we were glibly told, in reply, that within a period of five years, the number required to pay surtax was reduced from 10,000 to 4,000. That, of course, is consistent with Fianna Fáil policy because they wish to place the emphasis on indirect, or hidden, taxation as against what we, in the Labour Party, believe in, namely, the taxation of wealth and high incomes.  Fianna Fáil do not believe in that policy.  We believe in it because we believe social welfare should and must be sustained to some degree, in any case, by those who can afford to give by way of extra taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister was talking a lot of nonsense, I think, when he said that the old age pensioners, those in receipt of unemployment assistance and sickness benefit have been, or will be, compensated by the increase which the Minister for Finance announced in his Budget.  The old age pensioners get an increase of 2/6 on 32/6 which, as far as I can calculate, is an increase of about seven or eight per cent.  Now there is no use in the Minister talking to me about the cost-of-living index figure when we are talking about old age pensioners because the cost-of-living index figure has no relation in the wide earthly world to the type of things these people buy.  They are concerned with the purchase of food.  They are concerned with the purchase of the bare necessaries and these have increased in the past three, four or five years much more than the cost-of-living index figure itself.</P>
    <P>I trust I have made myself clear on that point.  I have examined these figures in relation to the prices of foodstuffs, in relation to rents, fuel, and such different items, items on which these people are depending, and they have all increased to some extent beyond the overall cost-of-living index figure.  The Minister ought to know that the old age pensioner now who buys a loaf must pay another halfpenny.That is much more than four per cent; it is certainly much more than 2½ per cent.  As far as I can gather from Deputies, milk has gone <Col N="882" /> up by one halfpenny per pint.  That is an increase of 8½ per cent.  As far as I know, butter has gone up by 2d. per lb.  That will certainly mean extra expenditure on the part of those in receipt of social welfare.  I am informed by the people in my home town that meat has increased by a few pence per lb.  Soap has gone up.  So have cigarettes and tobacco.  I am sure they do not indulge in these to a very great extent, but they have gone up.  Coal has gone up by £2 per ton.  All these increases in the cost of these essentials are far beyond the liberal figure of four per cent the Minister has just quoted as representing the possible increase in the cost of living with the introduction of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I support the general idea behind Deputy Sherwin's motion.  That is not for any political motive because I have spoken in similar strain before.  We all know, and it has often been said to us by various Ministers on the Front Bench, that the motion may be badly drafted or badly worded; indeed, they pick out certain words to show how silly or how stupid it may be.  After the speeches we have heard from the various members on this side, I think the Minister ought to know exactly what is in our minds: social welfare increases ought to be related to something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think social welfare recipients ought to be fortified with the knowledge that, if there is an increase in the cost of living, they will get a proportionate increase in their pensions or allowances.  I know this is a new departure, but what I am trying to tell the Minister is that, if Government policy is to be consistent, if all other things are to be related to production&mdash;and production, the Taoiseach said, must have relation to wages&mdash;then Deputy Sherwin's motion should be certainly accepted by the Minister and by the Government.</P>
      <P>If they want to relate wages to production, surely it is not unreasonable that they should plan social welfare benefits also to relate to wages and production.  I would go for that idea, or, better still, for the idea propounded by a former Fianna Fáil Minister for Social Welfare, and certainly by Deputy Kennedy when he was Parliamentary Secretary, that increases in social benefits would be given as the money came in by way of tax revenue. I have shown tonight and on other occasions that, despite the fact that tax revenue has increased, the proportion devoted to social welfare recipients has decreased.  We would support the idea that social welfare benefits should be related, as national prosperity is related, to wages, national production or tax revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated, in effect, that this motion is unnecessary by reason of the fact that it is the declared policy of the Government to improve the relative position of social welfare beneficiaries one year with another.  Deputy Corish made it very clear that there has been no relative improvement in the position of old age pensions since the Minister took office and that the latest increase of 2/6d., which he described as miserable, is not even compensation for the increases in the cost of living brought about by the turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, as the proposer of the motion said last week, the real value of the 35/- a week old age pension at present paid is not very much more than the 5/- a week old age pension <Col N="884" /> introduced by Lloyd George 50 years ago.  The Minister seems to accept the proposition that it is sufficient to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, that it is sufficient to meet the increases in the cost of food and clothing brought about by the new tax.  I am sure the Minister is as well aware as I am that there are 10,000 old age pensioners in this city living on the verge of starvation, that if it were not for the work of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other such bodies, their situation would be very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>Bread and scrape is the staple diet of many of them.  I readily concede the Minister is administering one of the most expensive Departments of State, that social services are at present costing us about £20 million a year, of which approximately £10 million is going to non-contributory old age pensioners, on whom the emphasis in this debate so far has been laid. Approximately half the moneys allocated to social welfare is being devoted to old age pensions to which Deputy Sherwin, proposing this motion last week, attached considerable weight.</P>
    <P>The old age pension problem is becoming more serious year by year by reason of the improvement in geriatrics.  As the last speaker said, we do not appear to have any long-term plan or even short-term plan.  We do not appear to have considered the principles on which our pension policy should be based.  We do not appear to have had any regard to the improvement in geriatrics and to the fact that there are now a growing number of old people year by year depending on a declining population of workers and that the burden of providing for old age pensioners requires close examination, requires the implementation of a plan.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the old age pensioners in my constituency and in Deputy Sherwin's constituency, living in miserable accommodation, eking out a miserable existence on bread and scrape and tea.  It seems to me the position of old age pensioners in Deputy Sherwin's constituency and in mine is much worse than that of old age pensioners in other parts of the <Col N="885" /> country.  The problem in Dublin is far greater than in rural Ireland and I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister who must be aware that in certain parts of the country it is the practice for a small farmer to sign over his land to a son or daughter so that he will qualify for the old age pension.</P>
    <P>That person is not in as dire a plight as are Deputy Sherwin's constituents. I have been told by Deputies that in their constituencies, when an old person qualifies for the old age pension, there is considerable rivalry among the members of the family as to which of them should accommodate that person who has then a cash income.  The old age pensioner in Dublin has an acute rent problem, an acute problem in relation to the provision of fuel, and in fairness to the Minister, it should be said that old age pensioners in rural parts do not appear to have these problems.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that the time has now come when the problem must be approached on a differential basis.  In other countries, this is done, consideration being given to the higher cost of living in the city areas.  I think that would be a constructive proposal.  It is a matter of consequence to all of us that social services are costing this country £20 million, while the working population, the people providing the moneys, are declining and the number qualifying for social services is growing.  A million pounds devoted to social welfare does not go a long way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I must make it clear that no one on this side of the House is satisfied with the Fianna Fáil policy of maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, giving a miserable increase of half-a-crown a week which purports to maintain the existing standard of living of social welfare beneficiaries.  What Deputy Sherwin has in mind is an upgrading of social welfare benefits and that has not been done.  Since Friday last, it has become very clear <Col N="886" /> that the real increase in the cost of living brought about by the turnover tax on articles of staple diet and of clothing purchased by social welfare recipients is far more than the halfcrown a week provided in last year's Budget.</P>
    <P>If it is the case, as Deputy Norton alleged, that all other needs are considered first and that for social welfare benefits, what is left over is availed of, that is a state of affairs which we must no longer condone.  The motion may not be excellently drafted but the principle to which it attempts to give effect is a good one and is one which we are supporting.</P>

      <P>Last year, I said that the ceiling was fixed in 1952 and has never been changed since, despite the increased cost of living and now the <Col N="887" /> 2½ per cent I voted for.  Indeed the ceiling fixed prevents a person from receiving an old age pension if he is in receipt of another pension after 30 or 35 years of work in some occupation. That is an important matter to which the Minister should give consideration as soon as he can.</P>
      <P>Take the position of a worker in the Dublin Corporation who, after 30 or 40 years' service, gets £4 10s.  He is an old age pensioner who has had to restrict himself and deny himself so much.  I do not think the House will be divided on the question of increases to old age pensioners and I am sure the Minister will do his utmost to see that this section of our people are helped. If he does not, of course, he just makes it so much harder for me as a Deputy who supported this 2½ per cent on essential commodities which the old age pensioners have to face.  As has been said by Deputy Byrne, commodities such as tea, bread and maybe an odd rasher are considered to be more or less the staple diet of the old age pensioner and there is now a 2½ per cent increase on those items.</P>

      <P>It is nearer 20, the point I am trying to bring out, and consequently I feel that possibly some of the contempt, ridicule and condemnation to which I have been subjected is in a way justified.  The old age pensioners are a section who no longer can work for themselves or do anything for themselves.  The younger section of the people can certainly work overtime or make some sacrifice.  I trust, therefore, the Minister will see the justification for this motion and help the old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be ruled out of order by adverting to anything other than what is within the terms of the motion but certainly I have nothing about which to condemn myself in regard to old age pensioners, or indeed recipients of social welfare benefits. I hope the Minister, as a result of this motion, will improve the amounts of benefit to old age pensioners and give <Col N="888" /> special consideration to those who reach pensionable age but are debarred because of a ceiling imposed in 1952. I am not a very good mathematician and I do not know how much the cost of living has gone up since 1952, but certainly the ceiling has not gone up. It would be in the country's interest, in the old age pensioners' interest and indeed in the Minister's interest if that were remedied.</P>

      <P>The House should be very cautious about accepting the statement of the Minister that the Government were prepared to accept in principle what is involved in this motion.  Principles to this Government are as common and as cheap as pebbles on the beach.  It is not so many years since the Government accepted a motion in this House to increase the school-leaving age.  It was three years ago and we have never had a sign that it was being put into operation. It is very easy to accept things in principle when you are in Fianna Fáil but to put the principle into practice is a completely different thing.</P>
      <P>I suggest that there is only one possible way for the idea behind this motion to be implemented, or to be brought home to the Government, that is, to show the volume of support for it by voting in favour of it. Otherwise, this motion is going to appear to the public as a bit of vote catching to save individuals in this House from the wrath of the old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients.  There is only one way to show our sincerity for the social welfare beneficiaries, that is, by voting in this House to ensure that a planned approach is made by the Government to the social services generally.  There is a golden opportunity here between now and tomorrow night to bring it home to this Government, who are teetering, that the members of this House are more concerned with the welfare of the old age pensioners than with the welfare of those people who are in the surtax bracket.</P>

    <P>What can we think of a Government who says that there are too many people paying surtax and that they would reduce the figure from 10,000 <Col N="889" /> people to 4,000, that it was a hardship on those in the income category which ranges from £15,000 to £20,000 a year to ask them to pay surtax?  They could do nothing for the old age pensioner other than give him an increase of 2/6d which is swallowed up long before the amount is paid.  A Government who put the welfare of the surtax class, the dance-hall proprietors and the other elements who have money to burn, before the welfare of the needy, the sick and the elderly, are not worthy of support.  There is only one way to bring it home to these people, that is, to frighten them sufficiently to make them realise that unless they toe the line in this matter, their days are numbered.  I hope the Deputies will realise that the Government will give nothing to the old age pensioners unless they are forced to do it.</P>
    <P>What is the general approach in our community today to social welfare generally?  Is it not a fact that we look upon it as a matter of charity?  Is it not a fact that were it not for voluntary organisations and their efforts, a large portion of the old and the sick would be actually dying day by day from starvation and neglect?  The Government have shelved their responsibility for the poorer and needier sections.I want to say this to the Government: fifty years ago, 5/- bought as much for the old age pensioner as the 35/- is buying for him today.  If we look at the changes in society, the scientific marvels of the world, and the amenities which science has brought to the human race, can we accept that a purchasing power which is only the same as it was 50 years ago is a fair indication of the way we should treat those people who are not in a position to look after themselves?</P>
    <P>The amenities available to the wealthier and more vigorous sections of the community, the improvements brought about by science and developments of all sorts, are not available to our old age pensioners.  There are still no allowances made for them except in regard to the very fundamentals, just enough to keep them alive.  There has been no change.  For instance, a television set is looked <Col N="890" /> upon today as an essential amenity in the city and it is becoming an essential amenity in the country.  Has there been any attempt by the Government to consider that a television set or wireless set should be regarded as a right in social welfare benefits?  We hand over matters like that to voluntary organisations.  The Government had no time and no money.  We have always been told there is no money.  For the benefit of certain Deputies who are helping the Government to fill the kitty, let it be understood that if things go according to the Government's plan, they will have an extra £20 million or £21 million to play about with.  The time is ripe to plan so that the more needy sections of the community are catered for before the greedier ones get their hands into the bag.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long it will be before the Government plan a regulated increase in social benefits.  The Taoiseach on numerous occasions within the past 12 months has sought to impress upon the old people, the workers and other sections of the community, that Fianna Fáil is a Party of the Left, that it is going left, or, in other words, becoming socialistminded.If that is true, the first people who should get priority in Government spending are those in the needy sections of the community.  It is by their deeds you shall know them and if we accept the Taoiseach's remarks as being true, then we must expect that they would be followed by a practical gesture, so that in this particular instance the old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients would get what they are fully entitled to.  There is no use at this stage talking about 2/6d. or 5/- a week.  They must be given a sufficient allowance to enable them to enjoy meagre comforts of this life.  They are not getting those at the moment and it is no use for the Government to pretend that the miserable increase which is being given is of any benefit whatever.  I am very pleased that Deputy Sherwin has tabled this motion and as far as our small group is concerned, he will have our full support in pressing the Government to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has gone on for a considerable time and almost every facet of local government administration has been examined, with emphasis on the housing situation. So much has been said about the administration of the Minister's Department that there is little left for me to cover.  I want to confine my remarks to the problems that confront us in the Southern Committee of Cork County Council and our housing problems in that area.  Last week, Deputy Corry spoke in this debate and used pretty strong language.  He gave the Minister some advice which it would be preposterous for him to take, namely, that he should use a heavy boot on some officials of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a practice in this House when officials of Departments are attacked that the Minister responsible for those Departments should make it clear that he is the person solely responsible to this House for the administration of his Department.  If I am now offering criticism of a Department, I am directing it to the head of the Department, the Minister for Local Government.I consider it unfair that any Deputy should be permitted to make an attack on the staff of the Department such as that made by Deputy Corry.  These attacks are repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> at meetings of the local authorities and are reported in the newspapers.  Only today the <i>Cork Examiner</i> again reports the type of scurrilous abuse levelled at the heads of the particular officers of the Minister's Department, all with the intention <Col N="892" /> to divert criticism away from the Minister responsible.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the methods used by some members of that authority in attacking officials of the Minister's Department.  They do that to curry favour amongst people who are awaiting decisions from the Department while at the same time not wishing to oppose their own Minister by criticising him.  The Minister has gone on record, on the occasion of his frequent departures from this country, as levelling criticism at the heads of members of local authorities and of local officers for their lack of attention to the housing needs of the people; but I contend that if there are individual local authorities in the country who are not alive to their responsibilities in this regard, the Minister should deal specifically with them.  It is not good enough for him to make a blanket condemnation of the entire housing authorities of the country or of their officers.</P>
    <P>There are local authorities that are diligent, hardworking and sympathetic to housing proposals put before them by public representatives.  I want to say of the Cork housing authority in the southern area that they are a dedicated body of men of action and that they work as one concentrated body in their efforts to expedite the arrangements that have to be made over far too protracted a period to get houses built.  The members of the sites committee go out to assist the more technical people and they try to ease over any difficulties that may be met with by the engineers in the selection of the more suitable sites.  They are presented with a monthly report on the progress of the various schemes for which the housing authority are responsible.</P>
    <P>Here last week I listened to Deputy Noel Lemass express horror at the fact&mdash;I am accepting his word that it is a fact&mdash;that there was a time when a delay of as long as three months was experienced before sanction was given by the Department.  This was presented to us as being an extraordinary delay.  From our experience over the past five months in the Cork housing authority, we would regard a <Col N="893" /> delay of three or four months as a very short one.  We regard ourselves as being extraordinarily lucky if we can get sanction in a three month period.  I know it will distress the heart of Deputy Noel Lemass to hear what I have to recite in relation to our experiences regarding this matter of sanction.</P>
    <P>There is one applicant for a house whose home I pass six times a week. He is living under appalling conditions on the road between Bandon and Cork. On 11th August, 1962, I was in a position to inform this man, who was providing his own site, that the housing authority intended shortly to make a compulsory purchase order and that he could expect that within a reasonable period building would start.  What has happened since then?  The compulsory purchase order was made by the Housing and Sanitary Services Committee at 7 Father Mathew Square, Cork, on 31st December, 1962.  It was sent to the Minister for confirmation on 8th January, 1963.  Can it be alleged that the local housing authority was remiss in its duty on that occasion? The order was made on 31st December and it was forwarded on 8th January.</P>
    <P>We have not yet got sanction for the 13 houses to be built under this order. This matter was raised repeatedly at the monthly meeting of the housing committee during 1963.  On 14th May, the manager communicated with the Dáil members of the authority and suggested that they should meet the Minister and try to get some finality with regard to this matter.  Deputy Corry took it upon himself to suggest that he would make arrangements for that meeting with the Minister.  From that day to this no interview has been arranged.  I do not know whether it was that the Minister refused to see Deputy Corry or whether Deputy Corry did not want to embarrass the Minister. That remains to be discovered.</P>
    <P>At any rate, at our meeting yesterday we inquired for the umpteenth time if confirmation had yet been received for this compulsory purchase order.  Now we find that queries regarding four sites included in the compulsory purchase order were received from the Department of Local Government on 22nd <Col N="894" /> October, 1963.  Submissions were made on 8th January, 1963, and the Department decides to send down queries regarding four sites out of the 13 on 22nd October, 1963.  We had the details of these queries yesterday.  One related to access to the site.  Remember, that of the 13 there are only four in question, but the other nine unfortunates will still have to wait for the Minister to make a decision relative to the building of their houses until these queries have been answered.</P>
    <P>What was happening in the Minister's Department from 8th January, 1963 to 22nd October, 1963 that these problems were not brought to the attention of the housing officers of the South Cork area during all these months? Why have these queries now been sent to us, despite the fact that at one period it was indicated by the Minister that the ball was now back at the foot of the local authority in Cork and that as far as his Department were concerned, they had no objections to the proposal?</P>
    <P>Having being out of the country for a period of three months, I came home expecting that at least compulsory purchase order No. 3 would have been granted by now, only to find that there was no change in the situation.  I went to the Minister's Department over a month ago and was given verbal assurance that within a matter of three weeks, sanction would be provided for compulsory purchase order No. 3. After the expiration of three weeks, we now have a further delay occasioned by the raising of four queries regarding four of the 13 houses.</P>
    <P>The last resolution passed in despair by the meeting yesterday was to ask the Minister forthwith to sanction the nine houses the sites of which seem to provide no opportunity for further delay in the Department.  I want to know from the Minister how long more it will take him to sanction that compulsory purchase order.  Is it not this kind of frustrating delay that is causing so much uneasiness, so much unrest, amongst those interested in housing?</P>
    <P>We know there are specific problems of the gravest character ever known since we obtained self-government relative to housing in Dublin.  I am <Col N="895" /> not conversant with the details of what is happening there.  All I know is how usefully the situation was employed for political motives at a given time. We know how effective the propaganda was and we know there were far more houses built then than are being built now.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the specific case with which I am directly concerned.We find in relation to other proposals before us in our housing authority that while we can deal with individuals relative to the acquisition of sites, when it comes to inter-Departmental negotiations, we are up against a stone wall.  I would ask the Minister to find out from his colleague, the Minister for Lands, why no action has been taken in six weeks relative to a site being acquired by agreement from the Forestry Division in Saleen, Midleton.</P>
    <P>This is the Government who assured us that on their election they would get cracking.  The country interpreted that to mean that they would get cracking on doing their jobs as Ministers.Here we have one Minister, supposedly sympathetic to the housing requirements of the people, allowing another Minister to hold up matters, while he comes in here and makes allegations in the course of a debate here last week against men whose footwear he is not fit to clean.  It would be far better for that Minister, specially selected to spew the dirt across the floor of the House for a Taoiseach who wanted to keep his own hands clean&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government is not responsible for the action of any other Minister.  The Deputy himself pointed that out in his opening remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, relative to the officials in his Department.  Here is a situation in which three houses are <Col N="896" /> to be built at Saleen, the site being acquired by agreement from the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands for which the Minister for Lands is responsible.  He has had this on his desk for six weeks from the Minister for Local Government and has not yet responded to it.</P>
      <P>He is not the only Minister who is holding up housing in Cork County. We also have the Minister for Agriculture involved.  In that respect, there was interference again, at a time when it would appear that we had a most attractive site available.  Here again we have the Department of Agriculture creating delays, of which we were encountering quite enough in our dealing with ordinary civilians.  One would expect that example would be given by colleagues of the Minister in Government in co-operating with the housing authority in the matter of sites for houses.</P>
      <P>In face of the evidence I have advanced regarding housing in south Cork, did it not take the utmost brazen cheek on the part of the Minister for Local Government to level criticism at members of local authorities or on hardworking officials of local authorities in view of the dilatoriness of the Minister in allowing a period of ten months to elapse between the submission of a simple compulsory purchase order and the discovery of fiddling, so-called defects in four of the 13 sites, involving the withholding of sanction in respect of nine sites with which no fault could be found?</P>
      <P>I know of another man involved in this situation whose house is in danger of toppling on him and his wife and children.  We know the scandal that was created when houses toppled in Dublin.  Are we to await another tragedy before something is done for him?  One of the four sites with which the Minister has discovered some fault, aften ten months, was for a house for that man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the town of Kinsale, we are in the happy position, ever since another Government classified the town as an undeveloped area, of having secured some industries but the situation relative to the availability of labour is presenting considerable difficulties. <Col N="897" /> There is in that town as energetic and as public-minded a group as could be found in any urban area in the country, in the Kinsale Development Association.  They have repeatedly advocated the building of houses to provide the employees of the local factories with accommodation.  I cannot see the advantages of a policy of sinking large sums of money in industries, if these industries are hampered later by having to engage public and private transport to travel considerable distances bringing the workers to these factories and home again.  We should concentrate on housing efforts where the potential labour force is growing. We know that the yardstick applied for the recognition of applicants as being worthy of having houses erected for them is completely out of date in relation to areas where industrial development is progressing.</P>
    <P>In this respect, the Kinsale urban council submitted a proposal to the Minister's Department for sanction early this year.  On 10th April last, lay-out and house plans for ten houses at Cork Street, Kinsale, were submitted.On 8th May, it was indicated to me that approval had not yet been received by the council.  As the members of the council were anxious to have the houses erected as soon as possible, the then town clerk wrote to me requesting that I use my good offices with the Department in order to have the matter expedited.  Submissions were made to the Minister by, I am sure, all the Deputies of the Mid-Cork constituency in respect of these proposals.  The situation is that since last April sanction has not yet been given.  I know an alternative plan was indicated to the council requesting that an architect be provided.  I do not regard that delay, however, as being as serious as the delay experienced in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Here we have a group of people giving of their time without reward for the advancement of their community.Here we have a progressive urban council quite prepared to vote the money necessary to build the houses.  They are all frustrated and discouraged by the fact that the plans they submitted as early as 10th April <Col N="898" /> last have not yet been finalised by the Minister.  I have selected and emphasised just two of the many examples of the delays frustrating members of local authorities in their efforts to try to get houses built.  It is preposterous that we should experience this at the hands of a Minister who in his time was so vocal regarding what were described as inordinate delays five or six years ago.  Here we have the example of almost a complete year elapsing before a simple compulsory purchase order could be sanctioned in the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The frustration which Deputy Desmond and I have experienced seems to be equalled by the frustration experienced by Deputy MacCarthy, the Lord Mayor of Cork, and by Senator Healy, who are members of the same authority.  At a recent meeting, they put forward a serious resolution that, in order to overcome these delays, a senior officer of the Minister's Department should be despatched to the city of Cork to be available full-time to try to surmount the obstacles we are encountering in house building by providing liaison with the Department.  I did not subscribe to this resolution, proposed and seconded by two members of the Minister's Party, because I did not think it was a practical proposal.  I cannot see the necessity for burying a full-time officer in Cork when he could be engaged in the Department working for a much wider area.  I merely cite this as an example of the frustration which these energetic and hardworking public representatives encountered, forcing them to resort to this extraordinary proposal.  I hope the exposure of these delays will make the Minister think again before he levels one word of criticism at any local authority or any housing officer employed by any local authority.  He should at least refrain until such time as he has cleaned up the mess in his own Department in the Custom House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to concentrate my remarks on the question of roads generally.  I read the comments of most of the Deputies who spoke on the problem of roads in <Col N="899" /> the course of this debate.  I think the Minister would do well to study the remarks of a number of Deputies in his Party who come from the west of Ireland, in addition to the comments from the other side of the House on this important matter of road policy. There is no more ardent supporter in this House of a proper, progressive road policy than I.  However, I do not subscribe to a policy which has given top priority over the past ten years to the making of main or trunk roads. All Deputies travelling from Dublin to the west have seen a complete change in the countryside in the past couple of years.  Now we have what I can only describe as dreary concrete runways stretching from Dublin to Galway, Ballina and Sligo.  These dreary concrete runways are bordered by cold, grey concrete fencing.  No more unimaginative work could be carried out in any State.  It could only be thought up by the vandals we have in the Custom House.  If the people who thought this up are qualified technical men, it is God help the country.  This lack of imagination is shown at a time when the Government, through their various agencies, are giving prizes for tidy towns and various improvements throughout the countryside.Yet here we have the Department of Local Government embarking on a campaign to tear up every tree from here to Galway in carrying out their road works programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did anybody in the Department ever think that when mixing concrete and making fencing posts they could colour the cement?  They could make them red, green or blue; they could vary the colours to harmonise with the countryside, and so endeavour to improve the appearance of the countryside following the tearing down of the trees.  Do the people who plan this road system realise that going down to the west at night, the road is a death trap because of the lack of signs, lines or proper protection on the side of the road?  Did any officials of the Department or the Minister himself ever stir themselves to go down the country at night?  These grey fencing posts I have mentioned are a death <Col N="900" /> trap at night to drivers, or to pedestrians who may be involved, presenting no indication of danger until it is too late.  At least the old clay fences or a trimmed hedge gave a guide to people walking, cycling or driving at night.  Now there is nothing.</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for this?  Is the Minister going to accept responsibility? Does he keep an eye on what his technicians and officials are planning or are these new plans the product of somebody who is not under the control of the Minister?  We are told that these motorways&mdash;concrete runways is my description of them&mdash;are necessary for the traffic on Irish roads.  We were told by some gentleman in Cork yesterday &mdash;one of the leading plutocrats who set up to advise the Government&mdash;that the number of cars will be doubled by 1970 and that we must have roads to take that traffic.  If we doubled the number we would have 300,000 on the roads then.  There are more cars in one county in England that we shall have in 1970 but we shall have a road system, if we are allowed to pursue it, that will be better than they have in England.</P>
    <P>Somebody over there said that was cod.  I know the Deputy spent a while in England but he ought to go there again.  Between Mullingar and Dublin from nine in the morning until five in the evening, from Monday to Friday, you could wait ten to 15 minutes before a vehicle would pass in daylight hours. Go to England and have a look at the roads.  See them at night.  Between some of the towns, I have counted, as near as I could, cars coming and going and one car per second passes.  That is what we are aiming at here but where is the population to come from? If you put a car into every backyard in the countryside, they will not all come out on the same day.  What are we aiming at in our road policy?  Is it expected that every household will have a car in another ten or 15 years?</P>
    <P>While that is being planned, there is a plan by another Minister to spend £24,000 on the railway station in Ballina which will not be used in five years' time at this rate.  We have one bunch of lunatics telling us the railway line is being improved and that we are <Col N="901" /> to spend more money to streamline the railway system and bring it up to date and another bunch making concrete runways all over the country, while the people living on the byroads and off the main roads are told: &ldquo;It is good enough for you to have potholes as big as Ministers' heads in the roads that serve you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The public will not stand this much longer.  I do not know what the Fianna Fáil cumainn are doing that they have not whispered into the ear of this Minister from Donegal what the people are thinking.  He is up there often enough to realise that the ordinary people of the country must be served and given priority over somebody who wants to go from Dublin to Galway in a hurry or from Dublin to Bangor Erris in two hours. Is it the Taoiseach or his fish and chip pal from London&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have here this Minister who was asked by Roscommon County Council on at least five occasions to receive a deputation and who had not the manners to do so. His Fianna Fáil Party for once woke up in the county council.  They were not the well-whipped and well-drilled little bunch of circus boys that they normally are and they voted in Roscommon County Council condemning the Minister for his attitude in failing to receive a deputation to discuss road problems.  It took four to five strong protests before the Minister finally gave in.  He was forced to do so in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make it clear that the deputation he finally received was not the official deputation.  He was gracious enough to receive the Deputies from the constituency.  We agreed to meet him rather than act in the same discourteous fashion as that in which he had treated the local authority.  He refused to meet the officials of the county council.  He refused to meet the representatives of the NFA and others nominated originally to go on that <Col N="904" /> deputation; but, when he was caught out, his hand was forced and, in the end, he sent for the Deputies representing Roscommon to go down and meet him in his room.  Naturally, when you go on a deputation to a Minister's room, you do not take him by the back of the neck and put him across your knee to deal with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>The Deputy will not do that to this Minister, no matter where he may meet him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That deputation was an eye-opener because we found out what was in the Minister's mind. A little light was let in.  Roscommon county carries the highest rate in Ireland for road surfaces.  No other county, except Donegal, which comes within a few pounds of Roscommon, has as high an expenditure from the rates for road surfaces.</P>
      <P>Last year, and for a number of years past, Roscommon got the lowest road grant in Ireland.  The grant for Roscommon per mile worked out at £106. The next lowest was Waterford, with £117 per mile.  The grants range from £106 per mile for Roscommon to £136 per mile in Donegal, to £150 per mile in Galway, to £190 per mile in Kildare.I will not bore the House with the other figures but, of all the counties in Ireland, Roscommon got the lowest grant per mile from this Minister.</P>
      <P>In addition to paying the highest rates in the country for road surfaces, Roscommon is the most heavily roaded county in the country.  I will not let this Minister, or whoever succeeds him in the next 12 months, get away with the nonsense that has gone on in his Department.  I do not know whether he has any control over the people who advise him but it is quite evident that the advisers in his Department have no regard for the people in rural Ireland. If what they do in Roscommon is taken as the yardstick, then they have no regard for the people in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past ten years, Roscommon has embarked on a programme of taking over, repairing and maintaining by-roads and <i>culs-de-sac</i>.  These are taken over at an average rate of 40 or 80 miles per year.  Since 1953 the <Col N="905" /> council has taken over the majority of all roads serving three or more houses and, today, these are public roads. Despite the fact that all these roads are recognised by the Department as public roads, the county council has not got one penny increase in its overall road grants in recognition of the work done by it in this regard.  Money for these has to be raised from the people in rural Ireland.  As far as the people in rural Ireland are concerned, no help by way of Government grant was given to supplement the work done by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Why?  Because, as I have said, the people who live on by-roads are merely the poor rural fellows.  They do not count.  It does not matter what kind of road leads into a small village.  The people living in the village are only rustics in the eyes of this Government. If, however, a road leads down to the west of Ireland, and there is a recognised beauty spot, there is no end to the money lavished on that road.</P>
    <P>I will not be put in the position now of having it said that I am against tourism or that I am against visitors to this country.  I believe in the expenditure of money on our roads in a proper order of priority.  The Minister may have an idea that he is giving money in Roscommon for tourism to compensate for the fact that he gives lower grants there per mile than are given in any other county in Ireland.  Let us see what he is doing.  Roscommon County Council is lucky to get a sum of £25,000 per year by way of a tourist grant.  We welcome it.  Leitrim, Galway, Sligo and other counties are getting tourist grants.  Some of them, including Donegal, are getting £55,000 a year in tourist grants.</P>
    <P>People may ask: why criticise the grant of £25,000 for the making of tourist roads in Roscommon?  Let me make it quite clear that Roscommon County Council deplore the restrictions laid down by the Department on expenditure on what the Department describe as tourist roads in Roscommon.The Shannon borders on Roscommon and there are roads leading down to the Shannon to some of the most beautiful scenic areas and some <Col N="906" /> of the loveliest fishing grounds.  Roscommon County Council are not allowed to spend one penny of this tourist grant on these roads.  They are forced by the Department to spend this tourist grant on main roads leading through the county, apparently for the sole purpose of speeding tourists out of Roscommon down to Mayo and Galway.  That is the policy thought up by this Minister and the bunch of advisers sitting behind him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is responsible for policy and his advisers should not be criticised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the only way we can get it home to them. It is no pleasure to me to have to make the remarks I am making.  I do not want to have to make them again.  I restrained myself each time on the county council the Minister refused to receive the deputation.  I restrained myself on the deputation.  I told myself there would be one occasion on which I could let that Minister and his advisers know what Roscommon think of them.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to re-examine the position with regard to tourist road grants in Roscommon.  When the local authority send forward a proposal for expenditure in relation to scenic areas, we want sanction for the expenditure of that money.  We do not want to be told that that money must be spent between Strokestown and Tulsk or between Athlone and Ballinasloe, or some other place.  Such expenditure will undoubtedly help to improve the particular road, but it will not be spent for the purpose of tourism within Roscommon.  I will probably be told that such expenditure is good for the country generally; it will improve tourism in other parts of the country. I hope it does, but it should not be described as a tourist road grant in Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Donegal, Leitrim and other counties, I understand that the tourist road grants are expended on roads leading to seaside resorts, on the improvement of existing roads near resorts, on the improvement of promenades, on the improvement generally of roads serving the amenities <Col N="907" /> offered in particular tourist areas.  We have tourist amenities inland, too, and it has been recognised by the Government in the past five or six years that the Shannon provides a first-class attraction for tourists because of its fishing.  It took a long time to persuade the Minister for Transport and Power to recognise the pulling power of the Shannon for tourists but he has wakened up to it now.</P>
    <P>For these and other reasons, I ask the Minister to increase the road grants to Roscommon.  He will have to realise that the mileage of public roads in that county has increased by 500 to 600 in recent years and that no recognition of that fact has been afforded by way of increased grants. While on the subject of roads, I submit it is time the Government embarked on a scheme for the improvement of <i>cul de sac</i> roads throughout the country generally.  The local authority in Roscommon have almost completed a programme and we are the only county in the country to embark on a systematic scheme of building up <i>culs de sac</i> into public roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated&mdash;he can contradict me if it is not so&mdash;that he does not think <i>cul de sac</i> roads ought to come within the ambit of Departmental grants.  He has said that if local authorities wish to take on these roads, they should be saddled with the entire responsibility.  If he has changed his mind on that, I shall be glad to hear it.  These roads, described as by-roads, are deserving of attention at the same level as county or main roads. It is of the community we should think all the time.  We should not think of the people living on main roads as backwoodsmen.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister telling me the money cannot be found for such roads.  My reply to that is that the money is misdirected at the present time.  Some of the roads being built are so wide in parts that some unfortunates are liable to turn round and go back the way they came.  Some people travelling at night would really need compasses, the roads are so wide.  If the Government want a long-term plan for roads, why not consider this: <Col N="908" /> acquire the necessary land now and as the indications come in that the number of vehicles is increasing, enlarge the road programme?  I suggest that the Government acquire the land now, make two or three lanes on what one would describe as a main road, and leave the remainder of the land acquired in the form of two substantial grass margins.  That would not cost a lot.  The grass margins could easily be trimmed by machinery and would be there for development as additional laneways as the increased traffic dictated.  That would be better than embarking straight away on schemes of roadmaking catering for continental conditions in a country where the population is so small.</P>
    <P>We will never have sufficient traffic to justify the road programme we are now embarking on.  No matter how we stretch out the tourist season, we will never get tourists here during the winter months, at least not to the extent that would justify our present expenditure on main roads.  I have discussed this with dozens of people, all of whom agree that people come in here to see the countryside and are not looking for jet propulsion to the west of Ireland.  Dublin is now within three hours by road of any part of the country.</P>
    <P>In fact, if the type of tourist we expect to come here as a result of President Kennedy's visit arrives, it will be by helicopter and it is quite possible we will have roads to spare, huge, wide highways without any tourist traffic whatsoever.  Most of the people interested in our fishing in the west of Ireland will come by helicopter from the midlands of England; yet here we are making what I describe as concrete runways, all of which will be covered by grass in ten years for lack of regular traffic.  I do not believe that is the right way to plan; I do not believe there is proper planning of roads.</P>
    <P>This reinforces my argument in regard to the Government's approach to housing.  If we displayed half the ambition in respect of housing that we display in respect of concrete runways, our people would be properly housed. But we do not, and as a result we <Col N="909" /> have seen in the city of Dublin the tragedies associated with bad planning by the Department and the Dublin Corporation.  While we have such housing conditions in Dublin, we see luxurious hotels and concrete runways being built all over the place.  When we complain, the reply we get is that we are very lucky to have these people coming in here, that we should put out the red carpet for them and bend the knee as natives, as we did in the past.</P>
    <P>I had hoped last Wednesday night to see the end of this Government, because with a change of Government, there would be some hope that Ministers would be appointed who would have a little more respect for democracy, Ministers who would have enough common sense to realise the idiocy of our present road planning policy.  We shall have another opportunity in the new year to alter our present planning.</P>

      <P>I shall not keep the House long but there are a few points I should like to make, mainly on housing and roads in my constituency.First of all, I should like to give credit for what has been done before pointing out what remains to be done.  We have come a long way in recent years and while our progress in housing in my constituency has been very slow&mdash;there was only one house built in the county in a period of six years&mdash;a start has been made, a survey carried out and we are getting down to the job.</P>
      <P>I hope some of the red tape in the Department will be cut out so that sanction for schemes in preparation will be received as quickly as possible. When I came into the Dáil a little more than two years ago, the position of housing in Sligo was pretty poor. We were in arrears with payments, and inspections were behind time by about nine or ten months.  I then asked the Minister a Parliamentary Question and in reply, he admitted the situation in Sligo was bad but blamed it on a current shortage of engineering personnel.He added that the staff had been instructed to concentrate on clearing up arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> I should like here to pay a tribute to the officials in the Department with whom I have had dealings since elected.  From any of them whom I have had occasion to telephone or communicate with by letter I have received nothing but courtesy and efficiency.They were only too glad to do everything possible to help me.  I have got prompt attention at all times from the officials in that Department and it is only fair I should put that on record.  I should like also to pay a tribute to the inspectors who come to us in the country.  They are very helpful to people in giving advice and I have heard many favourable comments on them.</P>
    <P>There is one point in this connection I should like the Minister to take into consideration.  I understand that one of the inspectors in my county is being taken off, that he is being put in charge of water and sewerage in a region comprising two or three counties.  The wisdom of that move is doubtful.  Previously, when an inspector came to examine a reconstruction job or the erection of a house, he generally did both together.  Under this new plan, we shall have one inspector in charge of water and sewerage and one in charge of housing and I think the old system was much more suitable for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The housing problem we have in the west of Ireland is a national rather than a local one.  I agree local authorities have clear responsibility in the matter, but it would be very wrong for anybody to think that the housing problems in the west of Ireland will be solved in a very short time without considerable Government assistance. It will take many years to solve that problem and to give the House an idea of how serious it is, I shall read extracts from two letters.  The first is from a Leitrim man and is as follows:</P>
    <P>This is a few lines to ask you if you could do anything for me to get a cottage.  Any sort of house would do.  I have been in for a cottage three years and no sign of it at all.  The old house I lived in was condemned last year by two <Col N="911" /> men from the council and it has all fallen down since.  I was living in it with my son so we had to leave it and a neighbour gave us a camp of a house where he had cattle before we went into it.  It is all damp and wet when the rain comes and we pay him 30/- a month for it.</P>
    <P>I need not read from that letter further.</P>
    <P>I now quote from a letter received from a Sligowoman:</P>
    <P>I wish to ask for your help and influence.  I have a very bad house and no money to reconstruct it.  I am a widow of 67 years and I have only a girl to help me with the work. The house is about to fall.  The front wall is very bad and the back wall is going out.  On a wintry night we are afraid to stay in the room.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of housing problem we have to face in the west of Ireland. I was in a house in Sligo last August in which a man, his wife and five children lived in the kitchen because the remainder of the house had fallen.</P>
    <P>As I have said, a start has been made at least to get over some of these difficulties.  I must say a special word here for old, infirm people who have not the money to reconstruct their houses.  I know that under the 1962 Act the Minister introduced Section 5 to deal with minimum repairs to houses of that sort.  However, the problem arises as to the adequacy of the assistance these people can get. For instance, there were 19 houses investigated in my constituency and the estimated cost is £4,954.  The State grant at £80 per house would amount to only £1,520, and the remainder would fall on the local authority.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to bring out is that we have 34 further applicants for treatment under Section 5 and 234 more to be dealt with otherwise.  In fact, we are not quite sure how they can be catered for.  What I want to drive home is the heavy burden this Section 5 places on local authorities. At a housing meeting yesterday in Sligo, we agreed to put up £120 against the £80 made available by the State, <Col N="912" /> making a maximum of £200 a house. We could not possibly go any further because the imposition on the rates would be too high, so I would ask the Minister, if at all possible, to increase the £80 to at least 50 per cent of the cost.  If the local authority accept responsibility for repairs to such houses, it is hard to know where they will end.  They could be straddled with a bill for £1,000 in respect of a house and could find themselves involved in a legal action as well.</P>
    <P>I think there must be some other solution.  The £80 is practically useless in our cases.  In respect of the specific instance houses which we are proceeding with I think the red tape could be cut.  So far as I am aware, this is how it works out.  First of all, the local authority investigates the housing needs of each applicant.  Then there is a selection of sites which must, of course, be approved by the county medical officer and county engineer. Then there is the making of a compulsory purchase order to overcome the difficulty of defective titles or anything like that.  Then there is the carrying out of contour surveys and the investigation of the availability of water, together with the preparation of plans and specifications.  All those are submitted to the Department for approval.  Before getting that far they have already been delayed long enough. When the Department approves them there is the invitation of tenders, the reporting on the tenders, preparation of detailed reports and making application for ministerial sanction.  Here, again, perhaps time could be cut.  The arranging of contracts, and bonds, the handing over of sites to contractors, arranging for loans, and so on, has to be done before starting off to build an SI cottage.</P>
    <P>I see one flaw in the building of SI cottages for small farms.  I think I mentioned it on this Estimate last year.  Let us take a farm of eight or ten acres, or even down to five acres of land.  You acquire a site and build a cottage on it.  After a time the cottage is vested.  The tenant in that cottage need not pay a halfpenny rent to anybody and nobody will put him out.  Who would come in and have the man, his wife and <Col N="913" /> children put out on the road?  Who would come in and take the tenancy? There must be another way.  The fact that the local authorities will have to subsidise the rents of those cottages will put an intolerable burden on the ratepayer.  The tenant in one of those small farmhouses could not reasonably be expected to pay a reasonable rent from limited resources.  The result, to my mind, would be that the rates would have to subsidise the rent and the burden would be thrown on the ratepayer.  If the tenant refused to pay nothing could be done about it. I still think, as I thought last year, that if machinery were established so that the Land Commission could draw those rents and build those houses it would save the local authorities quite a lot of trouble and money.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the roads. In passing, I might say that in the west of Ireland it is very difficult to get people who are used to bad housing conditions to understand how we could give £1 million for the Verolme Dockyard in Cork, and how we could put thousands into the Avoca mines, and so on, and still money cannot be found for housing.  I think in our county, too, that too much money is being spent on the main roads and not sufficient attention is being given to the county roads and by-roads.  Actually, there is one thing the Minister could do which would help a lot to stem trouble.  That is in connection with the reconstruction of main roads.  There does not appear to be a lot of respect for the rights of the people where land is acquired for the widening or building of parts of these roads.  I think the fencing on a man's land through which the road goes should be left in as good a state as it was before acquisition.  Sometimes these things are let hang on for 12 months or so; streets are dug up from lorries turning on them and they are left like that.  I think these repairs should take place immediately and the property left in as good a condition as it was found in.</P>
    <P>One point I should like to make in connection with roads is in regard to county roads.  In County Sligo, there are approximately 1,200 miles of county roads and this year the estimated <Col N="914" /> expenditure on maintenance alone is something over £70,000.  That allows approximately £58 or so per mile.  The rate for all roads in County Sligo is in the region of 11/- in the £, and to increase that rate would, I think, be rather difficult when the total rate for the county alone exceeds the £2 mark.</P>
    <P>I might add that we are satisfied with, and are not grumbling about, grants.  We are getting reasonably decent grants and we appreciate that, but we can do with a lot more.  The point is that year after year, on the five-year plan, we are extending the mileage of tarred road, and if that mileage has to be surfaced I understand that all comes off the rates.  If that is so we are increasing the burden on the taxpayer.  At a meeting of the General Council of County Councils, we sent the Minister a petition to give a percentage grant towards the maintenance of county roads.  After all, they give access to the most important section of the community, the agricultural section.</P>
    <P>There is one last point I should like to make.  The railway station has been closed at Kilfree Junction.  Also the Collooney-Claremorris branch line is closed to passenger traffic.  As a result of that there is an extra volume of traffic on the roads.  I would ask the Minister if he could see his way to give some railway grant to help towards the upkeep of those roads, especially the road from Collooney to Claremorris, where children had to go to school by train.  At the moment the road is not wide enough to carry the traffic.  That matter has probably been before the Minister already.  I think there is justifiable cause for any grant for widening that road so that buses can travel on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on the magnificent job of work he has been doing in regard to housing, the provision of water supplies and the improvement of our roads.  Whenever he retires from this House, even his greatest opponent will say that he was the man who inspired the group system, the man who gave immediate sanction to regional water <Col N="915" /> supplies where he was satisfied they would give the desired supply to the regions concerned.  He and his officials have put a lot of energy into the operation of the group system, a system with which I thoroughly agree.  The operation of the scheme will take a great burden off the rates, especially in areas like South Tipperary and West Waterford, which lend themselves to such schemes.</P>
      <P>Perhaps if the Minister went a little further and assured those people who have been industrious enough, who have been painstaking and patriotic enough, to get their own supplies and said to them that in the matter of upkeep, he will see that they will be helped out, it would be a good thing. That perhaps might be the only bone of contention in regard to the group system of water supplies, that we will have the same half-dozen or dozen people disagreeing about the charge for upkeep, repairs and so on.  There could be a little bit of trouble there and I would appeal to the Minister seriously to consider giving them an assurance that the State will be behind them on every occasion, not alone because they have their own water supply but because they spared the ratepayers so much money.  We know that there are areas, such as localities in the mountains, where it would be impossible for the local authority to provide water supplies and the people themselves could provide supplies themselves very effectively and more cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can all see the great improvements that have been carried out on our roads.  Despite the fact that traffic is multiplying daily and more traffic of a very heavy nature is coming on to the roads, the Minister, in his generous way, with the taxpayers' money, has been helping the local authorities to do their work well.  Were it not for the fact that roads have been widened, dangerous bends taken away and an insistence by local authorities in practically all cases that hedges be cut so that views will not be obstructed, the number of fatal accidents would be greater.  It is important that local authorities should use their powers to <Col N="916" /> ensure that views are not obscured. If the Minister insists on the local authorities doing their work, I am sure every Deputy will be behind him. The obscuring of view has caused many accidents.  While it is unpopular to bring people to court, and nobody likes to have to do it, if there is a possibility of an accident at a corner because the view is obscured, everybody should be behind the engineer and the Minister and the local authority in seeing that the person responsible is brought to court.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for the many roads he has licensed in my area for buses which carry mainly poor people who are unable to afford motor cars.  The day of the bicycle seems to be gone.  The Minister did not turn a deaf ear to our appeals but after consultation with the local authority and after some desirable and necessary repairs had been carried out, the buses were able to travel on these roads and bring people to the local villages to do their essential shopping which otherwise they would find difficulty in doing.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the speech made by Deputy P. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary)</i>.  It is unfortunate that attacks should be made on anybody who is not in a position to defend himself.  Neither the county manager nor the Secretary of the Department of Local Government is in a position to defend himself and anybody who attacks one or the other, in addition to the local authority of which Deputy Hogan is a member, should have his head examined.  The county manager is not a personal friend of mine.  I doubt if he ever did anything I asked him to do but he is a fairminded man and he and his assistant, Pádraig de Buitléar, are as good men as this country could produce.  I feel very proud of them.  They do their work conscientiously and well and they do not care whether you are a county councillor or not; if your representations are not of the right type, they ignore them and that is the correct thing to do.  I am not 100 per cent behind the Managerial Act but it is in operation and therefore it is our duty to give it all the support we can.  I am very sorry that an attack was made on <Col N="917" /> our council.  The majority of the members are Fine Gael and Labour. Fianna Fáil have 12 members, Fine Gael ten and Labour three plus one. My experience over many years is that they are a decent body of men.  I do not believe that money would buy any one of them and they do not deserve unfair censure especially from a Deputy who is himself a member of the council.</P>
    <P>Twice he availed of an occasion to refer to an act of the county council and of course very carefully avoided telling the whole truth about it.  In the rural division of Fethard some years ago, when the county manager divided the rate book, he left the town of Fethard attached to Drangan, which is many miles from Fethard.  The young man who had the rate book had a very small salary out of it and he had been constantly looking for this addition.  The council, regardless of political affiliations, gave it to him.  It was not a political vote.  Members of Fianna Fáil voted against the proposal, as also did members of Fine Gael and Labour but it was a majority decision. It was sent up to the Minister and it is costing the ratepayers £95, not £120 as stated by Deputy Hogan.  I can understand the Minister not sanctioning such proposals at a time when farmers are fighting against rates and this proposal was not sanctioned at the request of the hierarchy of Fianna Fáil as suggested by Deputy Hogan.</P>
    <P>When has it become a crime in this country to elect a man with Fianna Fáil tendencies, the son of a Fianna Fáil councillor, to a position, if he is otherwise suited for it?  There was a time in this country when we heard the old slogan that no Irish need apply and in one part of this country, there is the slogan that no Papist need apply.  In Tipperary, if Deputy Hogan had his way, we would have the placards that no supporter of Fianna Fáil need apply.</P>

      <P>I do not tell lies and I do not exaggerate.  If the Deputy has any doubts about it, I can prove it to him.  Deputy Hogan went on to throw more mud at South Tipperary.  He tells the Dáil about the terrible thing that happened down there.  Two home assistance officers were appointed there some years ago and, according to the terms of their appointment, they were to get the first rent collection that became vacant.  When the rent collector died, his carcase was to be sawn up and divided between them.  The idea of having a home assistance officer also a rate collector is a bad one.  He is dishing out money with the one hand and taking it in with the other and there is always the temptation, where a man is in arrear with his rent, to give him a few weeks' home assistance.</P>
      <P>If Ministers are slow to sanction appointments of that nature, I would clap them on the back for it.  What is the position?  The father of the young man who has been doing the collecting was vice-commandant in Liam Lynch's column, and the hardship he suffered in those days made him an invalid.  In this connection I would say that it would be well if the young men of today knew more about those days.  If they did, they would refrain from slandering the dead.  That man was an invalid for many years.  His son was doing the job and doing it well, but Deputy Hogan's idea is that it should be taken from him and that he should be sent to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position?  One home assistance officer is the owner of two or three farms.  He is acting in the capacity of superintendent and his brother is acting in his place.  That is the terrible grievance that Deputy Hogan has brought to this House.  That young man who has been doing that job is to be deprived of his position and sent to England, and then we start shouting about emigration and unemployment.I have always supported a man who had no other means of livelihood as against a person who I thought was living in frugal comfort. <Col N="919" /> I shall continue to do that in the future no matter what Deputy Hogan may think.  To criticise his own local authority as he did was most undesirable and they say that it is a bad bird that fouls its own nest.</P>
    <P>He can now go back to South Tipperary and ensure that the man who has been doing the job is fired out of it, a man who is the son of an old IRA veteran, without whose efforts in the past none of us would be here at all.  That is one thing we can be sure of, that it was not pious resolutions that brought us here.  It is a shame and a disgrace that a man should be attacked in this House when he cannot defend himself.  As I have already said, in some parts of this country, there is the slogan that no Papist need apply and now, down in Tipperary, we have the slogan of Deputy Hogan that no Fianna Fáil supporter need apply, although he was at one time himself a member of the hierarchy of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>It has been alleged that the local authorities have been slack in their approach to the housing problem.  The thousands of houses <Col N="920" /> built in Tipperary are monuments to the work and the efficiency of Fianna Fáil.  Before we came into power in 1932, there was not a cottage built in rural Ireland for anybody.  There were ten years wasted and ten years' arrears had to be made up.  We can truthfully say that the housing problem in South Tipperary has been narrowed down to the point where there is only a small number of applicants.  Admittedly, the number has been increasing again over the past few years because emigration has been stopped and young men are getting married at home, full of confidence that this country will give them a livelihood and that they will be entitled to a house.  They will get a house.</P>
      <P>The trouble is to get the contractors. Deputy Donegan may laugh but I can assure him that it took me two years to get a contractor to do a small job. Most of the contractors are engaged in repairing houses.  With so many cottages needing repairs and repairs being so costly, we are coming to the stage where the State will have to share the burden with the local authority, if these houses are to be put into a proper state of repair.  It is a very costly matter for the ratepayers, who, we know, are already overburdened. Rates have reached the ceiling and we are honest enough to admit it.  I would appeal to the Minister to come to the rescue of the ratepayers and subsidise by way of grant repairs to labourers' cottages.</P>
      <P>There are many cases of hardship, especially where the cottage is in an isolated situation, which makes it even more difficult to secure a contractor to carry out the work.  There is one such case I mentioned in this House before. I refer to a tenant called Heffernan, in a placed called Newcastle.  The county manager and the officials have gone to a great deal of trouble in an effort to get a contractor to carry out the work required to be done in that case. The only hope is to supply a prefabricated house.  I would suggest that where there is urgency, prefabs be utilised to an appreciable extent.  They would have a life of 40 or 50 years. The coming generation could take their share of the burden of cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that attacks on local authorities, <Col N="921" /> whether deserved or otherwise, will not be tolerated in this House. The place in which to attack a local authority is the council chamber, not here in the shelter of Leinster House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a splendid job of his Department.  I regret the attack made on the Secretary of his Department who is one of nature's gentlemen, who is responsible for such a huge amount of work, who has such a huge task.  Never before in the history of this country has there been such a great task confronting officials as confronts our officials now.  We know that the wisdom and the good guidance of the present Secretary have merited from us unqualified praise. He should not be belittled in this House.  He cannot defend himself.  If he could, he would defend himself but, if he could, he would not be attacked.  The House can be sure of that.  Of that I am perfectly certain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not here for the entire speech by Deputy Davern.  I gathered from his concluding remarks that he thinks it somewhat unfair that local authorities should be attacked in this House.  I do not know whether I could go the full way with him on that or not.  A local authority has two parts&mdash;the elected representatives and the official side represented by the manager.  I do not think it is a fair claim by a Deputy that a man should not be criticised in his absence. If it is malicious criticism, he should not be criticised in his absence, but if we were to confine our remarks merely to people who are in this House, we would end up by making personal attacks on one another rather than on people who are responsible for things that happen outside this House.  It should be remembered, when we appear to attack or criticise officials, whether city managers, county managers or county secretaries, that they are not personal attacks at all. They are not even attacks.  They are criticisms, not of the man, but of his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davern says that the place to criticise local authorities is the council chamber.  If that were insisted on, many of us would be deprived <Col N="922" /> of the opportunity of speaking on the Vote for the Department of Local Government.  There are many Deputies who are not members of local authorities.  In relation to matters such as housing, roads and suchlike, it would mean that a big proportion of the House would not be entitled to speak at all.  However, I do not think Deputy Davern made any great point about this or devoted a great deal of his speech to it.</P>
    <P>My concern here to-night is, first of all, housing.  I want to say straight away that I am not concerned with what happened in the past.  I am concerned with what happens now and I am particularly concerned with what is to happen in the immediate future. Criticism of what happened during the inter-Party Government régime or of what the Minister may have done or may not have done in the past four or five years will not get people housed.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be a greater awareness of the need for houses than there was in the recent past.  I cannot understand why we cannot declare an all-out emergency as far as the provision of houses is concerned.  We must consider not alone the present needs, but the needs in the future.  Deputy Sherwin tells us that he sees a lot of people during the week.  In many towns and villages throughout the country, there seems to be the same big demand for houses as there has been for many years past.  We must consider also the number of houses that fall into disrepair as the years go by.</P>
    <P>This is a tremendous problem, not alone for the Minister but for the local authorities themselves.  It is tragic that over the years we have lost so many building workers to Great Britain.  There was a lull in house-building in the latter portion of 1956 but at the beginning of his period of office, the Minister's attitude seemed to be that we had sufficient houses and that the need was not as great as it actually was.  I do not say that was deliberate or that the Minister's every action was conditioned by that attitude.  I do not know whether or not he got wrong information from the local authorities, but he must admit that the need for houses seemed to <Col N="923" /> be played down.  The Minister and his officials now seem to be more responsive to the requests of local authorities for the building of houses, but there still remains a very big problem.</P>
    <P>One of the things we lack in this country is a proper housing survey. The Minister gave figures here of the housing requirements of the various areas, but I do not think he has the complete picture.  That is not his fault nor the fault of his officials.  As far as I know, many of the local authorities who were asked to carry out this survey either did not do it or carried it out in a very haphazard way.  As a result, there are conflicting views as to the number of houses needed in this place or that place.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty is the amount of reconstruction and building of offices and factories in certain parts of the country.  That activity tends to draw off a number of building workers, who in the normal course of events would be engaged io the building of houses. Equal importance should be attached to the building of houses as to the building of offices, the reconstruction of shop fronts and, even in some circumstances, the building of factories. It has been my experience that some people decided to go to Great Britain, not alone to get a job, but because they could not get decent housing accommodation at home.  I do not say they got better accommodation over there, but they felt so frustrated at not being able to get a house in their own country that they thought they would take a chance and go to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to encourage local authorities to build on derelict sites in the centre of towns. I firmly believe that many of our provincial towns are becoming uglier every day because derelict sites in the centres of these towns are being left, while the houses are being built in sprawling suburbs.  In many cases this means the towns are becoming lopsided.I know that through legislation and financial measures the Minister has given encouragement to local authorities to clear these sites and <Col N="924" /> build on them, but my impression is that that assistance is not being freely availed of by the local authorities. Perhaps the Minister, by words or letters of encouragement&mdash;or even by direct action&mdash;might try to ensure that our towns retain at least some vestige of their character and that their centres be preserved by having decent houses built on them.</P>
    <P>I cannot speak for every area, but so far as Wexford is concerned, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the reluctance of the local authority to build houses for people who need them.  I believe there is a reluctance, and whether it is the fault of the manager or the members, I do not know.  I suppose other Deputies who are not members of the local authority have the same experience of representations made to them by people who need cottages.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, the Minister has been questioned here on many occasions by members of the Labour Party in regard to the housing of people lodging in local authority houses.  We put up several arguments as to why the rule with regard to the one-third and two-third subsidy should be relaxed in order to allow these people to be housed.  To give credit to the Minister, he announced some time ago that in certain cases a local authority would qualify for the two-third subsidy where people were being housed from existing local authority houses.  He said they could in certain circumstances be housed in a house that would qualify for the two-third subsidy where there was a case of overcrowding or where there were compassionate grounds.  However, I find reluctance on the part of the local authority, through their officials, to use their own good judgment, take a chance and depend on the generosity of the Minister and his officials to apply the two-third subsidy.</P>
    <P>I have in my files many cases where married couples, because they have no accommodation of their own, go to live with his parents or her parents.  I have in mind a particular case of a young man and young woman who married and went to live with the father of one of them.  In that house <Col N="925" /> was the father, the mother, a grown brother, a grown sister and the married couple, that is, six people in a county council cottage.  The local authority refused to build for that couple because, they said, they might not get the two-third subsidy.  These people are advised to look at the local newspapers to see whether there are any vacant cottages in the area and to apply for them, but vacant cottages are very few and far between.  If the local authority do not build for them, they will be lodging in their parents' house for quite a long time to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister has advised the local authorities that where there is over-crowding or where there are compassionate grounds, the local authority may qualify for the subsidy.  Can he go any further?  Can he give a decision on an application by a local authority prior to the building?  I think it somewhat unfair to ask a local authority to take the chance in certain cases and perhaps end up by having to accept a one-third subsidy and in consequence have to charge a greater rent than would normally be payable.</P>
    <P>It may not be quite so bad where a young couple live with his or her parents but there are cases of married couples having no accommodation of their own who are forced to live with complete strangers as lodgers.  We know how unpleasant that can be.  It is often said that two married women cannot live together very long in one house.  I suggest some families are very unhappy because there are in some cottages two, if not more, families.  I ask the Minister to advise local authorities to send in their applications for permission to build a cottage and supply all available information so that the Minister may give his decision before the cottage is built. In present circumstances, a decision is not given until the house is actually occupied.</P>
    <P>There seems to be quite a lot of controversy regarding the sale of local authority houses, whether vested cottages or houses in towns purchased or in the process of being purchased by the occupiers.  I see a certain inconsistency in the decision given by local officials.  In some cases, the sale <Col N="926" /> is sanctioned; in others, it is not.  The law seems unclear in this respect and it would be helpful for members of local authorities to have it clarified. Certainly, in those I know, it would help the officials and the members if the Minister attempted to define more clearly the conditions in which a vested cottage or house-purchase dwelling may be disposed of.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is little necessity to say this as all speeches on Estimates are supposed to be confined to some form of criticism but I should like to pay tribute first to the Minister and also to those in charge of building and reconstruction.  I do not know what the experience of other members may be; they may have many difficulties but so far as this section is concerned and as far as the general administration of building and reconstruction grants is concerned I, personally, have only the highest praise.  Many people engage in building and reconstruction and frequently do so before they notify anybody.  I find the Department officials and the inspectors most helpful.</P>
    <P>The only criticism that might be made is that inspectors' visits are too infrequent.  That problem can be overcome.If there is a case for employment of more inspectors&mdash;something which has been advocated for a long time&mdash;the Minister should consider that.  The people's biggest complaint seems to be the delay while waiting for the inspector to come.  Some inspectors pay a cursory visit and if they do not meet the person concerned, go off again.  It would be a humane thing to call next door and inquire when Mrs. Murphy will be back instead of going back to the Department and reporting&mdash;quite honestly&mdash;that he called to Mrs. Murphy but she was not there.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that inspectors cannot wait around all day but a few inquiries as to when the person concerned will be back or where he might be, would be most helpful.  I understand that it is impossible for an inspector to say exactly when he may call.  That means a person waiting for an inspector might have to be on top, so to speak, for up to a month.</P>
    <P>I have no knowledge, and I say this in ignorance, although I have colleagues <Col N="927" /> here who are very well experienced in local government, but I wonder what direction, if any, is given by the Department regarding roadmaking methods to local authorities.  I have seen some roads made, or allegedly made in recent years and they have broken up very quickly, so quickly that thousands of pounds appear to have been wasted.  A roadmaking method employed in my county recently was, I think, called the sanding method.  A base was put down with sand over that and tarmacadam or colfix then laid.  These roads, after a few weeks, just burst up, due to the amount of traffic over them.</P>
    <P>We should be more careful in allowing engineers to experiment, some of them losing possibly thousands of pounds for the State and the ratepayers.The public do not look kindly on this.  If a road worker breaks a shovel&mdash;I suppose this is also a Fabian remark&mdash;he is liable to dismissal on the spot but some engineers and other professional gentlemen engage in experiments that may cost the ratepayers thousands of pounds.  Therefore, I ask the Minister, although my colleagues would be able to tell me, perhaps, are any methods or standards laid down by the Department or has each local authority the right to construct roads as they like?</P>
    <P>As a personal opinion, I think speed limits have been very satisfactory up to date.  I appreciate their introduction must of necessity be an experiment and that many changes may have to be made before a permanent system is evolved.  I know the Minister has no responsibility for the enforcement of the various regulations connected with speed limits and traffic generally but he has responsibility for the location of signs and I suggest he could intervene in many of the decisions made by local authorities regarding placing of signs.  Some are placed too far from a town or village; others too near them.  Has the Minister prescribed the distance they should be from the village or town or city border?  It can be a cause of great annoyance to motorists if signs are either too near or too far from the town or village concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> I wonder also is it possible&mdash;this, of course, will cost money&mdash;to have warning signs of speed limits.  No matter how alert a motorist may be, he may discover that there is a speed limit only when he is five, ten or 20 yards away from it and realises it is there.  If he is over-conscientious, he will be inclined to jam his foot on his brake.  If there is following traffic, that, in turn, will be jammed up also. In other countries, I think, they have a system of warning signs before coming to the actual speed limit signs.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to wield an amount of influence in the Government.I wonder if he would use that influence on two of his colleagues, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Transport and Power? I wonder if the Minister has this difficulty in his own constituency: I refer to the damage the ESB and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs do to footpaths and roads.  They are two of the most brash bodies in the State that I know if; they assume they can come into a town, rip up the footpath, or the road, and just put a thin coating of concrete over the openings, a thin coat that cracks up in a matter of days.</P>
    <P>The local authority does not seem to get any satisfaction from either the ESB or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The Minister should try to come to some agreement with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and with the Minister for Transport and Power and, in the case of the latter, he should not let himself be fobbed off with the plea that the Minister for Transport and Power has no function because the ESB is an autonomous body.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether other local authorities suffer as we do.  Wexford town at the moment looks as if there had been slit trenches all over it, trenches filled in in a hurry when the soldiers moved on.  Wexford Corporation have had correspondence and made representations to both the ESB and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.They are not getting very much satisfaction and I suspect the ratepayers will be stuck for all this. I think the work could be done much more cheaply from the point of view <Col N="929" /> of public expense if the ESB, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the gas company, and so on, were required to put footpaths and roads back into the exact condition in which they found them.  They are not doing that at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister again to give all the encouragement he can to the building of houses and to insist on the completion of the surveys.  Whilst he may have some appreciation of the situation from the point of view of housing needs, none of us has the full picture.  I honestly believe the need is as great in certain places today as it was ten, 15, or 20 years ago, by reason of the fact that many houses have in that period fallen into disuse and disrepair.Declaring an area emergency as far as housing is concerned will not do any good.  The Minister and his officials and the local authorities would be well advised to regard it as a national emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the signatories to the motion being discussed with this Estimate, I am naturally concerned about the state of housing, especially in the city of Dublin.  The problem is not at all a simple one.  It is not easy suddenly to increase the tempo of the housing programme.I do not myself quite know why the housing programme lapsed into the state it did in Dublin.  Over a period of years, we built thousands of houses in Dublin.  Then, quite suddenly, that ceased.  The most important factor, I think, is the attitude of mind not only of the Government but of the public in general.  Naturally, on this side of the House, we would lay the blame at the feet of the Government; but that is not the complete answer because any Government will ultimately do what the people wish them to do.  Somehow the public did not seem to realise the dangers inherent in an easy, do-nothing policy in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation were well aware of the situation, but it is not fair to blame the Corporation as certain people have done here.  From the Corporation's point of view, the problem is not a simple one.  They cannot build houses faster than they receive money from the Government, <Col N="930" /> and the Government did not give them the grants towards housing equivalent to the grants given in the past.  I do not want to waste time trying to place blame because, as I say, there are a number of reasons.  I should, however, like to see&mdash;it is something we all want to see&mdash;the situation at the moment remedied and housing starting again with all the impetus it had some years ago under the late Deputy Tadhg Murphy as Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>He set up a housing council.  The very efficient head on that council is now the city manager in Dublin Corporation.That body did a tremendous amount of good work in this city.  It increased enormously the number of houses built.  We need now something like that.  We have a situation in Dublin amounting to a crisis.  The building programme will deal only with the natural increase, and barely with it at that.  It cannot deal with the situation in Dublin generally.  Quite suddenly, everybody now realises that many of the old 18th century houses in the centre of the city are in such a state of decay that they must come down.  Some of them have fallen down with tragic results and as regards others of them, we know, and the Corporation know, that unless people are moved out of them immediately tragedies may occur.</P>
    <P>That is the situation in which we find ourselves.  Large areas in the centre of the city have reached the end of their period of usefulness for housing people and we must house them as quickly and rapidly as we can.  Unfortunately, the will to do this is not sufficient because it takes a number of years between the time plans are made, property is acquired, and so on, and finally houses or flats are built and the tenants go in.  The answer probably is that we will have to put up prefabricated houses wherever we can in certain areas as a short-term measure.</P>
    <P>Another answer to it is that in the city of Dublin we will have to adopt a bolder method of housing and will have to go higher.  That is what every modern city, that does not want to spread out too far and put too great a strain on its citizens and indeed on its transport, has done. <Col N="931" /> The question is either to go up or go out.  We have gone out pretty far in Dublin.  We will have to alter our views radically on the question of height.  We will have to go up higher than we went before and if necessary, instal lifts, and so on, in the flats we build.  That is something that will come and must come.</P>
    <P>We must also adopt a more modern attitude on planning streets.  We must spend more money on widening streets and on pulling down buildings which stand in the way of modern development of streets and roads.  Otherwise, our city will choke itself with the amount of traffic that is in it.  Every one of us has seen in the past few years the increase in motor cars on the roads and we are told by Ministers and the Government, and indeed we can see in a way, that we are only at the beginning of movements of money to sections of the population that have not been able to afford vehicles and luxury goods.  There are many categories of people who in the next few years will be coming into the income group where they can afford to buy cars or other mechanically propelled vehicles.  Those are going to go on the roads and our roads will have to be as well designed and as wide as we possibly can make them, not only in the city of Dublin but throughout the whole country.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in having many lovely trunk roads but as is the case in all the cities and towns in Western Europe, the roads in our cities and towns were not designed for the traffic which they now have to bear and we will have to spend money on them and spend vast sums of money on them, or we will find our towns decaying, with consequent loss of revenue, and so on, to the local authority and great hardship and difficulty to both labour and the business community in them.  Therefore, we shall have to look very carefully at our planning in the future in that respect.</P>
    <P>In the city of Dublin and in the Custom House, too, there is a wideawake approach to that problem but the housing programme declined because there was not an alert public <Col N="932" /> opinion there to press for it.  We will have to do these things in the future in our cities or we shall find we are creating satellite towns outside the cities where business is done that was formerly done inside the cities.  That already, I believe, is happening to a certain extent and will increase in the United States of America and it is not because it is America that that is happening.  It is because America with its very large number of cars on the road has found that the centre of the cities get choked up.  We are already finding that.  Everybody who lives around Dublin knows what it is in terms of exhaust fumes in his nose and mouth and frustration and delay in trying to get through the city.  Therefore, we will have to have a forward policy in that regard.</P>
    <P>There has been talk also in that connection of building another bridge across the Liffey.  We had a debate in Dublin Corporation about a tunnel east of Butt Bridge.  I do not think a tunnel under the Liffey is the answer to our traffic difficulties on O'Connell Bridge.  The entrance to the tunnel would really have to be started in Clontarf and it would come out the other side somewhere near Merrion Gates.  That is a bit of an exaggeration probably but certainly the entrances and exits to any tunnel under the Liffey would have to be so far from the Liffey that I do not think they would ease the traffic congestion.  What we need is another bridge higher up the Liffey than O'Connell Bridge that would help to relieve the North-South traffic which is one of the great problems in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The city of Dublin has tremendous problems and has tried to face them but it needs money and it needs grants from the Government to do that.  The Government will have to empower the Corporation to take these very necessary steps which will cost money but which must be taken if this city of ours is to hold its position as a fine and beautiful capital city.</P>
    <P>In that respect, I should like briefly to mention a matter which has been coming up recently, namely, the houses in Fitzwilliam Street, the proposed demolition of which by the ESB has <Col N="933" /> caused so much controversy and has saddened so many people.  I have spoken about the decay of houses in the centre of the city and we all know the difference between the houses which were in danger of falling down and the houses in Fitzwilliam Street.  I hope that matter will be settled adequately and that reconstruction can go on behind these very lovely facades in Fitzwilliam Street so that we can get modern conditions and at the same time maintain the 18th century atmosphere of the whole district.  These very beautiful 18th century buildings which we still have in Dublin are very valuable from a tourist and a cultural point of view.  They were built by Irish workmen, designed by Irish architects and lived in by Irish people. They are relics of a very elegant age. They are part of our history, part of the tradition of Dublin as an 18th century European capital.  There are very few capital cities that have the heritage we have and it is worth spending some money and going to some trouble to maintain it.</P>
    <P>I am not a person who feels that modern buildings should always be sacrificed for the past.  Not at all.  I believe we can create beautiful buildings when we set our minds to it and we have erected some lovely buildings quite recently around the city of Dublin.Some of them take a bit of getting accustomed to but that is the age in which we live, an age of glass and steel and concrete.  Our modern architects can create very useful, functional buildings, often objects of great beauty in the modern way.  I am in favour of that trend but there are certain areas in the city which should be preserved because they are unique and Dublin has been famous for them for a couple of hundred years.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning of my speech, the centre of Dublin is about to fall down and that is the problem the Dublin Corporation and the Minister and his officers have before them. We must be prepared not to take the same view as we did some time ago when a business was carried on in the bottom of a house which was, in effect, a tenement dwelling.  We were very chary of interfering with business <Col N="934" /> in that respect but now we have reached the stage that we must take notice of dangerous buildings not only because of the danger to the occupants of the houses but to passers-by, which is a more important consideration than keeping a business in existence.  We must be more ruthless than we were in that respect.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the immediate solution to the problem is except the obvious one of putting people into some sort of prefabricated buildings. However, what we can do is step up the building programme.  Years ago great work was done by the housing council under the late Mr. Murphy, and before that again there were periods when the Dublin Corporation and the Irish Government behind it did tremendous work in housing.  That was done because there was a feeling that the poor of Dublin, and not always the poor, the people who were in overcrowded and dangerous buildings must be got out at all costs.  We must have that evangelical fervour again to improve the living conditions of so many of our citizens.</P>
    <P>That is why I am one of the people who is calling on the Government to set up a select committee to examine the whole situation, investigate the housing shortage and then take all the necessary steps to enlarge the housing programme for the city of Dublin.  The present situation is a disgrace to an Irish Government and Irish people wish to see it remedied as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has proceeded now for some time.  It is natural that a Department like the Department of Local Government should touch on many matters relating to housing, road building, building workers' conditions, road workers' conditions and all the rest.  Deputy Dockrell is dealing with the housing problem in Dublin.  There is no doubt that Dublin is faced with a problem but that problem is not beyond the ability of the Dublin Corporation to deal with it.  May I say as a country man looking objectively at the position in Dublin that the Dublin Corporation has many aids available to it to remedy this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> We all know from past experience that those houses cannot be expected to last forever.  The solution, therefore, would seem to be, seeing that some of the Dublin squares are passing into history, to build upwards.  We know from past experience in this regard that the Corporation, and especially the Housing Committee of the Corporation, has come in for some criticism on the ground that building houses out in the green belt is causing a difficulty, not merely in and around the city but in the county of Dublin as well.  I feel that it is not beyond the powers of the Housing Committee, without setting up Commissions, or without going into the matter very much further, to come to grips with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Housing Committee has available the services of its planners, its architects and those people who are qualified to advise on those matters. The trend would seem to be in cities bigger than Dublin, and in Europe in particular, that when it comes to flat building, the authorities are inclined to go up.  We will not go into the technicalities of the various heights but it would be a good thing if the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation made a move to build upwards and to insist, when doing so, that the design of the flats be improved and that there be a brightening up all round. We have seen in the past blocks of flats erected which would remind one more of a barracks than a modern block of flats.  I am not criticising the Corporation on that ground but we have now reached the day and age when a little colour could be introduced into the building programme in general.</P>
    <P>I have as lively an interest in the city of Dublin as any other Deputy, even though I come from the country. I was glad to see&mdash;I do not know what the final decision in the matter was&mdash; that the Dublin Corporation had decided <i>pro tem</i> to restore O'Connell Bridge to its former condition.  The best advice that could be given to the Corporation in this matter is to restore the bridge and leave it alone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> In general, the Minister can feel a sense of satisfaction with the rate of house building in the country, the rate of building new houses and the rate of replacement.  We all welcome the recent announcement of the increase in the scale of grants payable to certain categories of farmers and others who are finding it difficult to secure the wherewithal to proceed either with the reconstruction or replacement of houses.  It will make matters much easier for those people who, despite all that has been done down the years, still live in unhealthy and unsound houses.  There is no doubt we have had down the years a tough problem in dealing with the replacement of houses and the reconstruction of a good number of the existing houses.  It is good work from the national point of view and anything which this House or the Government may be able to contribute towards keeping the national housing stock in a sound condition will eventually help to improve the health and uplift the living standards of our people.</P>
    <P>As I am referring to housing in general, I might as well try to make one point.  We all know that the conditions of building workers have improved down the years as regards wages but I cannot say that one should feel satisfied, going through the city of Dublin, watching building workers out in the wet, having their rations, so to speak.  In England, the contractors at least provide decent shelter for their workers and the same sort of provision should rightly be made here.  It should not be beyond the powers of those who are engaged in the building trade to do so.  It is not very edifying, to say the least of it, that men who have to work in the open in all sorts of weather, especially on the early development of a site, should have to sit out in the open having their meal. For that reason, some sort of shelter provision should be made for them, especialy during the bad months of the year.  As I said at the outset, that problem should be properly dealt with by contractors engaged in the building trade.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a point in reference to vested cottages.  In the <Col N="937" /> efforts to solve the housing problem, and in conformity with the various Labourers Acts, the local authorities allow the vesting of labourers' cottages but, in recent times, a practice has sprung up in the country of allowing those cottages to pass into the possession of people who, strictly speaking, do not need houses.</P>
    <P>I want to develop that point a little further and to say that a position sometimes arises where somebody in the neighbouring farm may covet a vested cottage.  The cottage comes on the market and somebody steps in and buys it, not for the purpose of housing a family but merely for the purpose of owning it and perhaps with the intention of living in it later on.  Local authorities, as far as it is possible, should not allow such a state of affairs to prevail.  The local authority should have power to house a family where it deems it desirable that the family should be housed and prevent this traffic in houses which were built primarily for working men.</P>
    <P>In regard to road making there is at the moment a satisfactory rate of progress. One point, however, is that one often sees, during road widening operations, a row of trees being uprooted by a local authority on the presumption that they will be in the way of the scheme.  Sometimes that is highly doubtful.  This reminds me of something that appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 20th August, 1963 and to which I will refer for the purpose of the point I am making.  It dealt with an old house in San Francisco which had recently been torn down to make way for an apartment building.  When the house had disappeared, a bulldozer moved in to complete the devastation. It destroyed, in the process, a beautiful 100-year-old fig tree.  At last the area was rendered as lifeless and as sterile as the dark side of the moon and the bulldozer crew departed, but they left behind them a notice offering 100 dollars reward for information leading to the arrest of anyone defacing the property.</P>
    <P>I merely refer to that to make the analogy that local authorities who allow indiscriminate felling of trees <Col N="938" /> along the road without sufficient cause are entitled to be criticised because it can be argued&mdash;people may be inclined to be cynical about the point&mdash;that it is very easy to cut down a tree but it is very difficult to grow a tree.  During the past two years, I have seen what I consider to have been the indiscriminate felling of trees along the public highway on the grounds that the road was being widened and that the trees were in the way.  I do not want to criticise any particular local authority but I remember the road where those trees grew and it was reminiscent of a carriageway more than a road.  In my opinion, those trees could not have have been deemed to be in the way, by any stretch of the imagination. Local authorities and county engineers should be very careful about the indiscriminate felling of trees along the public highway.</P>
    <P>We have a very good road programme at present and the Minister can take every satisfaction from the knowledge that he is laying the foundation for a first-class system.  That applies both to the mainroads and to the county roads.  The rate of building of county roads is also satisfactory and has been over the past three or four years because local authorities have taken advantage of the various grants available to them.  That is a very welcome feature of local government.</P>
    <P>A further point to be remembered in regard to the road widening programme is the increase in motor traffic. Some indication of this is to be gleaned from the increase in the consumption of motor spirit.  The consumption of motor spirit rose by three million gallons in 1961 over the previous year and by six million gallons in 1962, bringing the total consumption to 96 million gallons.  The Minister is to be complimented on his foresight in making provision for main roads because if the growth of motor traffic continues at its present rate, we shall need these wide roads.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 6th November, 1963.</P>
