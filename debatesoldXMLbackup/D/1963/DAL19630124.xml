      <Col N="328" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, I was discussing the siting of the factory and pointing out that personally I had nothing against the fact that the factory was in Arklow.  At the same time, I was directing the attention of the House to the fact that the Money Resolution in connection with this Bill is for a sum in the neighbourhood of £6 million for a factory which will employ 300 people and that it did seem to me that it was rather an excessive State expenditure for the purpose of employing only 300 people.  I was also stressing the fact that I had information that the nitrogen plant itself was not really an economic one in that it was too small but I suggested that it was conceivably possible that it was the intention of the Government to have such plant, even though it might not be as economic as a larger one, so that they could employ a greater personnel, have more operatives at work there, than would be the case if they had more up-to-date and modern plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a new factory in connection with which there is an opportunity to have all conceivable modern appliances. In the competitive world that lies ahead, particularly in the European sphere, in the event of our not having the Common Market&mdash;which appears to be somewhat doubtful now &mdash;we shall certainly have some form of extended free trade area or free trade association, I wonder would it be possible at a later date to change this plant without imposing a very heavy charge on the company concerned ?  It may very well happen that if we have to negotiate a trade agreement&mdash;as assuredly we shall&mdash;possibly in conjunction with other countries who are already manufacturing nitrogenous fertilisers on an extensive scale, it may be necessary for us or for the firm to keep itself competitive by changing this nitrogenous plant and even though it may not give the same amount of employment as, <Col N="329" /> obviously, it is the Government's intention it should give, it may still be necessary to do this in order to remain a viable concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal very extensively with the envisaged free trade area or free trade association or, shall we put it, the liberalisation of trade here in association with other countries, whether in the Common Market or under a wider free trade agreement embracing the EFTA countries, the Six and ourselves, perhaps.  He brushed it aside by saying that dumping was prohibited within the Treaty of Rome. The position still is that we have made application for full membership of the Common Market and leading Government spokesmen have assured us we are going to get into it in the very near future.  Perhaps they have had reason to change their minds in the past few days&mdash;I do not know.  Within that market, it seems to me we shall have to compete fully with up-to-date plants.</P>
    <P>I stressed last night that a very big British firm had closed down production of nitrogenous fertilisers because they found themselves priced out of the market by up-to-date conditions prevailing in continental fertiliser plants.  Has the Minister fully considered that?  I think the House is entitled to some further statement on account of the vast expenditure involved here on the changes that will arise in the event of the free trade area or Common Market membership materialising.  Does he envisage that we shall face seriously competitive conditions?  Does he consider that with the small nitrogenous plant at present envisaged, we can remain viable?  Are we able to face these bigger firms in Europe and their competition and if not, what will be our position in the free trade area?  In all the trade discussions that have so far taken place of which I have any knowledge, existing trade facilities are always taken into account and might we find ourselves in the position that we could not impose any tariff, even though it was a free trade area?  I want the Minister to deal with that position in relation to the wider free trade area of the Economic Community.  Should <Col N="330" /> we still be able to consider ourselves viable within Europe?</P>
    <P>This is an important matter that concerns us not only as legislators voting money here and giving the Government permission to go ahead with a programme about which some of us have considerable reservations and doubts, but also it affects the firm itself and the 300 operatives who will be working there.  There is no use in starting a nitrogenous factory and giving this employment, expending this money which is coming out of the pockets of the taxpayers or out of the pockets of those who have invested money in national loans and so on, unless it can be made an economic proposition.  The House should get a full assurance on that point and the Minister should make a full statement on the implications of this factory in relation to the conditions of industrial development we all envisage within Europe on the basis of a wider free trade area.</P>
    <P>This factory is sited in Arklow which has suffered considerably as a result of the closing of the mines and the consequent unemployment in the area.  I have nothing against Arklow but it does not seem to be the best distribution centre in the State. Although the Minister has not actually given costings, certain agricultural organisations associated with the production of nitrogenous fertilisers have suggested certain figures of costings and I gather that the price delivered to the farmer will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of £11 odd.  Does the Minister feel that it is possible to distribute these fertilisers from Arklow throughout the State to every farmer in the country at the same price?  From what I know of CIE efficiency and the prices charged&mdash; and CIE will be the principal means of transport unless it is envisaged to send the fertiliser by sea from Arklow to Killybegs to supply Donegal&mdash;I wonder can it be delivered at the same price to farmers in Donegal and West Cork or in the more distant parts.</P>
    <P>The House would need a statement on that aspect of the matter to re-assure the agricultural community that they are not, as Deputy Desmond <Col N="331" /> aptly put it, paying a land tax on fertilisers.  I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the points I have raised.  I have had advice on many of the technical matters that I have mentioned but it does not necessarily follow that technical advice is always correct.  I hope the scheme will be a success as there is so much money involved in it and I shall give it my support, such as it is, with the reservations I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was made quite clear at the outset of this debate by Deputy Cosgrave, followed by the leader of this Party, that we would not oppose the Bill.  The assurances given by the Minister were accepted as coming from a responsible Minister in possession of information and facts not available to us.  Personally, from what I have heard from all my sources of information, I should have been inclined to oppose this venture.  The case for the establishment of the industry seems to be based mainly on its employment content&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  Please do not distort it.  That is one of the least considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the strong points made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>You said just now it was the main case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know what is the main case.  That is why I make this statement.  If it is not employment, then what is it ?  On what section of the economy is it conferring enormous benefits ?  It is an expenditure of £6 million&mdash;£6 million badly needed for agriculture, where there is certainly insufficient investment.  In a very short time, we shall be up against a very big unemployment problem for which we shall need a good deal of money for the establishment of industries&mdash;industries that will not involve an investment of £20,000 per worker employed.  Those are my feelings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also feel that the industry is much too small to be economic.  That is my <Col N="332" /> belief from all the information available to me.  At the moment ICI are establishing a nitrogenous fertiliser factory in Aden.  They considered establishing a factory with an output of 700,000 tons per annum, but they considered that was too small.  They considered that at that size it would be uneconomic.  They now propose to build a factory with an output of 1.2 million tons per annum.  The number of people they hope to employ in that industry is 300.  It is difficult to see how we can have 300 people usefully employed in an industry a fraction of that size.</P>
    <P>Another point made for this factory was that it would help our balance of payments to the tune of about £1 million per annum.  If we are hoping to sell our produce to the continent, it is hardly unreasonable that we should buy something from them.  It is one of the ways we could get into the continent at no cost to ourselves.</P>
    <P>There is another figure about which I have very grave doubts.  It was given by the Minister on two occasions.  He gave as the cost of transporting fertiliser from continental ports the figure of £2 10s.  I went to some trouble to find out what was the actual cost in the past year of bringing fertilisers from the continental ports to the various ports in this country.  My information is that it averaged  29/- per ton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are freight costs.  What about handling ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost to Arklow was from 23/- to 25/-.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What about handling ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fertiliser produced in Arklow will have to be handled, and I believe it will cost anything up to 25/- a ton for CIE to move fertiliser from Arklow to Cork. Those are the figures I have and it is only right I should give them to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not tell the whole story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="333" />
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting they tell the whole story, but they tell some of the other side of the story.  The ICSMA report was commended to us as an objective report. But it is so similar to the Minister's report that I do not believe it is objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would Dr. Crotty agree with the Deputy's views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe they got a lot of the information contained in their report from Nítrigin Éireann, from the same source the Minister has his information.  Therefore I do not think it is an impartial report by any means.  The NFA have gone into this. There is certainly no benefit to be conferred on the farmers.  At present they are getting the cheapest nitrogen available any place.  They have no grouse, and they are the only customers. They have opposed this up to the present.  They see no reason for it.  I am not suggesting they are completely right.  They have not all the information.  The Minister is in possession of information and costings, but has not given them to the House. It is unfair of the Minister to come in here and look for £6 million without giving such costings.  He gives us his own personal assurance that he believes it is all right, but it would make everybody much happier if, coupled with that assurance, there were detailed costings to back it.  Then we would not have to accept anybody's word.  If for commercial reasons that is not possible, I fail to see why that sort of information could not pass in a confidential way between the Minister and the leaders of the Parties. However, I have not been long enough in the House to know why that is not possible.  It certainly would put many people more at ease if they were in possession of all this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had concluded last night, I would have been very happy to say how pleased I was at the reception this Bill had got, even though the support for the Bill expressed by the leading spokesman for Fine Gael, Deputy Cosgrave, and the Leader, Deputy Dillon, was qualified <Col N="334" /> to a degree.  I am disappointed that two other members of that Party have come in this morning and differed substantially from the view put forward by their two leading spokesmen on this matter.</P>
      <P>I want to say categorically that this project is not a consolation prize for the workers at Avoca.  The decision to establish the nitrogenous fertiliser factory at Arklow would have been taken if mining operations, in which pyrites are one of the commodities extracted, were never conducted in or near Arklow.  The fact that pyrites were regarded at one stage as a means of providing sulphur as one of the raw materials for the production of ammonium sulphate was naturally something that was welcomed by the Government and by the committee entrusted with the examination of this project from the beginning.  But pyrites were at no stage a <i>sine qua non</i> of the operation.</P>
      <P>I may say at this stage that if the mining operations are resumed at Arklow at any stage and if it can be shown that the mining of pyrites, as well as of copper, will be an economic proposition, then it will be possible for Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta &mdash; for brevity, I shall call them NET in future&mdash;to convert the sulphur-producing side of the business to the use of pyrites and at very little cost.</P>
      <P>I thought I had made it clear in my opening statement and in the explanatory memorandum that the important stage in the bringing of raw materials to a plant and the distribution of the end-product as far as costings are concerned is at the distribution end. I have been advised, and I am satisfied, that Arklow, from that point of view, is at least as good, if not a better location for distribution purposes than any other location in the country.  In order to satisfy a point made by Deputy Esmonde, the intention is that the costs to the farmer of the end-product will be equated all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned that during his period as Minister for Agriculture this general proposition came to his Department, as it had done to two <Col N="335" /> of his predecessors.  On each occasion, he said, certainly on the occasion for which he had responsibility, the Department of Agriculture were not struck by the idea of having our own nitrogenous fertiliser plant.  I do not know what is the explanation of the view of the Department of Agriculture in those times.  I can only suggest that it was before the use of nitrogenous fertilisers by our farmers became a significant factor in the farming economy, and the figures I have given the House, not only in my introductory statement but also in the explanatory memorandum, clearly show the spectacular increase in user of both sulphate of ammonia and calcium ammonium nitrate in the past few years, particularly the past three years, but generally over the past decade.  I feel that if such an increase in user had been foreseen then, it is likely the Department of Agriculture attitude to the project in those days would have been different.</P>
    <P>In this connection, too, Deputy Cosgrave asked why was there a sudden impetus given to this project after the second committee reported in 1961. The first committee, set up in 1959, reported to the Government but a decision to go ahead was not taken. A decision hung on a number of things during those few years.  In 1959, the terms of reference given to the committee provided for a nitrogenous fertiliser plant based on the use of peat for gasification purposes.  At or about that time, the Government had reserved the Blackwater bog in Offaly, which was being developed by Bord na Móna, for this purpose, if the committee's report proved it feasible to use peat for gasification purposes in the production of nitrogenous fertilisers. When that committee reported, they did so favourably.  They suggested that nitrogenous fertilisers could be produced from peat as one of the means of producing a raw material. but just at that time the international grapevine in this business became operative and there was a sudden drop of about £4 to £5 per ton in the cost to the Irish farmer of nitrogenous fertilisers imported from Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> I do not think anybody here would suggest that it was because the producers of that fertiliser in Europe liked the colour of our farmers' eyes or their fields that that drop in price took place, but the Government decided at the time that as long as the farmers enjoyed these especially favourable rates, there seemed to be no justification for going ahead with the erection of a plant to produce nitrogenous fertiliser with peat as the means of gasification.  Therefore a decision to proceed was not taken at that time, but another decision was taken and it was this: that a new committee be set up, largely formed by the members of the old committee, with the terms of reference that they were to keep the whole project under review, particularly having regard to the movement of fertiliser prices, and as well, they were not, in their reexamination of the project, or reappraisal of any aspect of it, limited to peat as a means of gasification.  Therefore the whole range of a means of procuring raw material was open for examination by the committee.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, this low level of import prices prevailed.  The committee proceeded with their examination of the project, and used all the resources available to them within the country.  These were not inconsiderable, because as Deputies have pointed out, the whole project was being considered since 1930 from time to time, with the assistance of all our specialised agencies in this particular type of activity, Bord na Móna, the ESB, Ceimicí Teoranta, the late Professor Wheeler who was mentioned on a number of occasions in the course of the debate, and the senior civil servants of the Departments concerned. These included not only Industry and Commerce but Finance, Transport and Power and Agriculture, so there was a volume of expert opinion built up already in the country, and the committee satisfied themselves, and so reported in 1961, that it was possible to establish a nitrogenous fertiliser factory at Arklow, using fuel oil from the Whitegate Refinery as a means of gasification, pyrites for the production of sulphate of ammonia which, as I <Col N="337" /> have said, is only one side of the production end of the factory, and what was very important was that the end-products of ammonia and nitrogenous fertilisers could be produced at prices at least as favourable as the import prices still obtaining which, not to put a tooth in it, were dumped prices.</P>
    <P>These dumped prices, while they are not as low now as they were when this report was first made, still continue at a level lower than obtains in any other country in the world, even in the home countries of the producers of these fertilisers.  I ask anybody to look behind that story and ask himself why our farmers are enjoying these low prices by comparison with other countries.  Is it not because everybody knew the Irish Government proposed to establish a nitrogenous fertiliser factory and that this was an obvious attempt to defeat that purpose?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean the prices are likely to go up, now the decision has been taken ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices are already going up.  Some Deputy mentioned the existence of this combination of nitrogenous manufacturers called Nitrex who have come together with a view to ensuring that economic prices will be charged in future on the export markets so that they can now retain their profits.  That movement is already witnessed in this country.  There has been an upward trend in the import prices of these fertilisers notwithstanding that they are still much below the prices obtaining in their own countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Chilean nitrates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not know much about Chilean nitrates. We do not use much of it at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have to. We beat down the price of the nitrogen cartel by bringing in Chilean nitrates in the past.  I brought them in myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="338" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Chilean nitrates are not coming in here because the prices of continental nitrates are depressed and more favourable.  Therefore, as long as these prices can be maintained, there is no prospect of the import of Chilean nitrates.  The report of this committee, as established by their consultants and by the guaranteed performance of the contractors for this factory, is that nitrogen can be produced from this factory at rates at least as good as the specially favourable rates now enjoyed by the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very important undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On that basis, if the Chilean rates cannot compete with the rates obtaining at the present time, there is little likelihood that they can compete with the prices at which our own fertilisers can be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the European cartel push up the prices to what they consider economic now, is there any proposal to try to get Chilean nitrates to replace them ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to explain that.  Even if they do it in the meantime, our own production will be coming along.  We say our own production can compete with existing depressed continental prices which are keeping out Chilean nitrates.  Then, does it not follow that our production will equally keep out Chilean nitrates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is when the factory is completed.  In the meantime, is there not a danger of prices rising steeply ?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the intervening period and even in the succeeding period, fertilisers can be purchased by our farmers in any part of the world at the best possible rates&mdash;and that includes Arklow, Chile or Belgium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave it on a few occasions when this project was mentioned in other contexts in the House. I gave it in connection with the Avoca <Col N="339" /> subsidies for mining operations and in connection with the Supplementary Estimate which I sought in the House when the NET was set up originally. In checking through my brief, I find that I have given it in no fewer than four places in the course of my speech. Therefore, I do not think I could endorse any more the undertaking I have given as to there being no grant or subsidy assistance and no tariff or quota protection in any shape or form &mdash;and I am quoting from the first page of my brief.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Clinton has challenged the report of Dr. Crotty to the ICMSA as not being objective.  I did not identify Dr. Crotty with that report, but the Leader of the Opposition did, even though I knew who was responsible for it.  It is true that Dr. Crotty got all the information possible from NET when he sought it, subject to the close costings that are commercial matters and which, in any ordinary course of trade, would not be disclosed to anybody.  Nevertheless, to any points he raised they said in effect: &ldquo;Well, this is the position.  If you want to check, you can go to ICI or to any other source in order to establish or knock down our contention.&rdquo;  He was given every facility&mdash;as, indeed, anybody who on that scale sought facilities was given them.</P>
      <P>There was no question of submitting the report to the Chairman of NET.  In fact, the Chairman of NET did not know of its existence until the report appeared in Saturday's or Monday's papers, I am not sure which.  Therefore, as far as NET are concerned, except for supplying Dr. Crotty with whatever information he required and supplying him with the name or identity of whatever source was necessary to check facts that Dr. Crotty needed to have checked, there was no question whatever of influencing him in any way.</P>

    <P>Deputy Donegan last night questioned the cost per worker.  Many Deputies on the other side referred to the fact that on the basis of this operation the cost would be about £20,000 per worker in order to create employment. The purpose of this is not simply the creation of employment.  It <Col N="340" /> is one of the considerations but not the important consideration.  The important consideration is the establishment of a nitrogenous fertiliser factory to give our farmers the benefit of favourable prices and to ensure that our farmers, in conditions which are ever-changing will be cushioned against the operations and machinations of cartels and the like.</P>
    <P>There are industries which, as every Deputy knows, are capital intensive and labour intensive.  The capital intensive industries are usually the good basic industries, the ones that produce goods of high quality as a result of intricate technical and scientific processes but which, as well, give in general the possibility of having subsidiary industries established.  As everybody knows and as I think was agreed on both sides of the House, ammonium is one of those important intermediate substances that can be utilised in many directions and for many industrial purposes.  Deputy de Valera, in answer to Deputy Dillon, gave an indication of the type of subsidiary industry that might be established as a result of the setting up of the nitrogenous fertiliser factory. There are other examples beyond the plastics and synthetic rubber industries he mentioned.  Take, for example, explosives, although Deputy de Valera suggested they would not be as important now as 15 years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Other examples are copper and sulphate; the use of nitric acid for other purposes; the manufacture of CCF, that is, concentrated fertilisers; liquefied carbon, and many other possibilities.  However, again I am not using the possibilities for subsidiaries as justification for the setting up of the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to the size of the plant, which was questioned by Deputy Esmonde, the plant will be capable of producing 150,000 tons of nitrogenous fertiliser, that is, between sulphate and calcium ammonium nitrate.  While Deputy de Valera went a long way to show that the sulphate of ammonium was less efficient nitrogenous <Col N="341" /> fertiliser than the other, nevertheless the trend seems to be that our farmers are using more and more of it.  However, if the trend reversed and there were a greater concentration on calcium ammonium nitrate, then the factory would be capable of the proper adjustment.</P>
    <P>As far as the economic size of the plant is concerned I am satisfied 150,000 tons per annum output is above the necessary minimum economic output size.  In fact the contractors for this factory have in recent years erected about four factories which are less than half the output size of the Arklow project.  Incidentally Deputy Esmonde also mentioned he could not understand why we should go ahead with this project when he knew of a factory which was closing down in England.  I do not know to what factory he is referring but there is a known case of one of the important producers of fertilisers in England who are closing down one plant because it is uneconomic. Its gasification is based on hard fuel like coal and they are switching over to a new plant with gasification based on fuel oil.  That is the only one I know of in Britain and there are obviously good reasons why such an inefficient plant should close down. Deputy Esmonde will be comforted to know that this will be one of the most modern plants, in fact, the most modern plant in Europe at the time of its commissioning and therefore there need be nothing to fear from other modern plants on that score alone.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with what Deputy Esmonde said about the cost per worker.  He has worked out that the average wage will be £8 a week on the figures I gave here in the White Paper of £200,000 for salaries and wages for 300 workers including supervisory staff.  I do not know how he worked out £8 a week because if I divide 300 into £210,000 it gives me an average of £13 10s. and anybody will work that out very simply.  That is only a small point but it suggests that at least in some quarters there has been some hasty examination of this to find out what the bad points may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> Deputy Esmonde also inquired what would be the position of this plant in free trade conditions.  First of all, no matter what free trade conditions there are, assuming we are members of a common market or a free trading area, nobody would prevent our producing nitrogenous fertiliser in the most efficient manner possible and charging prices to our farmers or to anybody else on that basis.  If there are cartels or combinations within the trading group of which we shall become a member, then that trading group could not force our native factory to increase its price.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, we were a member, let us say, of the Common Market, then the difficulty for outsiders who send nitrogenous fertilisers into this country would be affected by the common external tariff over which we as a single member would have no unilateral control.  I do not know what kind of assurance Deputy Esmonde needs beyond that but I can only say that whether we are in or out of the Common Market the assurances I have given as to price will obtain.</P>
    <P>I am just reminded I may not have dealt fully with the specific question Deputy Norton raised whether the factory could revert to pyrites as a source of sulphur.  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and of course again that will depend on the price that pyrites will be made available to the factory.  I think I have dealt with all the points that have been raised.  I appreciate that the House has carried on an objective debate on the proposition.  I am glad I have got such unqualified approval from Deputy Norton and also that I have got the approval of the Fine Gael side of the House, even though there were shades of qualification among the different members of the Party in their contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it quite clear that the approval he has received is entirely and completely dependent on his personal undertaking to this House that the farmers of this country will have free access to the supply of nitrogen whensoever they may choose to look for it.</P>

      <P>It was raised through the newspapers and otherwise. It was suggested that ICI were capable of producing more than this plant could produce and employ far fewer people.  As I said, there will be 300 people employed here.  There would be four shifts around the clock every day and every week.  Therefore on an average, taking 300 people as the number employed, about 65 to 70 people will work on a shift.  The figures that have been given in respect of ICI as a plant producing slightly greater than the output here were 95 or 98.  I can only assume that the figure of 95 or 98 applies to one shift and corresponds to our figure of 65 to 70 in respect of the same working hours.</P>

      <P>On the Money Resolution, would the Minister give some information further to that which he was good enough to give me in reply to the question I put down in relation to the number of applications made, on the one hand, and the number of withdrawals and refusals, on the other?  I quite appreciate what the Minister has told me, that up to four years ago, there was no special tabulation of withdrawals and refusals, as such, but inevitably there was tabulation of the number of applications, as I understand it.  Without question, there must be tabulation of the number of acceptances and, therefore, subtracting one from the other, there would inevitably be information as to the number.  Perhaps refusals, withdrawals, and applications not proceeded with are not under a separate heading, but there must be a residual figure and that would give us tantamount information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit quite frankly that perhaps I made a mistake in putting my question down for written answer.  I did so because it was a tabular statement, but if I had got that written answer verbally, I would not have accepted it.  There must be information in the Trade Marks Office showing the number of applications in each year.  There must be information showing the <Col N="346" /> number of acceptances in each year and, therefore, there must be a residual figure, and I do not see why the Minister cannot give that figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot deal specifically with the matter which has just been raised but I do know that in latter years there has been an increasing number of applications for the registration of descriptive marks. As trading increases, naturally there will be a tendency to seek registration of marks in respect of more and more goods and varieties of goods.  I am informed that applications for descriptive marks are inevitable in such cases, and any prudent controller of marks using his discretion will be more hesitant in allowing registration of that type of mark.  I have a note with regard to the specific question raised by the Deputy that the number of refusals in any one year does not necessarily relate to the applications in that same year and there are carry-overs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

Let me say quite clearly that there has been a long line of decisions and discussions in relation to the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  In a context like this, it is to all intents and purposes equivalent to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. I am not, therefore, prepared to accept the view that &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this context is the same as &ldquo;may, if he so desires&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The position will be, in respect of subsection (3) as it appears now in this Bill, that the Controller will examine the two applications and deal solely with the first, making the principal application, and dealing solely with it, the one that has been put in first in point of time.  The effect of that will be that there will be possibilities of a flood of applications not wholly genuine, and there will be a very great advantage in being what I might call &ldquo;the moving applicant&rdquo;. A person abroad who sees the likelihood, therefore, of someone moving here in respect of a particular trade mark, which may be in use here but not registered, can hop in, put in an application and, by so doing, even though the other firm has been using the mark here for a period in excess of two years, gain an unfair advantage under this section as it is phrased at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me assure the Minister that I am not, and I do not know if he is, but I do not think he is, an expert <Col N="351" /> in trade mark procedure but I am assured by those who understand such procedure that there is a very great advantage in being what might be considered the moving application.  If there has not been in any way user in relation to a trade mark and two people make their applications, it is perfectly clear that the one who files his application first should be the one primarily to be considered but where a particular mark has in fact been in use in the State for a period of at least two years, it seems to me that by such user the person concerned has got the right to a greater equity than the person who just comes in and files the application shortly, at an earlier date in point of time for application, but at a later date in point of time for user.</P>
    <P>Where, for example, an unregistered trade mark begins to acquire a reputation in use, a rival trader could very easily think it worth his while to slip in an application to register a mark of a similar kind so as to benefit from the reputation of that unregistered mark that has been in use for some time.  The established trader only discovers that such application has been filed after it has been filed and the effect of it is, therefore, that even though he has been using some similar type of mark for years and years, he is in fact second in point of time and his rival's action has gained the initiative and gained it, in my submission, completely unfairly.</P>
    <P>The person who has been using the mark for years and years, under the well-established rule in relation to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in both the subsection itself and in the proviso to it, will find that he must stay back and allow his rival to proceed with the application and must then oppose it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Controller should have a clear discretion under the section of the Bill, clearly, in his own judgment, to decide which of the two applications is the more meritorious. Having so decided&mdash;and one of the best ways of deciding is user here&mdash; then the more meritorious application on a <i>prima facie</i> basis would proceed and the person whom the Controller deemed to be less meritorious on the <Col N="352" /> first <i>prima facie</i> examination would be in a position of opposing.  The effect of that, I think, would be also that you would find that some applications would not be opposed at all.  If there has been genuine user in the State for a period of at least two years of a similar mark, I imagine that anybody else, when he was aware of that and when he was proceeding to application, would find that it would not be worth his while trying to jump in and to pull a quick one over anybody concerned.</P>
    <P>The position in Britain, I understand, is the same under this section but entirely different under the procedure. There is a specific procedure there that conflicting trade mark applications are jointly cited in the one application and that the parties concerned come to a joint hearing on a primary basis, when the Registrar there decides which of them has the greater merit.  That can result in additional cost and it is in an anxiety to preserve the point of primary responsibility and primary merit that I have tried to relate it to something that is quite specific and easily proved and will not mean a double hearing, that is to say, existing user, and I would press the Minister strongly to accept the amendment.</P>

In the first place, to deal with the interpretation of the word, &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;Deputy Sweetman referred to decisions to the effect that &ldquo;may&rdquo; must be regarded as mandatory on the person in connection with whom it is used in the statute.  Nevertheless, I am advised that there is a British decision to the contrary, in which it is stated that the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; gives a Controller in this context absolutely unfettered discretion in dealing with two rival trade marks in this connection.</P>

      <P>If that interpretation of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the correct one, then I suggest that the Controller has all the discretion necessary to take into account the difficulties outlined by Deputy Sweetman.  Apart from that, the purpose of this proviso is to save applicants who are willing to have their rights determined by the Controller from being subjected to the incurring of heavy costs, in court.  For example if one of the rival applicants were a powerful organisation, a business concern, then they could bring the less powerful, ordinary trader perhaps, into court, a prospect that may not be acceptable or that the smaller trader may not be willing to undertake.  I submit, therefore, that the section as it stands achieves the purposes to be served to the best effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at once that I disagree entirely with the last remark of the Minister.  It is going to have exactly the reverse effect.  But, if the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; can be interpreted in the way the Minister has indicated it was interpreted in that case, and which I shall look at before the Report Stage, then I will come as far as this with the Minister, that the procedure then should be regulated by the rules and not by the section itself and if it is covered to that extent in the section, then I will press him very hard to go in relation to the rules to the pitch which applies on the other side of the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will agree with me, certainly, in this, that in relation to trade marks perhaps more than any other section of the law with which he is concerned, except perhaps copyright, it is desirable to ensure as far as we possibly can that our law here <Col N="354" /> corresponds with similar law in other countries.  It is one of the things in respect of which it is wholly undesirable to have any avoidable differences in the national laws as between one country and another.  Trade mark copyrights are things that flow over national boundaries and, therefore, we ought to ensure that whatever practice is going to be operative in one case is likely to be operative in the other in so far as we can without giving anything away ourselves.</P>
    <P>As I understand the situation, the position on the other side is dealt with by regulations and if &ldquo;may&rdquo; is going to be interpreted here and can be interpreted in the manner suggested, then I think I would come this far and say that it should be in the regulations and what I have in mind should be included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) This section shall not apply to a trade mark which is shown to the satisfaction of the Controller to have been continually used in the State for a period of not less than two years immediately preceding the application.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it matters in the slightest which amendment I move. Even if the principle were accepted by the Minister, I am certain it would require to be drafted in a slightly different way.  Section 21, as I indicated to the Minister a moment ago, to some extent follows the new enactment of Section 17.  By virtue of that section the alterations in the qualifications laid down in the 1927 Act concerning regulations in Part B will now come <Col N="355" /> into effect.  As introduced in the Bill, Section 17 provides a dispensation with the stipulation that in Part B only trade marks used for two years prior to filing will be included.  Now, however, under Section 21 the Controller is given a power to require a disclaimer of any elements in a Part B trade mark which he considers to be of a nonrestrictive character.  As I understand the situation, and I speak with very great reserve in this matter because I do not purport in any way to be an expert on it.  Part B was produced in 1919 for the purpose of enabling trade marks to be registered if they had been genuinely in use for the past two years. Although, perhaps, they were not in themselves inherently distinctive, there can be a distinctiveness acquired by extensive use which would otherwise have qualified them for registration in Part B, provided, however, they were of such character that they could become capable of becoming distinctive in the course of years.  The Minister himself, I am sure, in his professional capacity is fully aware of all the distinctions drawn by the late Mr. Justice Meredith in the Leathermack case of Richardson and Weiner in 1934.  The Minister has the advantage over me that it was subsequent to 1934 that he was at school learning his law, whereas it was prior to that that I was there.  I am quite sure that when learning his law regarding trade marks&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The law is very fully set down in that case as it was then and now we are going into a slightly different type and as I see it the effect of Section 21, if it is not amended, is going to be that we will run the risk of cluttering up the register with unnecessary disclaimers. It is accepted, of course, that in Part <Col N="356" /> A, where a registration is to be under Part A, the mark has acquired its distinction by use and, accordingly, disclaimer is, in relation to all Part B applications, going to be placed on the level of unused trade marks.  That does not seem to me to be just <i>per se</i> the correct approach.  The fact that a mark may have had, up to the point of consideration, considerable use and may be well under way towards having acquired a distinctiveness, now under this new proposal cannot prevent the imposition of disclaimer requirements.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that that is totally inequitable and totally wrong and if carried to its logical conclusion it will mean that every application for registration in Part B should be accompanied by a disclaimer.  If it had anything completely distinctive in it, it would be entitled to be included not in Part B but in Part A.  It seems to me, therefore, we have provided something to make the situation clearer and to show that there is a genuine benefit to be gained by a period of use in the State before the application.  I am not in any way tied to the period of two years.  If the Minister takes exception to my period of two years, that is a matter on which I would be perfectly prepared to meet him but it does seem that it is wrong that there should not be a benefit to be gained, to be acquired, for cases where there has been a suitable period of use as an unregistered trade mark in the country and that by so doing the unregistered mark has travelled a considerable part of the distance towards becoming completely distinctive in use and which would mean it could be taken in Part A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this disclaimer, as Deputy Sweetman knows better than I, is to ensure that so far as a trade mark with a composite picture is concerned &mdash; it might be an article with words, and either the article depicted or the words depicted or an article and words in ordinary use&mdash;no one person should arrogate to himself a proprietary interest in them.  There are many examples and I do not want to give obvious ones that would identify particular traders or <Col N="357" /> commodities but take an example of &ldquo;Night and Day Sleeping Tablets.&rdquo; If the sleeping tablet is depicted in a particular way, it identifies these sleeping tablets as the goods of a particular manufacturer and if it is distinctive in itself, then it would be possible to register that sleeping tablet with the words &ldquo;Night and Day&rdquo; under it as the trade mark as a whole, subject to a disclaimer in respect of the words &ldquo;Night and Day&rdquo;.  I think it is only right that the public should be protected against the possible monopoly of the use of such ordinary words or ordinary objects by a particular individual even in the context of advertising goods, and in a composite way with other articles or goods.</P>
      <P>I think it only reasonable in these cases that there should be a disclaimer and I think it reasonable to say that the fact that a person has been using a mark with these words or these articles depicted on it for a period of two years should not give him the right against the rest of the traders, the rest of the world and against the rest of the ordinary people to have a proprietary interest in the use of these words.  That is the fundamental point, as I see it, and it is on that basis that I would regard the obligation of the Controller not to require a disclaimer in respect of the use of such articles or such words if the applicant for a trade mark containing them had been using them for a period of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other point raised by Deputy Sweetman in connection with another section, that there is merit in having our law consistent with that of other countries, particularly Britain, with which we have very close trading relations, our Section 21 as it now stands and without Deputy Sweetman's amendment is the same as the law obtaining in Britain at present.  Deputy Sweetman suggested that I might have some knowledge in the course of my legal practice of trade mark law.  I am afraid I must admit candidly that I have not.  I never had a trade mark case and as a practising barrister, I never had occasion to read trade mark law.  Nevertheless, with my little knowledge of it, I am very much convinced by the force of arguments put <Col N="358" /> to me that a two year user of ordinary objects or ordinary words in a composite mark should not entitle that person to exclusivity in respect of these objects or words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister appreciate that the effect of what he is doing here is to take away the existing privilege for a person who has been using an unregistered mark here for a period of time.  I think that is what he is going to do under this section and it seems to me that is the wrong approach.  Let me at once say categorically that I personally am in the same position as the Minister in relation to trade mark law.  There may be cases that were dealt with in my office but I have never dealt with them myself to that extent.  Therefore, I am a complete novice in the matter.  As I understand it, registration in Part B is at present obtainable for a trade mark which the Controller considers to be capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods, provided evidence is furnished by statutory declaration to prove to his satisfaction that the mark has been used here for at least two years prior to the filing of the application in connection with the goods therein referred to.  Such registrations obtained in Part B are, I think, under Section 92 of the existing Act, excluded from the disclaimer section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will agree that experience has shown that in many cases the Controller should be able to judge whether a mark is capable of distinguishing a trader's goods or not, without reference to the question of whether the mark was already used or not.  When the British amended their Act in 1938, the necessity for two years' use before registration in Part B was removed and the possibility of inserting a disclaimer in all Part B cases was introduced.  That is the situation as it is there and that is the scheme we are proposing to make here.  Let me say that the Minister is dealing with this Bill in 1963. All my information means that the present law in relation to this particular point and the position that has been created by it in Britain has given so much dissatisfaction there that it is likely to be amended in the very <Col N="359" /> near future.  There does not seem to be much point in our introducing, merely for the sake of conformity, a provision here when it is accepted on the other side that the provision is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>As I said before, I want to see national law on this basis coincide as far as possible with the law elsewhere but that does not mean that we must absolutely follow a provision that is accepted elsewhere as being unsatisfactory and I am advised that the Minister will find, by inquiring, that over a wide field in Britain this provision has been universally condemned and that it is almost certain to be amended in the near future.  The trend there has been to use Part B merely as a repository for marks which are not quite up to the standard of Part A and the effect has been that the Controller must refuse to consider the trade mark to be capable of distinguishing a trader's goods, unless he is furnished with substantial evidence to show that it has proved itself to have that capability by actual use over a period of years.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as I see it, the position is that a trader who could previously have obtained registration in Part B without disclaimer for a trade mark which he has genuinely used can no longer do it and that the effect of this provision is that he must now disclaim something that he has used over the years and used particularly successfully.</P>
    <P>Let me take an example of something that is a trade mark.  We can take it by analogy.  We all know in relation to one type of goods a dog is depicted with certain words under it.  The analogy that the Minister has made about day and night could equally apply to the fact that a dog was a thing of such general application that it would be entirely wrong, if a gramophone company were starting now, to put &ldquo;His Master's Voice&rdquo; and a dog as a trade mark.  But everybody will accept that is a proper trade mark. The words &ldquo;His Master's Voice&rdquo; are ordinary words; the portrait of a dog is an ordinary, everyday matter; and <Col N="360" /> there would be just as much rhyme and reason to refuse that if it were a new case now as there would be in the case the Minister mentioned.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the position is this: in relation to a trade mark, there must be something in the mark that has a very specific identity with the goods concerned. In the Minister's case, it was that the name of the tablet was to be in some way or other embossed or printed on that tablet so that you could see it and the surrounding words were then to be added.  That is all right. But it seems to me one is pushing the matter very far indeed if you say it is proper for a person to take exactly the same design and to change that design merely by a small trifle and that by so doing it under this section you will prevent passing off actions. That appears to be all wrong.</P>
    <P>We all know that in an infringement action, what the defendant has to show is that the action complained of is not likely to deceive or lead to confusion. &ldquo;User&rdquo; because it happens to bring in something in everyday life, means in fact you can register no new mark at all.  In relation to any article, there is bound to be some word in the display of the mark or in the mark itself that is in everyday use, whether it is the dog or whether it is the word &ldquo;voice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I thought I understood the meaning of the section; but since the Minister has given us the explanation he has given, I do not understand where he wants to travel at all.  I want to see the position of securing registration in Part B for a trade mark which the Controller thinks to be capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods, irrespective of whether that trade mark has been previously used or not.  But I want to preserve, at the same time, that the Controller is entitled to require a disclaimer only in those cases where the trader does not prove <i>bona fide</i> use of the mark in the country for at least a period of two years.  If there has been <i>bona fide</i> use for at least a period of two years, I think it is reasonable that the person who has used that should get the benefit of such user.  I cannot understand how in any case against that argument you are <Col N="361" /> going to avoid having under Part B a flood of disclaimers which will ultimately completely clutter up the whole working of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A person making such an application for the registration of a mark two years in use must not only prove <i>bona fide</i> use but must prove <i>bona fide</i> distinctiveness.  Use and distinctiveness of a mark are not necessarily the same.  Where a mark is proved distinctive through use, a disclaimer is very seldom asked for in connection with a particular part of the mark.  In fact, the Controller has no power under this section to require a disclaimer for part of a mark which is distinctive of the applicant's goods.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by the Deputy as to whether the British intend to change the law, we have consulted them on this matter and our information does not coincide with Deputy Sweetman's information.  In the event of an application being made for the registration of a mark, which, on the face of it, might require a disclaimer but by reason of its being in use for two years, the Controller did not have power to seek a disclaimer, he would have power to refuse to register the mark.  I suggest that is in case of people seeking to register marks that have had two years' use without that degree of distinctiveness established that would otherwise be required.  The fact that the power of disclaimer in all these cases, including cases in which there is proof of user for two years, should reside in the Controller, is, I suggest, in easement of the traders themselves.  It would be wrong to tie the Controller's hands.  If a person could establish user for two years without ever having established or ever being likely to establish the distinctiveness of such a mark, it would be wrong that such a mark should be registered willy-nilly without a disclaimer.  I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5) Where the ownership has been assigned, the application for registration may be amended by substituting the name of the new owner upon such evidence of assignment being made available as the Controller may require.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This arises partly here and partly in relation to another section.  I put it down on this section because this was a specific section dealing with applications for registration.  We will find later on in the Bill the provisions dealing with the assignment, whether of the goodwill or of the business appertaining thereto.  As I understand those later provisions, the effect of them is that if there is, shall we say, a take-over of a company during or after an application has been lodged, the effect of that take-over means that the application itself cannot be proceeded with. What has to be done is that the former company must proceed to complete its application and then, having proceeded to completion with its application, at that stage, after acceptance, deal with the assignment to the new concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems entirely undesirable.  It seems to me we must recognise that in these modern days, there is a great deal of merger of companies, particularly companies dealing with trade marks and the like.  It is far more logical and efficient to provide that the application itself already on the stocks can be amended into the name of the new owner making application in this country without the necessity of proceeding with the application to the end in the old name.  The Minister may ask why the existing application would not be withdrawn and a new one filed.  That could be done, but would it not be losing the priority that had been attained?  I think it would be cheaper, in relation to the business as a whole, if the suggestion <Col N="363" /> I make is incorporated either here or in Section 29.  I thought it more proper to put the amendment down for discussion on this section which deals solely with applications.</P>

I cannot envisage at this stage, nor have I had time to check, what complexities would arise in the event of this system of assignment being permissible during the course of the examination of an application for registration, but I am told it would be necessary to provide for <Col N="364" /> partial assignment similar to the provision written into a later section, Section 29.</P>

      <P>In any event, I am advised that to assign during the course of the examination would give rise to complexities and it would not seem necessary to permit these complexities to arise when there is a sensible way of dealing with the case where it is particularly desired a mark would be registered in the name of someone other than the person who originally applied for it.  The sensible way would be that the person who has first applied might withdraw his application in favour of the new applicant who would, at that time, file a new application.</P>

      <P>They are consequential, according to my brief.  I might mention my point of view in connection with amendment No. 11.  Written statements on grounds of the Controller's decisions are not necessary in all cases.  The practice for some years has been to issue an opposition decision in the form of a short written statement and to furnish a full statement of grounds if application is made by either party and a fee paid.  Written grounds are also prepared if the proceedings result in some change or clarification of practice which it seems desirable should be published in the Journal for general information.  To make a full statement obligatory in all cases would unnecessarily increase the work and costs of the Office.  That is the principal reason why I must resist the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection, which corresponds to Section 105 of the 1927 Act, reduces the period of initial registration from 14 to 7 years. This proviso allows marks already on the register to retain their initial period of 14 years.  It has been found in practice that very many trade marks have fallen into disuse long before the expiry of the present 14 year duration.  Some of these trade marks were intended, even at the time of registration, for use for a short period only to push a new line of goods or an old line in a new get-up.  After these marks have fallen into disuse, other persons who wish to use the same or closely resembling marks on their goods may not do so without going to the trouble and expense of an application for removal.  On the other hand, trade marks which remain in <Col N="368" /> use for 7 to 10 years are likely to continue on the register indefinitely and renewal periods of substantial length are generally justified.  The Committee of Inquiry recommended a period of five years with renewals for the same period.  The Association of Registered Patent Agents favour a uniform system of an initial period of 10 years with renewals of the same length.  It is considered that practical difficulties might arise from such changes and on balance the present proposal seems to offer a reasonable solution from all points of view concerned. I understand it has worked satisfactorily elsewhere, in Britain and Australia.</P>

    <P>The last three lines of Section 29 provide &ldquo;.... and, if the Controller so thinks fit, the assignment is advertised in such manner and within such period as the Controller may direct.&rdquo; I think it is unnecessary to have any advertisement at all other than in the official Journal.  Experience has shown not merely here but everywhere else that advertisement in the official Journal is ample for all requirements. Additional advertising would only add expense.  I might again come to something <Col N="369" /> on that about which the Minister and I would each know more than we do know about the trade mark procedure&mdash;and certain other Deputies in the House as well.  In relation to Chancery suits, for example, there is provision that there must be advertisement. The effect of that provision is that the Examiner&mdash;if you like, not wishing to show partiality in any way &mdash;always directs that there must be an advertisement in each of the three daily papers.  It is quite unnecessary.</P>

If, at some stage, the person concerned in such Chancery matters were one of the many who have travelled from the south to the north, we would have the four daily papers.  Inevitably, it has meant that either you have choice between the daily papers or you have advertisement in all three.  If you have this provision here, you will have the same thing and it will very substantially and unnecessarily increase the cost.</P>
      <P>There is an official Journal.  Anybody who has any reason to want to have information about these types of matters will look at the official Journal and will get what he wants there.  The Minister also will agree that it is better to have certainty in relation to the provisions, so far as we can.  This makes the procedure vague and uncertain. I would suggest it is entirely unnecessary and that the advertisement in the official Journal meets this very specialised type of case.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 20, lines 43 and 44, to delete &ldquo;consisting of an invented word or invented words&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This raises an issue about which I should like to have some explanation from the Minister.  It comes back to my friend I mentioned a minute ago.  I would suggest that the principle that a well-known trade mark applied by a trader other than the owner of the trade mark who goes outside the normal range of articles manufactured under the mark would be misleading is not confined to invented words but applies to any type of trade mark.  It is precisely the example I quoted earlier for the Minister.  &ldquo;His Master's Voice&rdquo; dog symbol of the gramophone company applied to any article of furniture or domestic article would suggest a connection with the gramophone company which would be entirely improper.  The whole principle that is here of defining, or shall I say restricting, the defensive trade mark to the invented words or words alone seems to be one that is not maintainable, certainly on my reading of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not suggesting that the example given by the Deputy is not in point, the provision in the Bill refers to invented words rather than words such as &ldquo;His Master's Voice&rdquo;.  This provision is new and follows a provision introduced into the British law in 1938.  It is expected to be of benefit more to large foreign corporations than to Irish traders.  An examination of applications to ensure compliance with the provisions will not be simple.  This work would be greatly increased in complexity if the provisions were to extend beyond marks which are invented word marks.  Marks which are invented word marks are the brain-children of their inventors and have a degree of distinctiveness all their own and there is a strong case for providing means whereby they can be given a wider statutory protection. No such case exists in respect of other kinds of marks which can consist of surnames, geographical names and even ordinary dictionary words or commonplace <Col N="371" /> devices which are registered on the basis of use and distinctiveness in respect of a very limited range of goods and which would not be registrable except for such goods.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), to delete all words after &ldquo;provided that&rdquo; in line 36, down to the end of paragraph (a) and substitute &ldquo;such registration would not be contrary to the public interest.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to delete the provision enabling the relationship between parties to a registered user arrangement to be prescribed and to introduce into subsection (1) the public interest requirement which is already provided for in subsection (5) of this section.  The deletion of the provision which enables the relationship to be prescribed would leave the Controller with a discretion to decide in each individual case whether the relationship between the proprietor and proposed registered user or whether the conditions or restrictions under which the latter is to use the trade mark were such as to ensure that the use of the mark by the proposed registered user would not be contrary to the public interest as required by subsection (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Controller would then have a complete discretion, on the face of it, to accept any relationship or arrangement consistent with the public interest, the fact is that experience has shown, in connection with the working of the corresponding provisions of the <Col N="372" /> British Act, that satisfactory relationships or arrangements between the parties have crystallised into the categories which are proposed to be prescribed in the rules, that is, financial control, control by agreement and patentee-licensee control.</P>
    <P>In practice, even with the proposed amendment, the Controller would find himself able to accept only those arrangements which fall into one or other of the categories it is proposed to prescribe.  The advantages of prescribing relationships are that the trading public and their advisers would be able readily to ascertain from the rules what kinds of relationships are likely to be accepted and that the task of the Office in dealing with registered user applications would be greatly simplified.  In effect, it would help the trader.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Minister's view.  There is a very different proviso here from what arises in Section 28 of the British Act.  Section 28 (5) of the British Act says:</P>
      <P>if the registrar, after considering the evidence furnished, is satisfied that in all the circumstances the use of the trade mark would not be contrary to the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is presumed that because of that Deputy Costello submitted this amendment to follow the same lines.  I am a little bit worried by the use of the phrase &ldquo;prescribed relationship&rdquo;. There is going to be a relationship prescribed by the rules between the proprietor and the proposed registered user.  I should like to see that relationship prescribed in the Bill or not at all.  I do not like a suggestion of having a relationship prescribed in rules which will completely govern the whole of Section 35 and to have a situation arising in which the first time anyone knows what that prescribed relationship will be is when rules are made.  We all know, human beings being what they are, that once the rules are made, it will virtually take an earthquake to have these rules changed.  There is, of course, the tabling provision by which they could be annulled and that provision, while it is useful in <i>terrorem</i> to ensure that no <Col N="373" /> outrageous rules will be laid down, does not at the same time provide an arrangement by which there can be detailed consideration by anyone other than the Minister and his personal advisers.</P>
    <P>In relation to a typical restriction like this, that is entirely undesirable. If the relationship were to be prescribed by rules, it should be prescribed only after the rules have been promulgated in draft, laid before the House in draft, and generally publicised in draft, so that everyone will have an adequate opportunity of considering them before they actually come to be made.  In that way, it would be realistically possible to provide amendments. Once the rules have been made, power to annul does not provide an efficacious means of coping with small matters such as this.</P>
    <P>I do not know at the moment, nor does the Minister, what he proposes to be a prescribed relationship, and I object to passing a section not knowing what it will mean.  This is vital to the section.  It would be highly dangerous to pass it as it is.  It is far from clear.  I suggest it would be much better to leave the phraseology in the manner which Deputy Costello has provided, or alternatively to provide something entirely different as a means of publicising consideration of the draft before the ordinary tabling and annulling powers of the section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was considered but it was thought better to incorporate it in the rules rather than in the Bill itself.  I will read it.  It is not very long.  The requisite relationships are:</P>
      <P>(a)  That the registered proprietor of the trade mark has control over the proposed registered user;</P>
      <P>(b)  that the proposed registered user has control over the registered proprietor of the trade mark;</P>
      <P>(c)  that some other person has control over both the registered proprietor of the trade mark and the proposed registered user;</P>
      <P>(d)  that there subsists between the proposed registered user and the registered proprietor of the trade mark an agreement in writing specifying conditions whereby the registered proprietor shall be entitled to ensure that the goods in relation to which the trade mark is to be used by the proposed registered user conform to characteristics specified by the registered proprietor;</P>
      <P>(e)  that the proposed registered user is to use the mark in relation only to goods manufactured by him and protected by patent under which he is a licensee and which is registered in the name of the registered proprietor of the trade mark.</P>
      <P>Those are they, and I suggest that having consulted them in due course, Deputy Sweetman might reconsider his position.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister give any consideration to an addition in some shape or form to subsection <Col N="375" /> (7).  Certainly the section should include something equivalent to subsection (7) of the British Act of 1928. I cannot understand why there is no provision here similar to that protecting confidential information.  It seems to me that without a qualification similar to the British one, there is a real danger that confidential information supplied in connection with the registration of user would be disclosed to a trade rival.  For that reason, if for no other reason, I think a subsection like the British subsection should have been included.  I do not know whether the Minister gave any specific attention to that but I should like, in any event, to mention it now so that, if necessary, we can submit an amendment on those lines on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask the Minister why, in relation to subsection (4), he did not specify the requirements. As I understand it, again, the form in the British section is far more specific than the form the Minister prescribes here.  I suggest it might be desirable for the Minister to adopt the procedure in relation to that section which he adopted a few moments ago of letting us know what he has in mind to prescribe in the rules.</P>

I am thinking in terms of disclosure, in accordance with the proper processes here, to the other side, which is a different thing. The Minister, by referring to the Official Secrets Acts, is referring to the possibility of an official passing out information that should not be disclosed.  That is not what is in my mind.  What is in my mind is that, unless there is a specific provision, the confidential information must be given to the trade rival.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 24, lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;, or in any other case in which he considers it to be necessary in the public interest,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand this section, under subsection (3) the Controller has the right himself to apply to the court in the case of fraud.  I agree that that is entirely right and proper.  But the position here seems to be that there is power given in subsection (2) to amend the register for any case other than fraud and other than the public interest.  If that is so, then it seems to me that subsection (3) is just verbiage and quite unnecessary.  I cannot see at all why there should be anything more than the power to rectify in the case of fraud or in the case of the public interest, or, possibly, even pure clerical errors.  If the register is kept properly, and it should be, and I suggest it must be kept properly, <Col N="377" /> there should be no necessity whatever to provide for amendment.  This will mean that the Controller is given a very vague and far-reaching power under subsection (2) to amend in any way that he thinks proper.  That is entirely wrong.  It is allowing the interpretation and the correctness of the register to depend solely on his personal view.  I am not now making any comment on any particular Controller in stating that.  Where there has been fraud, we all agree that the register must be amended.  If it is necessary to have amendment in the public interest, I think we would all equally agree, but I simply cannot see why there should be the very, very wide power of amendment given by subsection (2) of Section 39 to both the court and the Controller.  If the power in subsection (2) were restricted to the court alone, then I would not have the same objection to it, but I do not think it is proper that the Controller should have such a wide discretion vested in him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Inevitably the discretion will be a matter for the court because, if the Controller applies to the court to rectify the register as a matter of public interest, then it will be for the court to decide whether, in fact, it is a matter affecting the public interest. I think the House will agree that the public interest must have priority over the interests in general of trade mark proprietors or of a particular trade mark proprietor.  The fact that the rectification can only be effected by the court ensures that the individual interests will be protected.  There are many cases in which the public interest might be affected; for example, one such case would be a trade mark being registered which could cause confusion in the public mind.  In such a case it would obviously be in the interests of the public that the Controller should go to the court.  I repeat that the court will be the authority to decide whether or not the submission to it is in the public interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives the Controller an extraordinary power to interfere with an entry in the register which he thinks may be wrong.  He is not bound in any way, as far as I can understand, to make any reference to the party who is vitally concerned, that is to say, the registered proprietor of the trade mark in question.  I put it further to the Minister that if a genuine error has been made the person most anxious to have it corrected should be the registered proprietor because it is on the entry that his rights depend and he, naturally, if there has been an error is the person who should come along and say so. But, in this subsection it is &ldquo;of his own motion&rdquo;.  Of his own motion the Controller has got power to do this. The prescribed notice is a very milk and watery way of giving the other person the opportunity to object to the matter.</P>
      <P>I suggest that there should be some restriction, perhaps by providing that he can correct any error on the consent of the registered proprietor&mdash;to do that, I would be completely agreeable&mdash;or, alternatively, that he can correct something that is so obviously a clerical error that it is beyond question; but, if it is a question of going beyond that, that before doing so he must have consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the subsection as it is.  Supposing the Controller considers there is an error in the entry and he gives the prescribed notice to the registered proprietor and the registered proprietor comes along and says, &ldquo;No, there is no error.  I think that is the entry that <Col N="380" /> there should be&rdquo;, the Controller still has the power under this subsection to correct the error.  Now, that is obviously wrong.  If the registered proprietor objects and says it is not an error, that the Controller may think it is an error but that he does not, obviously, there must be some provision to cover a case like that.  While I am prepared to agree that something that is obviously a typist's, clerical or printer's error or something obvious like that, could be dealt with in this fashion, the power to decide whether it is an error in substance or not could not be left open in the way it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is that further case in which a man who is the proprietor of a registered mark might suffer by a clerical error and naturally it would be only in his interests and it would be right that the Controller should have power to correct that and not at the expense of the man himself. In this way the Controller could proceed to have an entry corrected without such expense and if the man felt himself aggrieved there is always the power to appeal.  As well as that, the registered proprietor would have to get notice of the intention of the Controller to have this correction effected but there is the contrary case where, due to genuine error in the Controller's office, a registered proprietor would get in his registered mark something more than he would be entitled to by reason of the error and it would be only just then and in the interests of the public or in the interests of other proprietors of registered marks that might be affected that the Controller should have this power in those circumstances also.  On both scores it is, I submit, not inequitable that the Controller should have power to correct an error after due notice given to the proprietor of the mark and subject to appeal to the court.</P>

      <P>I understand that anybody aggrieved can go to the court to rectify the register.  However, if the Deputy would agree that as long as there is obligation to serve notice and as long as there is right of appeal the registered owner is safeguarded against damage to himself or other registered owners of trade marks are safeguarded against the particular individual getting more than he should have got, I submit that sufficient is done to serve both interests without limiting the error to a clerical error.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, the difficulty in relation to these cases that you are not considering appeals in the sense of appeal in the ordinary civil case because in the ordinary civil case if you appeal because you know you are right and if you win the appeal, somebody else has the pleasure of paying you the costs involved.  In this case you never get costs; you always have to bear the costs of going on the appeal against the decision of the Controller.  I will go so far with the Minister as to say that if there is under subsection (3) the right of appeal to the court by the proprietor, if he disagrees with the judgment of the Controller in the matter and says, <Col N="382" />&ldquo;No; I will not accept that that is a correction that should be made but let the court decide&rdquo; and if the court decides that the Controller was right, then the registered proprietor pays the costs and if the court decides the registered proprietor was right and the Controller was wrong, let the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce pay the costs.  Otherwise, I suggest that the subsection should be restricted to clerical errors alone.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments put down by Deputy Costello are somewhat wider than the one I put down but in any event it does appear that the cumulative effects of the subsections, as they are at present, give the Controller very wide powers, indeed.  One must recollect that in relation to the matters with <Col N="386" /> which he is dealing in this Bill, he is to a large extent an administrative official.  I do not think it desirable that an administrative official should have the extraordinarily wide powers here and I would throw out the <i>caveat</i> to the Minister that there is a possibility that it might be unconstitutional to give such powers to an administrative official and not to a court, as such.</P>
    <P>What I am particularly worried about is the effect they are likely to have on the practice.  I think it would be quite impossible to get any people who are not directly concerned with an application to give evidence by statutory declaration.  Disinterested traders will not come forward in connection with trade mark proceedings if they are bound to appear before the Controller on pain of punishment if they refuse to appear or if they refuse to produce any document he may call for.  The effect of that will merely be that the Controller will not get statutory declarations at all.</P>
    <P>I think I can see without question the case for subsections here to provide that, if the Controller calls upon a person who is giving a statutory declaration to appear before him in evidence and that person does not appear, the evidence included in the statutory declaration shall be completely disregarded.  That seems to be absolute sense but before one goes to a disinterested person and asks him to give a declaration that he has, in fact, seen this mark regularly used, you will have to warn him: &ldquo;If you do give such a declaration you may have to go before the Controller and you may be held up and you may have to produce your own books in evidence as to whether you sold articles of that sort or not.&rdquo;  I think the ultimate result will be that nobody will produce declarations.  That is not what the Minister or anybody else wants.</P>
    <P>The method I suggest of coping with that situation is that if a declaration is not substantiated by a personal appearance in evidence when required it shall be completely ignored for the purposes of the trade mark application. I suggest the past experience in relation to trade marks does not bear out <Col N="387" /> that the Controller requires the powers that are here, powers, I may say, which are almost analogous to criminal proceedings and certainly, in my view, ones that must be considered more meticulously before they are given to an administrative official.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific amendment in my name, apart from the wider one in the name of Deputy Costello, I must confess I do not see the necessity at all for paragraph (c) of subsection (6).  To suggest that you would put the Controller in exactly the same position as a court of law is to me quite absurd.</P>
    <P>Let me give this example that would undoubtedly arise and give the Controller power to act if he wanted to do so.  If a barrister appeared at a court of law without his wig and insisted on making an application without it he could be committed for contempt. If a barrister appears before the Controller, under this proviso he can be committed for contempt. I do not suggest the Controller would be such a fool as to do that but I think that it is all wrong that a Bill should go through the House giving an administrative official a power of that sort.  I think there is no case whatever for the retention of paragraph (c).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers that Deputy Sweetman objects to have, in fact, always resided in the Controller. If the Deputy consults Section 142 of the 1927 Act, he will see that the Controller has power to require in respect of <i>viva voce</i> evidence attendance of witnesses, that he may take evidence on oath and has power in regard to discovery of documents and is in the same position in all respects as a judge of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, there is a distinction in regard to Deputy Sweetman's amendment. I concede that readily.  I believe there is precedent for non-judicial tribunals to have power of committal in the event of contempt.  However, I am not so sure that Deputy Sweetman has not something in his amendment and so far as that amendment is concerned, I undertake to consider it very <Col N="388" /> carefully on the next occasion.  So far as the others are concerned, I suggest these are not extensions of the existing powers of the Controller.  Rather are they a continuation of them in the form of being spelled out more clearly.</P>

The Controller has the power of summoning, the power of <i>subpoena</i>, I take it, and the power of discovery of documents and the only other power involved here is that which Deputy Sweetman objects to in his amendment. That is one I should like to have another look at.  If Deputy Sweetman withdraws amendment No. 29, I shall undertake to consider it further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), line 32, to delete &ldquo;or of a symbol&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> I do not know exactly what the Minister has in mind here.  We have a departure from the British Trade Mark Act of 1938 about which we have had some discussion already.  I understand the word &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; in subsection (2) is a departure from the provisions of that Act and in the circumstances I am intrigued to know what the Minister has in mind in this section. There is a practice in America of placing a very small letter &ldquo;r&rdquo; in a circle adjacent to the trade mark with the idea of indicating that the mark is registered in the home country.  If that is the intention of this provision here, it seems to me to be a bit drastic, seeing it is only to the initiated that the symbol conveys that the mark is registered in America, while to the ordinary public, the uninitiated, it means nothing.</P>
    <P>What I want to know is whether, if a trader exposes for sale an article from America or elsewhere that has this symbol, he will be infringing the law by so doing?  I wonder therefore whether the inclusion of the word &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; means we are implying the registration in Ireland of a trade mark, or whether the word should be deleted as being indefinite and likely to produce nuisance?  I do not know exactly what is the position with regard to trade marks registered in America for registration in this country.  I do not think they can do it by what might be called transfer of registration.  If they could, manufacturers selling their manufactures here would like to do so.</P>
    <P>I think the position is&mdash;and I should like confirmation of this from the Minister&mdash;that many American firms who wanted to register trade marks here have found that trade marks registered in the States are not always acceptable for registration under the Acts here.  If that is so, it means that there must be a separate package for American goods coming in here so as to delete the symbol referred to above.  That does not seem to be necessary in order to protect the ordinary case.  I should like to have some clarification from the Minister. All the difficulty arising under this section arises from the inclusion of the <Col N="390" /> word &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; now newly and for the first time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the use of the words &ldquo;or of the symbol&rdquo; in this section is to make it an offence to describe any mark as registered, which is not in fact registered, by the use of this symbol.  The use of symbols to denote registration is increasing, and it is important that this growing practice should not be used to deceive the public.  If the use of the symbol &ldquo;r&rdquo; in a circle in relation to goods in this country indicates, or is sought to indicate, that the mark is registered in this country, it is clearly wrong.  If it creates in the minds of our traders that the mark is so registered, I submit our traders and the public should be protected against the possibility of this deception, innocent though it may be in some cases.  Certainly, any practice which is deliberately solely intended to indicate that a trade mark registered in some other country is also registered here should be prohibited. That is why in order to catch such marks, or such insertions on marks as &ldquo;r&rdquo; in the circle, the words &ldquo;or of a symbol&rdquo; are included in the subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (7), and insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Where the Controller is of the opinion that a person registered in the Register of Trade Mark Agents is guilty of conduct disgraceful to that person in a professional respect he may apply to the Court for an order erasing the name of such person from the register of trade mark agents and the Court on hearing such application may make <Col N="391" /> such order on the said application as the justice of the case requires. The Court may direct how the costs of the application are to be borne.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think it is proper to give to the Controller the right of removal from the register of trade mark agents somebody who has been on that register.  I am quite prepared to accept that the Controller should have the right to apply to the court for an order for such removal; but to give the Controller himself the power of removal is to put in the hands of an administrative official a power over the people with whom he is dealing which no administrative official should have in any circumstances whatever.  I am quite satisfied that subsection (7) (a), as such, would undoubtedly be declared unconstitutional. I accept that under (c) a person has the right of appeal, but the mere right of appeal will not be sufficient to validate constitutionally the actions of an administrative official.</P>
    <P>The proper course in relation to the circumstances envisaged by the Minister in subsection (7) is to give the Controller the right of applying to the courts to have the particular person struck off the list.  I imagine the Minister will agree with me so easily in respect of that contention that I do not think I need say any more at this stage.</P>

      <P>Except perhaps Deputy Sweetman might consider the import of paragraph (d) of subsection (7) which affects the decision of the Controller in this respect&mdash;&mdash; that the person affected may apply within a period of 14 days.

      <P>Unless it is the court that takes the decision, the person concerned will appeal to the court from a <i>de facto</i> decision and that is putting that person in an unfair position.  The burden of proof would be on the agent and I think in relation to a removal from the register the burden of proof should be on the Controller and let him be the motivating party in bringing the matter to court.  Otherwise, the situation will be quite unfair for the agents concerned.  I think the Minister agrees with me in this case and he ought to come the whole way with us.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> In subsection (8), line 50 to 53, to delete &ldquo;and the maximum fees which may be charged by any person registered in the register of trade mark agents for such services in connection with the registration of trade marks as may be specified in such rules&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I understand this situation, there seems to be considerable confusion about the power in relation to the fees involved here.  As I understand it, what we would all wish to aim at would be that if a person goes to a trade mark agent and says: &ldquo;I want you to handle this case for me&rdquo;, and the agent says: &ldquo;I shall accept it only at a fee of £X &rdquo;, and if the person concerned goes on, with £X as the appropriate fee, that fee would be paid.  However, if the trade mark agent does not make the stipulation, other fees should be prescribed. I want it to be made clear that there is power for the party to contract like that with his agent.</P>
    <P>The Minister can visualise persons going to solicitors or counsel asking them to take a case and the solicitor or counsel saying they do not want to unless a special fee is paid.  I think the agent here should have that right too.  In fact he has that right but it is not generally accepted in the profession that the right exists under legislation.  Hence the provisions sought in amendments Nos. 37 and 38. I do not understand why there would be a fee fixing authority like this without the counterpart of an association to deal with the matter such as the Incorporated Law Society.  It seems to me there will be unilateral action here which is not entirely defensible and I should like some clarification of the general position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>People who are entitled to engage in this business are put on a register as qualified persons and are therefore given a statutory right.  Being recipients of a statutory right they should be subject to statutory limitations of the fees they may charge.  There is no obligation on them under statute to apply for inclusion in the register.  I suggest that reasonable maximum fees should be chargeable and that those concerned should be confined to them.  To change <Col N="394" /> the law in this respect would require a change also in respect of registered patent agents.  In that connection too, the patent agents are registered and therefore have an obligation under statute to operate within certain maximum fee limits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely they are entitled to say they do not want to deal with the case at all, that they would rather not handle it because they did not think the fee would be adequate because of the complexity of the case and then, if the applicant says that notwithstanding such a position he still wants the agent to do it at a fee outside the rules, are they not entitled to do it so long as there is a clear contract?</P>

As long as a solicitor is entitled to apply for sanction of the Taxing Master there cannot be a closed shop by agents pushing up the <Col N="395" /> fees.  The statutory official, if the Taxing Master is there, would provide the levelling.  If they push them up too high, all the people have to do is to move over to the solicitors' profession.</P>

    <P>All that we suggest is that the discretion to apply or not to apply should not rest with the Controller but that the correct procedure would be that <Col N="396" /> the Controller should go to the court in the first instance and move that the man's name be struck off the list. Then they stand before the court on equal footing, the Controller alleging misfeasance on the part of the patent agent and the patent agent defending himself.  We are not to imagine that patent agents will be brought before the court in clutches.  There are very few of them.  I doubt if there has ever been a case of one being struck off the roll and it is unlikely that such a case will ever arise: certainly many will not.  This is all the more reason for sticking firmly to the principle that, where a man is transacting business under the supervision of an administrative official of the State, that administrative official should not be the judge of whether or not his conduct is right or wrong.</P>
    <P>I can imagine in other cases, the classic case being made that perpetual reference to the court holds up proceedings. That defence surely cannot be made in this case inasmuch as we suggest in paragraph (d) that even where the Controller removes, himself, the patent agent should set a good example to the Minister and all his colleagues in this matter; that the initial sanction should be vested in the court and that, if the Controller wishes to act against his agent, he should do so in the court and not on his own.</P>

      <P>In paragraph 1, lines 43 and 44, to delete &ldquo;one year&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not think the times provided in the Bill will give anything like sufficient opportunity to traders to sort out matters and to take the necessary action.  I believe that, by restricting the time, as the Minister has done initially in the Bill a flood of applications of a protective nature will be thrown in and that it will mean considerable administrative difficulty.  We must remember that these are matters that have arisen consequent upon the development over the past 35 years of the practice that has been there.  In those circumstances, it is entirely proper that we should have at least three years to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the effect of having three years will mean a lesser burden on the Patents Office than the shorter period. I know the Minister suggested, in another context, that we should go to two years.  I think he should go to three years for the whole lot.  Otherwise, a considerable number of protective applications will be filled while people see what is happening.  That is unnecessary.  It will add on the cost to the traders concerned of administering <Col N="398" /> the office.  I do not think the Minister will lose anything by extending the period to three years instead of one year.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Hotel Proprietors Bill, 1962&mdash; Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the discussions we had on this section when last the Bill was before the House.  I have been reconsidering the section in the light of the comments made about it on that occasion.  As it is at present, the section is designed to cover the case of a person who goes to a hotel without special contract. A hotel proprietor is bound to receive such a person.  If the person has a special contract, the duty to receive arises out of the contract itself.  However, if the hotel proprietor refuses to receive under the contract, the prospective guest could fall back on the <Col N="399" /> statutory duty to receive.  As I understand it, that is the existing law.</P>
      <P>I agree, however, that the section as drafted does not make that intention quite clear.  Furthermore, I am now satisfied that the statutory duty to receive should apply to all persons, whether or not they come under special contract.  In the case of a special contract, the proprietor may, of course, be bound under the contract to provide accommodation, food or drink and provision will have to be made separately in the section for such a case.  I hope to bring in an amendment on Report Stage which will clarify this section in these two respects.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to me by the hotel industry about the use of the term &ldquo;reasonable prices&rdquo; in the section.  I think some reference may have been made to this matter when last we were discussing the section.  The provision about prices as at present drafted is a restatement of the existing common law, the object being to ensure that a hotel proprietor will not be able to evade his duty by offering facilities at a prohibitive rate. However, the hotel industry claims that the obligation to supply accommodation, food and drink at reasonable prices could be invoked by troublesome or unscrupulous persons to create difficulties for them and could be used by such people to upset the normal running of the hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, they say this provision is unnecessary nowadays because these matters are regulated by Bord Fáilte and the maximum charges of all hotels registered with Bord Fáilte are published in accordance with the requirements of the Tourist Traffic Acts and a hotelier who exceeds the published charges incurs the risk of having his registration terminated by Bord Fáilte. I am considering the representations which the hotel proprietors have made in this matter and I shall be introducing an amendment on Report Stage to cover the point.  It is not that I do not think that the term &ldquo;reasonable prices&rdquo; as it is used in the section is suitable and adequate but that I wish to allay the fears and the worries <Col N="400" /> of the hotel proprietors more than anything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that this is a section which brings about a fairly radical departure from the existing law in that, when this Bill goes through, the duty imposed on hotel proprietors will be to receive allcomers, irrespective of whether they are travellers or not.  I am glad the Minister has indicated he will look again at the section in view of the representations made to him.</P>
      <P>There was one point I mentioned on the last occasion; I see in the Official Report it is credited to Deputy Sweetman but, nevertheless, I would ask the Minister to deal with it.  It does seem to me that the present wording of this section imposes an absolute obligation on hotel proprietors to make their services, both in regard to food and drink, available to allcomers at all hours.  The point I wanted the Minister to look into was the effect of this in relation to the hours under the intoxicating liquor legislation.  As the Minister is no doubt aware, there are concessions to hoteliers so far as closing hours are concerned under the Intoxicating Liquor Act but only limited concessions.  It does not entitle them to remain open all night and to serve drink at any time anyone calls. If you take the wording of Section 3 it does seem we are imposing an obligation on hotel proprietors to serve food or drink or provide sleeping accommodation to anyone who calls at any hour, day or night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the extension of the obligation on hotel proprietors, that extension is more apparent than real because the concept of a traveller in the common law had become so widely extended that it was almost synonymous with allcomers. There is an English case where it was decided that a man who drops around to the &ldquo;local&rdquo; for a drink in the evening is a traveller.  However, I think we could profitably leave the discussion on that over until the Deputies see the form of the new section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no problem about the intoxicating liquor point.  Deputy O'Higgins will see that the section <Col N="401" /> even as it is drafted says: &ldquo;Unless he has reasonable grounds for refusal.&rdquo;  It would be a reasonable ground for refusal to say he was refusing to serve a drink because it would break the law to do so.  There is an additional factor, that is, where you have an Act like the Intoxicating Liquor Act specifically directed to provisions governing the sale of intoxicating liquor, it would override this sort of general provision.</P>

    <P>The figures in Column (2) relate to children <i>recommended</i> for tonsillectomy as a result of the examination of the child at the school.  In some of these cases the surgical staff, or the ear, nose and throat specialist who subsequently examined the patient, decided against surgical treatment, and in some, the parents did not bring the child to hospital for further examination or treatment.</P>
    <P>In mid-January, 1963, the number of children in Co. Wexford awaiting tonsillectomy was nine.  Apart from these, about 50 children, possibly needing such treatment, were awaiting examination or re-examination by the ear, nose and throat specialist, the majority being children referred as a result of school health examinations carried out in November-December, 1962.  A proportion of these children may not require tonsillectomy.</P>

      <P>As I have stated on many occasions in reply to similar questions, the last occasion being the 5th of last month, the Government have constantly in mind the question of extending fishing limits by international agreement rather than by unilateral action.

      <P>The bilateral arrangement <Col N="409" /> come to between the Icelanders and the British was after the Icelanders had taken unilateral action to extend, and the Deputy will remember the trouble there was about that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the difficulty. One can make a bilateral agreement with Great Britain, possibly, or some of the continental countries, such as Norway, which are sympathetic towards our extensions.  On the other hand, we are conscious of the fact that Russian trawlers have now turned up and I think the Minister should appreciate that, with the incursion of growing numbers of trawlers on these fishing grounds on the south-east coast of this country, a more and more acute problem is arising.  It is, I think, true to say that the herring fisheries of Holland precipitated three European wars in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries and I am sure we do not want to start another war on the south-east coast of Ireland.</P>

The re-investigation did not establish that he had continuous membership of Óglaigh na hÉireann (Irish Republican Army) or kindred organisation during the three months which ended on 11th July, 1921.  I ceased to be satisfied, therefore, that the medal had been duly awarded to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 34, 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is prepared to render such assistance as it can in the circumstances comprehended in the questions, at the request of the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>During the recent inclement weather five requests for assistance were received in the Department.  Particulars of the five cases are briefly as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Arising out of a request from a private individual in the Blessington area, County Wicklow, on 31 Nollaig, 1962, the Department got in touch with Wicklow County Council and intimated that any request the council might make for assistance would be sympathetically considered. At the council's request two Army <Col N="423" /> trucks (with two drivers per truck and 23 other men) were provided on 1 Eanáir, 1963, to convey supplies from Naas to Blessington.  In the event the trucks did not succeed in getting through to Blessington because of ground conditions.</P>
    <P>(2)  On 3 Eanáir, 1963, the <i>Evening Herald</i> inquired whether the Department would be prepared to supply aircraft to drop food (which the newspaper would supply) in Valleymount, County Wicklow.  Wicklow County Council was advised of the request and indicated that as the road to Valleymount was open the use of aircraft to deliver food there was not considered necessary.</P>
    <P>(3)  On 3 Eanáir, 1963, Deputy Clinton requested the Department that a Sáirsint of An tAer Chór, who was a member of the Irish Parachute Club, should be made available to travel with other members of the Club in an aircraft, which was scheduled to drop supplies the following day (4 Eanáir, 1963) in County Wicklow. The Deputy stated that the Sáirsint had exhausted his annual leave and that he would be a keyman in the Club's projected operations.</P>
    <P>Special leave with pay was authorised for the Sáirsint who, I understand, participated in a supplies-dropping operation on 5 Eanáir, 1963.  Apparently weather conditions did not permit such an operation on 4 Eanáir, 1963.</P>
    <P>(4)  During the period 4 to 7 Eanáir, 1963, Deputy Cosgrave and others approached the Department regarding the position in Ballinascorney area, County Dublin.  The matter was discussed with Dublin County Council which indicated that the situation in the area did not call for military assistance.</P>
    <P>(5)  On 5 Eanáir, 1963, two land-rovers, with two drivers for each, were made available to Wicklow County Council for use in connection with relief work in the Blessington and Valleymount areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply in which he says that the Department are prepared to <Col N="424" /> render assistance of the type indicated in the questions, if requested by the local authority, would the Minister be good enough to look into this position for me?  As recently as yesterday evening, I received a telephone message in the House here from a gentleman speaking on behalf of six families in the Ballyfolan area requesting permission from the Department of Defence to use a bulldozer stationed at Kilbride Camp for the purpose of clearing roadways in the area.  He states that the children have been unable to go to school and that the Army personnel are prepared to do the necessary work, if permission is given.  I would ask the Minister to look into that matter, with the county council authorities if necessary, so that the work can be done.</P>

      <P>Traffic bye-laws for Wexford were made in 1955 but were not formally brought into force because the local authority were unable to see their way to provide the money to put up the requisite traffic signs.  The signs were put up in November, 1961, but by that time the new Road Traffic Act was in force and bye-laws made under the old Act could not then be brought into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> The police do not consider that the 1955 bye-laws are appropriate to-day, and proposals for new bye-laws are being examined.  This involves, at local level, consultation with officials of the local authority, and it also involves detailed examination by the Traffic Section attached to Garda Headquarters.  As a result of the passing of the 1961 Act, 40 or more sets of traffic bye-laws affecting different cities and towns have to be made, each involving detailed consideration.  Some of them were in hands before the Wexford bye-laws.  I understand that it is likely to be at least some months before the bye-laws for Wexford will be ready for submission to the Minister for Local Government.  Before they are submitted, they will have to be sent, formally, to the Wexford Corporation for consideration and the length of time the Corporation takes to consider them will also affect the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section in this Bill defining in very wide terms the liability of a hotel <Col N="434" /> proprietor and I should like to have it clarified for me as to what precisely the obligation of a hotel-keeper is to receive all persons.  It is readily understandable that if you are dealing with a large hotel in a city it is not unreasonable to expect them to be in a position to receive guests at any hour of the night or day, if they wish to hold themselves out as hotels as distinct from guest houses or something of a different status from hotels. But in rural Ireland is it intended to place a statutory obligation on a hotel-keeper in a small town to receive and accommodate guests arriving at, say, 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the guest says he is not arriving improvidently at that time, that his car broke down and that he planned to arrive at 11 o'clock but was, in fact, fortuitously delayed and he comes at three or four in the morning.  I would be prepared to say that I would regard it as deplorable on the part of a hotel-keeper in rural Ireland, given that kind of explanation, not to come to the person's assistance in that embarrassing situation out of his own good will but regretting lack of public spirit and goodwill is a very different thing from placing a statutory obligation on them that renders them liable to penalties, if they do not conform to it.</P>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would say if he is satisfied that lateness of the hour constitutes reasonable ground for refusal and, if so, what is the latest hour that would constitute reasonable ground for refusal of admission?  It is quite manifest that the latest hour appropriate to Dublin would be different from the latest hour appropriate to Naas and that the latest hour appropriate to Naas might not in fact be at all appropriate to a town, like Ballybay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to say that I think the actual time or hour has very little to do with it.  It would be a question of fact in each case.  The arrival of a person at an hotel at an early hour of the morning and the duty of the hotel proprietor to receive him or not would be determined by all the facts of the situation.  I could imagine if the hotel proprietor says &ldquo;I have no accommodation for you.  All my accommodation is booked&rdquo; or alternatively, if there were no staff available to provide food, the hotel proprietor could reasonably claim &ldquo;It is unreasonable to expect me to provide a meal at this hour of the night.&rdquo;  That would be reasonable grounds for refusing to provide food or drink, but it would depend in each case on the particular circumstances of the situation. The section goes no further than to say he must do it unless he has reasonable grounds for refusing. The existing law is that the hotel proprietor must receive a person at any hour of the day or night he may approach the hotel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) of this section provides:</P>
      <P>Where sleeping accommodation is engaged for a person as a guest at a hotel, whether or not under special contract, the proprietor is under a duty to receive any property brought to the hotel by or on behalf of that person for which the proprietor has accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister would deal with this situation a bit more fully.  I understand the position to be from reading that section that again <Col N="436" /> we are placing an absolute obligation on hotel proprietors to receive any property no matter what size, type, or character it may be, the only qualification being that it is necessary that the person for whom the property is being received should have engaged sleeping accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister no doubt is aware that the Council of Europe recommended uniform rules with regard to the liability of innkeepers and hotel keepers and that they gave a recommendation in relation to the character of property that hotel keepers would be obliged to keep for guests.  As far as I know, they recommended that anything that was dangerous, for example, should be outside of the categories which a hotel proprietor would have to keep.  In other words, if a hotel proprietor is satisfied that a particular article a guest wants to bring on to his premises is, in fact, a dangerous article, he can refuse to do it.</P>

      <P>There is no qualification here.  In the other section we were discussing, Section 3, it was subject to the qualification that a hotel proprietor might have reasonable grounds for refusing.  That does not happen in Section 5.  The rules recommended by the Council of Europe would exclude articles which might be dangerous.  They also suggested the exclusion of articles or property which might have an excessive value and which might not be covered by the insurance on the premises or which might for some other reason be cumbersome.</P>

    <P>The Minister should look into this section again.  While I think there will be general approval so far as the public is concerned that they should have the maximum amount of protection possible when they bring themselves or their property on to hotel premises, nevertheless, it is the Minister's duty to try to hold the scales evenly between the public, who are the guests, and the proprietors of the establishment.  It seems to me to be going a bit far to put this absolute <Col N="437" /> obligation on them without any exception or limit.  I should be glad if the Minister would reconsider the section.</P>

      <P>In fact, I have been having a look at the section in the light of representations which have been made to me by the hotel industry. I feel the wording of the section as it stands is all right&mdash;that hotel proprietors need only receive property for which they have accommodation.  If they had not got suitable or appropriate accommodation for the particular items mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins, they would not be under an obligation to receive them.  However, it has been suggested to me that is not quite clear from the section as it stands and I intend, between now and Report Stage, to consider amending the section in order to meet the criticism which has been made of it.</P>

      <P>Again, I have had representations from the hotel proprietors about this question.  It has been suggested that the word &ldquo;precincts&rdquo; might lead to difficulty.  Deputies will realise that in the case of a person owning a hotel in a city street the property is deemed to extend into the centre of the road, and it might be possible to argue that a motor car parked at the kerbside outside the hotel was actually within the precincts of the hotel.  Again, I am not satisfied there is any validity in that objection; but I propose to have regard to it and again it may be desirable to introduce an amendment to make it clear that it is only a motor car brought within the grounds of the hotel proper that would be included.</P>

      <P>May I suggest this for the expedition of this Bill?  It appears that the Minister very properly has discussed this Bill, as presented to the House on Second Stage, with interested parties, has listened to their representations and is trying to meet them. Would he consider our giving him the Committee Stage of the Bill to-day on <Col N="438" /> the understanding he would recommit on Report Stage with his amendments?</P>
