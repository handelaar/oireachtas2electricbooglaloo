    <Title>Supplementary and Additional Estimates, 1962-63.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil, according to order, went into Committee on Finance to consider Supplementary and Additional Estimates for the year ending 31st March, 1963.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £8,500 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Houses of the Oireachtas, including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>  There are two reasons why this Supplementary Estimate is necessary.  The first is that travelling expenses were higher than anticipated because there were more meetings of the Dáil during the year, and apart from that, expenses were higher than was estimated. The second is that the new provision in relation to overnight allowances will take some of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point in relation to the facilities for Deputies and Senators who come here by car.  Let me say, first of all, that the position in the city of Dublin generally for the parking of cars is, to say the least of it, most unsatisfactory.  It is quite clear that those who will be erecting new buildings in the future will have imposed on them, of necessity, under the town planning or some similar code, a requirement that they provide proper car parking facilities for the personnel of the new office buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As legislators, it is our duty to show a good example in that respect.  It was, to say the least of it, unfortunate that <Col N="1259" /> the plans of the new building going up at the back of this building, did not provide for proper car-parking facilities.  I must say that the blame for that does not rest merely with the Government who produced the plans for it, but rests also on those of us who saw the plans because they constituted a House matter and did not draw attention to the matter then.  We have a duty to ensure that we show a good example in this respect and therefore we should have so provided.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, and be the difficulties as they may outside in the city of Dublin in respect of car-parking facilities, it is without question quite incontrovertible that the car-parking facilities in the forecourt of Leinster House are chaotic.  If a Deputy or Senator happens to come in early and during the course of the day wants to go to one of the far away Government Departments in connection with his business, say, to the Custom House to the Department of Local Government or the Department of Health, to Marlborough Street, to the Department of Education or to Parkgate Street to the Department of Defence, it is impossible for him to get his car out without first manhandling two or three cars which came in later.  That means that those Deputies whose cars are in the front rows must leave their cars unlocked, of necessity, because if they lock them, they will prevent the people who are in the inside rows from getting out.  That is quite unsatisfactory because very often Deputies have private and confidential papers in their cars and they prefer to keep them locked.</P>
    <P>The situation has got much worse lately and on days when the Seanad is sitting as well as this House, anyone can go out and see for himself the chaos that exists.  I want to make it quite clear that I am not suggesting in any way that we should have facilities which are not available to other people outside but, while there is a duty on us to see that we do not get unnecessary and undesirable luxuries for ourselves, there is equally a duty on us to see that we have <Col N="1260" /> facilities whereby we can carry on the duties for which we were sent here. That is not at present the case.  I think the forecourt of this building could be better utilised by having some kind of underground park which would help to keep Deputies' cars out of Kildare Street.  A subterranean car park of some sort in the forecourt would help to preserve the dignity and beauty of the facade of Leinster House and, at the same time, provide the facilities which we need so badly.</P>
    <P>All of us will agree that we should do everything in our power to preserve the facade of the forecourt which is one of the most beautiful vistas in Dublin.  Equally it would be unthinkable that the back lawn of Leinster House would be in any way impaired by having cars cluttered up all over it.  However, there will have to be some method discovered which will take members' cars off the streets and enable members who come in early to go out again and carry on their business with Government Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has said, it is not possible now to make any change in the plans as far as the buildings are concerned.  It would have been difficult to do anything even in the beginning but, as Deputies are aware, the new building is going up now and no changes could be made in the plans.  I agree that the existing facilities could be improved upon and I will ask the Board of Works to get expert advice on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £16,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses <Col N="1261" /> of the Office of the Attorney General, etc., and for the Expenses of Criminal Prosecutions and other Law Charges, including a Grant in Relief of certain Expenses payable by Statute out of Local Rates.</P>
    <P>  This arises under two heads.  One is subhead B which deals with witnesses' expenses and the second is under subhead D which deals with general law charges.  General law charges cover any expenditure provided by the State in payment of expenses.  In regard to these two subheads, the Estimate was under-estimated and it is necessary to provide this additional sum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give me two pieces of information?  Is there anything in either subhead dealing with the Singer case and Shanahan stamps and, secondly, how much in each of these subheads arises in respect of witnesses' expenses and general law charges in cases in which the State, because it lost the case, was ordered to pay the costs of the other side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was estimated as regards the Singer case that about £8,000 would fall for payment in this financial year.  In the event, that amount turned out to be roughly £12,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has misunderstood me.  What I wanted to know is how much of these items is in respect of cases which the State has already lost and in which it was directed by the court to pay costs. There would be two different charges coming into the question.  One would be the cost of paying the State's legal advisers and the other would be where an application by the Attorney General <Col N="1262" /> was dismissed with costs and he was directed to pay the costs of the winning side.  The Attorney General does not pay them himself.  They are paid out of this Vote and I want to know how much we had to pay in cases where the court ordered the State to pay the costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £41,800 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Stationery Office; for Printing and Binding, and the provision of Stationery, Paper, Books, Office Machinery and other Office Supplies for the Public Services; and for Sundry Miscellaneous purposes; including the publication and sale of Reports of Oireachtas Debates, Bills, Acts and other Government Publications.</P>
      <P>In this case the expenditure has been substantially higher than was expected at the beginning of the year.  It must be remembered that the gross Vote was £732,000 and that something over £40,000, taken as a percentage of that, is not abnormally high.  There are two or three matters I could mention which were unforeseen.  The Committee on Industrial Organisation turned out to be very much more expensive than was anticipated.  The Joint Committee on Electoral Law was the second matter that incurred unforeseen expenditure and thirdly, a very large publication dealing with customs and excise tariffs was put on sale during the year.  Apart from those, there were small items here and there and there was, for instance, a much bigger run than usual on maps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electoral Law Reform Committee was in existence and the report was available when these Estimates were framed and, in fact, there is nothing whatever that should not have been estimated under the Electoral Law Report.  There is, however, a perfectly good answer in respect of committees to which the Minister has not adverted.  Most voluminous submissions were provided for the Health Committee of the House now sitting and required an enormous amount of printing that could not possibly have been foreseen when the Estimates were being prepared. I think the Minister must have got his committees slightly mixed at some stage in their progress to the brief.</P>
      <P>However, I want to repeat observations I made on the Supplementary Estimate about six weeks ago in relation to certain printings which are now improved but which still require further improvement.  Verbatim minutes of Committees of the House should be available to members of the various Committees more speedily.  There has been a very considerable improvement&mdash;let me put it on record&mdash;since I raised this matter here in relation to the Health Committee a month or six weeks ago but there is still room for further improvement. The delay, perhaps, may arise because of the manner in which contracts are placed by the Stationery Office and because there is no provision in those contracts to ensure that verbatim reports of Committees of the House get appropriate priority. It is a matter of inserting the appropriate clause in the contract and making the necessary financial arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in relation to the Houses of the Oireachtas Estimate, business of this type must be done in such a way that members of the House can do properly the job for which they were sent here by their constituents. The situation also about which we had a discussion earlier in regard to the printing and binding of volumes <Col N="1265" /> of debates of the Houses themselves is a matter that requires continuous pressure.  I think when we discussed this on the token Estimate, the Minister for Finance suggested that my strictures should have been directed not at him but at you, Sir. Whether that be so or not, I shall leave it between the two of you.  My only anxiety is to ensure that in general the volumes are available at an early date, particularly because of the index that is included in them.  It is not much trouble for any of us to deal with the unrevised reports themselves but it makes the business of the House much more difficult if the index is not available at an early date and necessarily that index is available only in the bound volumes.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest to you, Sir, that you, as Ceann Comhairle and head of the administrative section in the House should direct your attention to that matter and also direct the attention of the Minister for Finance to the necessity for expeditious printing of these things in the hope that the shuffling&mdash;I do not use the word in any obnoxious sense&mdash;of responsibility between the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister may be ended in such a way that we will get what we want at a proper, early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I should like to ask the Minister when are we going to have the general index of the proceedings of this House?  The last one published was in 1954 and it includes the period between 1948 and 1954.  This is 1963 and I feel it is overdue to have the subsequent index available.  It is essential to any Deputy if he is to keep in touch with past statements made in the House and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who is responsible for the distribution of the various publications provided for under this Vote and possibly I should have raised this on the first Estimate we discussed here this morning, Houses of the Oireachtas, but I have a strong complaint to repeat, that is, that many of these important publications are not in the hands of Deputies until 12, 24 and sometimes 36 or 48 hours after <Col N="1266" /> their contents have been made known to the public by Press, radio and television. I do not object to these things being publicised through those media but there should be an effort, whether by the Ceann Comhairle or the Minister for Finance, to ensure that, as far as possible, important publications will be in the hands of Deputies simultaneously with the general publication of such documents.  I can give two recent examples: the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> was made generally public through the Press, radio and television on Saturday morning.  Some of our Deputies did not receive this publication until Monday afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a great gap in transmission, therefore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There certainly was. Similarly, the details of the Book of Estimates were published on a certain date&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Saturday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On Saturday morning, through the Press, radio and television but that Book was not in the hands of some Deputies until Monday.  I appreciate the difficulties there are in respect of Deputies who may live 250 or 300 miles from Dublin but I do not think sufficient effort is made to ensure that these important publications will be in the hands of Deputies at least simultaneously with their publication generally.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to complain when we have reached a situation where members of the public, who get up early in the morning and happen to listen to the 8 o'clock news programme from Radio Éireann, are able to tell Deputies what is in certain of these publications and the new proposals on legislation.  Deputies themselves do not know anything about the details until they get their post 12 hours later&mdash;24 hours or 36 hours later, in some cases. I say that with reserve.  I do not know whether it is the fault of the Minister for Finance in this particular section, the Stationery Office or some other State Department.  Again, there should be some effort to ensure that Deputies and Senators will have these important Government publications at the very earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that the Ceann Comhairle is not responsible for some of the complaints made here.  The only thing I can say is that the Ceann Comhairle is responsible for the indexing, but when the volume is indexed, the Stationery Office are responsible for printing, circulation and so on.  I have to take responsibility for the printing and for the time taken in printing&mdash;to get it out as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards the point made by Deputy Corish, which is an important point, it is a matter I shall inquire into again to see if something better can be done in that direction.  I am sure Deputies are aware&mdash;those who have been in Government are certainly aware&mdash;that there is the anxiety that if the publications are not received by the Press in time, we cannot expect an intelligent comment.  I may be wrong, but so far as I know, it is posted to the Deputies before the Press get it.  That may not be in time, I admit, to reach many Deputies in the morning post.  The only thing I can do is to find out if putting it in the post a few hours earlier would make a difference.</P>

      <P>Deputies are probably aware that the Contingency Fund is used to deal with some payments that may come during the year, in the first place, where the payment may be unforeseen or in the second place, where there is no heading under which it could be put.  In this particular case, it was not unforeseen.  It was in connection with the Presidential election. There was no heading under which it could be put and it was put into the Contingency Fund.  At the end of the financial year, the Contingency Fund is replenished and this is to pay back the £114 which the Contingency Fund paid out during the year.</P>

      <P>I sat throughout this debate&mdash;at least when the leaders of the Parties spoke&mdash;because usually the backbenchers follow the line of the leaders.  I admit that, from time to time, you will get a new line from the backbenchers.  They are not all just as &ldquo;back&rdquo; as that, but, on the whole, they take the line of their leaders. Nevertheless some of them act like the proverbial hatchetman of the Party to whom Hitler on one occasion referred. They try to get a little bit dirty. I listened carefully to the Party leaders.  Last night I listened to Deputy McGilligan.  He is a brilliant lawyer. In fact, there are a great many lawyers in this House&mdash;perhaps 30 or 40.  It would appear to me that the majority of those men are brilliant men, honest men, as individuals, which is something different from politicians.  They are a sort of Jeykll and Hyde.  They are as honest as the sun.  As politicians, they do not care how a bounty is earned. They take the view that it is a Party game.  I made some remarks about the Party game.  The last time I spoke I was insulted.  Nevertheless, everything <Col N="1270" /> I said was true.  I do not think I got personal.  When I made references to the Opposition, I was not referring to the present Opposition: I was referring to Oppositions.</P>
      <P>However, getting back to Deputy McGilligan, he took the view that this was going to increase the cost of living. He pleaded, as a good counsel will in court.</P>
      <P>We all know what counsel does in court.  His object is to make his client, even though that person may be a rougue, the fairhaired boy.  His job is to make his opponent the biggest blackguard thinkable, even though that person might be an angel.  His job is to discredit the witness.  That is his training.  They seem to take the same line in here.  The public outside are confused, just as a brilliant counsel would confuse a jury, were it not for the fact that there is a learned judge there to point out what is material and what is not.  That is not the job of the Ceann Comhairle.  Both sides can bluff all they like.  His job is to see to it that they do not box.  There is no one to tell the public what is true and what is false.  I try to do that in my own little way.  If I differ from others, it is because I came in here as an Independent.  My whole upbringing was that of an Independent.  I could have been in Parties long ago, but I chose the role of Independent because I had a little experience of Parties and I do not like Party politics.  I do not like wrangling.  I am not trying to be a holy Joe; I am just saying what I think is correct.  I try to inform the people.  I try to do what the learned judge does in court.  I hope to help them in that way.</P>

      <P>It is a game in this House.  That was proved by the fact that when he was speaking Deputy Corish said he hoped we would approach this matter by leaving Party politics out of it.  He said it would be a pity we could not deal with such matters as debates on the Adjournment without Party politics.  Surely he was hinting at something he was forced to be a party to which he was ashamed of?  Even the Minister for Transport and Power said it was a pity we could not get together and discuss problems privately.  He said we could discuss costs and honestly find out whether a thing was possible or not.  In a nutshell, what he was saying was: &ldquo;It is a pity you do not do things in a constructive way here instead of making outrageous statements and promises to the public which are impossible in practice.&rdquo;  There have been hints thrown out to drop the Party game, and I am preparing the ground.</P>
      <P>Most of the attacks on the Vote on Account were not constructive, but were playing the Party game.  On the last debate, we had Deputy J. A. Costello, the former Taoiseach, denouncing the previous Government for making things difficult for him when they were in Opposition.  He brought the Party game to the notice of the House.  All the contributions made here were made with an eye not so much on the Vote on Account but on the next election or the by-election in Dublin North-East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said the new sales tax would increase the cost of living. We are told the new sales tax is required to get the money to take the place of what we will lose by dropping tariffs.  If we are going to lower tariffs, will goods not come in cheaper?  Even if the sales tax means that luxury goods are to cost more, will those goods not come in cheaper because tariffs are <Col N="1272" /> being lowered?  Deputy McGilligan did not mention that.  He mentioned only the rotten part, but did not mention the rosy part at all.  That is the game. Attempts have been made to make the game work in a better way, but they have failed, and the cause of the failure is this threat of an election.  If there were an election only once in five years and no by-elections and if the seat becoming vacant were given to the Party of the occupant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting my finger on the sore point.  If there were no immediate threat of an election, men would forget trying to arouse passions and would be constructive for four years out of five.  In the United States, the executive power is the President. He is elected once in four years. He does not resign because some Bill is defeated.  Everybody loves and helps him for at least three years out of the four, and he is then subject to the usual attacks for the last year.  If we had that system here, we would have less of the Teddyboyism, which takes place here from time to time.  If it were not for the Ceann Comhairle, Standing Orders and the Guards, that is what we would have here.  It is no use saying we are decorous.  We are only decorous because we have to be. Deputy Costello's complaint was that the Opposition of that time hounded him when he was in difficulties.  That is <Col N="1273" /> my point.  That is the role of the Opposition&mdash;to mislead, to misrepresent and make things difficult for the Government, in case an election might break out.</P>
      <P>I have a lot to say about housing. People spoke about housing who knew nothing about it.  The fact that a person is a member of a city council does not mean he knows anything about housing.  He could be a member of the council and not a member of the housing committee, and he could be a member of the housing committee and not attend the meetings.</P>
      <P>We have 18 on our Housing Committee and there are never more than six, seven or eight present.  So it is no argument to say that a man is a member of the corporation or a member of the housing committee.  I am telling you here and now that there are only two or three people here who know what they are talking about when they talk about Dublin housing and I am one of them.  I would say that Deputy Barron and Deputy Timmons are others and that is about all.  We attend the Housing Committee day in day out. We never miss out.  I have not missed four meetings in eight years.  I have everything at the tips of my fingers, apart from taking an interest in it and making a study of it.  You all know the vice-chairman has to take pains to find out all the day-to-day facts.  The ordinary member strolls in without looking at the agenda and there may be a big number as the meeting proceeds. But the vice-chairman cannot do everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to the Opposition here debating housing and when those questions were discussed by Deputy Declan Costello.  The most startling facts were statements made by the Opposition.  Deputy Ryan is a smart young fellow and a friend of mine who should know better.  But of course he is a solicitor.  He must win.  That is my point.  It was said that in 1959 a very small number of houses were built.  In an interjection, he reduced that number by one-third.  Why, why, why?  If the official statement&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;said there were 270 odd houses built in 1959, why should he reduce that number to 200?  Why did <Col N="1274" /> he not leave it at 270, or whatever it was?  Again, when the official answer was given that there were 9,000 people with their names on the waiting, he said 9,500 were on the waiting list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>That was bilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>You see my point&mdash; that words do not seem to mean anything. They are bandied around here &mdash;shots in the dark.</P>
      <P>There is another statement he makes. Imagine, he says, 9,000 people with over four in a room.  That was the most false statement made in this House yet.  He ought to know better because although he is not on the Housing Committee, he could easily find out.  The truth of the present housing position is that there are 9,000 on the waiting list and, for your information, there are a lot of people from the country, who have just come up.  Once you come up, you write in and get an application form, fill it in and you are on the waiting list.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they have just come up.  The bye-laws set out that you must be four years resident before you can be considered for housing. But the names of those fellows who had just come up are there and they were mentioned as part of the 9,000, and even as families of over four. When you put that sort of thing over here, can you blame me if I am cynical and if I try to spill the beans to the public?  The truth is that there are only about 4,500 on the list who are considered by the local authority as requiring houses.  The rest is a fictitious number.  If the City Manager were a politician, he would not have given that number but being an honest man, he gave every application for a dwelling. He even gave the names of people who had three rooms.  It does not matter what you are if you apply; if you own a mansion, it does not matter if you apply.  They will be included in an answer to a query on how many people there are on the waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is there are little more <Col N="1275" /> than 1,000 people of four and five. That is all there are on the housing list.  Just imagine a statement that there are 9,000, with four.  The truth is there are only a little over 1,000.  Of those 4,500, there are 1,100 families of one and two.  How does that compare with the statements made here&mdash; reckless statements, all made so that the people outside will think this is a terrible Government?  I think there is no truth in it.  I will make the case that it was a mistake for the Opposition to make any reference to housing at all.  It would have been better for themselves if they never opened their mouths about houses because they were speaking in total ignorance&mdash;even the former Minister for Local Government. He had a good knowledge of housing then, but he knows nothing about houses now.  He might dig up an answer by reference to books and getting data.  But that is no use.  You cannot get the feeling of the thing from books; you can only get the feeling of the thing from living with it.</P>
    <P>I have the official number&mdash;it is 4,401.  It might vary.  Amongst that number there are actually 1,100 families of one or two persons.  There are only a little more than 1,000 families of four or five persons.  That puts an entirely different complexion on the position.  Of those 4,500, there are 750 families returned from England.  Do not forget that in the past two years we housed approximately 750 families from England.  More than 1,500 families came back&mdash;and we had to house them.  The 750 we housed naturally had to get priority on the list because of the size of their families. We could not leave a wife and a gang of children out on the street.  If you take those from the 4,500, it leaves only 3,000.  That would be the true housing position, if it were not for the fact that people came back from Britain, not through any fault of anyone here.  We did not expect these people to come back, and we could not plan for something we did not know about.  You might say that the local authorities along the seaboard in France should be blackballed by the <Col N="1276" /> French Opposition because they had not houses ready for the Algerian refugees.  How could the local authorities know that de Gaulle would throw up the sponge and pull out of Algeria? How could they know that these refugees would descend on their areas? If suddenly a million people come back, would it be fair to say: &ldquo;You never built houses; look at the housing list.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not the truth.  Up to 1960, they were running away.  The housing problem was practically solved in 1960.  I can prove it.  Then suddenly the British brought in a measure&mdash;the Rent Restrictions Act.  At one time in England if one were being overcharged, one could go to a local court and get the rent reduced to 30/-.  In 1960, the Rent Restrictions Act was amended and landlords were given power to charge what they liked.  That has a lot to do with people deciding to come here and preventing those at home from going away.  They started to charge £3 and £4 per room and that is what is being charged at the moment.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, in and around 1960, there was a lack of overtime. The unions decided against overtime. All those were earning up to £20 a week&mdash;double time for overtime, treble time for Sunday and they were making £20 a week and so everything was rosy in England.  Rent was 30/- and income £20 a week.  The fact that all this ended up around 1960 was something we did not know.  How could the Housing Committee know? Gradually the housing vacancies began to reverse.  Since we found there was a changing approach, we started to plan again.  But again we hear this cry: &ldquo;You only built this number this year.&rdquo;  It takes two years from the planning stage to produce a house.  It takes three or four years from the planning stage to produce a flat and there is a wait of two or three years.</P>
    <P>The Opposition made a political issue out of this and I am going to see that it boomerangs on them, although I have no desire to do it.  I might be supporting the Government, because there is need for the Government, and <Col N="1277" /> I make no apology for it, but I have no intention of taking sides in a general way on politics.  I have been a member of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee since 1955 and as vice-chairman I was attacked, although the main attack was on the Minister for Local Government who had nothing to do with it at all.  The Minister for Local Government at no time refused a penny to Dublin Corporation nor did he at any time hold up sanction except for the usual short periods.  Whatever guilt may attach to me, he is the innocent party. This business of trying to make political capital out of this situation has no foundation at all.  Evidence would want to be produced to show that we asked for money and that the Minister refused to give it, or delayed giving it.</P>
    <P>We asked him only for what we wanted.  The City Manager and his officials are the executive authority and they administer the estate.  The committees, such as the Housing Committee, are the policy makers.  It is the Housing Committee which decides: &ldquo;We will build flats, or we will build houses; we will build so many flats or so many houses, or we will not build them.&rdquo;  If any brickbats are to be thrown, they cannot be thrown at the Minister for Local Government.  We decided in 1959 that we would not build any more houses on the perimeter&mdash;and that is the only place we had land&mdash;that there was no demand for houses, that the people would not go out to them and that instead, they were coming in.  It would have been unfair to the ratepayers.  The houses were being wrecked by children playing cowboys and Indians in them and lighting fires.  Under those circumstances, what sane person would decide to go on with the housing programme on the perimeter of the city?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was guilty of one big evasion.  He said that 270 houses were built in 1959 but he did not refer to the 1,600 vacant houses, which meant that there were really 2,000 dwellings which nobody was taking. It would condemn the whole Opposition if that evasion were dragged out in court.  The fact that there were <Col N="1278" /> 1,600 houses vacant actually put the corporation in a position which was almost as good as they had been in in 1950 when there were 20,000 people in urgent need of dwellings.  I can give you the details from all the official corporation minutes which I have here. There were 800 applications for transfers back into the city from Ballyfermot and Finglas in 1959 and 1960. There were 1,500 refusals to go out. There were 1,500 houses lying idle for months where one after the other people said: &ldquo;No; we want a nice flat in the city, around the corner from where we live at present.&rdquo;  That is the truth and the figures are there.  As I said, children were breaking windows and the ratepayers were being billed for windows, frames and doors which had been smashed and the ratepayers were in a panic.  Yet Deputy Dillon comes in and says that only 270 houses were built in 1959.  Although in 1959-60 there were 3,000 on the waiting list for houses, half of that number had been offered houses and would not take them.  Deputy Dillon read out only one side of the picture without referring to the other.</P>
    <P>In 1951, there were 2,588 houses built and the vacancy rate was only 194, which was nothing.  Now we come to 1960-61 when 279 dwellings were handed over.  There were 1,260 vacant dwellings, making an actual housing contribution for those on the waiting list of 1,539.  That was as recently as two years ago.  In 1959-60, there were only 505 dwellings handed over but there were 1,605 empty dwellings.  We actually had 2,110 dwellings to hand over to those who wanted dwellings.  How can the Opposition make a case there?</P>
    <P>Members here are ignorant of the position in Dublin and likewise the people outside are ignorant but the members here are in a position to elicit the necessary information.  How can the people outside judge a statement, which may be bandied around at the next bye-election, that no houses were being built, that only 500 were provided, when actually the truth is that there were 2,110 available in 1959-60 as against a total in 1951-52 of 2,239, almost as many <Col N="1279" /> dwellings provided when there were 20,000 on the waiting list, and they were bad cases.</P>
    <P>Do I require to proceed any further?  I will.  As they say in court, when one side introduces a certain line of argument the other side is entitled to rebut it and I will certainly do that.  Considerable play was made with the fact that in the first two years of the regime of this Government housing dropped; that in 1958-59 the present Government built only 460 dwellings.  But it had nothing to do with the Government. Do not forget that if there were only 460 houses built, there were 1,393 vacancies.  If only 460 houses were built in 1958-59, who was responsible? Who planned two years in advance?  If only that number was built in that year, that was because in 1956 there had been no commonsense planning.</P>
    <P>When a decision is made to build houses, there is, first of all, what is called a rough sketch plan, and to that the committee agrees in principle. That plan goes back and, after a month or two, we get a working plan with all the details.  We examine that.  We may alter it.  If we alter it, it has to go back again for perhaps a fortnight, after which it is sent to us once more. If we agree to the working plan, it must then go to Local Government. They, of course, have hundreds of applications, and there are such things as priorities.  It may take a fortnight, or a month, or two, before it comes back from Local Government.</P>
    <P>Then we have to prepare bills of quantities&mdash;100 houses to be built, so many rooms, walls of such and such a thickness, so much wood, so much glass, etc.  These are advertised and the contractors tender.  Time is passing. When we eventually decide which is the best offer, we must once more send it to Local Government because they must approve the expenditure.  It comes back and we must bond the contractor; we must make sure that he has money and that he is not like some of the fellows in 1956 who went bankrupt and left houses half finished.  All that takes a year.  By the time the <Col N="1280" /> builder gets on the site, 14 months may have elapsed.  That cannot be avoided. The important point is that it takes about two years from the time the actual decision is taken to the time the house is handed over.</P>
    <P>If there were only 460 houses built in 1958-59, it must be remembered that Fianna Fáil came into power only in March or April of 1957.  No one could expect them to get cracking immediately.  They are responsible only for the last three or four months of 1957.  The song and dance here is about the few houses built.  There were few because there was no planning in 1956 and, because of that, there was a big drop.  There was a big drop in the previous years, too.  I have evidence here that, between 1956 and 1957, 1,100 workers were sacked; about 1,000 houses were not built and all these workers went to England.  Later, when we tried to get going again, there were no workers available.</P>
    <P>I have here the minutes of the Municipal Council of the city of Dublin, 1957.  Now if I were to give the names of the Fianna Fáil people on the Council, there would be cries of &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I will give the Coalition names.  No one can call them liars. Councillor Denis Larkin, T. D., Chairman of the Housing Committee, and a supporter of the Coalition Government: a good man on housing, he asked how many dwellings as distinct from cottages, flats and reconditioned houses were under construction in July in each of the years 1948 to 1957 inclusive.  I shall deal with the last two years because they are the vital years.</P>

My point is that there was a crisis in 1956 which resulted in no houses being built in 1957 and 1958; that, in turn, resulted in 1,100 workers going to England.  That is the vital period.  If the Deputy built 1,000 houses ten years ago, well and good.  I am not concerned with that.  I am concerned with the cause of the drop in building in 1958 and 1959.  That is what <Col N="1281" /> the Opposition have been hammering at.</P>

      <P>I am concerned with 1957.  The reference is page 151 so that the Deputy can look it up for himself.  The total number of cottages and flats built, or houses reconditioned, in 1956 was 2,423.  The Coalition must accept responsibility for the position in July, 1957, because Fianna Fáil had only just returned to office: there were 968 houses built.  There was a drop from 2,423.  In 1956, the number employed on corporation housing was 1,857; in July, 1957, it was 925.  Housing collapsed.  The collapse started in 1956.  I have proved that.  I looked up the <i>Irish Independent</i> for the last three months of the relevant period.  I am not saying the <i>Irish Independent</i> is a Party paper, but it has leanings.</P>

      <P>It has leanings.  I make the point&mdash;it is an important one&mdash;that I am not quoting from the <i>Irish Press</i>.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 6th October, 1956, General Mulcahy, then Minister for Education, referred to the building of schools; he said there was a strained economy and &ldquo;that is responsible for the slowing down of building&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Councillor Larkin&mdash;<i>Irish Independent</i> of December 4th, 1956 &mdash; said that delay in sanctions meant that the corporation could not complete its target.  Councillor Larkin was Chairman of the Housing Committee.</P>
      <P>There is another important reference &mdash;<i>Irish Independent</i> of 20th October 1956.  There was a mass meeting in the Mansion House under the auspices of the Dublin Trades Council and a resolution was passed: &ldquo;An end to indiscriminate cuts in Government expenditure.  Restitution of credit for socially progressive projects and Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act Building.&rdquo; Placards were carried: &ldquo;16,000 families living in slums&rdquo; and &ldquo;Building workers idle&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> Here is a gem.  This is the Dublin County Council.  On December 22nd 1956 Senator Carton, Fine Gael Chairman of the Housing Committee, described the position of housing as ghastly.  The manager said that there was no delay by the council, there was a crisis in regard to loans and delay in sanction.  Senator Carton accepted the manager's explanation.</P>

      <P>This is what Mr. Denis Larkin, then Lord Mayor, had to say on 21st February, 1956, in the Report to Council:</P>
      <P>While there would be a time lag in the expectation of money, the corporation could not be expected to enter into contracts binding themselves without an assurance that the money would be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>  We had been promised money.  We had a deputation to the Minister for Local <Col N="1283" /> Government, then Deputy P. O'Donnell. I was on the deputation.  I was a witness to all this.  I am not the type of fellow who comes in here once in a blue moon and takes a shot in the dark.  I am a witness from day to day. Not every man can say that.  I think I have the best attendance record for all corporation meetings.  I would get a medal for my attendance at corporation meetings&mdash;and I am there for the beginning of the meetings.  Mr. Denis Larkin said:</P>
    <P>While there would be a time lag in the expectation of money&mdash;</P>
    <P>  We had been told we would get money but we were not getting it because there was a credit squeeze.  Eventually, we got money from the Local Loans Fund but in 1956 we were hamstrung. Mr. Denis Larkin said that the corporation could not be expected to enter into contracts with builders in the expectation of the money without an assurance that the money would be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I looked through the <i>Irish Independent</i> for a period of three months only. I could have looked at the other papers.  I could bring in a million quotations.  I did not go through the Dáil Reports because notes from the Dáil Reports are all cod.  There is no truth in them in the sense that the case made in the case the person wants to make; when he comes in here, he skips the bad things and takes the good things.</P>
    <P>I am not reading up this case at all. I was one of those who went to the Minister for Local Government in 1956.  We were told we would get the money but, as Councillor Denis Larkin, the then Lord Mayor, said, we would want a guarantee.  Anyway, 1956 was a notorious year for the building trade and, as has been proved, as a result of 1956, there was no planning in 1956 or at the beginning of 1957: there was delay in planning.  As a result, 1,100 workers lost their jobs and went to England just about then.</P>
    <P>It is significant that, just about then, things began to get good in England. There were a few years there and things were rosy.  The boys were making <Col N="1284" /> plenty of money and they started to move out.  I want to be fair to the Opposition.  Actually, we did not really require a lot more dwellings at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>If we did not require them, it was not due to any foresight on their part: we could have needed them.  Actually, the crowd began to leave the corporation houses in droves. We were housing families of three in those years: that is a small family. We even housed families of two in many cases.  Surely if any family of three could get a house without any trouble, it indicates that houses were available.  However, those are the years 1958, 1959 and 1960.  That is my point.</P>
      <P>Why do you come along and try to make political capital out of something when there is no truth in the assertion that the Minister for Local Government or the Government were at fault here?  They may have been responsible for many things but why do you say they were responsible for any drop in housing?  Who have they as witnesses?</P>

      <P>There would be no point in your argument, otherwise. You are appealing to the people outside, now, who want a house.  There would be no sense in your argument if that were not your case.  Everything said here is not for the enlightenment of the fellows on the other side. We are all wise to one another.  Do not worry about that.  What is said here is for the benefit of the people outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case was put that this little crisis was due to the fact that we did <Col N="1285" /> not build dwellings.  The truth is that there was no need for any extended building of dwellings until 18 months or two years ago.  That is all.  Then we got cracking immediately and we saw a slight change.  There was not much of a change&mdash;a change of half a dozen&mdash;and we said: &ldquo;We will go off again.&rdquo;  This year, there has been an increase of 100 per cent.  Eight hundred dwellings are being provided this year.  Only a couple of hundred were provided last year.  That was a vast improvement when you remember that we had to gear ourselves up again.</P>
    <P>You cannot start from nothing.  You cannot gear up in a month.  It took Hitler seven years to have a go at France.  You cannot suddenly say: &ldquo;We will build houses&rdquo;&mdash;and up they go like mushrooms.  We had not the workers&mdash;they were all away.  There was difficulty about carpenters, bricklayers, and so on.  But we had to gear ourselves.  We built 800 dwellings in the past year as against a couple of hundred in the previous year.  I think there was a cement strike last year. That knocked us out of two months' building.</P>
    <P>Do not forget that we have had two months of snow and that, in that weather, you cannot work on housing. You cannot ignore it.  You cannot, on one hand, come in here and do a song and dance about the poor people being snowed up and say the Government are responsible and then ignore that bad weather when it comes to an assessment of the housing position. We lost at least 100 houses in the three months of this terribly bad weather.  I know all about it.  People were coming to me about differential rents and I know they were working only two days in the week, and so on.</P>
    <P>We reversed the position of last year and, in spite of the fact that 750 more came back from Britain, in the oncoming year we shall have a thousand.  The Minister expects that there will be about 100 under construction for next year.  He is wrong. There will be a thousand.  This statement is made by the City Manager&mdash; not by a politician.  It is an informed and an honest statement.  At the <Col N="1286" /> moment, 800 houses are under construction but inside the next couple of weeks, we shall have entered into contracts.  It is only a matter of this week or next week when the other 200 or 300 will be in operation. Therefore, if you put forward the date by a fortnight or three weeks, a thousand houses will be under construction. That is the answer I got yesterday from the Principal Officer of Housing&mdash;and he proved it to me, although nobody has to prove it to me as I know it myself.</P>
    <P>Here is a little gem&mdash;an item on page 19 of the 1957 Report of the Dublin Corporation municipal minutes &mdash;a motion moved by Councillor J. Barron, one of our Deputies here.  The only two men who know anything about housing in this House are Deputy Barron and Deputy Timmons.  This motion was: &ldquo;That the Council are of opinion that no further building by the Corporation on the perimeter sites of the city be carried out and that we should concentrate on building flats in the city.&rdquo;  That motion was referred to the Housing Committee and we adopted it in a few months.  There are some wise guys who talk about the bad job the Government did on housing, but where were they in 1959 and 1960?  They did not make any public statements as to the likelihood of 1,500 people coming back.  They are wise after the event and their talk is just politics.</P>
    <P>Before I finish with the subject of housing, I should like to read a statement by the City Manager in 1962. He said:</P>
    <P>In 1960-61 the previously increasing vacancy rate started to reverse itself&mdash;&mdash;but only in 1960-61: do not forget that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;but still these vacancies provided 1,260 dwellings.</P>
    <P>  That is the key to the whole situation. You do not buy a loaf of bread if you have the press full.  He went on:</P>
    <P>In 1961/62 the figure had further fallen to 856 dwellings, and in the <Col N="1287" /> current year it is estimated that no more than about 700 will become available.  Immediately that tendency became pronounced steps were taken again to develop the momentum of increased housing production.  For the reasons indicated above, however, this necessarily entails a time lag before its results are available.  During 1960/61 only 277 new dwellings were completed. This was somewhat increased last year to 391, and in the current year it is estimated that it will have increased to 698&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;or approximately 700.  The statement continues:</P>
    <P>There are at present 1,035 dwellings in course of construction by the Corporation's contractors.  Summarising the housing operations from 1948/1949 to date, 18,198 new dwellings have been built under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and 8,758 financed by way of loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.</P>
    <P>  I may mention the fact that they took a census to access the needs in 1948/49 and they said we needed 20,000 dwelllings to end the housing problem in Dublin.  Instead of providing 35,000 houses, we actually provided 37,000.</P>
    <P>  The statement goes on:</P>
    <P>A further 10,465 families have now got new tenancies as a result of the net vacancies to which I have referred, making a total of 37,421 families re-housed in that period. In addition 4,793 grants have been made to private householders, supplementing State Grants to enable these people to put their houses in a better state of repair.  During that period the Corporation's capital expenditure under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts amounted to £32,504,900 and under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts to £13,203,794&mdash;total £45,708,694.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these vast housing operations, however, pressure for new housing started to build up again about 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>  That is vital because, as I said, it takes two years to produce a house.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> As I have already indicated, this was essentially due to the substantial drop in net vacancies and in the number of new houses becoming available.  Moreover, during this time a number of families returned from England, and even though many of them had surrendered Corporation houses, they sought immediate priority over persons who had been on the waiting list for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>  When families with more than one child are given priority on the waiting list people start growling.  That is human nature.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>In assessing the present housing deficiency no useful purpose is served by emphasising the fact that the applications list totals over 9,000.  A majority of these applicants are persons whom the City Medical Officer does not consider to be in immediate need of housing and many of whom, either because of their short residence in the city or for some other reason, would not be housed by the Corporation anyway. When I referred above to the housing requirement as estimated in 1948, the deficiency of 20,000 represented families and persons whom the Corporation accepted as being urgently in need of re-housing.</P>
    <P>  Later on, we decided to invite anyone to apply so actually this figure of 9,000 is fictitious.  It should be 4,500.</P>
    <P>The case I am making is that the Housing Committee have done tremendous work.  They work as hard as members of this House and the active members of the Housing Committee deserve to be paid as much as members of this House but they do not get a stamp.  We can attend to our business because of the fact that some councillors attend regularly.  Most of the councillors do not attend at all and they cannot know anything about this problem.  When they talk about it, they are just taking a shot in the dark.</P>
    <P>The main point is that at no time did the Minister for Local Government refuse money.  The Housing Committee are the policy-making body. <Col N="1289" /> They ask for their requirements and they get them.  If they did not build too many houses in 1958-59 it was due to the collapse of their finances brought about by the Coalition Government in 1956.  I have said that it takes two years to build a house but it takes three to four years to build a flat, and the lack of flats goes back to the lack of money in 1956.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies shed crocodile tears over people looking for houses, but if in 1956 or 1959 a Deputy had gone around saying he could get houses in Finglas or Ballyfermot, he would have been told: &ldquo;We do not want a house in Finglas or Ballyfermot; we want a flat.&rdquo; The present position is that we have no more land in the north city.  We have land in Raheny, which is a nice place. A tribute must be paid to Mr. Molloy of the Housing Committee who acquired land at a time when we had laid off housing.  He said: &ldquo;To be on the sure side, we had better acquire the land.&rdquo;  That land is now developed and we have land for 3,000 or 4,000 houses, enough to solve the problem for the immediate future.  We believe that a year or 18 months will clear the urgent demand, but there are always people who want houses at once.  I have people coming to me who have just got off the boat with six children and have no place to go.  These people have to be given priority.  Next year we will have 1,000 houses and the following year we expect to have the same.  After these two years, we do not expect that there will be any crisis in housing.</P>
    <P>I want to say this much, that the Fine Gael Party should forget about housing as a political argument.  It is extraordinary that the Labour Party had so little to say about it but, of course, they could not condemn their own Chairman of the Housing Committee.  I will say no more about it.  I have heard talk about the Taoiseach's reference to a cast-iron dog laughing.  I have to laugh fairly often when I hear about these things but many simple-minded people outside accept those arguments.  Deputy Dillon referred to a few houses built in 1959 but there was not a word from him about the 1,600 houses <Col N="1290" /> empty at that time.

Those who start that business are attacking Denis Larkin, the Chairman of the Dublin Housing Committee, and Senator Carton, chairman of the County Dublin Housing Committee.  If you want to attack anybody, attack the Housing Committees.  The members of the Housing Committees do not bring politics into their work.  They operate as teams.  If you are going to talk like that, you should remember that the Housing Committees of Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation are coalition bodies.  Since I became a member in 1955, they have always been coalition committees.  The Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation numbers 18 and there are only six Fianna Fáil members.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I try to.  When they come about a house, I ask them all the questions necessary and if the answers are not satisfactory, I tell them that they cannot get a house.  I am not like some of the people who say they will do their best.  It is a lie to tell a person that you will do your best when you cannot do anything.</P>
      <P>I believe the Government so far have been a good Government, and I believe the majority of the members of this House believe that.  I do not mind what they say in here because, as I said before, all politicians are Jekylls and Hydes.  When a motion was put down here in connection with the pay pause, the Labour Party did not vote for the resignation of the Government. They were having no nonsense.  They appreciated that anything connected with wages was their business but they understood that the Government were trying to preserve the <i>status quo,</i> which is not bad.</P>
      <P>The last increase in wages was due only in part to an increase in the cost of living.  It was largely an increase in the standard of living, and that was admitted by members of the Labour Party.  Now the position of those who have a job is quite good.  If we are to argue on the question of social benefits I would argue against the record of the past and not on the future.  The argument must be against the existing Government and their record of the immediate past, not the distant past. If we did that, we would be going back to the Civil War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that whether it was brought about by mismanagement or by the Suez crisis, things were bad in 1956, as everybody knows.  The Government of the time were depending on a few votes and it is one of the failings of democracy that when a <Col N="1292" /> Government are up against it, and the Coalition were up against it in 1956, there is likely to be ratting amongst some of their supporters.  The play is always against the Government.  The people who might shout now for the Government's resignation would shout three months later for Fine Gael's resignation.  The politicians know, and they are the people who are always &ldquo;lying into it,&rdquo; all those distortions of truth.</P>
    <P>If you want to compare the present Government and be just, you can compare them only with the immediately preceding Government and if we do that, we find things were pretty hopeless in 1956.  We remember the housing problem with all the housing workers idle and no credit.  Perhaps the Government at the time did not deserve the mounting of attacks by Fianna Fáil.  The then Taoiseach, I know, is quite an honest fellow.  I believe he did his best and I know he felt very bitter afterwards.  About a week ago, when I was having my little argument with Deputy Dillon&mdash;a man I greatly admire but I think he lost his head on that occasion&mdash;I said that Deputy Costello had said the same thing.  Deputy Costello said they had acted like partisans in the French Revolution misrepresenting everything.</P>
    <P>Do you blame me if I am cynical and express my contempt for the Party game?  That is my mission here and I am not trying to be a &ldquo;holy Joe&rdquo;. I came up without Party help.  In fact, Parties did their damnedest to keep me out.  However, I still believe this Government should continue for at least another year or two and should be helped.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish made a good speech. He put his Party point of view and made it clear that he was not trying to trip up the Government.  He was not trying to harm the economy because he has the workers' position in mind.  It was a fair speech for a political Party Leader.  A Party leader can be as honest as the day is long but he must do a little playing with words.  It is all in the game.  There is such a thing as white lies but barefaced lies are different.  Deputy Corish was not trying to cause a general election. <Col N="1293" /> He knows the actual position and the trouble that arose from the Common Market difficulty.  He hopes that things will go along merrily as they are.  At least I am sure he would like things to be better but that, to put it in Lincoln's words, he feels that to change horses in the middle of the stream might make things worse for the people.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for defending the Government.  I do not defend all they do, but when supporting a Government, you cannot play around with such an important function as government, even if you disagree on some minor sidelines.  That would be a cheap performance.  In the main, I think the Government have done well. At least they deserve, if not support, constructive criticism.  We know Parties have to play the game and there is a bye-election coming on.  We should give the Government credit where credit is due.  It is impossible for a Government to be always right. In my opinion, all Governments honestly try to do a good job, even though they make mistakes and even though on the way to power, they do a lot of playacting.  Once they get into office, that is suspended and they try to make the country economic and do the best possible for all the people. On the way to power, with the sort of system we have, you must bandy about untruths and distortions.  You must misrepresent the Government and give them no credit if you hope to win and get the support of the 20 or 30 per cent. of the people who never ask questions.  I shall continue to support the Government until I am satisfied that we have a state of affairs something like 1956.  Then I shall not support them, but I am not going to risk the present position which is not so bad just because it might get me a few &ldquo;hurrahs&rdquo; from a few people outside who do not understand.  I shall put up with their sneers which are not often genuine.</P>
    <P>About a year ago, some 15 letters appeared in the papers abusing me and eight saying a good word for me but of the 15 letters of abuse, 11 of them came from a political club in North Dublin that met that week and decided <Col N="1294" /> to write the letters.  I proved that and I have witnesses in this House to it.  I do not mind what the people say outside.</P>

He said that, if there was a hiatus in the building of houses, it was the Minister for <Col N="1297" /> Local Government in 1956 who was responsible for it.  In the next breath, he tells us that, if there are not new houses built in Dublin, we should not blame the Minister for Local Government but we should blame the Housing Committee.  In March, 1956, I informed Dublin Corporation that they could have £2 million for the building of houses.  At that time I received Deputies Larkin and Briscoe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I asked them to get on with their building plans, that there was £2 million available for them whenever they required it.  Nothing was done.

      <P>I do not care who was on it.  I am telling you what I told Dublin Corporation at the time. At the same time, I told them they should review the position, that I thought they were building too many houses on the perimeter and that they should concentrate on building multistorey flats in the centre of the city. The reply I got from the Housing Committee was: &ldquo;Mind your own bloody business&rdquo;&mdash;that they would decide policy.  I told them I believed the building of these houses in Ballyfermot and other places was responsible for cluttering up the city with traffic.  These people had to be transported from their homes to the city and back.  It was straining their resources to have to pay for transport. I told them I was afraid these houses would become vacant.  Deputy Sherwin now confirms what I said.  Again, for the record&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The present Minister for Agriculture was Minister for Local Government for 12 months.

What caused those houses to be sited there? Who was responsible for siting them? Was it this famous Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation?  If it was, it is a very serious matter.  What is going to be done with these houses? Are they to be left lying vacant?  If they are, they should be known as somebody's &ldquo;folly&rdquo;.  It is a disgrace.

      <P>Now I am going to take the Deputy up on another matter.  On 11th March, 1961, I asked the Minister for Local Government a very simple question. I asked him if he would state the amount of money actually spent on the building (a) of local authority houses and (b) private houses during each of the years ended 31st March, 1950 to 1960.  That was not for Dublin Corporation.  That was for houses built throughout the State, including Dublin Corporation, of course.  What was the reply I got?  The amount of money spent on the building of houses&mdash;it is well worth remembering&mdash;in the year 1949-50 was £9,557,645; in 1950-51, it was £10,417,927; in 1951-52, it was £11,468,612; in 1952-53, it was £10,607,675; in 1954-55, it was £7,619,230; in 1955-56, it was £6,993,246; and in 1956-57&mdash;the bad year&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I was saying &mdash;I hope I shall not drive Deputy Dolan out of the House as I should like him to hear this reply&mdash;on 24th November, 1962, Deputy O'Reilly was interested to know, and requested the Minister for Local Government to tell him, the number of new houses built by Cavan County Council, the number of new houses built by private enterprise and the number of houses for which the Department paid reconstruction grants between the years 1954 and 1961.  It is worth while putting it on the record.  Cavan is a poor county like my own.  They are, of course, a progressive people.  They have not the same emigration we have.  They have not the same influx as Deputy Sherwin told us Dublin had last year&mdash;1,500 families.</P>
      <P>Here is the record for Cavan.  In the year 1953-54, Cavan local authority built 78 houses; private enterprise built 145; and 254 houses were reconstructed.  In the year 1954-55, the local authority built 99; private enterprise built 169; 250 were reconstructed. In the year 1955-56, 86 were built by the local authority; 154 were built by private enterprise; 304 were reconstructed.  In the year 1956-57, 65 were built by the local authority; 166 were built by private enterprise; 396 were reconstructed.  We went out of office in 1957.  We no longer had any responsibility.</P>

In 1957-58 only 36 were built by the local authority; 131 by private enterprise.  In 1958-59&mdash;we had no responsibility of any kind&mdash;29 were built by the local authority and only 56 by private enterprise.  Again, we had no responsibility.

      <P>Not one solitary house was built in Cavan in the year 1960-61.  Deputy Dillon pointed out that this Vote on Account is a record one.  When the Minister asks for a Vote on Account he asks for one-third of the revenue necessary to run Government for the next twelve months.  This year what he asks for is a record.  What local authorities are asking for to-day <Col N="1306" /> is a record amount for rates.  These records stem from two things, and two things only.  First, they stem from the slashing of the food subsidies and, secondly, from the reckless expenditure by the present Government.  I use the word &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; purposely.  In 1956, as every Deputy on the other side has pointed out, we had a financial crisis here due to the Suez crisis. For the first time in our history, other than in a national emergency, we had petrol rationing.</P>

      <P>It was the Deputy put the squeeze on housing. He built none.  We found it necessary to impose a tax on imported luxury goods, but we stated the tax would be a temporary one, and nothing but a temporary one.  We went further.  We said the moneys we collected would be used for one thing, and one thing only, namely capital development.  That was in a time of international crisis. Today I do not see any international crisis.  There may be a national one, but there is certainly not an international one.  Why the necessity for this squeeze today?  I cannot understand it.  But I think there is a very good reason.  There is no doubt whatever the present Government were sure that we were going to enter the Common Market, and that all we had to do was catch on to the coattails of Great Britain and, whatever terms Great Britain got into the Common Market, we would follow suit.</P>
      <P>The Government never anticipated that Britain would be refused.  They never bothered to think what the alternative would be if Britain were refused. On one occasion the Taoiseach, with his tongue in his cheek, proclaimed: &ldquo;If Britain is refused, we go it alone.&rdquo; Those were his words.  Do we hear anything today about going it alone? We certainly do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we going to do now? <Col N="1307" /> Immediately Britain was refused admission she started negotiations with the EFTA countries.  She called in, through her diplomatic channels, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers.  She had to look for an alternative.  What have we done?  Nothing whatever. Even now the Taoiseach is going to Great Britain merely to have talks. Talks on what?  We have not been told.  We have not been told whether he is going to try to negotiate trade talks, economic talks, political talks, or any other kind of talk.  He is merely going.  He could be going to present shamrock to Mr. Macmillan on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>The North-east has a serious problem. They are badgering the British Government to improve the economy and to do something for the unemployed. Here we are, down in the South, twiddling our fingers, doing nothing.  We have a problem.  Is it not time we began to talk with our neighbours across the Border?  Is it not time we became realistic?  We sent a note of thanks to the head of the RUC when he escorted the President over the Border to Armagh on a recent sad occasion. But when it comes to economic talks with the Northern Government, we refuse to recognise them.</P>

      <P>The Minister finds no fault: we are agreed on that. Again, we have Denmark looking for a greater quota for her agricultural produce.  What are we doing to increase the quota which Deputy Dillon got for us in 1948?  Nothing whatever.

    <P>It is all very fine to say that there is a gap of £100 million between our imports and exports.  That gap has been caused by the importation of raw materials for processing and of machinery for the setting up of industries here.  However, the Minister must tell us and the industrialists where they are to export their manufactured <Col N="1313" /> goods.  He must also tell the farmers what he is doing to procure markets for our agricultural produce.  I do not believe he knows.  Let me end with the biblical quotation by asking the Government : Quo vadis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was rather amazing to listen to Deputy O'Donnell. Were it not that the Irish people are the most charitable race in the world, they would never vote again for Fine Gael or Labour, because on two occasions when they got an opportunity of taking over the Government, they sabotaged the economic interests of this nation.  In spite of that, they have the cheek to speak to the Irish people as they have spoken here since this Vote on Account was introduced.  They ran away from their responsibilities in 1951 and left the Fianna Fáil Government with a very ugly job to do in balancing the budget.  They were bluffing the people that everything in the garden was lovely.  I remember the Taoiseach saying from the other side of the House after we had been defeated in the election: &ldquo;We are handing over this State in a sound financial position; give it back to us the same way&rdquo;.  The economic position of the country was never better when we handed over office to the inter-Party Government.  Our external assets at that time, even in Britain, amounted to over £400 million.</P>

    <P>The first thing our Minister for Finance had to do in 1951 was to try to rectify the economic mistakes made by the inter-Party Government.  In 1952, we on this side of the House had to swallow a very hard pill in standing over the Budget of that year in order to put the national finances on a proper footing.  We did that, putting the interests of Ireland before the interests of our Party.  We felt that if we never came back to office, we had to put the country right financially. That was done and again the propaganda and the whispering started.  In 1954, we were again defeated and from 1954 to 1957, things went from bad to worse with the inter-Party Government. Deputy McGilligan who was a member of that Government came in here last night criticising everything this Government were doing.  I look <Col N="1314" /> upon him as an honourable, decent man but I cannot say that his politics were honest.  Deputy Dillon, Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Sweetman, in spite of all that happened when they were the Government, will tell the people they have the cure for all ills now.</P>
    <P>In 1957, for the second time, the Minister for Finance, and his colleagues in the Government had to face up to a shocking financial position left by the inter-Party Government and had to do unpopular things for which we have been criticised by Deputy McGilligan and Deputy O'Donnell.  I should like some building contractors from the city and county of Dublin to have been listening to Deputy O'Donnell, especially those whom he forced to go to Canada, Australia and the United States by his plausible talk here when he was Minister for Local Government, advising building contractors that there was money for everything.  Many a decent contractor accepted Deputy O'Donnell's word at that time and some of them are in Canada and Australia still.  In my constituency at that time, there were no housing loans or grants available.  In 1955 and 1956, people were leaving the country as fast as they could.  They did not even bother to give up the key of the house to the local authority.  Yet Deputy O'Donnell now tells the House what he did.  There was not the price of a bag of cement left when the inter-Party Government left office, not to mind sufficient money to build houses.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance took office, he had to get a number of local authorities out of difficulties.  There was no credit available from the banks or from building societies.  Industry of all kinds had come to a standstill and the Fianna Fáil Government had to restore the people's confidence in the country.  The banks started to advance money again.  Then the Government, through the Minister for Finance, once more had to pay the debts that were incurred by the inter-Party Government on housing.  There were then no grants for houses, no agricultural grant, no schools being built.</P>
    <P>I must pay the former Deputy Mulcahy the compliment of saying <Col N="1315" /> that at that time at least he was honest.  When he was Minister for Education and when I complained bitterly about the school building programme in Dublin, he replied with words to the effect that you cannot take trousers from a Highlander&mdash;you cannot build schools when there is no money available.  Yet we had Deputy P. O'Donnell today saying there was plenty of money.  He knows very well that it was action taken by him which deprived SDA applicants of their loans.  I did not come in here armed with documentary proof of all this but I cannot let it rest when I hear Deputies opposite making such obviously dishonest statements.</P>
    <P>Under Fianna Fáil government, the workers were never better off than they are nowadays.  There was very little for anybody in 1956 when the other crowd left office.  Immediately afterwards, social benefits increased, wages and salaries went up and the building industry was given a new lease of life.  Industrial grants are now available and the people of Ireland are generally a jolly sight better off than they were under the inter-Party Government.  I hope in the national interest the people will never trust them again.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell spoke of the housing programme of the Dublin Corporation.  Neither the Minister for Local Government nor the Minister for Finance has impeded in any way the Corporation's housing plans and I should like to point out that last year about 1,700 SDA loan houses were built.  Through supplementary grant schemes, things have become much easier for those anxious to build their own houses, and all I hope is that the present Minister for Finance will continue the good work.  As Deputy Sherwin has pointed out, Dublin in 1948 had an estimated housing deficiency of 20,000 dwellings.  It was further estimated at the time that an additional demand for about 1,000 dwellings per annum would accrue as a result of normal family growth.</P>
    <P>I have here a report from the City Manager for last year which tells how this problem was tackled:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> In planning to meet the deficiency, it was estimated that about 200 dwellings per annum would become available for new tenancies as a result of net vacancies in the existing housing estates.  By net vacancies I mean the complete vacation of houses and not transfers of tenancy on the death of a tenant to some other member of the family continuing to live in the house, or inter-transfers between tenants.</P>
    <P>The net vacancies began substantially to increase in 1954-55 when they amounted to 605 dwellings; in 1955-56 the figure increased to 763, and by 1956-57 had reached 986. During the administrative years 1948-49 to 1956-57 inclusive, 15,279 new houses were built and the net vacancies reached a figure of 3,777. In that period, therefore, 19,056 families were rehoused.  At the same time, operations under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts helped 5,879 families to provide homes for themselves &mdash; a total of 24,935 families.  Capital expenditure in that nine-year period was £25,283,234 under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and £8,838,493 under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts&mdash;a total of £34,121,727.  The combined effect of this was that the pressure for new housing substantially decreased.</P>
    <P>  I do not want to delay the House much longer in reading this report, but I think it is necessary in view of the statement made by Deputy P. O'Donnell.  The City Manager goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It had been decided to pursue the construction programme with all possible expedition until the housing deficiency was made good, and to that end substantial acquisitions of further sites were made which are noted in Appendix II of this report. However, when the substantial and continuously increasing vacancy rate was noted and considered in 1956, this resulted in a suspension of new development proposals and some delay in placing new housing contracts. Net vacancies continued to increase for a further three years. In 1957-58, they provided 1,294 <Col N="1317" /> dwellings, in 1958-59, 1,393, and in 1959-60, 1,605.  During this period, new building reduced from 1,564 dwellings in 1956-57 to 1,021 in 1957-58, 460 in 1958-59 and 505 in 1959-60.  During that three-year period, therefore, 6,278 families were housed.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee is Mr. Denis Larkin and it cannot be said that he would not have the interests of the working classes at heart.  The City Manager and the members are all most anxious to see that everything possible is done to provide adequate housing.  Deputy P. O'Donnell's contribution here then was nothing but another effort to sabotage housing operations in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Even though we met with a reversal in our attempts to join the Common Market, everything possible is being done by the Government to stimulate external trade but unfortunately everything we do is being met with opposition from the Fine Gael Party who seem out for sabotage of the national effort.  I thought we were all at one in relation to international affairs, but apparently the Fine Gael Party are more concerned with their own interests and their own petty outlook than they are with the national interest.  Of course I should have known that because they have proved it over the years.  When Deputy O'Donnell started to talk about the Economic War, he mentioned cattle.  He should have been ashamed of himself because they played England's game at that time. What happened during the Civil War could have been reversed if we had had a Party in this House other than the Fine Gael Party, or the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, as they were then.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to go back on history like this but they brought it on themselves. Deputy O'Donnell raised this question in the House or I would not raise it.  We on this side of the House are anxious to go ahead and not back. Because it was raised, I want to make clear the position in which the Irish people found themselves at that time. We were betrayed and Fine Gael <Col N="1318" /> played England's game.  They are now telling the country to get rid of Fianna Fáil and that they have cures for everything.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil always have, and always will, put the interests of Ireland before their own interests.  Whether we are in office or out of office, we will always be concerned about the interests of the nation.  We will not play with the economic interests of the nation as did Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Dillon and quite a number of others who spoke. They sabotaged the country, and left us in economic ruin when we defeated them in 1957.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote traditionally gives us an opportunity of reviewing the economic position of the country and it is appropriate that a rural Deputy such as myself should avail of the opportunity to put before the House matters which affect my constituency.  I do not want to extend the discussion which has been rather protracted and, in fact, has become very localised.  From the discussions that have taken place, it is quite obvious that there are two schools of thought in the House, that there is the city man and the rural man. Deputy Sherwin talked for something over an hour and a half this morning and he discussed, nothing but housing and Dublin Corporation.  That may be all very fine for Deputy Sherwin who is a Dublin Deputy, but the economic conditions prevailing in the country at the moment concern more than the townsman, the city man or Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the people who are affected by the prevailing economic conditions in my constituency.  Perhaps I can segregate them into three different communities: (1), the farming community; (2), the traders in the small and big towns; and (3), the workers.  I think it appropriate for me to say at this stage that the farmers must be considered the most important members of the community for many reasons.  When I say that, I do not wish to detract in any way from the importance of the small town dweller, the big town dweller, the road worker or the factory worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> I think it has been conceded by all politicians and by all economists that we are an agricultural country and, as such, our basic economy must be agriculture.  I am glad&mdash;and I say this without apologies to anyone on either side of the House&mdash;to see that the farmers to-day are organised.  I am glad to see the farmers members of the National Farmers' Association, Muintir na Tíre or any other branch of the farming organisations.  I think it was well past time when the farmers should organise themselves as an economic unit.  The working man who joined a trade union movement has reaped the reward of his organisation and to-day, as a result of the efforts made by the trade unions, the working man is guaranteed at least what he is entitled to: a fair wage for a fair day's work. Many years ago the worker was not paid for his labour.  Perhaps that was a result of the stigma left over from the old days of the British rule when they used our great grandfathers as slave labour.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the farmers have organised themselves in a manner somewhat similar to the trade union movement.  No matter what Government are in office, the important part to be played by the farming community must be recognised.  The farmer has now become educated and respect is due to the poor farmers' sons who became highly educated.  I want to pay tribute to those who went into the various Civil Service Departments, gained experience and passed it on to their organisations.  I want to advise them in my own small way.  Let the farming organisations keep clear of all political Parties and proceed on the lines on which they are proceeding at present, and Ireland will benefit from their efforts, and the farmers in general will benefit from the results of the efforts of these organisations.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be personal towards the Minister for Agriculture but he must take responsibility for his Department and he must take responsibility for the well-being of the agricultural community.  I regret to have to say in this House that, in my <Col N="1320" /> modest opinion, the Minister for Agriculture has completely abandoned and neglected the farmers, and especially the small farmers of Ireland.  It is quite easy to talk about the industries in rural Ireland but we must never forget that in rural Ireland small farmers with small families, and sometimes small farmers with large families, are little old-established industries which, I regret to say, are quickly disappearing.</P>
    <P>I very much regret having to criticise the Minister for Agriculture, who is not travelling to London on 18th March with the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs.  I think the Minister for External Affairs has enough travelling of his own to do to New York, Brussels and Paris and now we find him going to London when the Minister for Agriculture should be going there to talk to his opposite number in the British Government about finding a market for the produce of the small farmers of the West of Ireland and the large farmers of the midlands.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach still seems to be interested only in industry and he is still talking about industrial expansion when our entry into the Common Market is in jeopardy.  It is considered by our economists that if we fail to become a member of the Common Market, there is no hope for the survival of many industries established over the past ten years.  Is it not true to state that in many cases where large grants were passed on to industries in the past eight or nine years, these industries are now beginning to collapse?  That is wasted money. There is one thing for which there is always a market, and that is, the produce which we can grow on the land of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Great publicity has been given by Government speakers to the amount of money allocated to agriculture but I must repeat to the House what the House already knows, that is, that the farmers' income last year dropped by something like £20 million.  I want seriously to ask the House what good there is in giving a grant to a farmer to erect a piggery, or a cow byre, or a henhouse, or to reclaim his land.  If <Col N="1321" /> you do not provide him with a market for the produce he is going to get from his land.  That is completely irregular planning.</P>
    <P>A great amount of capital expenditure has been thrown at the Irish farmer that is not worth the snap of his fingers to him.  What we want at the moment is a market for the Irish farmer.  The egg from which the farmer's wife used to get the money to run her household, is gone.  The pig is gone.  What have they left?  We are depending entirely on our cattle trade to keep up our exports, and in the west of Ireland we suffer from the disadvantage that when there is a possibility of profit to be made out of the store bullock, we are short of grass and must dispose of him.  I must appeal to the Minister not to be demanding that the farmers should improve their holdings, and, at the same time, not making any effort to provide a market for their produce.</P>
    <P>We in the west have probably been hit hardest by emigration.  When speaking on the Vote on Account last year, I drew attention to the fact that we had 20,000 emigrants from Mayo in the previous ten years.  The indications are that there will be a further increase in that movement.  I was amused this morning to hear Deputy Sherwin talk about all the people coming back to Dublin.  I think he is confused by the number of people coming here from the west of Ireland and stalling in Dublin looking for work.  It is that rather than the number coming back from England that confuses him.</P>
    <P>I have quite a good knowledge of my constituency and, apart from my political movements through it, I have quite a good commercial knowledge of it.  In any town I go to, or in any small village, I see no movements back from England but I can see quite a big movement from Ballina station out of my constituency.  That is a big loss to us.</P>
    <P>I do not want to extend this already protracted discussion but I must refer to the position in my constituency with regard to the rates.  Speaking here this time last year, I drew the attention of the House to the fact that a week or two earlier we had been discussing our <Col N="1322" /> estimate at the meeting in Castlebar of the Mayo County Council and I mentioned that the indications were that the rate for County Mayo would be 50s. in the £.  It ultimately turned out that the rate was 55s.  On that occasion, I beseeched the Government to do something for the seaboard counties of the west, as they could not, from their own resources, curtail the high expenditure.</P>
    <P>On last Saturday week, one year later, I was present at the meeting of Mayo County Council with my colleagues. May I put it on the records of this House that there are 31 genuine members of that council who sit in Castlebar and who, irrespective of their political affiliations, are concerned to produce as low a rate as possible and at the same time to give the people as good a service as possible? The rate struck by any local authority is the price you pay for the services you give your people.  On last Saturday week, for a poor county like Mayo, we struck the abnormal rate of 62s. in the £ and I am predicting here and now that the people of Mayo will get no better services, medically or otherwise, than they got last year.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a section of the community which, in my opinion, must receive consideration in the forthcoming Budget.  I refer to the small shopkeepers and business people of the small towns and villages in Mayo. They are a section of the community with a genuine grievance because they have had to suffer a progressive decline in their business.  If you have a dwindling population, you must have a decline in business.  To that misfortune must be added increased wages, rates, transport charges, electricity charges and so on, without any increase in business and in most cases, with the advent of supermarket business, reduced profits.  In my constituency, many of the smaller towns such as Swinford, Killala, Crossmolina, Charlestown and Belmullet are just hanging on.  May I repeat what I said at a county council meeting that in bringing our rates to 62s. in the £, we have drawn the axe on the small towns of County Mayo.</P>

At various times in the year in my constituency, we have numbers of unemployed and quite a lot of work to do in connection with unemployment assistance and stamps and the dole.  I am sure the other Deputies from the constituency will bear that out.  It is a terrible state of affairs that accommodation roads in my county are in a disgraceful condition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to make constructive criticism in an objective way for the benefit of the Government and ultimately for my constituents and I felt it my duty to bring these facts before the House.  If the Chair would be patient and allow me to correlate my remarks to what I had in mind, I think he would find they are relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare pay £3 to £3 10s. in unemployment assistance each week.  That is no use to a married man today.  It is like giving biscuits to an elephant.  I should prefer to see co-operation between the Board of Works and the Department of Social Welfare in this respect so that instead of giving a man £3 10s. for doing nothing&mdash;and in so doing, simply making him lazy physically and mentally and no addition to the economy&mdash;where there are accommodation roads to be repaired and schemes generally under the Board of Works required to be done, the Board of Works would put up another £3 10s. and do productive work which would benefit the constituency and benefit the individual who will have a decent income and a decent <Col N="1325" /> job?  That is the suggestion to which I wished to correlate my earlier remarks. In that way accommodation roads would be immensely improved and they require it urgently.  The recipient of unemployment benefit would be getting a respectable wage and doing respectable, productive work.  You could also have him opening drains and working to benefit the land which would result in further production.</P>
    <P>The time has come when something must be done for western seaboard counties.  I do not know if it is relevant to suggest it now but the Government will have to consider seriously setting up a rates equalisation fund for counties like Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Kerry and Cork.  In Mayo, we are in the unhappy position that valuations are small and the population declining and therefore the <i>per capita</i> contribution expected from the remaining population has become an unbearable burden.  We shall have to get more aid from the central authority.  The Government have access to funds that no local authority could hope to get and if a burden becomes too big for any section of the community, we shall all have to make our contribution from the central authority to meet that problem.  Here is a problem and if you do not do something about it, there will be no west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I appeal very strongly to the Minister sitting opposite, a Connacht man himself, with, I am sure, as much experience of West of Ireland problems as I have.  He is a much older man and although a member of the Government, I believe that close to his heart he must have the very grave situation that arises for the farmers and townspeople in the West of Ireland, especially in places like Mayo and Galway.</P>
    <P>I want to criticise the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands for his neglect since coming into office of the fishing industry in the West of Ireland.  I was quite pleased when a young Parliamentary Secretary was appointed to that important position because I always believed, although I come from an inland part of the constituency, that there is a tremendous <Col N="1326" /> potential of wealth along the coast of Ireland, especially the north Mayo coast outside Erris and Achill.  There is tremendous scope there. Almighty God has provided the material to raise the fish.  All the fishermen on the west coast require is adequate boats, equipment and landing facilities.  Yet it is not unusual to find that in the West the fish we eat on Fridays has been brought down from Dublin.</P>

I could not understand how a man from an inland part of the country was put in charge of fisheries, but I presumed he had a fishing background, either as a rod fisherman or as a deep-sea fisherman. Along with the other two Deputies from the constituency, I have attended many meetings in the Erris area and have gone on deputations to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I regret to say he has done very little with regard to landing facilities in either Achill or Erris or the provision of fishing boats or gear.</P>

      <P>Finally, I appeal to the Government to take immediate steps to provide marketing facilities and a guaranteed market for farm produce.  I appeal to them also to consider the plight of the towns in the West of Ireland. What is to keep them in business?  I can assure the Government that I will never encourage either the NFA or trade union workers to look for anything unreasonable.  But I want to tell the Government that, so long as I am a member of this House, I shall never hesitate to back up any section of my community who I feel are not getting a fair crack of the whip from Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House making a long political speech.  As an Independent Deputy, however, I should like to make a few observations.  My voice is not very often heard here.  I feel my time is much better spent looking after the needs of my constituents than taking part in some of the political debates one has to bear with here at times.  I am sick and tired of listening to the howls from the Opposition since I came into this House&mdash;I say that with emphasis&mdash;telling the people that the Government have brought the country to perdition.  I am also sick of the Government answering the Opposition back by asking: &ldquo;What did you do in 1955-56?&rdquo; It reminds me of my school days, when one young fellow said to another &ldquo;Strike me and I will strike you back.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time to end this political bickering is long overdue.  I do not agree that this Government, or any other Government as far back as I can remember, are perfect; but I think the Government are doing their best.  Apparently, the Opposition think they would do much better if they were in government. But they are not in government. That is the will of the people.  I would appeal to the Opposition, if they have any constructive advice to offer, to put it forward.  In that way, they will be doing a good day's work for themselves <Col N="1328" /> and, above all, for Ireland, instead of adopting a negative attitude.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that the example set here has gone further afield.  One has only to read the debates of county councils and county committees of agriculture down the country.  You will find those bodies reeking with politics. Political play-actors, I would call them, with one or two gluttonous speech-makers wasting the time of the sincere people on those bodies.  They have only one idea in mind&mdash;to get their names pasted across the local papers.</P>
    <P>This is the largest Estimate ever to come before this House.  The only consolation in it for me personally is that our primary industry is being voted a large amount of money, which it richly deserves.  It is still, and always will be, our basic industry.  I am glad to say the Government have recognised that.  A great deal of publicity has been given recently to an increase in the price of creamery milk.  If such an increase is given, I shall welcome it indeed.  Many people in my constituency have changed their former pattern of farming and have gone over to milk production.  If an increase is given, I am sure it will be welcomed by all.  At the same time, I appreciate the difficulties.  I know the heavy subsidies Bord Bainne have to face at the moment.  I do not think it is as easy as Deputy T. O'Donnell told us it was last night.  I do not think we can find these markets in the countries mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I was present at an international milk conference in Tours, France, last May two years.  With the exception of the Iron Curtain countries, every country in Europe was represented there.  The delegates had only one aim in mind: to find a market for milk and milk products.  Leaving that conference after three days, we were just as wise as when we went in.  The president of the conference, Mr. Vincent, who was also chairman of the NFU said, &ldquo;You will see that every gun at this conference is pointed at the British Market.&rdquo; Various references were made on that occasion to India, Africa and various places were named in Africa, such as Nigeria, where we could find a <Col N="1329" /> market for our milk and milk products. The Germans who had already tried those places got up and laughed at such a proposal.  They said: &ldquo;We tried those places but we came to realise that we were not a charitable institution; the market is there but we have nothing to get.&rdquo;  That is my humble opinion, unless that trend has changed within the past two years. That is how I found it in the milk business.  If anybody wants to get into the milk business or if anybody has high hopes of export markets, then I am not the one to depress him.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this Vote last year, I explained the need for changing the Undeveloped Areas Act so that counties such as those I represent would get the chance to have new industries.  I am glad to say that now through the enterprise of local people, a new industry is mooted for Mullingar. This is a meat factory which will benefit the farmers as well as the townspeople and the workers.  We have high hopes that this factory will materialise some time next year.  I ask the Minister to be prepared to give us all the help we will require when it comes to that time.</P>
    <P>Last year, I also appealed to the Minister for Agriculture to give us the seed scheme which operated in other areas and now I want to express my gratitude to the Minister for making that scheme available to the farmers in North Longford.  As they say, every little helps.</P>
    <P>The Inny drainage scheme is a great boon to my constituency at the moment.  I hope when it is finished, some other scheme will be made available by the Government for that part of the country.  It is giving large-scale employment at the moment and greater benefits will come when swampy land becomes suitable for grazing and tillage. I should also like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance on the working of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that there is great uneasiness about increased rates on agricultural land. Deputy Browne also mentioned this. Rates can be a very heavy burden, although I am not unmindful of the <Col N="1330" /> reliefs given last year.  I hope the day is not too far off when the Government will be in a position to give full derating on agricultural land.  On the subject of rates, I am not forgetting people who need sympathy in this direction.  I am speaking of people who are living in large useless buildings in towns and villages, whose businesses have been whittled down and whose backs are being broken by heavy rates.  I do not know what can be done for them unless they form themselves into a body like other bodies which are doing all the shouting about rates.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday morning, I saw looming before my eyes in the newspapers mention of the very large sum of £5 million to be devoted to setting up supermarkets.  I wonder who is at the root of this venture?  I wonder who is to benefit by these supermarkets?  I wonder how decent business people, small and large, who have borne the brunt for so long of good business and bad business, whose families have been engaged in the same business for generations, will fare against such ventures? Are we to turn our backs on these people?  Are we to leave the rural towns like a city about which I read recently where supermarkets have taken over and where flats have replaced business houses and where the streets have become carparks and the ladies and gentlemen who deal in the supermarkets walk from their cars from places which once throbbed with good business?  The Government should look very carefully into this matter and see if by any chance this is investment by foreigners because I can tell you it is not for love of the ordinary people of Ireland that they are coming in to start supermarkets.</P>
    <P>Some time ago and also recently, there was great talk from the Opposition, and from other people, too, who were not so much of the Opposition, about Germans buying up land and about &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money coming in.  I have not heard one word about the business people who are being put on the road by the invasion of supermarkets. Is the sympathy created now for the farmers merely because they have a strong organisation?  I am glad that they have a good strong organisation <Col N="1331" /> because I am a farmer myself, and a farmer of no small dimensions either, and I need all the sympathy that is coming to me, whether from the Government or from an association. But I would ask the people who shouted here before about the Germans to take up the cudgels now for the business people of rural Ireland and the city of Dublin and to see that they are not put on the road and that they will not be found standing at the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer, a matter which, thank God, has not got far but which has sounded the deathknell of a certain section who were always decent, hard-working people and who were never found at the labour exchange.  Some time ago, some financiers got the idea that they would start a business here called the cattle mart and they would eliminate the middleman and the farmers would have an assured market for all time.  They even got around some of the county medical officers of health to publish items saying that fairs held in the streets were not healthy.  They succeeded to a certain extent in doing that.  Is the market for the farmers any better?  I think it is a whole lot worse for them and for the business people of Ireland.  Together with that, they have put some decent, hardworking people out of business. Once more, I should like to remind the House that they should be careful about the supermarkets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but I have listened to the speeches made here during the past couple of days and, having done so, I feel it incumbent upon me to say something in relation to the matters that have been discussed. Listening to the Fine Gael speakers is a depressing experience. I can only regard them as a Party who project gloom and despondency.  They have pursued a course of denigrating the Government and the efforts the Government are making to develop and improve our economy.  No doubt their speeches are largely coloured by the fact that there is an impending <Col N="1332" /> by-election in North-East Dublin, a constituency I have the honour to represent, caused by the lamented passing of Deputy Belton.</P>
      <P>In all the speeches made by the Fine Gael Party, there has been no specific proposal to reduce the large bill before the House.  I should here like to compliment the members of the Labour Party, who have contributed to this discussion: they had a constructive approach and, if they had any criticism to make, it was that the bill is not large enough.  Fine Gael, on the other hand, have endeavoured to represent to the country that our economy is unsound.  Everybody knows we have a sound economy.  It is through the efforts and the policy pursued by Fianna Fáil since they returned to office in 1957 that the economy has been made sound once more.  To-day we can see the success of that policy.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the housing position, on which some stress has been laid here.  Fine Gael are trying to make political capital out of the present housing difficulty.  They do not like to be reminded that it was their mishandling of the affairs of the country a number of years ago that produced some of the conditions that exist to-day.  Every member of this House who is a member of a local authority has detailed the causes of the recession in the building industry in this city.  I, and other members of the corporation, know well the reasons why building tapered off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the return of the Fianna Fáil Government, building has been considerably stimulated.  Today, there are over 1,000 houses and flats in course of construction.  Another 3,000 are projected, and plans have been advanced for the building of a further 4,000.  The effective waiting list is in the region of 4,000 or 5,000 applicants.  With the impetus, encouragement and financial assistance given, I see no reason why the housing problem should not be solved within a reasonable period.  The problem has been complicated somewhat by the fact that our emigrants are returning.  On the waiting list to-day, there are at least 800 families who have returned from England, because <Col N="1333" /> of the employment opportunities resulting from the policy pursued by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>There are increased employment opportunities.  The columns in the newspapers are full of advertisements seeking employment. The records of the Dublin Corporation stand in testimony of the situation.</P>
      <P>In this Vote on Account, there is an additional sum of £400,000 for housing. That will help to stimulate further building activity by both local authority and private enterprise.  That is in marked contrast to the experience in the Dublin Corporation when Fine Gael were the predominant partners in the Coalition Government some few years ago.  In those depressing years, there were, in north-east Dublin, vacant building sites and uncompleted houses, a monument to the ineptitude of the Coalition Government.  The builders emigrated to America, Canada and England and, of course, the building operatives followed them. We had the colossal figure of 100,000 unemployed.  We had conditions which produced marches by the unemployed in this city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 1, and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circular referred to by the Deputy was issued before the medical card system was introduced under the general medical services regulations, 1954, and paragraph 3 was, consequently, drafted as referring to all applicants for maternity cash grants. Since the introduction in 1954 of the medical card system, eligibility for the general medical services, which carries with it entitlement to maternity cash grants, is based primarily on inclusion in the general medical services register. If, therefore, a woman's name is correctly included in that register, she is entitled to a maternity cash grant. Health authorities are, however, quite entitled&mdash;and indeed have the duty&mdash;to <Col N="1335" /> delete from the general medical services register at any time the names of persons who have, through betterment of their financial situation or otherwise, become ineligible for inclusion.  A health authority may thus, if it desires, make fresh enquiries at the time of application for a maternity cash grant into the circumstances of any particular applicant, even if the person concerned is covered by a medical card, but there is no obligation on them to do so in the absence of grounds for believing that the applicant has ceased to be eligible for free general medical services.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to have a copy of the circular placed in the Library for the convenience of Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that county managers&mdash;not in County Meath&mdash;have recently had a further examination of means carried out&mdash; within weeks after a medical card has been issued&mdash;when an application has been made for a maternity cash grant? Does he consider that that is laid down in his circular or have they been overstepping their duty?</P>

      <P>The general medical services regulations of 1954 provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that whenever a local authority have reason to believe that, because of a change in circumstances or some other factor, persons are not entitled to have their names inscribed in the medical register, the health authority are bound to make investigations.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to a statement made on 9th March by the chairman of the Public Dental Officers' Group of the Irish Dental Association, during the course of which the chairman drew attention to the complete impossibility of running an adequate dental service for children and adults with the number of dentists at present employed by the health authorities; and whether he will take immediate steps to ensure the overall improvement of the public dental services, both by the employment of a greater number of dentists, <Col N="1337" /> and by careful and rational planning to the best advantage of the use of the services of dentists already employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to a newspaper report of a statement made by the chairman of the Public Dental Officers' Group of the Irish Dental Association at the annual general meeting of this group held on 9th March, 1963.</P>
      <P>While it is true that there is a shortage of dentists here, we are not unique in this respect.  The same position exists in most countries, even in such countries as Sweden, USA and Great Britain, where facilities for dental treatment are regarded as most developed.</P>
      <P>Up to comparatively recently it was difficult to recruit dentists to the whole-time service of our health authorities, but the position in this regard shows signs of easing.  A further limiting factor is the financial one and this, in the context of the general financial situation, is a substantial one since improvement of the services involves an additional charge on rate-payers, and taxpayers.  Thus, even if the additional personnel were readily available, the cost of substantially increasing the number of dentists employed by health authorities so as to bring about a significant overall improvement in the dental services has to be considered in conjunction with the cost of the health services as a whole and the demands on public funds for other services.</P>
      <P>Despite this financial limitation, I have urged the appointment of senior dental surgeons in a number of health authority areas so as to improve the organisation and co-ordination of the dental services in the areas in which they are employed.</P>

Be that as it may, I want to put this on record that since the enactment of the Charities Bill, the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests have done very much more work than ever before in a comparable period of time and I think I am speaking not merely for those who are interested in charities but for those such as solicitors, and so forth who have been connected with this work.  The experience has been a happy one in that since the enactment of that Bill, the Commissioners and their officers have, through the new statutory powers, greatly facilitated the expenditious and convenient handling of certain charity matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £7,000 be granted to befray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education and for Expenses connected with the Council of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate is required to enable a sum of £5,400, first <Col N="1365" /> instalment of a refund of expenses in connection with an OECD Pilot Survey, to be appropriated in aid of the Vote and to provide a balance of £7,000 towards the excess expenditure under subheads B &amp; C.  The excess under subhead B is due to arrears of increases in salary for members of the Inspectorate, as part of the 8th round increase for the period 1 November, 1961, to 31st March, 1962, which were paid in the financial year 1962/3.  The revised scales of salary were agreed upon at a meeting of the Departmental Conciliation Council in July 1962.</P>
    <P>Successful competitions for the filling of vacancies in the primary and secondary school inspectorate were held towards the end of 1961 and in 1962 and in the circumstances the provision for travelling and subsistence made under subhead C for the financial year 1962-3 was not fully adequate to meet the expenses for travelling and subsistence charged to the subhead. These expenses include some travelling and subsistence charges in connection with a pilot education study being conducted in conjunction with OECD and charges arising from the preparation of a special course in Irish based on linguistic research methods.</P>
    <P>As already announced, the pilot study in conjunction with OECD has been under way since October last.  The aim is to prepare an educational development programme for Ireland up to 1970 and 1975, based on detailed studies of the trend of economic and social factors at national and international levels.  The experience gained from the pilot experiment will be passed on to other member countries of OECD and the organisation has agreed to refund about 50 per cent of the cost of the project, subject to a maximum of £10,600 approximately. The first instalment of this refund&mdash; £5,400&mdash;has been received and credited to Subhead G&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid. The study is to be completed not later than on 30th September, 1964.</P>
    <P>By a special arrangement with the authorities of his Order, the services of Dr. Colmán Ó hUallacháin, OFM, are being made available to the Department of Education for the purpose of the preparation of a course in Irish <Col N="1366" /> based on the most modern thought and practice in linguistic research methods. It is anticipated that the work in connection with the preparation of the course will be completed in about two years from 1st January last and provision by way of a grant-in-aid of £4,000 is proposed for it in a special subhead in the Estimates for the financial year 1963-4.  In the meantime expenditure in connection with the scheme is being met from the subhead Travelling and Incidental Expenses of this Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister says that during the year an examination was held for the promotion of primary school inspectors and I take it a number of new appointments have been made as a result.  I should be very interested to know what the methods of appointing these inspectors is and what was the cost of the examination.  I always understood that a teacher was appointed to the position of inspector on his record as a teacher and was not aware of the fact that examinations were held for these appointments.  I should like to know now what the examination is and what the curriculum is for it.</P>
      <P>Again I note that additional moneys are required for research into linguistic methods.  We would be very interested to have further details of these methods of research.  The Minister made no suggestion about the provision of expenses for the commission which have been set up to study methods for the revival of the Irish language.  Are that commission functioning at all or have they become dormant?  Perhaps it would be a very good thing if, like the Select Committee on the Health Services, they provided us with a report.

      <P>Surely that should dovetail with the commission who are sitting.  Surely if the Minister is employing this reverend gentleman, there should be some liaison between him and the commission who are studying the revival of the Irish language.  The Taoiseach cannot be responsible for the commission and the Minister responsible for this gentleman and hope to achieve the best results.  It does not seem to be much use, and yet we are spending money on them.  I should like to know what progress this commission have made with regard to methods of reviving the Irish language, because if we do not get a move on there, we may be too late.  It would be no harm if they got a move on.</P>
      <P>I notice a considerable amount is required for increases in salaries.  I take it that refers to primary school inspectors.  Have additional inspectors been appointed?  It would be a good thing on Votes of this kind if we could get details of how the money will be expended.  Then we would be in a better position to discuss them.</P>

      <P>I would join with the Deputy is saying it is a most desirable thing, if we are to have fresh knowledge about methods of teaching Irish, that we would have access to them. Surely we are getting into a grotesque situation if, having set up a commission <Col N="1368" /> who have been sitting for some years now to inquire into the question as to the best methods of teaching Irish and promoting the language in our educational system, the Minister for Education is to set up another body to consider methods of teaching Irish without establishing any liaison with the existing commission who, as I have said, have been sitting for years and from whom we have heard nothing. Surely if this gentleman has something of value to impart to us, the first body he should get in touch with is the commission who have been charged by the Taoiseach with a very special responsibility&mdash;to survey the whole field of the Irish language revival.  The Minister, when concluding, should give us greater details as to what this gentleman has to offer and in how far he is to co-operate with the existing commission in order that they may incorporate whatever information he may have to give them in the report which we hope some day will be made available to the patient public who have been long waiting for some result. Can anyone remember when this commission were set up under the Taoiseach's Department?</P>

      <P>It is certainly passing into history.  It was set up so long ago that no one here can readily say how long it has been functioning.  We have heard nothing from it. Now we are told that a considerable volume of modern teaching innovations has apparently been discovered and developed since the original commission was set up.  Would it not be a galvanising experience for that commission if this new young Lochinvar who has made the discovery since the commission was established were put in touch with it?  It might discover that things are moving in the world even if they are not in the ivory tower of the commission.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that superficially, at any rate, an anachronism seems to exist.  I think he has a certain duty to inform us why this commission of the Taoiseach's has not reported, or why he has not decided to inject this learned man into their deliberations, if they propose to continue indefinitely deliberating.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not feel that I am taking away some of his ammunition, but I cannot resist rising at this stage to say that I am appalled at the apparent ignorance of the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy O'Donnell of something with which I thought everyone who was interested in the Irish language was familiar.  The activities of An tAthair Ó hUallacháin are very well known and have received a considerable amount of publicity.  For the benefit of the Opposition, may I say briefly that he is a priest who has devoted a large number of years to the study of languages.  He has attended courses in America and France where he has studied the latest developments in the teaching of languages.  Most people I think are aware of the fact that there have been revolutionary developments in the study of the manner in which people learn anything, but particularly of the manner in which they learn languages. Those studies have revealed some <Col N="1370" /> very pertinent facts in regard to the methods of teaching languages.</P>
      <P>I should have thought that the Opposition would have got up today to congratulate the Minister on his broad vision in seeing to it that these most modern researches are put to the use which we require here, the revival of the Irish language and the teaching of the Irish language.  These methods are being availed of by other countries and, for a change, we see some effort being made to utilise the modern tools available for teaching the language instead of going back to the methods of the past century.  I think the Minister's action is most praiseworthy and I should have expected to have heard congratulation instead of something which amounted very closely to derision.</P>

I expect that when the commission's report comes&mdash;and I hope it will come before long&mdash;it will have something to say about the methods used in schools, but it could not be expected to deal with the technical points involved in the research undertaken by An tAthair Ó hUallacháin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that his methods consist to some extent of recording the <Col N="1371" /> language used by young children in the various parts of the Gaeltacht, of recording the words they use, and the number of times they are used, and basing the teaching methods on the discoveries made of the manner in which children who have the language from birth speak the language and the manner in which they build up a vocabulary.</P>
    <P>In regard to the commission, I should like to make the point that references have been made from time to time to delays in the appearance of its report. It seems to me that the implications behind those remarks are that the Government are either responsible for the delays or are deliberately causing the report to be held up.  Anyone who can read between the lines, and anyone who looks at the questions put to the Taoiseach from time to time about this report and the replies given by him, will realise that the Taoiseach wishes more than anyone else that the report were available.  It seems to me to be a little unfair to imply that the Government are responsible for the delay.</P>

      <P>An tAthair Ó hUallacháin is not a commission.  He is a single person and a linguistics expert. From his studies, he is in the position of being able to do research into the techniques of teaching languages.  He will deal mainly with the Irish language, but he will deal with, and already has dealt with, modern continental languages.</P>

      <P>The technique is a rapid learning technique and there are mechanical and other techniques. These are matters of details which could not by the longest stretch of the imagination be considered matters for the commission to report on.  I imagine that the commission would recommend in its report the appointment of such a man who had actually studied the techniques and details, a man who was a linguistics expert.  As I said when introducing this vote, the money for the work of An tAthair Ó hUallacháin will come under the main Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, he will do a certain amount of work on Continental languages, but he will deal mainly with the Irish languages.  I hope that from his <Col N="1373" /> work we will have much more rapid learning of the spoken language with much less time having to be spent on it.</P>

      <P>There was another matter which puzzled Deputy O'Donnell. There were 12 primary and seven secondary inspectors appointed.

I do not know what the expenses of the Civil Service Commission are but the competition was held by them and the appointments were made on the recommendation of that Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a point here.  I listened with attention to the contribution of Deputy Colley for whose discretion I have the most profound respect.  Quite recently I mentioned to the Minister a work on the linguistic development of my youth to which considerable importance was attached.  I recognise the potential there is for the development of the language but surely it is not reasonable to say that An tAthair Ó hUallacháin has something of value to contribute to the teaching of Irish and just leave it at that.  Surely, the knowledge he has ought to be given to the commission which should be allowed to avail of that knowledge?  Some liaison ought to be established between him and the commission so that some regard may be had to his system of linguistics, which the Minister has stated, <i>prima facie</i>, to be of value.  That system ought to be carefully examined and exploited as far as it can be.  It is not reasonable that the report of the commission should be issued until it has considered what contribution An tAthair Ó hUallacháin might be able to make that would be helpful to the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The most the commission could do in the matter would be <Col N="1374" /> to recommend that such an arrangement be made.  I am responsible for the teaching methods in the schools, no matter what the commission may report, and I was fully justified in making the appointment.  I understand that the commission's report is being typed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley was astonished that I had not heard of An tAthair Ó hUallacháin but I am sure there are experts of my youth of whom Deputy Colley has not heard.  It would be an astonishing matter if the commission produced a report and made no reference whatever to the new methods which An tAthair Ó hUallacháin recommends to the Minister for Education. It would be an anachronism if the commission produced its report after seven years' deliberations and the Minister disgarded half the material in it because it did not have regard to the new system of linguistic teaching which he has now accepted from An tAthair Ó hUallacháin.</P>

The selection of one particular man to bring these techniques into the schools would be a matter for me.  I am satisfield that the commission have heard of these techniques.  The reason why you probably have not heard of An tAthair Ó hUallacháin is that he has been abroad and that most of his work has been done in America.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £60,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for Primary Education, including National School Teachers' Superannuation, etc.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet the cost of additional grants to the training colleges and increases in the rates of annual bonus payable to national school teachers in respect of special qualifications.</P>
      <P>A major scheme for the provision of new premises is at present in hand in the case of St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra.  The cost will, in the first instance, be met by way of a bank loan and the State will refund this total cost, as to principal and interest, over a period of years.  The additional sum required in this supplementary estimate includes £21,000 approximately as a first payment in respect of such refund.  The balance represents increased provision to enable the training colleges to meet additional current expenditure, including the cost of increased salaries to the teaching staff as from 1 November, 1961.</P>
      <P>Following the acceptance by the Government of the finding of the Chairman of the Arbitration Board, which sat on 11th and 12th October, 1962, the rates of annual bonus payable to national school teachers in respect of special qualifications were increased, with effect from 1 November, 1961.  The annual additional cost of the revised rates of bonus is estimated at £20,000.  In the financial year 1962-3 the additional cost is £27,000, since payment for the five months from 1 November, 1961, to 31 March, 1962, is also included in the payments in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross total additional provision now required is, therefore, £69,000 but net savings of £9,000 approximately are anticipated in the other subheads of <Col N="1376" /> the vote, thus placing the net additional provision required at £60,000.</P>

      <P>We are spending money on the building of St. Patrick's College and we have closed down in Donegal one of the finest buildings in this country, Coláiste Bríde.  Not alone have we closed it down but it is costing us £1,000 a year to keep it closed down.  That is the reply I got to a question which I addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance on the matter.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister could find some use for Coláiste Bríde.  He talks about decentralisation and here we are to spend money now on the building of St. Patrick's College.  We are going to close down these preparatory colleges throughout the country which could be used for the education of teachers who are going to teach in the Gaeltacht because these colleges are sited in the Gaeltacht.  It is false economy. Coláiste Bríde has now been closed for three years at a cost of £3,000 to the taxpayers and although we are spending a £1,000 a year on it, the building is deteriorating for want of occupation and fires.  The Minister should consult with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and see if his Department could use this building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give an example.  Donegal vocational committee built a magnificent technical school at Gortahork in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I forget what it <Col N="1377" /> cost but I think it was well over £10,000.  When we were planning to build that school, the Minister knew he was going to close down Coláiste Bríde only two and a half miles away and that it would cost the taxpayers £1,000 a year to keep it there.  What a tragedy that the Department had not a little more foresight and had not said: &ldquo;Before you build in Gortahork, let us look at the preparatory school and if we think the preparatory school is not the right type of school for training teachers, we shall make it available to the vocational education committee.&rdquo;  That would have been a very fine gesture.</P>
    <P>Again, although this may be more appropriate to the next heading, we are paying considerable sums to CIE for these hotel training courses.  I am not criticising them&mdash;they are excellent &mdash;but we have the CIE hotel in Bundoran occupied for six or eight months of the year and it is costing us or CIE&mdash;Seán citizen pays in any case &mdash;a considerable sum.  We had Coláiste Bríde fully furnished and capable of housing 100 students.  Why did we not keep it open for the training of hotel staffs instead of taking over the hotel in Bundoran?</P>

      <P>The reason I suggested this particular one is that it is in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  It belongs to the Department and is furnished. Yet we decided to close it and build a new technical school two and a half miles away.  We sold the entire contents and we let the farm in conacre and then moved to Bundoran at fabulous cost to the taxpayers and took over the CIE hotel for some six months of the year.  That is very shortsighted policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now going to spend money on building a new St. Patrick's College and we are back again to centralisation instead of using the preparatory schools we have in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  There is another in West Cork, Ballyvourney. It is a tragedy that they are not used to train teachers for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht schools in the environment in which they are going to teach later, an environment where they can acquire, if <Col N="1378" /> they need it, the dialect of the Gaeltacht in which they will teach.  It is a waste of taxpayers' money.  That is one of the troubles of the Government&mdash; there is no liaison between the Departments.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for Education in particular but this is something he should look into.  We have not enough money for education but we want to put what we have to much better use than rebuilding a training college when we have these magnificent buildings in the country.</P>

      <P>They are being used as secondary schools.  I think it would be more than wasteful to have five teachers' training colleges in the Gaeltacht. It would not be realistic to do what Deputy O'Donnell suggests in regard to training the teachers in the Gaeltacht for the Gaeltacht because you do not know where the teacher will be appointed to teach.  It may sound very attractive to train Gaeltacht teachers in the Gaeltacht but you cannot pick them before they are trained to go to particular Gaeltacht schools.  I do not think that is feasible.  I do not know why the Deputy objects to the vocational school at Gortahork&mdash;</P>

      <P>But the decision to change the system of preparatory schools was taken after the decision to build this vocational school at Gortahork and the planning of the vocational education committee in Donegal was arranged to meet the needs of the people.  The reason Coláist Bríde is not put to educational use now is that the region is adequately served by secondary schools at the moment, but I am not without hope that we shall find use for it.  I think it is worth holding on to the building rather than selling it at present.  It may be possible to sell it. I think it was advertised but there <Col N="1379" /> were no offers near the value of the college.  Any of the other proposals suggested would be less attractive even though they could be made to sound attractive.  I take it that the Deputy does not object to the training college being improved?</P>

      <P>No, but we do object to the Minister trying to turn the anvil on Deputy O'Donnell by saying he is shocked at Deputy O'Donnell objecting to the erection of a vocational school at Gortahork when, in fact, what the Deputy said was that he was sorry the Minister did not arrange for an even better vocational school at Gortahork and at the same time save the Donegal vocational education authority a very large sum and show a little foresight on behalf of the taxpayers and ratepayers.  Magnificent as is the new vocational school at Gortahork, I think quite a number of people would agree with me that the premises at Coláist Bríde would be even more commodious than the excellent school provided at Gortahork.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £360,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for Secondary Education, including the Teachers' Salaries Grant, Capitation Grant, Incremental Salary to Secondary Teachers and Grant to the Secondary Teachers' Pension Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>  This is required to meet the cost of increases in the incremental salaries <Col N="1380" /> for recognised secondary teachers which were accorded with effect from 31st November, 1961, and which arose from the implementation of the report of the Arbitration Board for Secondary Teachers which met on 23rd of February and 2nd March, 1962, and whose findings were approved by the Government.  The extra provision required in subhead B.1 for 1962-63 as a result of the payment of these increases alone is estimated at £360,000.  It is not anticipated that there will be any appreciable net savings in other subheads of the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>These additional sums are required for increased salaries voted throughout the year and we have, of course, no objection to them.  On the question of salary, I cannot understand why the Government will not recognise the teaching service of secondary teachers who have to teach in the Six Counties for a number of years, pending the procuring of appointments here.  That is something the Minister should do.  I know teaching service in certain other countries is recognised when it comes to calculating incremental and pension rights.  I do not see why teachers who have been compelled to teach in the Six Counties&mdash;a part of this country&mdash; for a number of years before they get permanent appointments here should not have those years considered for incremental and pension purposes.  It may be that the Minister has some scheme whereby he will give this recognition.  If he has, I would certainly welcome it.</P>

      <P>I hope I am relevant in raising this.  It is in regard to a communication we received from the Minister at Cork County Council regarding the council's recommendations in relation to scholarships.  The Minister's reply included an allegation that Cork County Council was remiss in the amount it was voting in its estimates for the provision of such scholarships.  He referred to the fact that it was the lowest in the country. This was an entirely unfair suggestion in as much as the income from the levy of a certain amount of money in the £ in Cork is capable of bringing in much more than in many other <Col N="1381" /> counties.  I saw the Minister casting his eyes behind him to see how many Cork Deputies were there, but the 2.20 p.m. train has relieved him of the support I would get from Deputy MacCarthy, Deputy Corry and others who objected as strongly as I did to the fact that this was set before us as a stigma on the efforts of the county council in regard to the provision of scholarships for secondary education.</P>

      <P>I was in correspondence with the Department in the recent past about the payment of some pensions to secondary teachers which were still outstanding.  I wonder has that matter been resolved?  I think there was some award made of an increase to secondary teachers and that there has been some delay in its payment.  Some of these are very elderly people.  If they do not get their payment soon, some of them may have been called to their reward before they get it.  In any event, having elderly people waiting in uncertainty for the actual award of what they believe to be their due is not a happy situation.</P>

      <P>The question of the recognition of teaching service has been brought up very often.  In answer to a Parliamentary Question recently, I said I hoped to be able to do something about the matter of teaching experience in the North.  I still have those hopes.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £102,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for Payments under the Vocational Education Acts, 1930 to 1953 (No. 29 of 1930; No. 50 of 1936; No. 9 of 1944; No. 1 of 1947; No. 33 of 1950; and No. 37 of 1953), and for other purposes connected with Technical Instruction and Continuation Education.</P>
      <P>  The need for this Supplementary Estimate of £102,000 arises mainly from the introduction of improved salary scales for full-time officers of the vocational education service as from 1st November, 1961, as part of the eighth round increase.  The extra payment to vocational education committees in respect of the period 1st November, 1961 to 31st March 1963 in connection with such increased salaries is about £99,000.  A further £3,000 is necessary to meet an anticipated deficit due to casual variation in the original provision in the subhead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this Estimate, which also is for an increase in salaries.  However, there is one point I should like to mention.  It is the employment, or rather the non-employment, of married vocational teachers.  A very high percentage of vocational teachers are engaged in teaching domestic economy. I do not think we have a single male domestic economy teacher.  These young ladies are qualified and trained at considerable expense to the State. They are then sent down the country <Col N="1383" /> to teach domestic economy.  Just when they have gained a little experience, they marry and are completely lost to the profession.  They are no longer employed.  That is very wrong.</P>
      <P>I have in mind a particular lady&mdash;an excellent teacher&mdash;who taught for years in County Dublin.  Then she married and took up residence in my county of Donegal.  She could no longer get regular employment with any vocational education authority in the State.  But four miles from her residence she is now fully employed by the Six County Government as a vocational teacher.  They are delighted to have her.</P>
      <P>We tried this out some years ago when we would not employ married primary teachers even in a temporary capacity, but we found that was not a success.  We are now re-employing primary teachers.  Why can we not do that in the vocational schools, particularly when a high proportion of these teachers are females engaged on domestic economy&mdash;a subject in which experience is much more valuable than all the knowledge acquired in a domestic economy training school.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister not to throw these married women out, but re-employ them just as he has rightly done in the case of the primary teachers.  It would be to the advantage of the students, the profession and the country generally.  We would bear in mind that vocational education is one branch of education in which we have been lagging behind.  We had not the schools, but we are getting on with that now. We are now lagging behind because we have not got the teachers.  The number of students we can take into the training colleges is limited.  If we are to progress with the building programme, we must also progress with the teaching programme.  We should re-employ these people, be it in commercial classes or domestic economy classes.  I appeal to the Minister seriously to consider that point.  If he does he will have the blessings of the vocational education committees and of the parents of pupils throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider a problem with <Col N="1384" /> which many vocational education committees are confronted, that is, trying to get competent teachers, having regard to the salaries offered, it has been the experience of the Dublin Vocational Education Committee that they have had to forget about the best man because of the salary scale existing.  When we are thinking of vocational education, we must have regard to getting the best man obtainable.  Recently in Dublin there was a problem in relation to chef instructors.  There were a number of applicants but they were dissuaded from going any further with their application because of the salary offered.  We cannot induce the best man away from private employment if he is to be offered less than the salary obtainable under private enterprise.  It often happens that we have to make do with people who cannot be described as the best available.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this position which not only applies to chef instructors but to other instructors.  Even if you take the final scale, it is not sufficient to attract people.  Take the case of a woodwork instructor.  The salary scale offered is less than that for the foreman standard which you require. These are matters which should be gone into carefully, particularly now that we are stressing the importance of technical education.</P>

      <P>This £500 is for the transportation of five old coaches belonging to the Marquis of Sligo, or <Col N="1390" /> someone like that.  Remember, while we make this provision, certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party are advocating the pulling down of monuments, monuments which are equally precious from an artistic point of view. Periodically, some of them talk about pulling down Nelson Pillar.  If pulling it down costs as much as transporting five old coaches from Sligo to Dublin, then it would be much better to leave it there forever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on subhead C.7, the increase in the grant-in-aid to the Irish Academy of Music.  Music is the greatest of the arts and anything that can be done to foster appreciation for and love of it is worthy of the most serious consideration.  Music, painting and sculpture are the very essence of civilisation.  They are the lasting products of human genius.  A nation, whether it likes it or not, will never reach its true stature, unless everything possible is done to spread knowledge of and affection for the arts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>Music is the most universal of the arts.  It is heard in some shape or form by almost everybody <Col N="1391" /> every day, in the office, the factory, the workshop and the home, on the streets and in the bus.  Most of it is the canned stuff poured out in a daily stream from Tin Pan Alley.  The purveyors of this pop music need no subsidisation.  Fortunes are made out of it because it caters for those who demand music that can be listened to with the minimum of effort.  The schools and academies which cater for the type of music that lasts, the type of music that has been enjoyed by generation after generation down through the centuries, are fighting an uphill battle.  They will not survive unless they are subsidised in one form or another.  If these schools and academies are to make themselves attractive to the greatest number, they must keep their fees as low as possible. They cannot relate their fees to their running expenses.  If they do so, they will render themselves inaccessible to hundreds of prospective pupils.</P>
      <P>Music, and the teaching of it, is not a luxury to be left to the few who really love it and wish to spread knowledge and appreciation of it.  It is a form of culture we cannot afford to ignore if we are sincere in our ambition to make Ireland respected and honoured the world over.  The only fault I have to find with this Supplementary Estimate is that it is too small, but the Minister is to be congratulated on his efforts to help the Royal Irish Academy of Music in achieving its objective. There are many calls on the national purse.  No doubt the Academy will be grateful for this increase in the grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Academy, with commendable courage, spent many thousands of pounds in recent years in the reconstruction and decoration of the building. It is a very beautiful building actually, as anyone who visits it knows. It could well be a national showpiece. Anything given towards the teaching, preservation and greater appreciation of music is money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly endorse what Deputy Cummins has said and I think he presents to the House a facet of this problem which only too frequently escapes us.  Institutions like the <Col N="1392" /> Royal Irish Academy of Music sometimes do not realise the volume of goodwill that exists in the Oireachtas for their work.  Perhaps that is our fault if we do not sufficiently often give expression to our appreciation of the work they do.  I often think that these learned bodies sometimes labour unnecessarily under heavy handicaps because they do not make their very modest needs more generally known. I am interested to hear Deputy Cummins speak of the unequal battle proceeding between Ludwig von Beethoven and Fats Waller.  I have the kind of feeling that, in the long run, Beethoven will come out on top. I do not altogether agree with Deputy Cummins when he says the pop music of Tin Pan Alley is easy to listen to. I find it quite an ordeal.  Though it is not infrequently imposed upon me by the younger generation, it not infrequently places a considerable strain on domestic peace in order that the younger generation should have free access to what pleases its ear, as I claim to have to Verdi, Puccini and even to Bellini, for to so oldfashioned a theme I plead guilty to having a lingering regard.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cummins but not for the reason he gave.  He would seem to suggest that classical music is fighting a losing battle with jazz.  I do not think it is.  I think it is perhaps a mistake to suggest there is that antithesis between the two because probably our grandchildren will find classical qualities in what sounds to us today cacaphonic, if that is the correct word.  However, it is true that tastes change and appreciations develop.</P>
      <P>I think there is already emerging a certain classical element, even in jazz, to which perhaps my ear and even so young and fresh an ear as that of Deputy Cummins have not yet fully adjusted themselves.  I rather imagine he would find in the Royal Irish Academy of Music a full understanding and appreciation of new forms of music on which I have no doubt the Royal Irish Academy of Music will not turn their back or ignore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the Minister especially to an aspect of this problem to which the observations of <Col N="1393" /> Deputy Cummins call to mind.  I think it is true that these learned bodies sometimes are too backward in making their needs known.  Ministers so rarely encounter outside bodies dependent on public funds who are other than clamorous that they rather tend to assume that any body which is not perenially beating at their doors must be getting enough and that if it were not getting enough it would shout about it.  The plain fact is that there are some venerable institutions in this country doing very valuable work, like the Royal Irish Academy of Music or like the Royal Irish Academy itself, who have inherited an old tradition of self-restraint and who feel that if the grant is somewhat larger than it used to be they have a very grave obligation to restrict their activity so that they can bring it within the amount of the present grant that they are receiving. These people are not intimately in touch with the changing value of money and with considerations of that kind.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, exercising the most scrupulous discretion, he has an obligation as Minister for Education to distinguish between the kinds of bodies who would make their needs known to him very fully and those which would allow their work to be retarded through a reluctance to urge a need for extra money.  I think it is true to say that at the present moment the Royal Irish Academy Irish-English Dictionary is held up for the want of quite a trivial sum.  I think one letter is prepared for the printer but has been left aside because they have not got the money to make the appropriate contract with the printer to get the letter printed. I have very little doubt that if the council of the Academy came to the Minister for Education and said, for instance: &ldquo;We require authority to commit ourselves to the tune of another £5,000 to permit the printer to proceed with the work that is completed and ready for printing&rdquo; the Minister would say: &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo; However, they have a traditional reluctance, when they feel that the grant provided by the Minister is generous, to ask for more.  I am suggesting that where we are dealing with bodies such as the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the Royal Irish <Col N="1394" /> Academy, and certain other conservative and scrupulous bodies of that kind, the Minister has an obligation from time to time to query them as to whether their work is proceeding satisfactorily and as to whether any important work is being held up through financial difficulty.</P>
    <P>It may be that occassions will arise when the Minister will be obliged to say: &ldquo;We shall have to wait to get that done.&rdquo;  I think that not infrequently he will find that by the provision of a very modest sum, important work could be pressed forward and, in fact, that people are laying work aside, and that important work is being delayed, for financial considerations which experienced financial administrators recognise as being quite inadequate to justify the delay.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to say is not difficult to express.  I seek to pay a tribute to their high-minded reluctance to constitute themselves a charge on the public funds but they sometimes carry that too far.  It is so rare and precious a quality that I would not wish to see them changed but I think it puts a corresponding obligation on the Minister for Education&mdash;instead of barring and bolting the door as most Ministers have to do against people looking for additional grants&mdash;in the case of these bodies to inquire of them from time to time: &ldquo;How is your work getting on?  Is it being held up through shortage of money? If it is being held up, let me know what you want and I shall see if we can find it in order to permit of the kind of work you are doing proceeding without interruption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose I have a certain sympathy with the Minister in his difficulty with regard to subhead A (3).  He says he has not access to the Museum now. Possibly he has somewhere in his brief some further details.  It is an embarrassment to us all when the subhead is produced and when we ask for further particulars if we find the Minister is without the detailed information which the House is entitled to have if we seek it.  Perhaps a further perusal of the material available to the Minister would enable him to give us a more detailed explanation of subhead A (3) when he comes to conclude.</P>

      <P>I accept a certain responsibility in regard to these reluctant bodies.  They are not altogether isolated from me and we have some contact.  I do intend that the Royal Irish Academy will have an increase in their grant this year, not in this Estimate but in the main Estimate.  As far as the dictionary is concerend, I am informed that they will not need money this year but will probably need it next year, in 1964-65.</P>

I am sorry I had not the detailed information required by the House; I do not often transport six coaches from Sligo to Dublin.  I think it was the fragile nature of the coaches which made it necessary to take particular care.  I have the information from the Museum that they are six specimen coaches of the last century which were presented to the Museum by Mr. Donal O'Hara of Annaghmore, County Sligo, who housed them locally at his own expense because there was no accommodation for them in the Museum.</P>
      <P>We have generally decided to have the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham used for Museum purposes and it is desirable that as many specimens as possible representative of the life of the people should be collected there in the form of a folk museum.  This is a desirable venture.  They had to be transported from Sligo to Dublin and being very fragile the vehicles had to be dismantled, packed and brought to Dublin by CIE trailers travelling at a very slow speed, five to ten miles an hour, and there had to be a crew of three for each trailer.  Therefore, all the costs of getting them to Dublin safe and sound and intact went up.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £33,500 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>  The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to make available to the Land Commission in the current financial year an additional net sum of £33,500 for expenditure under three headings, viz. (a) purchase of interests for cash and payment of auctioneers' <Col N="1398" /> commission (b) essential improvements works arising from land settlement operations and (c) preservation and improvement of game resources.  I shall outline to the House the reasons necessitating the extra expenditure under each of the subheads concerned.</P>
    <P>Under subhead G in this year's Vote for Lands, a total of £145,000 was provided for two distinct items: (i) £140,000 under Subhead G.1 to meet the cost of lands purchased for cash in the open market or by private treaty under Section 27, Land Act, 1950, and (ii) £5,000 under Subhead G.2 in respect of compensation, also payable in cash, on the resumption of tenancy interests on estates of the former Congested Districts Board.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, activities under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, are confined to lands required for the creation of holdings for migrants or to facilitate rearrangement of intermixed holdings.  It will be recalled that the sum of £140,000 made available for this purpose in the Main Estimate this year constituted a record provision, in line with the continued expansion in the volume of funds provided for cash purchases in recent years.  Properties suitable for the purposes of Section 27 come on the market continually and it is most desirable that the Land Commission should have sufficient funds to enable them to negotiate for purchase of such lands within the limited time normally available.  Up to a recent date, expenditure on cash purchases in the current financial year amounted to £125,875, while further amounts aggregating £35,845 were committed for expenditure.  To finance completed purchases falling due for payment in the remainder of the year and to ensure that properties for which purchase negotiations are in train can be brought to the possession stage by March 31st next, an additional sum of £35,000 will be necessary, thus bringing the total provision for the current year in respect of purchases under Section 27 to £175,000, that is almost as much money as spent in the entire first ten years of the operation of this form of transaction.</P>
    <P>For the purchase, through resumption, of tenancy interests in holdings <Col N="1399" /> required for division on the small outstanding residue of estates of the late Congested Districts Board, £5,000 was provided under Subhead G.2 of the main Estimate.  While this amount, which has remained at the same level for some years, would be quite sufficient to finance the limited number of cases normally arising under this heading, the position this year is that the Land Commission have succeeded in purchasing two exceptionally large holdings in County Galway at an aggregate cost of some £25,000.  As the original amount voted is required to meet the land intake from smaller properties on CDB estates, an additional sum of £25,000 is now necessary under Subhead G.2.  I may say, however, that the unexpected intake of the two extensive holdings referred to, aggregating about 680 acres, was very welcome indeed and will make a significant contribution towards the pool of land available for relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>So far I have explained £60,000 of the part of the gross Supplementary Estimate applicable to Subhead G. The residual £1,000 now sought under this subhead is partly in the nature of a new item, viz., payment of auctioneers' commission in certain land purchase transactions.  Deputies will already be aware that the Land Commission pay auctioneers' fees in appropriate cash purchase transactions under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950.  I have long felt that an extension of this principle to certain properties purchased on a voluntary basis for land bonds, would serve as a decided incentive to inducing auctioneers to bring to the notice of the Land Commission lands on their books which would be suitable for the purposes of the Land Acts.  Moreover, by securing the increased goodwill of the auctioneering profession, it would, I feel, result in an acceleration of the land acquisition programme by speeding up purchase negotiations, thereby permitting a valuable saving in time and public funds.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, not long ago a complaint was voiced in this House that lands entrusted to auctioneers for disposal were not being brought to the <Col N="1400" /> notice of the Land Commission because the auctioneers could not expect to receive their fees with the Land Commission as purchaser. Deputies may recall my announcement some time ago to the effect that the Minister for Finance had agreed in principle to my proposals for payment of auctioneers' commission in these bonds cases.  Provision has been made accordingly in this Supplementary Estimate &mdash; the amount required to meet payments in the remaining weeks of this financial year being estimated at £1,000.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Subhead I which carries the general description of improvement of estates.  Improvement works, which are an inseparable feature of land settlement, include the erection of dwelling-houses and out-offices; the provision of access roads, fencing and drainage; repair and maintenance of embankments, and so on.</P>
    <P>The total amount provided under Subhead I in the main Estimate was £690,000.  An additional £35,000 is now required under the Subhead due to a number of factors.  This year, heavy and unforeseen expenditure was necessary on the repair of embankments damaged by severe storms.  In addition, an improvement in design of Land Commission dwelling-houses has resulted in increased costs while an increase in workmen's wages, effective from 1st April last, had also to be met.</P>
    <P>At the end of February, expenditure under Subhead I amounted to £650,000, leaving a balance of only £40,000 available for expenditure in March.  It will be appreciated, however, that the final month of the financial year sees the annual climax of the land settlement programme. Land allotment, which has been gathering momentum in the preceding months, reaches peak level at this time, and side by side with this activity the drive to complete essential improvement works on these lands in time for spring farming operations must be intensified to the utmost.  To ensure that there will be no falling off in the level of improvement works arising from the current year's land division and rearrangement programme, an <Col N="1401" /> additional sum of £35,000 is necessary.</P>
    <P>The final item in the Supplementary Estimate concerns Subhead L, under which grants for preservation and improvement of game resources, are provided.  Perhaps I should remind the House that these grants are confined to efficient local organisations which are representative of all appropriate interests and that they are made, from the funds available, to assist schemes which hold out promise of worthwhile practical results. In the main, the schemes embrace proposals for destruction of predators on game birds&mdash;apart from the fox menace&mdash; and for the breeding and laying down of game to augment wild stocks.</P>
    <P>A sum of £10,000 was provided in the main Estimate this year.  The first charge on this sum, however, consisted of grants totalling some £2,170 carried over from last year leaving a balance of £7,830.  Despite the difficulties which confronted Game Councils as a result of the prolonged and abnormally severe winter, the level of their activities has been greater than anticipated. Indeed, not only has the remaining £7,830 under Subhead I been fully committed but it is expected that an additional sum of £3,000 will be necessary to meet grants to Game Councils falling due for payment within the current financial year.  I should like here to pay tribute to the work of these bodies and to say how gratified I am that the financial assistance provided through my Department is contributing to the success of their activities.</P>
    <P>The gross total of the Supplementary Estimate, as outlined, thus amounts to £99,000.  However, an increase of £26,500 is expected in the appropriations-in-aid of the Lands Vote this year while it is anticipated that savings amounting to £39,000 will be feasible under other subheads, that is, a total of £65,500.  The actual net amount which the House is now asked to provide, therefore, is £33,500.</P>
    <P>In presenting this Supplementary Estimate, I have confined my remarks to the subheads directly affected.  If Deputies require any further information regarding them, I shall be pleased to furnish it.  I have purposely refrained from commenting on policy matters <Col N="1402" /> generally which can be more appropriately dealt with on the main Estimate or in connection with the forthcoming Land Bill which, as already intimated, I hope to introduce in this session.</P>
    <P>The relatively small amount now sought will be utilised, in the main, to enable the work of land settlement for the current year to be completed.  I know that Deputies, and especially those who represent rural constituencies, will be fully aware of the importance of this work.  I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House with confidence.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's statement to the effect that during the next session, or at the end of the present session, the House will be given an opportunity of discussing the Land Bill is welcome. On that Bill, we can deal very fully with all aspects of Land Commission policy.  Therefore, we have no objection to this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary as a matter of special urgency to statements that have recently appeared in the public Press to the effect that there was growing concern and anxiety in the country in regard to the purchase of land by aliens, and particularly by Germans.  Some time ago we on this side of the House appealed to the Minister to direct the attention of the Land Commission to the importance of purchasing land which, to our knowledge, and to the knowledge of the general public, is being purchased by aliens.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary whether in fact there has been any check-up in the Land Commission since the main Estimate was presented to the House, and whether there is any basis for the growing concern in the country in regard to the purchase of land by Germans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to place on record that we on this side of the House strenuously and strongly object to the land being purchased by Germans, or by any aliens, because we have a large number of small and uneconomic holders in the country.  In addition, we have had the experience of farmers' sons having to <Col N="1403" /> emigrate and seek their livelihood beyond the Irish sea.  No responsible Irish Government should stand idly by and see the best agricultural land, land that should be in the possession of our small farmers/em/</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the Parliamentary Secretary will avail of this opportunity to ease our minds in relation to the activities of the Land Commission.  I trust he will see fit to make some references to the matter of the prompt acquisition of land in view of its urgency.  He referred in the course of his speech to the payment of auctioneers' fees.  This is something which should have been provided many years ago and I am glad we have at last reached the stage where the Land Commission, because they will be able to pay these fees, can look for the full co-operation of auctioneers throughout the country.  That co-operation is vitally necessary because auctioneers have an intimate knowledge of when and where lands become available on the public market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not act here as spokesman for the auctioneers but I know they are deeply grateful for this departure by the Minister for Lands.  I can assure him that he can look for a marked improvement in co-operation between the auctioneers and the Land Commission in the future.  I know that the auctioneers have on their books a considerable amount of estates in all areas which, if purchased by the Land <Col N="1404" /> Commission, would contribute in no small way towards solving congestion in many parts of rural Ireland.  The auctioneers, as a body, are patriotic men and they will be only too glad to assist in this work of national importance.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the availability of grants in connection with the preservation of our game stocks. The regional game councils do very valuable work but much of it is hampered by lack of finance.  The national importance of their work is recognised generally and I do not think the Minister should be slow in encouraging them.  The Department of Lands should also concern itself more closely with the maintenance and improvement of our game farms. These farms do marvellous work in providing stocks for the future but they need financial assistance.  Their work is mainly concerned with the provision of consignments of eggs and birds throughout the country, including the Six Counties from which they get unlimited requests for supplies, but they cannot be expected to do their work properly and get the best results without financial assistance from the Exchequer.  Most of their equipment, particularly the installation of modern heating apparatus which has to be imported, is expensive, and I would ask the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to do everything possible to help them by way of financial support.</P>
    <P>A sum of £17,000 has been provided towards building work and improvements and that amount appears to me, in present circumstances, to be very small.  I take it that is additional to what was already provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The total was £600,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Commission have decided to improve the architectural structure of their houses because the old Land Commission house was considered generally to be rather drab.  Now this move for more attractive design will be very welcome.  I do not know whether Deputies or even the Parliamentary Secretary himself have seen the new houses but some of them I have seen <Col N="1405" /> in the Shannon Valley are really first class.  I would say, from my experience of building that the houses built by the Land Commission in Castletown, Laois, are the best type of house being built in Ireland to-day.  I give the Land Commission full credit for that.  I am glad to see that they have departed from the drabness of the old type of Land Commission house.</P>
      <P>The new up-to-date design of the Land Commission houses is something to be welcomed and encouraged and no matter what money would be provided from this Estimate for that type of house it would be generally welcomed. I am glad to be able to pay tribute to whoever is responsible for the design of those houses which people travelling from the south to Dublin frequently stop to admire. Deputies who pass down through that part of the country would be well advised to have a look at them.  The tenants are friendly and generous people and they would give permission to view the insides.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to this Supplementary Estimate beyond one comment. We can see here the impact of Government policy with regard to the increase in the contributions for social welfare.  That impact is now making itself felt in various State Departments. The Government seems to be determined to keep piling on taxation and expenditure in every possible way.  We on this side of the House have already criticised the unnecessary increases in social welfare contributions and we are now being called on to provide more of the taxpayers' money for funds in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>I presume the Minister will introduce the new Land Bill before the next Estimate but I hope there will be a general stocktaking of all the activities of the Land Commission on that occasion.  The Department is a very important one and the resettlement of our people in homes on the land and the provision of additional holdings and the rearrangement of existing ones is of great importance to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Flanagan's constructive contribution to the debate and I can assure him that <Col N="1406" /> the new Land Bill will be a progressive measure designed to meet some of the constructive criticisms addressed by many people over the years to the matter of land settlement.  It will also incorporate many of the points raised in the Small Farms Report which was generally welcomed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan raised the question of acquisition of land by foreigners. This is a matter which I feel is grossly exaggerated.  We keep a very close eye on that situation and the Land Commission have interested themselves very positively in such estates which come on the market. Since 1st August, 1961, when we introduced a 25 per cent stamp duty on lands purchased by aliens, we have been able to keep a particularly close eye on the matter.  The total amount of land acquired by aliens in the 18 months since we imposed that stamp duty is 9,000 acres or 6,000 acres a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a lot of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a lot of land having regard to the tremendous interest shown in land in this country by foreigners.  That is a very small figure when taken in relation to the amount of interest which has been shown.  The public may be getting the impression, on account of the interest shown, that all that land is going to foreigners.  That is not the case. Each application by an alien to purchase land must go through channels and we can keep an eye on it.  A large proportion of that 6,000 acres is land which would not be suitable for Land Commission purposes.  It is not arable land suitable for division and is largely land bought for its amenities or for its tourist or other value.  We are satisfied that this matter has been exaggerated to a considerable extent and we feel that we can control it all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also made a point in regard to game development and I agree with him on the important work at present being engaged in by these game councils.  The whole development of game in the future can go ahead on the basis of fruitful co-operation between the game councils on the local <Col N="1407" /> level and the Department itself at national level.  We feel that any moves in the future towards regional game councils and national game councils must come from the game councils at local level.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of the money being spent on game development comes from the State.  We contribute 60 per cent of the cost of these schemes and the local councils bear the remaining 40 per cent.  The amount spent so far this year on game development is £7,450 and there is an additional £3,000 to that in the present year so that an addition of almost 50 per cent of the amount originally voted is being added to ensure that game development will go ahead.  We hope the same will happen in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Game farms are included in the overall game development schemes and they also get assistance in conjunction with the game councils.  The suggestion made by Deputy Flanagan in that respect will be borne in mind.  The whole development of game councils in the past few years has been very helpful.</P>
    <P>There is very little else to be said on this matter except on one point, that is, the increased expenditure which we see in these Supplementary Estimates.  We can defend this increased expenditure up to the hilt as being necessary for essential works.  Even though we may be criticised for the increased expenditure, this sort of expenditure, in the detail set out, can be defended on every ground that is necessary&mdash;neccessary improvement work, improved design of Land Commission houses, necessary improvement grants for development schemes and so on.  Deputies may be assured that the increased expenditure is necessary for the maintenance and improvement of the very valuable work being done by that Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £133,000 be granted to <Col N="1408" /> defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other Services administered by that Office, and for payment of Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is mainly required to meet the costs of&mdash; (a) increases in remuneration or improvements in conditions granted since the original Estimate was framed; (b) improvements in services; and (c) increased telephone development.</P>
    <P>Taking the subheads in order and giving the main reasons for the excesses, the sum of £132,700 required under Subhead A is for additional costs arising out of certain increases in remuneration which were granted during the year and an Arbitration award, during the year, of a shorter working week to postmen.  On Subhead B, £21,000 is required to meet the costs of additional travelling by engineering staff to deal with an expanded programme for telephone trunk line construction and of higher subsistence rates generally.  On Subhead C, £16,700 is required to meet additional costs arising from the renting of transatlantic telecommunication circuits.  On Subhead D, £40,700 is needed to provide for an additional night air mail service to Great Britain, for higher rail and road conveyance costs, and for increased payments for sea conveyance from Irish ports.  On Subhead F, £116,600 is required to meet the cost of replenishing stocks of cables and related stores as a result of the expanded programme for telephone trunk line construction.</P>
    <P>Subhead K is being restored to provide £1,300 for the cost of the salaries of certain civil servants whose formal transfer to the Broadcasting Authority was not completed, contrary to expectations, until this year.  The amount has been recovered from the Authority.</P>
    <P>The gross excess of £329,000 on the foregoing subheads is expected to be offset by additional appropriations in aid under Subhead T, amounting to £196,000.  The main increase is in <Col N="1409" /> respect of an additional recovery of £175,000 from Telephone Capital funds as a consequence of the expanded development programme.  Higher staff costs will result in greater recoveries for expenses incurred on work for the Savings Bank and Social Insurance Funds and there are also some repayments from Radio Éireann for staff on loan.  These additional receipts will be partly offset by deficiencies in other appropriations in aid.</P>
    <P>In all, the net excess is of the order of 1 per cent on the original net provision of almost £13 millions.  The original Estimate was, as Deputies will appreciate, prepared at a time when many staff pay claims were in progress. In addition, the gross provisions under many subheads have been affected by the Telephone development programme, the provision for which this year is now £3,675,000 as compared with £2,500,000 last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this Supplementary Estimate and I have only a few words to say on a couple of points.  I notice the increase in the provision for Telephones from £2½ million to £3,675,000.  I do not think it is sufficient.  At the introduction of the Vote on Account it was stated that we were getting a very good return on capital invested in the telephone services.  If that is so the people using the service are not getting reasonable satisfaction.  Every Deputy is constantly writing to the Minister to get Telephones supplied to his constituents. The telephone is no longer a luxury but a necessity in business and agriculture.  The more people who get telephones, the more use is made of them and the more people that are anxious to get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the business is a paying proposition, the Minister should develop it further.  I notice the item for increase in remuneration and reduction in working hours.  I hope the telephone services have not been reduced by the shorter working week.  I hope the strength of staff is being maintained. Recently, I rang the exchange and the operator said: &ldquo;I will get it for you when I am able,&rdquo; giving the impression that she was in a rush but that if I would wait she would get the number. <Col N="1410" /> That is not the kind of service that should be given and I ask the Minister to look into that and try to develop the service as we would like to see it developed.  I am sure there are at present 10,000 applicants and even at the present rate of installation the number will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to get the present dispute between the journalists and the Radio Éireann authorities ended as soon as possible.  We are living in 1963, not 1913, and it is not nice to see a dispute between a Government Department and any section of its employees left in abeyance for a fortnight without a genuine effort being made to settle it.  In former days that would be all right.  Employers left workers out. Each side wanted a victory.  That day has gone and we all realise that when people apply for an increase, rather than advertise the conditions and salaries applying to journalists in the city of Dublin and compare them with Radio Éireann, as against the BBC in Belfast, I think it is up to the Minister to use his good influence.  I sincerely appeal to him to do so, so as to bring this dispute to a close.  The people have paid licence fees for a radio and television.  Therefore, I ask the Minister feel that the news service is one of the most valuable either on radio or television.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to try to bring the matter to a solution as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Crotty in his appeal to the Minister in respect of a better telephone service and I would ask him to give special attention to the outlying areas of Dublin where there is a marked absence in telephones and where they are badly needed particularly in the evening and at night.  It often happens that residents who have no telephones in their houses must travel long distances before finding a telephone and perhaps their calls may be urgent if they require a doctor or something of that kind.  There is a section of Finglas &mdash;I am talking in terms of the distance from a telephone&mdash;which is completely cut off.  A case came to my notice recently of a male nurse who is dependent on receiving and answering calls <Col N="1411" /> and he finds it very difficult to cope with the demand on his services because of the absence of either a public telephone or a telephone in his house.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy Crotty in the appeal he made to the Minister to use his good offices in an attempt to bring this unfortunate dispute in Telefís Éireann to an end.  It is unfortunate that it occurred.  Perhaps if efforts had been made beforehand on the Ministerial level it would not have occurred.  There is nothing wrong in any organisation seeking recognition in this modern age.  It is not seeking too much.  If it comes to a matter of having somebody intervene it is imperative that we do not appear to be taking sides.  It is rather noticeable that while the Labour Court have intervened and are now considering their findings we have attacks being made &mdash;that is how you could describe them &mdash;on the journalists by Telefís Éireann. That could be regarded as intimidation and an encouragement to the Labour Court to give an unfavourable decision. I hope that the Minister will appeal to Radio Éireann to deal with the journalists' organisation in a modern way.  Employers and employees have now reached the stage of sitting down and talking about the problems in dispute and the dispute in Telefís Éireann can only be settled by that means.  It will certainly not be settled by one side continuing its attacks on the other.</P>

      <P>I shall only take three minutes.  I want to raise only two points.  Recently I was endeavouring to deal with certain business between Cork and London and I was amazed and appalled to find that there was no method of sending an express letter to London from Cork direct.  It had to come up to Dublin and go from Dublin to London and in consequence the delay was quite what it must have been in the old coaching days.  I was in London myself at the time. <Col N="1412" /> Endeavours were made to get the postal authority in Cork to send the letter by express by the Cork-London Aer Lingus plane, but that is apparently forbidden.  It must be sent from Cork to Dublin and from Dublin to London.  In consequence, the delay is not only unnecessary, but one of the advantages of having the direct air link is completely lost.  I am surprised indeed that no Cork Deputy has raised this matter before a Kildare Deputy had to raise it on their behalf.</P>

      <P>The Deputies represent the whole of Cork; the chamber of commerce represent only their aspect of it.  In my constituency, as the Minister knows, the telephone service is appalling at present.  Frankly, I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister and his engineering staff.  I appreciate that much of the trouble is technical trouble and that it is the worst sort of technical trouble&mdash;intermittent trouble.  If you have a fault all the time, it is usually easy to find it; but when you have an intermittent fault, it has the nasty effect of being perfectly all right when you check it, but perfectly all wrong as soon as the checker has turned his back.  Something must be done, and done radically, to mend the position.  Whatever it is, I am not a technician and I do not know.</P>

    <P>Apart from the technical hitches that regularly arise, I am bound to say that the service offered in the Kildare automatic exchanges on Sundays leaves everything to be desired.  The Minister is aware it is my personal experience very often, if I want a number not on the automatic, I have to dial for up to 20 minutes before I can get the Dublin exchange to answer.  On Sundays, dialling &ldquo;10&rdquo; does not ring in Naas, Droichead Nua or anywhere else but is routed through Dublin.  As I say, I have frequently had to wait a long period or to abandon altogether any hope of getting &ldquo;10&rdquo; to answer on Sundays.  I notice the same thing sometimes occurs at night.  I do not know whether this is due to a mechanical fault in the installations in Kildare or whether the staffing of the switch <Col N="1413" /> boards for trunk lines when country areas are put through is insufficient. I am told that people in the Maynooth area have the same difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate, and I think he will accept, that this is most aggravating and prevents the proper use of the system.  The machines&mdash;if that is the correct word to use&mdash;that have been obtained for the automatic exchanges in Kildare have been submitted by first-class firms.  Whether they are not suited to the Irish temperament or the Irish climate, or whatever it is, they do not seem to work at present.  I sincerely hope the Minister will be able to assure us in my constituency that we may expect a better telephone service in the future than we have been obtained recently.</P>

      <P>Deputy Crotty, Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Mullen raised the question of improving the telephone service.  There is so much to be done in telephone development that when I came into this office, I found it very difficult to know where to start.  I made a decision, which I conveyed to the Engineering Branch, that it was absolutely necessary to strengthen the network generally so far as trunk cabling is concerned before we could seriously attempt to deal with the number of applications coming in.  Otherwise, we would not have an efficient service at all.  We would have an overburdened network incapable of dealing with the calls put upon it.</P>
      <P>Last year, I dealt with the financial provisions we undertook in 1960 for the further development and extension of the telephone service by the provision of £10 million.  We expected to spend it at the rate of £2 million a year.  By the end of 1960-61, it was found the amount of money would have to be increased yearly.  That £10 million is now exhausted.  I shall have to come soon to the House with a new Telephone Capital Bill to provide further moneys for the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money is not the only problem, either.  You have to provide engineers and a properly trained working force to deal with the technical task of installing telephones and doing the <Col N="1414" /> necessary line work.  We have been increasing the staff since 1960 and we will increase it further in future to deal with this problem of providing the country with an efficient and adequate telephone service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crotty mentioned the number of people who are waiting for telephones.  I know there are people waiting.  I listened to Deputy Sherwin to-day talking about the waiting list for houses in the Dublin Corporation area.  This is much the same class of business.  As soon as an application comes in, the person's name is entered on the waiting list.  The only people we cannot supply with a telephone within a reasonable time are those people who are a long distance from the exchange, because of the capital involved in giving such a person a phone and the delay it would cause to the Engineering Branch.  I decided that it would be better for the Engineering Branch, when they are clearing an area, to clear even the recent applications, provided the applicants lived within a reasonable distance from the exchange, that it would not be reasonable to exclude such people, and that they should be included rather than have them wait longer for the second clearance when we would come to deal with what are known as &ldquo;long lines&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Every effort is made by the Department to give an efficient service and there is a constant watch in exchanges especially in Dublin, in relation to the length of time it takes to answer a call when the exchange is called on 10 or any other call.  It is impossible in an organisation such as this to deal with all the individual complaints that come in.  It is almost an impossibility to make certain that every instrument in the telephone service is in perfect order on any particular day.  Generally speaking, people who work in the exchange are courteous and give an efficient service.  They do everything they possibly can to assist a subscriber. However, instances do occur, though infrequently of discourtesy by operators towards telephone callers.  In any case brought to my notice where persons are discourteous, or not giving an efficient service, or will not help the subscriber asking for facilities in a phone connection or otherwise, I shall <Col N="1415" /> have no hesitation in taking appropriate disciplinary action against the offenders. I can do no more than that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen raised the question of the city of Dublin. It is a fact that there are areas in the city, especially on the perimeter, where cables are not laid to provide a telephone service in new areas.  The areas mainly affected are Ballsbridge, Clontarf, Dún Laoghaire, Crumlin, Terenure, Dolphin's Barn, Templeogue and Whitehall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been pressing for this to be attended to since I became Minister.  We are taking steps with additional staff and an effort is being made to permit large-scale clearance of these centres.  There are also deferred applications in Finglas and the north city and new exchanges are planned for these areas.  Until that is done, we will not be in a position to do anything with the waiting applicants.  We will see that the matter is put in hands as soon as we possibly can.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman raised the question of difficulties that have arisen in a new automatic exchange in Kildare.  It is an unfortunate thing to happen but the Deputy knows my mind because I wrote to him and I also spoke to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Every effort is being made to come to a decision on this matter.  The company concerned is a reputable company and secured a very large contract from us.  When this trouble arose, we ceased operations on the other exchanges, which has put our programme out of gear.  As the Deputy knows, the firm concerned have sent over a team of their experts. Unfortunately I am not yet in a position to say what the outcome will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not fully satisfied. Even the vice-chairman of the company came to Ireland.  Certain adjustments had to be made in the <Col N="1416" /> equipment to suit our requirements. The equipment was tested in the country of origin and found to be correct and I presume in technical installations of this nature, faults can occur for various reasons.  I hope that the situation will be all right.  I will keep the Deputy informed and the Deputy will have ample opportunity in a short space of time to raise it on the main Estimate.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give particulars of agricultural employment, i.e. permanent farm employees over eighteen years, and farm tractors in County Dublin in (1) 1961 and (2) 1962, in each district electoral division included in the agricultural <Col N="1355" /> enumeration in either or both years, and the totals for each year.</P>

      <P>The following statement gives the particulars requested by the Deputy as returned in the enumeration books of each District Electoral Division or part of a District Electoral Division in Dublin situated outside the Dublin Metropolitan Garda District.  The method of enumeration employed is such that certain holdings may be enumerated in the returns for different DED's in different years according to the arrangements made between the Enumerators.  Consequently the figures for individual DED's are not necessarily comparable in successive years.</P>
