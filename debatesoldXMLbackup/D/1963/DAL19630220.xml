      <P>The only relevant information available to the Central Statistics Office is that collected at the quarterly inquiries for the calculation of the Consumer Price Index numbers.  The appropriate data for 1957 relate to 11 February and the most recent particulars are those for 12 November, 1962.  I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together and to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving (a) the national average retail prices at these dates for certain of the commodities requested and (b) the percentage change in the cost of the other items between the periods, in so far as they are available.  In the case of items, other than certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for the identical quality of the different articles in all areas and therefore any average prices computed would not be meaningful.  The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that, at each source, the identical article is priced at successive inquiries.  Particulars of the cost of radio licences, Health Act charges, motor insurance and wine are not included in the computation of the index numbers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the cost or estimated cost of the increased expenditure, if any, to date, incurred by local health authorities following the issue of his Department's circular of September, 1961, to the effect that persons not included in the General Medical Register may in certain very limited circumstances be entitled to free, or partially free, drugs and medicines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The information normally supplied to my Department by health authorities does not show separately the cost of drugs issued to persons benefiting from the arrangement to which the Deputy refers, and from preliminary enquiries I have made, I understand that many health authorities do not segregate the figures in their accounts.  I am, however, asking health authorities to furnish me in respect of the year 1962-63, the first complete year after the circular was issued, with actual figures where possible or, where this is not possible, with estimates of the cost.  This information, of course, cannot become available until after the close of the financial year.  If the Deputy will repeat the question after Easter, I shall <Col N="8" /> supply the information in so far as it is available.</P>

      <P>On 31st December, 1962, the latest date for which the information is available, the number of medical cards current in Counties Sligo and Leitrim was 4,660 and 2,384 respectively.  The total number of persons covered by these cards, that is holders and dependants, in County Sligo was 14,028 and in County Leitrim the number was 8,020.</P>

The number of such applications is 23 for Sligo&mdash;15 boys and eight girls&mdash;and 16 for Leitrim&mdash;eight boys and eight girls.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to provide sufficient residential accommodation for all those mentally handicapped children who need institutional care. The number of places available in the special institutions for mentally handicapped children has been almost doubled in the last ten years and works have been approved which will provide a further 300 places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A special service charge is not, as the Deputy appears to think, related to special extra costs of a &ldquo;once and for all&rdquo; kind.  The charge is, in fact, a supplement which must be paid in cases where the normal fixed charge portion of the two-part tariff does not yield sufficient revenue to permit the connection of particular premises on an over-all economic basis.  The fixed charge, including any special service charge, is required to meet outgoings on interest and sinking fund, depreciation, operating expenses, maintenance and repair and administration. Since the network will be required long after the original equipment is worn out and replaced, these outgoings continue to arise indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Fixed charges, therefore, including any special service charge, continue to be payable as long as the premises concerned remain connected to the network.</P>
      <P>In certain circumstances, such as the connection of new consumers to a particular extension, the Board may find it possible to reduce or remove the special service charges on existing consumers.</P>

      <P>Any station served by these bogs would have to operate on sod turf which is less economic than milled peat for the purpose.  Moreover, the potential output from all these bogs would only be sufficient to supply a station of a size which would henceforth be quite uneconomic.  The erection of such a generating station would involve the ESB in increased costs which would have to be met by consumers of electricity.  In the circumstances I see no prospect for the erection of a power station in this area.</P>

      <P>Since then, I have advised the Corporation, in effect, that they may charge to their annual Road Fund grant allocations their net expenditure on schemes for car parks in the central city area, with which they may proceed pending an examination of the problem of parking as part of the planning as a whole of the central city area.  I should like, however, to emphasise that the primary purpose of parking restrictions is to assist in reducing traffic congestion and that the introduction of such restrictions cannot be postponed on the grounds that off-street parking facilities are not available for all who wish to use them.</P>

The Commissioner submitted the bye-laws for my consent on 7th December, 1962, and notified each of the local authorities concerned on the same date that such submission had been made.  No representations were received by me from any of these bodies and I gave my consent to the bye-laws on 26th January, 1963.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The traffic signs bearing the word &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; or the words &ldquo;Yield Right of Way&rdquo; indicate that the road which a person is about to enter is a major road.  The General Bye-laws for the Control of Traffic, 1937 (Amendment) Bye-laws, 1956, require the driver of a vehicle approaching a junction at which a stop sign is provided on his left or near side of the road, to stop the vehicle at the stop line, where such a line is provided, or at or near the stop sign where no stop line is provided. The driver may proceed only when he has yielded the right of way to vehicles proceeding in either direction along the major road, in accordance with the provisions of the General Bye-laws for the Control of Traffic, 1937.  If the driver of a vehicle fails to stop the vehicle at the stop line or at the sign, or if he fails to yield the right of way to vehicles on the major road, he is liable to be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a function of the road authority to provide traffic signs, either with the consent of or at the direction of the Garda Síochána.  I have, after consultation with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, advised road authorities of the general principles they should follow in providing traffic signs. Regarding the Stop sign, I advised that it should be reserved for road junctions which are particularly dangerous, for example, where the entrance from a minor road to a major road is so obscured that a driver cannot infiltrate <Col N="23" /> in safety; but it is for the road authority in consultation with the Garda to decide on the sign necessary at a particular site.  If the Deputy considers that any particular Stop sign should be replaced by a Major Road Ahead sign, I suggest that he raise the matter in the first instance with the road authority concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one ambiguity outstanding.  I understand that where a Stop sign exists, you have a statutory duty to stop, whether any traffic is coming or not, whereas where there is a Yield Right of Way sign, you are intended to let any traffic on the main road pass before you enter the main road.  Does the obligation to stop, independent of the existence of other traffic or not, still obtain or are we entitled to consider all Stop signs now as merely Yield Right of Way signs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What the Deputy indicated as his meaning of the Stop sign is correct.  As I said in the latter part of my reply, we have advised local authorities that the use of the Stop sign should be reserved for particularly dangerous junctions.  Therefore, the type of thing to which the Deputy refers should not happen.  The really dangerous situations should be marked by a Stop sign and the less dangerous ones by a Yield Right of Way sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly clear then that the statutory obligation to stop still remains?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, where there is a Stop sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate to the local authorities when it is permissible for a driver to go again? One could be prosecuted for causing obstruction.  That is my point.  I am not being facetious about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, we cannot drive the cars for the people, but merely lay down the regulations.  The person coming out of the minor road is the person in the dangerous position, and he must take all due care.  If such a person gets into trouble, to a large extent the law will <Col N="24" /> be on the side of the person who has the right-of-way.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, the means of holders of qualification certificates under the Unemployment Assistance Acts must be reviewed when any change occurs in the circumstances of a holder e.g. acquirement of property, marriage, change of address. The means of self-employed persons must also be re-examined periodically. Apart from the other reasons mentioned, the means of the holder of a qualification certificate must also be re-investigated if his circumstances have not been reviewed for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period from 1st December, 1962, to 9th February, 1963, the number of persons in County Donegal whose unemployment assistance was discontinued, following reviews of means by officers of my Department in <Col N="27" /> the discharge of their statutory duties, was 40 and the number whose unemployment assistance was reduced was 111.</P>

      <P>The application in question was made in April, 1961.  It is hoped to provide service by July next in conjunction with a general clearance of applications in the area. It will be necessary to obtain wayleave consent for a new pole route from Donegal County Council and this, in turn, involves advertising and a statutory waiting period.</P>

Mar sin níl ar mo chumas an t-eolas atá ag teastáil ó na Teachtaí a thabhairt dóibh.  Beidh an t-eolas ar fáil dom feasta do réir forálacha an Achta a luaim.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the procedure followed by the Garda Síochána with regard to the return of stolen property to its proven rightful owner, and the period of time which in general elapses between identification of the rightful owner and the return of the property; and if he will take steps to expedite this procedure for the return of stolen property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Where criminal proceedings are taken against a person in respect of the stealing of property the Garda Síochána apply to the court for an Order for its disposal.  It is usually necessary to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings, and the expiry of the period for the lodging of an appeal, before the court can be asked to make the Order, as the property may be required by the court as evidence.  In the case of perishable property, however, it is the practice to ask the court to make an Order even though the criminal proceedings have not terminated.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that production of the property in court may be necessary, there is frequently a difficulty about conclusive identification.  Certain kinds of property, including money and items such as cigarettes, are seldom positively identifiable and to accept that identity had been conclusively established in such cases could be tantamount to assuming the guilt of the accused person before he has been tried.  However, where it is clearly established that there is only one claimant, it is generally possible to have the property handed over to him on his undertaking that it will be preserved until the court has disposed of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> Where no criminal proceedings are taken and there is only one claimant to the property and he satisfies the Garda that his claim is well founded, they hand the property over to him. Otherwise, they apply to the court for an Order.</P>
    <P>The period that elapses before the property is delivered to the person claiming to be the owner varies with the particular circumstances of each case, and depends primarily on the length of time the criminal proceedings take.  An average figure could be obtained only by an examination of a great many individual files and I do not think it could serve any purpose.</P>
    <P>The possibility of taking steps to improve the position from the point of view of the owner of stolen property has been examined on several occasions but, owing to the double problem of the need to have the property as evidence and the frequent difficulty of establishing conclusive identification in advance of the court's decision on the criminal charges, it has not been found feasible to make any significant change.  As matters stand, where the Gardaí have possession of perishable stolen property or property that appears to have been positively identified, they submit an immediate report to the local State Solicitor, so that the question whether the property can be returned in such circumstances is considered on its merits by the law officers in each individual case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion, as far as the ordinary members of this House can judge, this item on today's Order Paper represents one further incursion on the rights and privileges of members.  The ordinary Standing Orders of the House, as I understand them, provide that where an amendment is being put to a motion, the amendment should be taken immediately after the motion has been proposed and seconded.  By virtue of No. 5 on to-day's Order Paper, the rules are being changed.  The rules have been changed before to the disadvantage of the private Independent Member and here is another example of how the Parties <i>per se</i> are changing the rules when the game is not going to <Col N="63" /> their liking.  I suggest to the Taoiseach, in case it has not occurred to him, that item No. 5 is in derogation of and detrimental to the ordinary rights and privileges of the members of the House who, it must be remembered, are elected not as members of Parties but legally and constitutionally elected as representatives of the constituencies and the people for whom they stand. If they choose to organise themselves into groups or Parties after the election, that is another matter, but the primary thing that should be guarded, in my view, is the right of the individual Deputy under Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>Here we have a further example&mdash; which no doubt will be carried by the acquiescent and quiescent majorities of the House, now that it has been decided to select a few on various sides&mdash;of how rights are being taken away from individual Deputies.  The position is that the discussion on my amendment should follow discussion on Deputy Dillon's motion.  I may say that I have no wish to precede the Taoiseach in these matters, but I do say that I have a right prior to others who have been granted the right of discussion before me.</P>

The motion was moved, seconded and discussed and some little time after, the Labour Party sought to move an amendment to it, the amendment having been previously inserted on the Order Paper.  It was ruled then that you must move the amendment immediately after the motion so moved or you could not move it at all.  Then Deputy Corish was denied the opportunity of moving the already submitted amendment because it was not moved on the heels of the motion which was first moved.

If this motion is carried, the Government must resign, <Col N="67" /> and the discretion then rests with the President whether to invite the Dáil to choose an alternative Government or to dissolve the Dáil.  It is in the clear knowledge that that is the significance of the motion we move that we commend it to the House.</P>
    <P>Whatever else this White Paper has achieved we can all agree on one thing, that it has produced confusion and dismay generally in the country. There never was a time when it was less expedient to create confusion and dismay in the minds of those elements of the community who want to play their part in what is admittedly a difficult situation.  I cannot help recalling the brash impudence of the Taoiseach when he spoke in Wexford about going it alone not only internationally but internally.  It is time the Taoiseach woke up to the fact that in a civilised and free society such as we have here no political minority should claim the right or the desire to go it alone and indeed a responsible majority, if it is a truly democratic majority, should glory in the fact that it does not want to go it alone.  It will want to go it in collaboration with all the people.  It will want to carry with it common consent in regard to matters of fundamental national interest. If ever there was a Government in this country that has every reason to acknowledge with gratitude the extent to which it has been supported by all elements of the community when it was believed that the vital interests of this nation were at stake, it is the present Fianna Fáil minority Government.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult time and it is in that time that a White Paper is issued entitled <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  Let us consider for a moment the background against which that White Paper is produced. I exclude all the banquets, all the dinner parties, all the hoolies which Ministers of this Government, not excluding the Taoiseach, have been attending, singing the glories of Fianna Fáil always provided that the room or tent was large enough to accommodate television lights and cameras.</P>
    <P>Forget all that and consider what <Col N="68" /> the Taoiseach had to say about the state of the economy in Dáil Éireann. In Volume 198, columns 1469 and 1470 in December, 1962, on the occasion of the Adjournment, I thought it right to direct the attention of the House to certain trends in our economy which, I felt, if they were to continue, were bound to create difficulties &mdash;we were then in the context of entering the European Economic Community&mdash;and unless these trends were corrected I suggested to the House that the cold analytical eye of the experts of Brussels would dwell on the facts and not on the lucubrations of the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers at the dinners and hoolies which have been going on for the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I urged the Taoiseach that now was the time to face the facts and state the opinion upon them so that general co-operation could be bespoken if there was anything going wrong which required to be righted.  Here is what the Taoiseach said in reply:</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon expressed concern about the adverse trade balance.  He talked about the gap that exists between the volume of our visible imports and the value of our invisible exports.  It is true that the overall picture at the end of this year, when it will be possible to determine it in February or March next year, will probably show some deficit on our external payments, but in so far as that deficit has not involved, as the Deputy found out, any diminution of our external reserves, it is not a matter for great concern.  Our economy is in a healthy state.  In a period of national economic expansion there will be imports of machinery and raw materials for agriculture and industry in greater volume than previously.  These imports will appear in the trade statistics as physical goods, whereas the money that frequently comes in to pay for them does not so appear.</P>
    <P>Then, smiling up at us, he wished us a happy Christmas.  He hoped that we would all come back in the best of fettle ready to face the future with all the confidence that radiated from him. The fact was that he was holding in <Col N="69" /> his hand a busted flush.  He gambled that the Brussels negotiations would succeed and that in the subsequent rejoicing, the contents of his hand would be overlooked and we would mistake the diamond for a heart.  Now that he has had to put down his cards, he has got panicky, which is also characteristic of a poker player who has been found out.  It is one thing for the Taoiseach to display embarrassment and dismay, but it is quite another in an atmosphere of panic and distress to issue a document of this character.</P>
    <P>What is the fundamental defect of that White Paper?  Its fundamental defect is that it calls for sacrifice but not for equality of sacrifice.  Of course when you read it and reread it you discover all of the qualifications and all the circumlocutions of the trained bureaucrat preparing a document for Government consideration; but sooner or later, this Government ought to wake up to the fact that we are not living in an economic laboratory.  We are living in a free society, and we here as politicians have an obligation to make on our people demands when demands are necessary, in terms calculated to mobilise their support and understanding.  Can anyone say, in the circumstances in which that document was put, that the terms in which it is phrased were calculated to secure the consent and understanding of the bulk of our people?</P>
    <P>I do not believe anybody here&mdash;certainly no rational person here&mdash;will claim that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is a reckless or irresponsible body.  There is a good deal of misunderstanding in the country, and I want to go on record deliberately as saying that, in my personal experience of dealing with trade unions in this country and in my public experience of dealing with them, I have always conceived the trade unions to be tough in negotiations on behalf of their members. That is what they are there for. But I find them in my experience to be loyal and faithful to agreements on which they entered and generally contribute their full measure of responsible co-operation in any national effort where the help of all was called for.</P>
    <P>When we compare the record we <Col N="70" /> have had of trade union experience in this country with the record found in America or the records the people in Great Britain had, I think that the trade union movement in this country has the right to claim that while there are, as is inevitable in industrial relations from time to time, breakdowns and misunderstandings, as a general rule the trade union movement has been responsible and honourable and tough in negotiation on behalf of their members, which it is their duty to be. But that body which I do not think I have over-praised has this to say about the White Paper, not on the morrow of perusing it but after careful deliberation and consideration:</P>
    <P>The Government should have been aware that the publication of the White Paper could well create a sense of anxiety and uneasiness leading to a crisis of confidence with general reactions in the economic sphere with which we have been familiar in the past.  It should certainly have realised that it would have the effect of creating an artificial atmosphere of concern in regard to wages and salary levels.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say at a later stage of its statement:</P>
    <P>There is no basis for any assumption such as apparently impelled the Government to issue the White Paper that the trade union movement would behave in an irresponsible manner or that it would in any way precipitate a situation that would damage the national economy and thereby the interests of the wage and salary earners whom the movement represents.  The ready co-operation that has been forthcoming from the trade union movement at all levels, both in joint labour-management bodies and in government sponsored organisation, should surely have dispelled any idea that it would engage in any unreasonable action running counter to the nation's interests.</P>
    <P>I believe that Deputies on all sides of the House will be constrained to acknowledge the justice of those two representations by the Irish Congress <Col N="71" /> of Trade Unions, and that they should have been forced into such a protestation at this time is no service to this country.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that Ireland is too small a country in which to establish two nations.  Either we work altogether or we all go down the drain together. It never was more true of our situation than it is today that united we stand, divided we fall.  There are some people in this country who believe that it is impossible and even wrong&mdash;and to this disreputable doctrine the Taoiseach has lent his name&mdash;that there can be unity on anything in the political life of this country, that there must be division and conflict about every matter that Parliament is called upon to consider or else Parliament is not rightly functioning.  I want to say most categorically that nothing could be further from the truth.  The obligation of a responsible Parliament is to acknowledge readily and willingly that in certain contingencies we should all be together defending the national interest but that about important other issues different views should exist and will be canvassed and, if necessary, carried to the country in a general election.</P>
    <P>It is because we believe that the general policy of this Government has in its results shown itself to be wholly ineffective in the situation in which we find ourselves at the present time that we take the view that Parliament should now pronounce that it is no longer satisfied and that the country should be given an opportunity of passing judgment on the Government responsible for the policy and the situation which evoked the publication of this White Paper.</P>
    <P>I have studied this White Paper as closely as I can and the impression borne in upon me is that it speaks of excessive purchasing power.  That is the heart and centre of the whole theme.  It is fortified by graphs of a very over-simplified kind.  I want to direct the attention of the House to the danger of the employment of nice simple graphs like these.  The graphs look beautiful until you begin to ask <Col N="72" /> what they are about.  The heading of Diagram 1 in the White Paper is &ldquo;Indices of weekly earnings and output per wage-earner engaged in manufacturing industries 1958-62&rdquo;.  There is a dramatic line drawn where at one stage the weekly earnings soared above output per industrial worker and everybody is expected to say at once: &ldquo;There is the gap&rdquo;, but then you could turn to the graph published by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which deals with labour productivity and real earnings of industrial workers and here we have the volume of output per wage-earner compared with real earnings.  Here no gap exists at all except that the gap between real earnings and the volume of output tends, if anything, to widen.</P>
    <P>If it is true, and I think it is true, all the graphs apart, that the core of the case made in this White Paper is that there is at present operating in our economy excess purchasing power, surely a White Paper that wanted to put the case objectively before the people would have something to say about the cost of living and the rise from, I think, 135 to 157 that has taken place in the course of the last six years?  Surely, if it were excess purchasing power that we really wanted to deal with, we would not spend so many paragraphs and so much eloquence on wages and salaries categorically described without some reference to profits?  Surely, if we were more worried, honestly worried, about excess purchasing power and we were talking about wages and salaries as one element in creating that excess purchasing power, we would have made some note somewhere on the impact of hire-purchase on the increased purchasing power in this country and we would have observed that in the last four years the volume of hire-purchase debt in this country has more than doubled, from £14.7 million to £31.8 million?  I am not a statistician but I understand that most hire-purchase debt bears for a period of two years.  Am I correct in believing that that represents a creation of about £15,000,000 per annum of hire-purchase debt?</P>
    <P>Surely, if this paper were addressed <Col N="73" /> to people with a desire to inform them fully, there would have been some reference to the creation of bank credit?  Or, for whom was this White Paper intended?  Did the Taoiseach seriously imagine that he was going to deceive the members of this House who are concerned with such matters or is it the desire to create a general impression in the country that the best way to resolve our problems is to hit the civil servants, to hit the local authority employees, to hit anybody who works for the State?</P>
    <P>We are all long enough in politics to know that there is nothing more popular in any free society in the world than walloping the bureaucrats. Nobody is going to get very excited about the proposal to cut them down. But, the plain fact is that this country is greatly blessed in its public servants. They have never asked for more and, God knows, they have never got more than the very minimum of equality with persons in similar employment outside and the plain fact is that public servants in this country share the same handicap that people in public life have, that is, that their work must be done for a reward far lower than similar work would secure in commerce, trade or industry.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a happy thing to re-open this whole argument.  I do not think it is a happy thing to go back on the agreement that was reached in 1954, when we finally decided to provide arbitration for people in the public service.  There was a difference about that.  Fianna Fáil were opposed to it; the rest of us were in favour of it, but we established it and Fianna Fáil have since adopted it.</P>
    <P>Nothing could do more to shake the confidence of workers in this country than the implication that Oireachtas Éireann, having finally accepted the principle of arbitration, are going to wriggle out of it without repealing it. I believe it is a good principle.  I believe on the whole it has worked well and I am convinced that, instead of going it alone, any Party in this country who are prepared to put the real economic cards on the table would get from the trade union movement in this country and, I believe, from the <Col N="74" /> industrial organisations in this country, whatever measure of co-operation they wanted within reason to prevent such an expansion in purchasing power as to put the whole economy of the State in jeopardy and I believe if they had asked for it, they would have got it. Would it not have been a very much preferable thing if that were the way the story had been told?</P>
    <P>If we had had some disappointed journalists recalling that there was no jizz or no fire in Irish public life, that actually all sides, recognising the economic emergency that did exist, had come together with a common plan to lend a hand to prevent an economic difficulty degenerating into an economic crisis, despite the disappointed journalists, I would have rejoiced at the evidence of sophistication in our democracy, of which I believe our democracy is fully capable if given the opportunity of showing it.  But, if that proved a disappointment to the sensationalists, I would have regarded it as a <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> of the methods by which democracy works in this country. But, then, of course, we on this side of the House do not believe in the arrogance or impudence, whichever you choose to call it, of going it alone because we know that in this country, and God grant it may ever be so, our people are not susceptible to being kicked about by outsiders, or insiders either.</P>
    <P>I have observed, as we must all have observed, that of course since document No. 1 was produced it is impossible to open the daily paper without document No. 2 and document No. 3 and document No. 4 being produced. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport and Power and anybody else who can get someone to put up a dinner for them have been back-pedalling as fast as the dinners would allow ever since this White Paper was produced.  We have had grim memories in this country of documents No. 1 and No. 2.  We have had a civil war started in this country once about document No. 2. It would be a world of pities if we started an industrial disputes war in this country at this critical time in the effort to determine which was the valid <Col N="75" /> instrument of to-day: document No. 1, document No. 2, document No. 3, Dr. Ryan's document No. 4 or Deputy Childers' document No. 4½.</P>
    <P>We have not yet received any clarification in any of the new versions as to what has happened since the Taoiseach spoke here in Dáil Éireann in December. What changed the whole situation that such extreme measures are called on to put right what we were told in December could not be better.  It is not until the Government tell us in explicit terms what is the real nature of the problem that they can hope to get the kind of co-operation necessary to avert economic difficulties, if we are truly faced with them.  It is equally true to say that any Government in this country will get that kind of help and co-operation if the people understand what is required and if all are asked to do it together.  If the atmosphere created by the White Paper were to obtain, and I say deliberately, &ldquo;created by the White Paper,&rdquo; because there have been various documents No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, the general impression was that there was a hankering after the classical remedy of 1947&mdash; freeze wages; freeze salaries; let us have a Selwyn Lloyd pause.</P>
    <P>I can understand the theoretical economists in the fortress of a lecture room or a research institute saying that the shortest way to go about solving the problem is to freeze wages and salaries, that if you can hold the line for a couple of years, the nation may be greatly advantaged, but what they tend to forget is that there are certain economic advantages which can be purchased at too great a price. If the price you have to pay is to shatter the whole fabric of industrial relations in the society in which you live, you have paid a price out of all proportion to any so-called economic advantage. You have created, over that period of two years, cruel injustices and inequalities which every just person would cry out to have remedied but which are left outstanding because the sacred doctrine of the wages freeze has become the gospel of the day.</P>
    <P>Unless we retain the fabric of our <Col N="76" /> own particular economic setup and unless we retain equity of reward in our economic effort, instead of getting peace and progress, we get distrust, hatred and suspicion, arising, perhaps, in many cases from very small disturbances but the greatest evil is an evil which we have had an opportunity of learning from in Great Britain, that very often the root of the illfeeling is forgotten but the illfeeling itself continues to grow.  How often have we seen great industries in Britain held up and paralysed over the employees' cup of tea because of the failure of labour relations to solve completely and effectively the grievances of some person or group of persons about a cup of tea or about a five minute break for smoking?  Because of that failure they have fallen into a whole forest of distrust and confused labour relations and great industrial undertakings have been paralysed at immense loss to the men, to the employers and to the nation as well.</P>
    <P>Why should we allow ourselves to stumble into that situation when we have a trade union movement in this country that has shown itself ready, willing and anxious to sit down with the employers' organisations and, with or without consultation with the Government, work out a common policy on which to base expansion in the industrial sphere and show great restraint where that is necessary in order to achieve the appropriate results?  I cannot help recalling to this House, and it is a useful thing to learn from the experience of others, that we have had a case closely analogous to this in the United States of America.  We have had the case in the big steel industry there where the head of the Government went to the steel workers and asked for forbearance.  That forbearance was forthcoming on the implied understanding that there would also be forbearance on the part of the employers with regard to profits.  Probably due to a misunderstanding, steps were taken by the industry to raise prices and that caused something approximating a national crisis because the Government said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The Government said that if one side were to be asked to make a sacrifice, the other must also make a sacrifice.  The Government <Col N="77" /> said that there must be no question of asking one side to make sacrifices and saying to the other side: &ldquo;For you, the lid is off&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There were elaborate arguments that could have been made for the case of increased profits but those who understood what the real national need was said to them: &ldquo;Cut out all that tripe.  What must be done here is justice and justice must be seen to be done.  Industrial peace must be established and as we go on we can see what effort can be made.&rdquo;  It transpired that instead of increasing prices, the steel industry found it expedient to bring prices down.  The fundamental principle was involved, the establishment of peace in this great industry, and that is what is lacking in the proposals put forward by the Government here in this context.</P>
    <P>I have advanced the thesis that there are indications that the economic situation of this country is such as to cause anxiety.  I tried to express that feeling in the most restrained language I could employ last December when I directed the attention of the House to the trading figures up to the end of September.  Since then, the figures for the calendar year have emerged.  It is important to emphasise that too much stress can be laid on the mention of the calendar year.  There is no more significance in the calendar year than in any other measurement of time.  It may be a calendar year, or a financial year or a five-year period, but for purposes of comparison the calendar year is not really significant in this context.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we are faced with an adverse trade balance of unexampled magnitude, over £100,000,000 in the past 12 months. That is a situation which must cause concern no matter in what context it occurs; if there were a strong, rising tendency in our exports and a stable, or even a declining, tendency in our imports then we could view that increase as a passing thing, without its giving rise to any very deep anxiety. But that is not the case.</P>
    <P>We have an adverse trade balance of £100,000,000..  We can speak rather more freely and more emphatically of <Col N="78" /> these things now because, certainly for some time ahead, the Brussels situation is irrelevant.  It is not the case that we have this unexampled adverse trade balance with buoyant exports. Exports have been going down.  Now I know that part of that decline in exports has been in agricultural produce, and to that I shall return in a moment; but, taking the overall picture, exports are going down and imports are going up.  Now, in itself, that presents a picture calculated to cause concern, but there is a further feature which we must bear in mind.  That situation is accompanied by what, at first glance, appears to be a phenomenon, and that is that our external assets of the joint stock banks, of the Central Bank and the Government Fund are showing no corresponding decline.  That means that there are large capital movements taking place between this country and abroad.</P>
    <P>What is the nature of these capital movements?  Nobody seems to be able to tell us, and I can only surmise. There may be an element of hot money.  I am not qualified to say if there is, but in so far as that hot money is deposited here for safe keeping its period of residence here depends almost entirely on the degree of international confidence in the stability of our currency.  Some of it is sales of land.  I do not know how much, and I do not believe the Government know, but there is no doubt that we are selling land for cash to foreigners who want to stash money away here in tangible form in agricultural land.  Now, there will come a time at which our people, with their history behind them, will say: &ldquo;This must stop.  We are not prepared to create a new race of foreign landlords in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark you, I differentiate most emphatically between the foreigner who comes and buys a house and garden, and enjoys the amenity of a holiday residence here, and the man who comes in and buys a large tract of agricultural land and sets it.  I am told that at this present moment there is a standing order in many land agents' offices in this city for any parcel of Irish land of two or three hundred <Col N="79" /> acres, always provided it is good land, and the instruction &ldquo;The price does not matter much provided the title is good&rdquo;.  I do not believe that can go on indefinitely, for social reasons.  I do not believe the people will suffer it to go on, but let us remember that, when it stops, it means not only the desirable step of putting an end to the alienation of Irish land to foreigners but it also means that some of the money coming in to correct the balance of payments stops with it.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly a considerable volume of foreign money being invested in Irish industry.  Within limits that is a good thing.  I rejoice to see new industries started with foreign capital.  But let us be on our guard, however, against an excessive alienation of existing Irish industry to foreign ownership.  There has been a good deal of trouble in Canada about that, and a good deal of unnecessary and evil international misunderstanding consequent on that in Canada.  I do not want to go into the politics of a neighbouring country, so old a friend of ours, but there is no doubt whatever that that issue of excessive foreign investment in Canada, if that adjective be appropriate to investment at all, has created an underswell throughout Canadian society that it has gone too far.</P>
    <P>I want to say most emphatically on behalf of our Party that, in our judgment, no corresponding situation obtains here.  I want to say most emphatically, and let it be as clear as crystal, that, so far as the establishment of new industry here is concerned, foreign capital is welcome.  We have always emphatically differentiated between the entry of foreign capital for the purchase of agricultural land and the entry of foreign capital for the purpose of establishing industry that gives good employment at fair rates of wages.  Bear this economic fact in mind, however, when we talk of the balance of payments, that for every £10,000,000 of foreign capital invested here there will be an annual charge of approximately £700,000 on our balance of payments.  Now we <Col N="80" /> should want it that way because that is the hallmark of success.  We want foreign investment in this country to be profitable.  We want it to draw other <i>entrepreneurs</i> following in the footsteps of the pioneer, but we should not, when we see the balance of payments today apparently immune to the usual consequences of an adverse trade balance, forget that for each £10,000,000 invested there is a charge in perpetuity thereafter, so long as the industry thrives and prospers in the profits that must go out.  In so far as these industries build up exports we can carry that cheerfully.  In so far as other activities generate increased exports we can carry the financing of these problems, but we have got to remember that they are a charge which must come.</P>
    <P>Now there is another very substantial contribution to the balance of payments at the present time.  That is the remittances of the 300,000 emigrants we have sent out of this country in the past six years.  But do not forget there is a tendency for those to dry up too.  One thing we must remember &mdash;it is the least attractive&mdash;is the impact of the growing unemployment in Great Britain, where most of those emigrants are.  There is also the traditional experience of all of us that, as boys and girls continue to live in Great Britain or America, they marry and settle down; the tendency then to send money home gradually declines.  That is another source of income for the relief of our balance of payments which tends to diminish.  We are, there fore, faced with a situation at the present time far different from that described by the Taoiseach when he spoke in December and told us that it is not a matter for great concern; that our economy is in a healthy state and everything is going as he would expect it.</P>
    <P>All of us here want to see industrial expansion continue.  There are some people who will say at once that you must not then say one word of criticism of the economic state of the country.  That is all ballyhoo.  People who contemplate establishing industry here, or investing money here, are not going to be affected by any self-generated  <Col N="81" /> euphoria that we create in Dáil Éireann.  They are going to look at the facts and if we do not look at the facts with the same detachment and objectivity as they do, we are only deceiving ourselves&mdash;we are not deceiving them.  They are going to look at the stability of this country.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Corish will not object if I say that when he and I visited Europe together, one of the outstanding facts to which our attention was directed was the importance in Ireland of the availability of labour. I ask Deputy Corish to listen to this so that he may correct me if I misquote our common experience.  The German industrialists and German economists attached great importance to Deputy Corish's statement, which he was peculiarly equipped to make, that there were good industrial relations in this country, a vigorous trade union movement in which the working people had confidence, and that there were satisfactory relations with employers, and reasonable settlements by negotiations on wage rates were established within a disciplined trade union movement which provided the very kind of stability which those who contemplated setting up industry set special value on in Ireland.</P>
    <P>To my mind, to put all that in peril and to tear down the whole superstructure of confidence that has been built up pretty painfully from&mdash;I like to think&mdash;1948 onwards when Labour took its part in the government of this country and discovered there was a basis of mutual co-operation with others who did not belong to the Labour movement would be a catastrophe. Out of that has grown a growing sense of the significance and importance of the labour movement not only in the day-to-day negotiations on wage rates in the various industries but in the national and economic polity.  If all that is to be blown away by the <i>demarche</i> which is adumbrated in the White Paper, the whole basis of confidence and stability, which I think Deputy Corish will agree constituted an added attraction to foreign capital, can be shattered overnight and it may take years to re-establish it.</P>
    <P>You can plaster over the cracks; you <Col N="82" /> can repair the individual mistake; but I venture to swear that for years hence there will be people who will recall the issue of the White Paper and what would have happened, and what it would have contained, if Fianna Fáil had 74 Deputies instead of 70.  In so far as this Government have done that, they have done a great disservice to the country.  Though I wish Fianna Fáil ill and would be glad to see the last of them, the plain fact is that they are still a great political Party in this country and at present constitute the Irish Government, and in those circumstances I would have infinitely preferred the political kudos of approaching this matter prudently and effectively and saying: &ldquo;There is a problem; will you sit down with us, Labour, Opposition and all, and see if we can find any common recommendation couched in terms that will carry full understanding to all our people of what we are about, that we simply want to prevent economic danger growing into serious economic debacle?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know that we are going to have to face formidable difficulties.  The news of the expedition by EFTA of their programme of tariff reductions, coupled with the corresponding movement within the EEC, in which there is now developing a race to see who will be first to eliminate tariffs and quotas from their economic setup, is going to create problems for this country more especially in our present situation in which we belong to neither, but they are not incapable of resolution.  But if ever there was a time when stability, when good industrial relations, when mutual confidence were vital to the survival of industry, surely the time is now.  I ask the Government how far do they think the White Paper and the circumstances of this issue have contributed to the confidence which I think all of us would agree is a vital <i>sine qua non</i> for the economic survival of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that the terms of this our motion go further than the express and specific matter of this White Paper.  All this constitutes part of a general picture <Col N="83" /> which I am sorry to say I am coming to believe is part of the Government's reaction to a gamble that did not come off.  I think the Taoiseach, not without difficulty, forced his Government to stake their all on the success of the present negotiations in the EEC.  I believe the present Minister for External Affairs has been put in cold storage and is virtually now frozen stiff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

      <P>I believe he has a few travellers like the kite flier who was sent down to Castlebar and he had his kite cut down and has moved over to the left.  The Minister for Lands is of the one mind with the Minister for External Affairs, but I believe there were dissentient voices and I believe the Taoiseach lined them up and I think the Taoiseach was right to go for the Common Market.  This Party supported him and the Government in their effort to enter the Common Market and, I am happy to think, made some contribution to Ireland's cause for acceptance as a full member of the Common Market.  There is no blame attaching to our Government.  We never came into the discussions.  We were not mentioned and we have not been mentioned since, so that at least we have this melancholy consolation that we cannot be blamed for the failure of the Brussels negotiations.  I think, however, that their failure has created problems for which the Taoiseach has not prepared himself and which he has not deliberately elected to control and which I think must be controlled.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest to the House that vital and important as industrial exports can be to us the whole EEC situation, the Common Market situation and the adjustments which would have to be made on the industrial front, have dazzled us all a bit until we have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in the country but the prospect of industrial exports.  I want to suggest that, now that that dream period is over, we have got to face the future without access to the Common Market and we are driven back to realise that the sheetanchor of our economy is agriculture and the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> Bear in mind that our industries at present are enjoying the advantage of preferential terms in the British market. According to the EFTA programme today, all those preferences will be gone in three or four years' time.  We shall be competing in a free-for-all. In some branches of industrial exports, I think we shall survive that experience but we shall have trouble.  However, let us not forget in our solicitude for that situation that we still have 50 million hungry people beside us and the kind of food we send them or desire to send them cannot be put in the category of luxuries, which would be the first to suffer in the event of any diminution of national income.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the House that one of the outstanding evidences of the complete failure of this Government adequately to grapple with the situation which any Government, this one or the one that succeeds them, will have to deal is in relation to our balance of trade.  Where this Government are going wrong as they have gone wrong before is in forgetting the land and the people living on it as a source of a material and valuable contribution to the effective solution of this balance of payments problem.</P>
    <P>Our land has not lost its capacity to produce livestock and livestock products. We still have an untapped reserve capacity of produce&mdash;cattle, sheep, pigs, meat, bacon, butter, cheese, dried milk, vegetables and other agricultural produce, fresh and processed. There are also wide areas for the export of agricultural produce from this country as the raw material of foreign industry with special reference to barley and malt.  If these are to be expanded effectively, and it is now vitally urgent to do so if this balance of payments problem is not to creep up on us and destroy us&mdash;it is time to say it plain and bluntly now&mdash;it is agriculture that must fill the gap, for the time being in any case.</P>
    <P>What are we doing?  Is there any evidence of a sense of urgency on the part of this Government to expand the output of agriculture or effectively to market an increased volume of production? I suggest that one of the great failures of the past five years has been <Col N="85" /> the utter failure of the Government to provide an adequate national agricultural advisory service, however it is to be provided, of sufficient dimensions to put an agricultural adviser and organiser in every parish in Ireland, to solicit, to lead and to direct the enthusiastic response that there would be from the vast majority of farmers if they got the help they want to expand their incomes and their output.  What help do they want?  There is no use sending them advice&mdash;and let me say that it is at the peril of my political life I say this because as sure as I make suggestions Fianna Fáil will swallow them tomorrow morning and produce them as their policy at the next election&mdash;if we do not give them the credit to enable them to put that advice into operation.</P>
    <P>Is it unreasonable at a time when we are giving grants in bucket loads to industrialists from the four corners of the earth to suggest that where a small farmer would be prepared to expand his production, he should get a loan up to £1,000 interest free?  Is that priming the pump to excess?  I do not think it is.  It is very necessary if we are to get the expansion in agricultural produce without which that balance of payments situation cannot be brought under control.  Is it unreasonable to say, when we get them under way ready to produce and equipped to do it, that having housed every other element of our community and having appropriated and in continuing to appropriate vast sums to house future immigrants to this country &mdash;and nobody will grudge them good houses&mdash;is it unreasonable to say that we should at least provide credit terms with which small farmers could build themselves houses at least equal in the amenities which we are providing for the operatives that work in factories. be they Irish or visitors from abroad?</P>
    <P>These things require doing.  It is unnecessary for me to dwell on the urgent need for improved marketing machinery in order to market increased production.  Nothing more urgently requires development than that but may I say this in conclusion?  We are sometimes rebuked that we are not sufficiently trenchant in our castigation <Col N="86" /> of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not deny there are occasions when I find it difficult to castigate them as my instinct would urge me to do because I find them advocating policies today with a brazen-faced audacity which they have spent their lives denouncing, and this Party is not going to be forced into the position, to satisfy anybody who is looking for entertainment, of repudiating the policies for which we have traditionally stood simply because Fianna Fáil now advocate them.  I would be glad to think that Fianna Fáil's conversion to these policies was in every respect genuine and effective but there is danger here. Lipservice can be given to policies but when their implementation comes, those who do not believe in these policies honestly cannot give them effect.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have suddenly discovered that Ireland could not enter the European Economic Community without Great Britain because the British market is indispensable to the economic life of this country.  We believed that and within a month of our being elected to office in 1948, we went to London and negotiated a trade agreement with Great Britain in order to exploit that market effectively for our own people.  It may be necessary to do something like that soon again but I ask myself, when that time comes, will they be fit to do it?  If I listen to their protestations, I feel constrained to say &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; but when I want to hear the truth, I listen to the rumblings from their back benches because there, like lava boiling, is the old conviction that &ldquo;the British market is gone, thanks be to God&rdquo;, and it finds its eloquent expression in the infrequent intervention of Deputy Corry in our deliberations.  Deputy Corry spoke here no later than 29th January from the back benches of Fianna Fáil.  The Taoiseach rose exasperated at the thought of this old warrior being quoted against him. Maybe he represents the real Fianna Fáil more truly than the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>We did not hear this <Col N="87" /> a fortnight ago.  It was only a week ago but the Taoiseach was not here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry was expounding on the subject of the Common Market, and when he announced his intention of giving us his views on that topic we naturally all pricked up our ears and gave him our undivided attention. Here is what Deputy Corry had to say &mdash;and, mind you, there was a rumble of gratified approbation from the back benches of Fianna Fáil, scattered as their members were&mdash;as reported on column 570 on Tuesday, 29th January, 1963, Volume 199:</P>
      <P>I will not speak about the Common Market.</P>
      <P>That of course was in itself a guarantee that he proposed to make some trenchant remarks on that subject.  I commented:</P>
      <P>That is a loss to us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde said: &ldquo;We would be anxious to know what is going to happen&rdquo;, and to that encouragement, Deputy Corry very quickly reacted and he is reported thus:</P>

      <P>Mr. Corry: Every bit of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to relate my remarks to the subject matter of the White Paper or I should say the title of the White Paper, and, without moving the motion, of course, to speak to it. In my opinion, the introduction of this White Paper is thoroughly uncalled for and certainly justifies the violent reaction of disapproval and rejection by the trade unions in this country represented by the Irish Congress of <Col N="88" /> Trade Unions.  I think it is especially unfortunate that it should have been introduced at a time when the Employer-Labour Conference seemed to be progressing at least reasonably well, at a time, as I think has been acknowledged by most people, when employer-worker relations were indeed improving and this improvement has indeed been acknowledged even in recent weeks by those who represent themselves as employers' spokesmen.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the intention of the Government was or their underlying motive in issuing this White Paper, but the reaction from it did much more harm than any good it was intended to achieve.  The Taoiseach said last week in other speeches that he did not feel compelled to get the concurrence of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to this White Paper.  He was told, and I would like to tell him now, that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions did not want to be in a position to agree or disagree with the contents of this White Paper, at least when it was being prepared, but at least within the Employer-Labour Conference, there was a medium, a machine, in a better position to be able to estimate what damage or what improvement there might be effected in employer-worker relations through the publication of such a document.</P>
      <P>While this document in its entirety was not expected, we at least in the Labour Party and the trade union movement always believed that some time or other the Fianna Fáil Party would get back to their old policy of attempting to curb or control wages and salaries.  We have had very many examples of this, even though Fianna Fáil at various times have tried to protest that it was never their intention to curb wages or salaries, but to allow free negotiation of wages and salaries. We had the infamous wages standstill order of 1941 which was maintained for five years, and in 1947, we believe there was to be another wages standstill order, but that was not implemented because fortunately there was a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even as recently as September 1961, we had a proposal introduced, I think, by the Minister for Industry <Col N="89" /> and Commerce which purported to impose compulsory arbitration on certain workers in the Electricity Supply Board, but because there was a violent reaction of the people and a protest made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on that occasion, the Government through their spokesman, the Taoiseach, backed down, rightly so, we believe, in the circumstances. During the general election of 1961, we forecast that the Fianna Fáil Party would at some stage attempt to impose control of wages and salaries.  Of course, when that allegation was made in the campaign, it was denied by the Taoiseach, but in fact here we have it in this White Paper bearing on incomes and output.</P>
    <P>It has been rightly said that it seems that this is copying the Selwyn Lloyd, Macmillan pay pause, which it must be known has been an acknowledged failure in Great Britain.  We did not take the Minister for Transport and Power seriously in the speeches he made recently on the matter of output, incomes and wages, because quite honestly, we did not believe that he was talking with the voice of the Government.  We took it that he was talking for himself alone. He has in speeches over the past few years antagonised workers and, what is worse still, has antagonised the employers. This White Paper is represented as being issued by the Government.  After reading it, I was inclined to think that it was prepared by the Minister for Transport and Power, and was not even read by the Government, because it certainly was typical of the pious speeches he has been making in recent months.</P>
    <P>One thing is outstanding in the speeches over the past ten days or so and about this White Paper, that is, that when Fianna Fáil talk about a wage policy, they always talk about the control of wages, whether it is voluntary or compulsory, but they have a different tune when they talk about profits.  There was a sneering reference to the control of profits and prices by the Minister for Finance a few nights ago when he suggested that it was ridiculous to attempt to control <Col N="90" /> prices or profits and that these should in fact seek their own level.  Therefore, we have on the one hand, an attitude which suggests that there should be control of wages and salaries, while as far as prices and profits are concerned, the attitude seems to be &ldquo;Let them find their own level&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Little did I think when I referred to a speech by the Minister for Transport and Power on production and wages and the responsibility of the workers in a recent debate here in Dáil Éireann that when the Taoiseach announced this White Paper, it would be of the nature of what we now know it to be.  At that particular time, I was complaining of what some people believed the attitude of the Minister for Transport and Power to be, that the workers did not seem to be pulling their weight, and on that occasion I had reason to point out that the major responsibility for greater production did not rest on the workers but on management and on industry itself. With very few exceptions, that has not been pointed out by the spokesmen of the Government over the past few years.  In any case, as a result of that intervention and from a reply from the Taoiseach, we were told that there was to be issued a White Paper dealing with the relationship between incomes and output and national policy. The Taoiseach, at column 1235 on 7th February last, said:</P>
    <P>The essential requirement is a policy designed to promote economic growth and also understanding the serious consequence that would follow from any departure over a protracted period of time from these essential requirements of a good policy.</P>
    <P>That was a fairly high sounding description of the White Paper that was to be issued, which would deal with the relationship between incomes, output and good national policy.  We got a document of eight miserable pages, which when stripped of two pages of diagrams boils down to six, amounting, as I reckoned a few moments ago, to about 3,000 words. Does the Taoiseach think that he has done himself or the Government justice in attempting to deal with such a <Col N="91" /> problem and in running the risk of being misrepresented and of doing irreparable damage to the relationship between employers and workers in a miserable 3,000 words?  I suggest that it cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Evidence of that, and of the inadequacy of this document, is the frantic rush by Ministers over the past ten days at meetings or dinners of chambers of commerce and this, that and the other thing, to try to explain what they meant.  I do not know whether they are going to be successful in their attempt to explain what is meant by the Government's policy on incomes and output, but at least it does show that this document of a mere miserable 3,000 words is certainly inadequate to deal with such a huge problem in such a critical time in the development of the economy in the country.  As I said, I am sure it was prepared by the Minister for Transport and Power but how it got by his colleagues in the Cabinet I cannot imagine.</P>
    <P>My main criticism of this document is that it is one-sided; it is a biased document and why it should be biased, I cannot imagine because the emphasis throughout the document is on the danger of higher wages or salaries. There is an emphasis here on the danger of workers receiving too much money.  There is no doubt in the world about that.  There is not a mention of the tens of thousands of lowly-paid workers in the country.  One would imagine that a document entitled <i>Incomes and Output</i> would have some mention of those who at the present time are being paid £5 10s., £6, £7, £8 or £9 per week.  There is no element of social justice in this document and I believe there should be.  There is no reference at all to the important fact that because a number of workers are paid inadequately, they are forced to emigrate, with consequential loss of manpower to the country.  If one is to talk about production, one has also to talk about manpower and loss of manpower and inadequacy of wages but there is not a tittle of mention of the matter in this miserable 3,000 word document.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> There is no reference in the document to the inadequacy of things like home assistance, social welfare payments. The Government do not seem to regard these as incomes at all and certainly do not seem to have any regard to the inadequacy of them.  It is said in the final paragraph of this document that if certain demands for increases were acceded to, they would act as an incentive to other sectors to seek similar increases.  I wonder if the Minister for Justice is blushing at this moment, or will he recall that it is less than 12 months since he was justifying increases to certain gentlemen, to people who did not have £8 or £9 or £14 or £20 per week but who had £4,500 a year and to whom he proposed to give, in one case, an additional £600 a year.  There were academic arguments as to why that increase should be given.  The Minister talked about a status symbol; he talked about what they would have to repay to the Revenue Commissioners in income tax.  Was that a good example to a farm labourer who would be boarded in a house and who takes home to his wife and four children £4 or £4 5s. per week?  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the other members of the Government should now be suffering a certain amount of shame when they relate the proposals in respect of the judiciary to the inferences contained in this White Paper described as <i>Closing the Gap.</i></P>
    <P>There was, as I have said, an immediate and strong reaction from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and their statement, one might say, was not as biased as this White Paper certainly appears to be.  This White Paper, whether the Taoiseach likes it or not, is recognised as one that proposes a pay pause.  The Taoiseach may say that it is in respect of State and semi-State employees.  However that may be, it is a pay pause.  We have never believed in and never will tolerate, no matter on what side of the House we may be, any sort of interference with the free negotiation of wages and salaries between the salaried class or the workers on the one side and their counterparts, the employers, on the other.  In any case, if it is a pay pause <Col N="93" /> only as far as State and semi-State employments are concerned, it is a clear direction to all employers not to concede increases and every single employer will use this document, miserable though it is, as an excuse not to pay legitimate increases to employees and the Taoiseach will not be able to prevent that, even though he may disagree with it.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in recent times there is a certain amount of concern expressed by sections of the community as to the standard of living of ordinary working people.  There seems to be a resentment that workers have improved themselves to some extent in recent years and it seems now from this White Paper that with those who prepared it the dictum is: &ldquo;Thus far and no further; your standard of living now is good enough&rdquo;.  We hear people talking about the working class, especially the manual workers, in terms of how well off they are now and pointing to the forest of television aerials in the new housing areas in various towns and cities as if it were wrong that people should have radios, and speaking in a critical fashion of workers who have cars, as demonstrating that they are now paid too well, as if it were not the right of the worker to have a television set, to have a radio, to have a car, if his position allows it.</P>

      <P>We are told in this document that the last increase did damage to the economy.  That is the implication in paragraph 4.  We are told that substantial awards were given <Col N="94" /> in the eighth round.  What is a substantial award?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest amount conceded in what is now described as the eight round of wage increases was 27/- but many people forget that there were much smaller awards, that farm workers got substantially less.  I would say that the average as between 6/-and 27/- was about 12/- per week. Here we had the Government boasting in the last election about a booming economy and now they are crying because workers in this country got an average increase in wages of 12/-a week.  In this document, the workers are being admonished to be reasonable and certain wage earners and salary earners are told that there will be a pay pause.  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge the reasonableness of the trade union movement in this country? Did they not demonstrate that in 1957? Then they did not need any exhortation from the Government to come to an agreement with the employers.  In that year, they showed a distinct reasonableness and, despite the fact that their standard of living had been damaged by the total abolition of the food subsidies, they agreed to a formula of 10/- increase.</P>
      <P>In 1959, they sought to close the gap between wages and prices and it was not until 1960 that the per-war purchasing power of the workers was generally restored.  In 1961, what is described as the eighth round of wage increases commenced.  In 1960, the pre-war purchasing power of the workers was restored but the pre-war standard could not be described as being luxurious and, therefore, in 1961, the workers of the country, through their Trade Unions, and with the approval of the Congress of Trade Unions, decided to make some effort to improve their standard of living.  It was not without some thought that they decided to look for an increase in 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They had seen an improvement in their efforts from 1958 to 1961.  If they are to be blamed now, they should get credit for the increase in production <Col N="95" /> between 1958 and 1961 and on the basis of that increased production, they made their claim for the eighth round in that year.  For some three years prior to that, national production rose by 16 per cent., industrial production by 15 per cent., exports by 37 per cent. and company profits by 56 per cent.  On those figures, they were entitled to increased wages and in 1961 they commenced the eighth round.  The outcome of that was that the workers obtained an average increase of 12½ per cent.</P>
    <P>There is an allegation in this White Paper that the eighth round of wage increases had a tremendous effect on the increase in the cost of living. During that time, from 1958 to 1961, the cost of living did increase, as indicated by the consumer price index, by six points.  In August, 1961 it was 151 points and in November, 1962 it was 157 points, an increase of six points, or four per cent.  By November, 1962, it is reasonable to assume that those increases granted in 1961-62 had been absorbed in the economy. Therefore, we could well examine the effect of the eighth round and relate it to the six points increase in the cost of living index figure.  Food in-increased by .4, clothing by .3, housing .8, cigarettes .7, fuel and light .6, public transport .3, drink one point, and sundries by 1.9.</P>
    <P>The workers were not responsible for all these.  The fact that there was an increase in wages was not responsible for all the increases in the cost of living but the inference in this document is that the eighth round was responsible for the increase in the cost of living.  The Government should not forget that it was their direct action in increasing the prices of drink and tobacco that led to the increase in the cost of these commodities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was by the direct action of the Government that the <Col N="96" /> price of drink and tobacco was increased. The workers could not be held responsible for that.  The workers could not be held responsible for the increase in the price of imported coal, for the increase in the cost of housing. I do not see how the Government can say that it was the action of the workers which increased housing costs.  It was the Minister for Justice who introduced the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960 into this House and that Act allowed a 12½ per cent. increase in rents.  I do not say that all rents went up by 12½ per cent. but any increase there was was due to Government action.</P>
      <P>One particularly large firm in this city, the biscuit manufacturers, said that the eighth round of wage increases did not affect them at all, that they were well able to absorb it. Again, let me say that it is unfair to infer that the workers of this country have been responsible for the increase in the cost of living from 1958 to 1961.</P>
      <P>We are told of the dangers of increased wages on our exports and told that the eighth round increases had the affect of bringing about a reduction in our exports.  It is true that in 1962 there was a fall in exports of £6.8 million, but we should remember the extraordinary position we had with regard to the export of cattle and the fact that the value of our cattle exports last year decreased by £7¼ million.  The value of wheat exported, as compared with the year before, fell by £2,000,000.  I do not think the eighth round of wage increases could be said to have had any effect in the fall in our exports.  We should also remember that there was an increase of 5 per cent. in exports of manufactured goods to which the workers largely contributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been said that wage increases have an effect on our imports and tend to increase them.  The White Paper states that the eighth round definitely contributed to the expansion in our imports of consumer goods and that 8/- in every £1 of wages is spent on imports.  The Minister for Transport and Power said recently that out of every £ of the recent increase, 10/- was spent on imports.  I <Col N="97" /> wonder who spent all this money, or is that sort of expenditure to be attributed solely to the working-class community?  From January to November, 1962, imports increased by £10.8 millions but there is no mention at all of the fact that of those £10.8 millions £5.2 millions were accounted for by machinery.</P>
    <P>One would imagine, again from this White Paper, that there was an extraordinary increase in the importation of consumption goods.  For the first nine months of the year 1962, consumption goods represented 20.1 per cent. of our imports as against 19.8 per cent. in 1961.  I do not think anybody can, therefore, make a strong case to the effect that, in the last 12 months, the importation of consumer goods has gone up in any great way. The important thing with which the White Paper appears to be concerned &mdash;we are, of course, all concerned&mdash; is production and productivity.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon when he asks what is sacrosanct about the 12-months period.  I do not know whether or not we are supposed to stake our faith on the trends in every single 12 months.  I do not believe we should.  I do not know whether it is agreed by the Taoiseach that, as far as production and productivity are concerned, in respect of transportable goods, the pattern of productivity shows a sharp drop every second year as far as the increase is concerned.  I agree that everybody, whether manual worker or office worker, should be concerned about production, but I do not know that the red light should be given to the workers on the figures of production disclosed in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> and particularly the recent ones disclosed in their issue of September, 1962.  As I said, every second year seems to show a drop in the increase in production.</P>
    <P>What is more important, and what is much more desirable, is that there should be a bigger increase; but, once again, one gets the impression from the White Paper that production as far as the workers and their efforts are concerned, has dropped catastrophically in the past year.  The increase is <Col N="98" /> described in the White Paper as being 1.5 per cent. up to not quite the end of the last calendar year.  It is well for us to remember that, in respect of many of the industries, there have been pretty good increases in production. There is a varied picture of increase in production but, in respect of the furniture trade, paper and printing, food industries, metal and engineering, clothing and footwear, all important industries, all industries that employ many thousands of workers, there has been an increase in production for the year ended September, 1962, and increase much greater than what is described here in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Why was the Taoiseach, when he decided to issue a White Paper on Incomes and Output, so shy about talking about profits?  Profits are mentioned in this three-thousand-word document maybe twice&mdash;I know at least once&mdash;but maybe twice.  It is just not good enough to place all the emphasis on what the worker is getting, what he should not get, what he should not ask for, and no emphasis at all on the other side of the picture. This little diagram&mdash;diagram four on page 9 headed &ldquo;Domestic Income in Different Categories in 1961, Wages and Salaries 56 per cent.&rdquo;&mdash;is designed, in my opinion, to give the impression that workers, wage and salary earners, are getting more than their share.  With that diagram, the Taoiseach, in fairness to everybody, should have given an idea of the number of people involved in each sector.  We would know then how the national cake was being shared.</P>
    <P>Fifty-six per cent. of the domestic income goes on wages and salaries. How many wage and salary earners have we in the country?  I could not give exact figures but I know there are about 750,000 insured wage earners.  Assuming these are married, and have normal sized families, one can multiply that by three; therefore, between wages and salary earners, there would, I suppose, be 2,000,000 in this country, or 1,500,000 who account for 56 per cent.  of the domestic income.  How many are in this little shaded spot?  Those who have 7.6 per <Col N="99" /> cent. of the national income.  There are no diagrams or graphs dealing with profits.  Are profits not income? The only income apparently to which the White Paper wanted to refer was wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach should have told us, when he told us about wages, how profits have fared in recent years. Company profits in 1958 amounted to £39.1 millions.  In 1959, they increased to £47 millions, an increase of 20 per cent.  Company profits increased by 20 per cent., wages and salaries by four per cent.  In 1960, company profits amounted to £55.4 millions.  Company profits increased by 18 per cent., wages and salaries by 7½ per cent.  In 1961, company profits stood at £61 millions.  There was an increase of 10 per cent.  Wages and salaries increased by six per cent.  Between 1958 and 1961, company profits increased by 56 per cent.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to understand why the Government have attempted to create an artificial crisis for the purpose of curbing wages and salaries.  They say it is not a pay pause.  The Taoiseach need not take my description, or the description of Fine Gael, for it.  We will be told, I dare say, that we merely want to score political points off our opponents who are now in Government.  The consensus of opinion in the country is that it is a pay pause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions <Col N="100" /> are not composed exclusively of those who are either supporters or members of the Labour Party, and they have issued a document giving a unanimous view about this White Paper; they, in fact, describe it as a pay pause and warn the workers of the danger of the Government being allowed to go too far, if they get away with the proposals contained in this White Paper.  In any case, it is a clear intimation to State and semi-State organisations not to accede to claims which would arouse expectations in other employment.  As I said before, I see in this a clear direction&mdash; it will be accepted as such by employers&mdash;to refuse the legitimate applications that may be made by workers from time to time through their trade unions, applications for increases to eliminate, say, certain anomalies in wages, for a change in differentials, applications for increases as a status claim, or applications for increases in wages for the improvement of lowly-paid workers.  These are the normal negotiations carried on, whether there was any round of wage increases or not.  I believe they will be disrupted.  I believe employers will invoke this White Paper to refuse legitimate increases and so provoke discord amongst workers and disrupt the relations between the trade unions and some of the employers' organisations.</P>
    <P>One would imagine from speeches that have been made and from the general tone of this White Paper that wage rounds were indiscriminately or maliciously planned.  Such is not the case.  The Taoiseach himself has had many contacts with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They are aware of the economic situation that obtains in this country from year to year, and even from quarter to quarter, and they are not so malicious or spiteful as to engage in any precipitate action that would disrupt the economy of the country.  Such admonitions as are contained in the last two paragraphs are certainly not designed to win the confidence of the trade union movements in the difficult problems we have.</P>
    <P>All these claims, these rounds of wages, as they are described, are considered  <Col N="101" /> in conjunction with the change of prices and in connection with food subsidies and with fiscal changes which the Government may make from time to time.  The evidence of that is in every single one of the eighth round of wage increases that have been afforded to the workers through their trade unions in recent years.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the Employer-Labour Conference and let me say that it has been admitted by the two sides that progress has been made and friendly relations have been established. The Taoiseach also must have been aware, when he ignored this Conference, that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions had accepted a report of the Economic Sub-Committee which proposed that efforts should be made to establish a more rational and better informed basis for wage discussions and negotiations.  They recognised that there should be a new basis for satisfactory settlements and negotiations. They are not at all impressed by the Minister for Transport and Power when he usurps the functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and attempts to tell us how bad labour relations are and how bad negotiating machinery is.</P>
    <P>Therefore I ask: what reason have the Government for saying that the trade unions would act in an irresponsible manner or in a manner detrimental to the country's economy?  Free negotiation at all levels is of paramount importance if the goodwill of the workers is to be maintained on the problems we undoubtedly have and which will become greater in the immediate years ahead.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions as a body are concerned about economic expansion and increased productivity as much as and more than many other sections because they are the section which will be affected first, if the economy does not improve.  They are the individuals who will get the first knock, whether it is entry into the EEC, or EFTA, or whatever trade association you care to mention that is involved.  If the economy is disrupted in any way, it will mean unemployment and therefore the Government should not be antagonistic <Col N="102" /> towards them and provoke them as they have in this document.</P>
    <P>They should recognise the concern of the workers as displayed in the Employer-Labour Conference.  They should recognise that the trade unions and the workers have played their part, especially in recent years, and in the present crisis, when their work on the Committee of Industrial Organisation has been freely acknowledged by every single branch of industry which was investigated by this Committee. Again the responsibility with which the trade union movement view the economy must be evident in the work of their representatives on many State and semi-State companies.  In endeavouring to preserve the economy, in endeavouring, as we must in present circumstances, to increase production, every single section must take responsibility.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the evidence is there that the trade unions are prepared to accept that responsibility.  The Government have the main responsibility in the direction of the policy.  We thought that in this White Paper we would get some indication for increased production as far as the workers are concerned but we did not get it.  Instead, in my opinion, it was used as an instrument to make the workers a scapegoat for the failure of the Government's policies.</P>

      <P>This debate should be mainly, if not entirely, concerned with the facts set out and the problem presented in the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  It is also in some degree a test of the present Dáil's capacity to deal seriously and constructively with an important issue of public policy. We have had two speeches already. We have had a speech from Deputy Dillon, or rather should I say a flow of words, eloquent certainly, as we expected, disconnected, inconsequential, irresponsible in parts and if anyone knows what it is all about, he has a better capacity for understanding than I have.  We have had a serious speech from Deputy Corish, a relevant and serious speech, notwithstanding its many inaccuracies. If the debate, as I said, is a test of <Col N="103" /> the Dáil's capacity to deal seriously with the nation's problems, the score at the moment is one down and one up, all square.</P>
      <P>The problem with which the White Paper deals just cannot be brushed aside as Deputy Dillon tried to do because his Party finds itself with a need to make some political hay.  The position of this nation and the welfare of its people are far too important to be made stakes in some Party political game.  The responsibility for facing the facts, for resolving the problem which the facts present, rests not only on the Government but on the Dáil and indeed on every organisation and group within the community which has the power to do something about it.</P>

      <P>The conditions which will enable the nation's economic growth to continue with stability of prices and rising employment will not be maintained without effort.  The Government's attitude is that these conditions will not come about of their own accord; they have got to be planned and organised, and not organised by the Government alone, but throughout the whole community. Things which might assist them should be encouraged; things that could endanger them must be made known and checked; otherwise, we may find ourselves facing a repetition of the situation which developed in the second half of 1956 when the Coalition Government, of which both Deputy Dillon and Deputy Corish were members, in the face of deteriorating economic conditions, gave up their efforts to try to control developments, with the consequence of rapidly-mounting unemployment, intensified emigration, declining national income and contracting trade.  How often do we need to have the same experience before we learn the lesson?</P>

      <P>Whatever the outcome of this debate or whatever the <Col N="104" /> fate of the Government, we consider we have done our duty in bringing the elementary facts of the national situation to public attention.  The Government did not decide lightly to publish this White Paper.  We knew that we could have avoided, for some time at least, political difficulties for ourselves by defaulting on our responsibilities but the consequences to the country of our failure might be very serious. Having decided that it was in the national interest that widespread understanding of the situation should be promoted and encouraged, there was no sense in doing it in a way which would not command public attention, and that is the reason for the White Paper.</P>
      <P>In that White Paper or in this debate, we are not discussing some academic problem of interest only to economists or statisticians but matters that bear directly upon the welfare of the ordinary people who constitute our national community.  As far as the Government are concerned, we welcome this debate &mdash;and welcome it notwithstanding the misrepresentations of the Government's policy which have already taken place and which will no doubt be repeated before the debate is concluded&mdash; because it must help the securing of understanding amongst the people of the character of the issue we have to face, or at least understanding that we have an issue to deal with.</P>
      <P>The main concern of the Government is to ensure the restoration of conditions in which prices will become stabilised again, in which production will expand more rapidly by reason of increased export demand for Irish goods, both farm and factory goods, in which employment will rise more rapidly, in which national income will increase, with wages and salaries and living standards generally rising in line with national income.  Everybody must realise that if wrong decisions are taken now, taken either positively or taken by default, they can have very serious consequences particularly for the wage earners in respect of the security of their employment and the buying power of their wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deny the assertion in the statement published this morning by the Irish <Col N="105" /> Congress of Trade Unions that the White Paper was weighted against the workers or presented the problem facing us in a partisan way.  We will not yield a fraction of an inch to anyone in our concern for the welfare of the workers.  I will not concede to anybody in the Dáil or outside it that they are more fully dedicated to their welfare.  I resent the implication which often underlies the speeches of some Deputies here that there is one Party and one Party only that has a monopoly of interest in the workers of this country. It is the considered view of the Government that the welfare of our wage earners, their job security and their living standards are threatened by the gap which emerged in 1962 between incomes and output.  That is why we are worried about it.  The existence of that gap is a fact and it cannot be talked away by Deputy Dillon's eloquence.  It would be stupid for us to try to ignore it.  An ostrich policy will not make it disappear.</P>
    <P>Would it be an act of friendship to our wage earners to allow these dangers to develop and to do nothing to try to avert them?  I agree with that part of the Congress of Trade Unions' statement published today in which they say that if we act wisely now there is no danger of an economic recession, but if our rate of progress is slowing down, as it is, instead of speeding up, as we need, must we not ask ourselves why, try to find out the reason and put it right if we can?  Up to the second half of 1961, since the <i>Programme of Economic Expansion</i> began to bring about the results at which it was aimed, wages, salaries and output have all moved in line.  This gap between the level of incomes and the level of output did not appear during that period so that all wage earners and all salary earners benefited and benefited directly in a very real sense from the economic progress which the Government's policy had made possible. They became better off, and became better off without any serious disturbance in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>That is the way we wanted it to be, but it is a fact that from somewhere in the middle of 1961 up to now money incomes of all kinds have jumped <Col N="106" /> ahead whereas national output, the resources available to the community to pay these incomes, has not increased in corresponding degree.  I do not deny that the higher wages which workers received, the higher salaries paid to public officials and other people of that grade, meant real benefits to them. Of course it did.  The community was better off and they became better off notwithstanding the higher prices of commodities which were, in part at least, attributable to the higher costs which had been caused.  Their wages bought more.  The White Paper suggests that, taking into account all the increase in price which has occurred since, their wages are now able to buy 7½ per cent. more in commodities than previously.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Government policy &mdash;and this surely must be the aim and the policy of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions also&mdash;is to protect and preserve this gain, not to permit it to be frittered away by any unwise policy or, worse still, not to allow it to be lost by any failure arising out of political cowardice to expose and face the danger as we see it.</P>
    <P>Our problem now is to get national output up, to close this gap so that the gains which have been made can be consolidated.  That is primarily a task of getting some elementary economic truths understood and accepted generally in our community.  If incomes start to rise again before output catches up with their present level we shall be facing an economic crisis, a situation in which living costs will start rising rapidly, in which our export trade will begin to contract because our products will be uncompetitive in the world's markets, with serious unemployment as a consequence. Nobody wants these misfortunes.  There may be one or two Deputies in the House and some elements outside who would perhaps deliberately provoke them for some obscure purpose or political motive, but they do not count.  No responsible Deputy and no trade union leader wants them.  Yet they can happen without anybody wanting them.  That is the lesson of our experience and that is the point I want the Dáil to understand, that a <Col N="107" /> policy of drift, of sticking our heads in the sand and ignoring the facts, is not good enough at this time.</P>
    <P>I accept without argument the contention put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in their second statement that a rise in wages, a rise in earnings, during that period of 1961-62 was warranted and justifiable by reason of the country's improved economic conditions and because of the productivity trend, and I mean a rise in wages not related to any change in the cost of living because, in fact, there had been no such change for some years previously, the price situation having become stabilised. Over that period, a five per cent. increase in national output was recorded. That means that the resources of the country available to pay wages and maintain improved living standards had expanded to that degree.  That increase might have been larger perhaps if conditions had been different but&mdash; and this is the point I make in reply to Deputy Corish's argument about what was intended in this respect&mdash; nobody in this country, not the trade unions, not the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or anybody else, planned the dimensions of the increases which eventuated in the eighth round.  There was no examination by anybody of what average increases or what percentage increases were possible without adverse consequences on the price level, without adverse effects on employment or on national economic progress in any respect.  There were no discussions on that point between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers. There was no pronouncement from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as to how the long term interests of the workers might be affected by the way matters were working out.  The fact is&mdash;and we all know it here&mdash;that what happened then took everybody&mdash;trade union leaders and employers as well as ourselves&mdash;completely by surprise.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen a statement issued last week by an organisation which calls itself the Federation of Professional and Service Associations, <Col N="108" /> in which it is said that the eighth round as it is called started because the Government tried in 1961 to restrain salary increases.  It is always stupid, in my view, to make an assertion which most people know to be untrue.  The public memory is not that short.  The key agreement in the eighth round, the agreement which settled the dimensions of all the subsequent settlements, which determined the dimensions of wage increases given, was that for the electricians.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that it started it, but that was the key agreement and everybody here knows it.  That agreement was negotiated under the auspices of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It was the fact that the key agreement, as I think most sensible people recognised it to be, was negotiated under the auspices of a Government Minister which was taken as conveying official approval, and as an indication that the Government accepted that increases on that scale were possible for all workers without adverse consequences. If the Government were at fault over the eighth round&mdash;we have been criticised and are entitled to be criticised&mdash; it is because we did not intervene more strongly to advise restraint or try to procure a reasonable national agreement. As Deputy Corish said, there was a national agreement made in 1957.  He implied that that was done without any intervention by the Government, which was less than generous to the part I played in it, but leave that aside.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a national agreement facilitated by the Government and I think it was a very great pity that the practice then established was not maintained.  In my view, <Col N="109" /> the fault lay in the attitude of the Federated Union of Employers at that time.  In 1962, a national agreement was not likely.  The Federated Union of Employers were not prepared to think in terms of a national agreement until it was much too late.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions did not consider that they could negotiate an agreement which would be acceptable to all their affiliated unions.  The first rule of political wisdom for all of us is not to make the same mistake twice.</P>
      <P>I agree with what the Congress said in their statement this morning, that nobody is now planning a ninth round. Nobody planned the eighth round, either.  Indeed, as the Congress points out now very rightly in that statement, except in the one instance of that national agreement of 1957, none of the rounds of wage increases which we have had since the war was planned by anybody.  They developed out of the general situation.  That is one reason why, in the Government's view, the facts and considerations contained in the White Paper ought to be published to everybody, not merely to some select group of people who could control these matters.</P>
      <P>Some people have said that this White Paper was untimely.  This was the time for it, just at the period when the eighth round had spent itself and before another round had started.  If another round had already begun, it would have been too late.  The Government's decision, and it is the only decision which we can make effective by our own will, is that we will not start a ninth round within the Government services or that we will not permit these State bodies which exercise statutory monopolies, which have no problem of making profits, which have no difficulty in passing on increased costs to the public, to set in motion a process which could have disastrous effects for many workers in other less secure employments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the realities of this situation are better understood by the public and by workers generally than some Deputies here assume.  Labour Deputies are not the only members who go among the workers and know what they are thinking.  I read last <Col N="110" /> week in a paper the statement made by the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr. Jack McGougan, a statement which was based on a thorough understanding of economic realities and packed full of commonsense and every word of which I could endorse.  Indeed, I regret that only one of our daily papers had the sense to give it a reasonably adequate report.</P>
    <P>This morning's statement from the Congress of Trade Unions suggests that the outlook which their President had expressed last week prevails within the Congress and, if that is so, it certainly implies that agreement on the principles of economic policy at this time should not be impossible to secure.</P>
    <P>All members of the Labour Party who take an interest in what is happening elsewhere know that the attitude of the British Labour Party in relation to the corresponding problem arising in that country is not dissimilar to that of the Government here.  It is the Government's duty, as we understand it, to get the facts and the dangers which they imply known and understood outside our own direct sphere of responsibility.  We do not want powers to compel anyone else to accept our ideas or to conform to them.  We have not implied any intention of taking exceptional powers. Indeed, if a critical situation requiring unusual action or powers should look like developing, I think we would probably decide, assuming there was no element of urgency, that, one way or another, the public should be consulted. We do expect that everybody will take account of the facts and give proper weight to the views about them which we have expressed.</P>
    <P>The Congress statement complained that the Government did not consult them in advance, which was correct. It also stated that we proposed to use the Employer Labour Conference as an instrument of Government policy, which was not correct.  It was mentioned in the White Paper only as providing a convenient medium for tripartite discussions.  I am referring now to the first statement issued by the Congress, which was probably hastily drafted, which appeared the <Col N="111" /> day after the White Paper was published. Their second statement, the one published this morning, is much more serious, very much more constructive. I do not agree with all their arguments or with all their statistics but I agree with many of them.</P>
    <P>The prospects for the coming year, 1963, are that the growth of national output will not be less than it was in 1962, which is reckoned at about 3½ per cent.  That would not be enough to close the gap but it would go a very considerable way to doing so and to put the situation right unless the prospect of continuing progress at that rate is upset.  Now, it is difficult in the present state of international affairs to attempt to forecast how they may work out but it can be said that there is nothing now in sight on the international horizon which could upset that prospect.  Our problem is mainly an internal one.  We need to assure a rise of four per cent. in national output every year, if we are to achieve the target which we have set ourselves of a 50 per cent. increase in national income by 1970.  We believe that is a realisable target, even if it means that the nation has to achieve as much progress in this decade as it achieved in the past quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>It seems inevitable that there will be some further rise of imports in this year, mainly plant and material for new enterprises and for existing concerns extending and modernising their plants under the inducements and compulsions which the Government are giving them, but also, probably, of consumer items because the effects upon consumption of the eighth round increases in incomes will become in this year more fully operative than they were last year.  We have got, therefore, to achieve a rise in exports to meet that prospect of a further rise in imports and, indeed, beyond that again, to cancel the deficit which emerged in 1962.  To achieve that, we are relying mainly upon industrial exports.  No doubt, some increase in cattle exports is likely but the main prospect for securing a balance in our international payments this year depends upon increasing <Col N="112" /> our industrial exports and that cannot be done if we follow a policy which would have the effect of pricing our industrial goods out of export markets.</P>
    <P>Our industrial output increased by 8½ per cent. in 1960 and again by 8½ per cent. in 1961.  That was a rate of progress as high as was achieved by any other country in Europe, far higher than most, but in 1962, the rate of our industrial progress dropped to five per cent.  To estimate now for a five per cent. increase in 1963 would be optimistic, unless the overall competitiveness of our national economy is improved.</P>
    <P>There is a motion before the Dáil which asks the House to reject this White Paper because of the failure of the policies of the Government&mdash;the Fine Gael motion.  This motion was devised as a method of dodging the issue presented by the White Paper. It is a fence-straddling motion and fence-straddlers get only public contempt, and deserve nothing more.</P>

      <P>Do Fine Gael think &mdash;perhaps some of them will answer this question before the debate is over &mdash;that we should do nothing about it? They cannot evade that question for ever.  They may be able to do it to-day and tomorrow but before very long events will push them off their fence.  They must realise that, despite their evasiveness, despite their efforts to dodge this issue, they are now appearing in public as being against a policy of restraint.</P>

      <P>Is it right that the danger of a further general round of increases in incomes of all kinds should be created by Government inaction in respect of salary proposals arising in the Civil Service or in the State-sponsored organisations financed out of public funds?  While the White Paper says that the point at which normal pay adjustments within the public sector must be checked for the present, it is where they are of a character which could start off a general demand for corresponding increases in other sectors or for workers generally, or where they threaten national interests.  Do the Fine Gael Party consider that these things should be ignored?  Do they think that the Government, realising these dangers, could exhort restraint in private employment, while following a different line in the sectors which are directly under our control?  If the Government believe, as we do, that the continuation of the nation's economic progress requires understanding of the dangers of the situation and an appreciation of the actions which might intensify these dangers, do Fine Gael think the Government should remain silent, as they did in 1956 in similar circumstances, with the disastrous consequences <Col N="114" /> which they knew followed from it?</P>

      <P>Pressures for pay rises, which could have general repercussions, have been building up in some sections of the public service. I am sure the Irish Congress of Trade Unions may not be altogether unaware of them.  If these pressures were allowed to proceed, allowed to grow, they would produce similar pressures outside the public service and, I believe, a very widespread reaction amongst our farming community.</P>

      <P>I do not want to elaborate.  Deputy Dillon spoke about two nations, borrowing a phrase which he got from the <i>Daily Mail</i>.  If he used that phrase to instil in the minds of Irish workers the poisonous idea that they are being discriminated against on class grounds, it is proof of his total irresponsibility.  If there are two halves of this nation, if our community can be divided into two compartments, in one compartment are the salary and wage earners and in the other the farmers who have not got any eighth round.</P>

      <P>I want to make one point clear.  We are not carrying out an inquest on the eighth round.  We are concerned with what is going to happen in the future, with how we can protect the interests of our people, including the wage earners, in the future.  The Irish Trade Union Congress stated this morning that Government Ministers have spoken about a wages policy.  We have, and frequently, but not only Government Ministers have done that.  Some of the most important and enlightened statements on that matter have come from trade union leaders.  Only this month, Mr. John Conroy, General President of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, spoke on this very subject and said&mdash;I am quoting from the press of 4th February:</P>
      <P>It would be a most impressive advance in employer-worker relations if all the interests concerned could trust one another to the extent that they could sit down in conference to discuss and agree upon progress wage rates based on truth and justice and the acceptance of a policy of full employment.</P>
      <P>That is what we mean when we talk of a wages policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He complains that you did not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We mean by a wages policy the relationship between increases in wages, increases in profits, between all kinds of income increases and the nation's economic objectives which include stability of prices, increased production for export leading to increased employment, and the reduction of emigration.  These objectives are agreed by everybody, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to be national objectives.  It means a policy as generally understood and accepted by those who have functions that they will follow its guidance both in respect of demands by the workers, on the one hand, and the attitude of employers to these demands&mdash;neither asking more nor conceding less than the natural circumstances are agreed to justify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These problems we are dealing with <Col N="116" /> face every democratic Government of this time and all of them are trying to cope with them.  It is no use pretending that they are easy to solve and I am not going so to pretend. There are many solid difficulties.  There is the question of the authority of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to make agreements which are acceptable and binding on their constituent unions; and perhaps some reluctance to commit their influence in support of each agreement, after their experience during the electricians' strike. There is also the backwoods mentality still prevalent amongst some members of the Federated Union of Employers although I am assured it is not now a majority factor there.  We have to work out our own solution to these problems&mdash;a solution related to our own conditions and history.  One thing is certain, that is, that the countries which come closest to finding the right answers to these problems will make the most economic progress, will move most rapidly to full employment and steadily rising wage levels.</P>
    <P>In other countries, employers and trade unions expect guidance from their Governments and even demand it when it is not offered.  Their Government's views are rarely accepted without argument and we would not expect that they would be accepted here without argument, but it is absurd to suggest that the Government should have no views or, if they have, that they should not express them.</P>
    <P>In the same speech I have already mentioned, Mr. McGougan said that the final responsibility for the conduct of economic affairs and for planning must necessarily rest on the Government; and the ICTU in their statement said that the Government have overriding responsibility for economic progress. No sane Government would accept responsibility for economic progress, if they are to exclude, even to the extent of expressing opinions on the single most important factor affectting economic progress, the level of incomes and the expenditure it generates, which constitute more than half of national income.</P>
    <P>In some countries, there are arrangements for the objective and expert examination <Col N="117" /> of the national progress, achieved over some period in the past or which could be reasonably anticipated over some period in the future. The need for such an examination here was contemplated by the Employer-Labour Conference, as was pointed out in the statement of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions this morning.  This is something we can have.  This is what the Government want to discuss.  Policy making always begins with the ascertainment of facts. There may be room for argument whether the relationship between agricultural and industrial incomes is right, or whether increasing total employment is more important at any particular time than raising living standards, or whether commercial profits in any sectors could absorb wage increases without price adjustments. We can have these arguments, in public, if necessary, provided that all would accept that the end of the arguments would be a policy which all might follow&mdash;Government, State bodies, both employers and trade unions&mdash;a policy that would contribute to the growth of the nation's economy.</P>
    <P>If the Government proposals for discussion of these with the Employer-Labour Conference as suggested in the White Paper are not acceptable, is there an alternative?  We will consider any practicable proposals made to us. As the Minister for Finance said last weekend, nobody wants to keep down wages.  It is certainly not the policy of the Government.  Our aim is to get them, after the gap has been closed, moving upwards at a steady rate, which will not defeat its own purpose through higher prices or reduced employment. I do not suggest there is an easy way of relating wages to productivity, or even to the growth in the national income.</P>
    <P>Calculating productivity is not just a simple matter of dividing total national output by the total of workers employed.  We know that productivity can increase rapidly in some employments because of technical developments and in some others not at all. We know that there are vast differences in the bargaining powers of different <Col N="118" /> sections of workmen.  We know that many workers can make little or no contribution to productivity, and the scope of a sound national wages policy should include arrangements to ensure that they also will participate in due degree in increasing national resources. We know that some sections can by irresponsible action wreck any general policy, but I do not believe that there are any sections of workers, or of any other class, within our community in which a majority, if properly informed of the consequences, would vote to pursue sectional demands to an extent that would destroy the nation's prospect of future progress, or which would hurt their neighbours or their fellow workers either in their living costs or their employment.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion asks the Dáil to disapprove the White Paper for two reasons: first, that it interferes with the normal machinery for regulating salaries, wages and working conditions, and, secondly, because it is likely to promote discord between management and workers.  Neither of these reasons will stand up for one moment to examination.  The White Paper does neither of these things. It is true that the Government, in common with many responsible trade union leaders, and employers' leaders as well, do not consider the existing normal machinery, as it is described in the motion, for negotiating about employment conditions as very good or good enough.  Discussions for improvement of that machinery have been proceeding in the Employer-Worker Conference.  Personally I cannot see, having regard to the organisation of the trade union movement and the reluctance of the trade unions to delegate authority to conclude an agreement on their behalf to the Trade Union Congress, how improvement in this machinery can be made possible without Government help.  But the White Paper does not propose any change.  If, however, it does lead to serious consideration of the possibility of improving existing procedures it will have been well worth while; and, of course, improvement by general agreement is the desirable method.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade <Col N="119" /> Unions' statement this morning refers to discussions without Government interference.  That is all right but, if agreement is not found possible, the Government cannot be precluded from proposing changes which the public interest may necessitate.  Why the White Paper should promote discord between management and workers is incomprehensible to me.  It is the Government's production.  Nobody else had any part in it.  Nobody else inspired it in any degree.  That it leaves the Government open to misrepresentation has been made very clear but, so far as it concerns those who have functions in settling wages in private employment, it is our view that it helps both sides by setting out the facts of the national situation and the considerations which should guide their discussions.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Congress of Trade Unions referred, as Deputy Corish did, to the possible effect of the publication of the White Paper on trade union co-operation in the handling of problems facing the whole nation at this time.  Now I believe that that co-operation, which was given&mdash;and I readily acknowledge that it was given and that it was of great value&mdash;was inspired by the idea that it would benefit the workers, and that will become increasingly so in the course of the months lying immediately ahead of us. Any lessening of the degree of co-operation would therefore have the opposite effect.  The Government certainly do not desire it.</P>
    <P>The Congress also urges initiative rather than caution.  I am one who does not believe that there is any necessary conflict between these two qualities.  I believe in initiative and enterprise where expansion is clearly seen to be possible.  I also believe in the exercise of caution where there are danger signs to be noted.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion, which is the one we are immediately discussing, talks about the failure of the Government's economic policy.  We all know here, being political realists, that it is not the failure of the Government's policy but its success that is worrying them.  The measure of Deputy Dillon's <Col N="120" /> failure as an Opposition leader is that he has got his Party into the position that their only hope of an electoral success is some national economic catastrophe.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;rejects, specifically, that portion of the White Paper which calls for a wages pause, designed, in essence, to freeze the pay of city tradesmen and labourers, as well as that of farm and road workers and of those earning their livelihood by clerical employment, at a time when extremely high salaries are being paid to certain members of the Judiciary and executives of State and semi-State bodies such as CIE and Bord Fáilte; and considers that a positive policy to secure increased production should be initiated.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Upon my soul, having listened to the rodomontade of Deputy Dillon and the <Col N="121" /> demagoguery of the Taoiseach, one can only conclude that one of them should become chairman, or is aspiring to become chairman or president, of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  That may be thought by some to be a happy development but I would rather suspect that it is not so.  There was a time in this House when the words &ldquo;trade unionism&rdquo; were dirty words and that is within my memory as a member of the House.  Now it appears that the leaders of these two Parties are very anxious to court the apparatus of the trade union movement and it makes one suspect, I am afraid, that the trade union movement must not now be what it was in other days.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has treated us to a very lengthy dissertation on the economic position of the State and those of us who have ploughed through the White Paper are aware that in its essence, in spite of what has been said by the Taoiseach, it clearly implies that it is the Government's intention to stop wage increases.  It is obvious the Government could take power&mdash;of course they will not because it would be a very unpopular thing to do&mdash;to prevent wage increases in private employment. What they are doing is that which is nearest to hand: they intend, as far as we can read into the last two paragraphs of the White Paper, to prevent wage increases in such sectors of the economy as come directly or indirectly under their control.</P>
    <P>I have listened to what has gone on here and I may say that I have seldom listened to the leaders of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil without being reminded of a comic opera political song wherein, it will be remembered by some Deputies, it states:</P>
    <P>Every boy and girl alive</P>
    <P>Is born a little liberal, or a little conservative.</P>
    <P>To that proposition, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are dedicated.  But you could take out &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; and &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; and insert Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The difference between the two main Parties in this House is fractional.  It is the difference between like and dislike <Col N="122" />&mdash;personal animosities and perhaps memories of other days.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Closing the Gap</i> is the name given to this White Paper.  The best and most effective contribution that could be made by both major Parties here would be to close the gap between themselves because it is illusory and pretended.  There are in the Fine Gael Party, as there are in the Fianna Fáil Party, men of infinite goodwill who, because of their affiliations, must accept certain lines of policy and must try to defend them, but there is, at the same time, undoubtedly an air of unreality about the political situation in this country.  I believe, and I must agree with the Taoiseach in this, that the motion put down by Deputy Dillon is no more than a device, an endeavour to secure the removal from office of this Government.  I must say, and there are few who will say it here, that it is not my wish to precipitate an election at this time.</P>

      <P>The purpose of my motion is to impress on the Government that there is an alternative to what they propose in their White Paper.  That alternative could be summed up in one word, which so far has not been mentioned in the course of this debate.  That word is incentive. Nobody so far has suggested incentive to production.  The Taoiseach says our problem is to get national output up. Is it to be thought that we will achieve that by freezing wages while prices will undoubtedly be allowed to rise?  Is it not, on the other hand, reasonable to think that when wages are frozen, particularly the wages of the categories I mention in my motion&mdash;city tradesmen and labourers, farm and road workers, none of whom can be said to be living at any great luxurious levels of existence&mdash;they must accept this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give an example of a case which came to my notice yesterday.  As I have often mentioned here, my constituency embraces an area which <Col N="123" /> contains the greatest pool of urban workers in this country and possibly in these islands, Ballyfermot.  Yesterday a case was brought to my attention which is not untypical, and I should like the members of the House to imagine what the impact of a wage freeze would be in this instance.  A man with six children has to travel up to five miles to work and this means substantial bus fares because of the <i>diktat</i> of the political appointee of the Government, Dr. Andrews, who is above all reproach by anybody in this House or in the country. This man's bus fare amounts to 12/- per week.  The eldest of his family of six is nine years of age.  That man's total income from wages is £10. 7. 0. per week.  He is employed by a semi-State body and works from 7 o'clock in the morning until 11 at night.  His rent is 33/- a week.  It is quite easy to figure out what he has left for his family when he pays his rent, which he must pay.</P>
    <P>How will a wage freeze hit that man and what will this mandarinistic language in which we cloud our facts mean to him?  That is a typical case. It happens throughout my constituency and throughout rural County Dublin as well.  The road workers of County Dublin could never be described as being highly paid.  A fortnight ago, a recommendation was made which would give them an increase of 10/-a week.  What will happen to that? Will they get it?  Their present wages are less than £8 a week.  Is a stop being put to all these suggestions and proposals?  These are questions to which I want the answers.  Health inspectors in this area are the subject of a recommendation from the Labour Court for an increase in their salaries. Will they be stopped by these proposals in the White Paper?</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the word &ldquo;incentive&rdquo; has not been brought into this discussion so far.  I shall try to develop that somewhat.  Is it better to encourage people to increase productivity rather than try to force them?  I am an unrepentant believer in the modern conception of incentive and encouragement as against economic pressure. <Col N="124" /> What is suggested in these two paragraphs is the exertion of economic pressure on the workers to produce more in order to bridge the gap we are told exists by the orators and economists.</P>
    <P>The question may be asked: what form should the incentive take?  Take, for instance, the man I have mentioned, who is paying 12/- a week in bus fares.  In respect of him and in respect of thousands of other workers in Dublin, who are being asked to increase productivity, would it not be an incentive if a worker's ticket for travel in the Dublin area were introduced? I think it would.  But we were told on a previous occasion that it was a function of the Board of CIE, which means, in effect, a function of the Chairman, and that the Minister for Transport and Power could do nothing about it.  We cannot interfere when it is something beneficial to the worker, but apparently the Government can interfere very effectively when it is a question of stopping wage increases or anything of that nature.</P>
    <P>Incentives&mdash;take the situation of any corporation tenant in Dublin under the differential rent scheme.  I take it that when we ask for increased productivity, part of the drive towards that end could very well be the working of overtime.  Anybody who has worked manual overtime ten or 12 hours a day will agree with me that it is one of the most strenuous and unhealthy operations that can be undertaken.  If a Dublin worker who is a tenant of a corporation house works overtime and gets £2 or £3 a week extra, which he spends on his family, there is a system &mdash;equalled only in the days of the Gestapo &mdash; whereby the corporation check up on his earnings every six months.  He might well receive a bill, and out of every £1 he has received by way of overtime, he will have to pay 3/4.  That system of differential rents might well be tackled by the Government.  Its ramifications, socially and economically, are far too wide and too serious to be left to the tender mercies of a small group in Dublin Corporation, not all of whom are ill-intentioned men.  Indeed, many of them are well-intentioned but may not <Col N="125" /> be as alive to the problem as those who represent areas in which tenants have to pay differential rents.</P>
    <P>Incentives&mdash;I would suggest that the Government say to the people concerned, who make up a large part of the labour force in this country: &ldquo;We want you to increase productivity and we want to help you by giving you encouragement and incentives.  We are going to say to Dublin Corporation that they should give you a fair break and not be taking every spare halfpenny. We are going to ask Dr. Andrews to institute a weekly or daily ticket for workers in Dublin as an incentive to greater productivity.&rdquo; These are things we can do without disturbing in any way the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the white-collar workers.  On the fringe of Dublin, we have from 10,000 to 11,000 houses purchased under SDA grants&mdash;a situation not equalled in any other urban centre.  Most of these houses are occupied by white-collars workers.  These people are being pressed gravely by rates and by interest charges on the loans they obtained from the local authorities.  Surely it would be an incentive to those people to increase productivity in their own spheres of employment if the Government were to take their courage in their hands and say: &ldquo;We are fed-up with this business of usury, whereby, by means of excessive interest rates, the banks are taking their profits out of the pockets of hard-working people trying to rear their families respectably and decently&rdquo;&mdash;profits which are finally put up in coloured lettering on the plate glass windows of their offices in the centre of the city and throughout the country.  These are the things which occur to me.</P>
    <P>Is there any point in mentioning the farm workers here?  The farmers have no lack of mourners in this House.  I remain to be convinced, however, that the farmer is suffering economically.  I think the standard of living of farmers has increased very considerably over the past 20 years.  Whenever I go to chapel gates&mdash;as I have to occasionally because part of my constituency is as rural as the south or west of <Col N="126" /> Ireland&mdash;I see the farmers arriving. They do not arrive in pony-traps or secondhand cars.  They are well-to-do, and more luck to them.  However, I am talking about the farm labourers. There are few of them left.  Any of them who could get the fare have gone to Coventry, London and Manchester, and small blame to them.  All they got from the farmer when they were here was the hardest side of the bed and the thinnest cut of the bread.</P>
    <P>The farm labourers should be encouraged to remain.  An inducement should be given to them.  I suggest there should be some system by which a special pension could be given to farm labourers as distinct from other sections of the community.  But the farm worker who spends his life on an Irish farm winds up the same as the day he began, with nothing but the clothes he stands up in, but with plenty of illnesses and disease and the prospect of an early grave and, possibly, the old age pension will arrive.  There should be some incentive for people in rural areas such as farm labourers and other rural workers.</P>
    <P>The point I want to emphasise, and the reason why I want to put this motion, and endeavour to get a vote on it, is to persuade the Government to implement the idea of encouragement rather than the idea of economic compulsion.  I shall conclude on this because I want to facilitate other Deputies who, I am sure, are very anxious to participate in the debate. There has been mention of the awful possibility, as it has been described, of a ninth round wage increase.  I suggest to the Government that they should stop thinking in these terms and should begin thinking in these terms of a first round of rent, bus fare and price reductions which we have not yet had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish referred to the violent reaction which he alleged the publication of the White Papers created.  I think the violent reaction was confined to statements made in the House to-day by Deputy Corish and Deputy Dillon.  Most people in the country accept the White Paper for what it is, a request for the exercise of restraint in wage demands in the interests of the national economy as a whole.  The Government have no desire to interfere with ordinary methods of wage negotiation and settlement and for a long time, it has been the policy of all Governments in this country to allow wages and working conditions to be settled by direct negotiation between the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>The Government have provided in the Industrial Relations Act the machinery which the parties themselves require to assist them in arriving at settlements in the event of there being disagreements or disputes in the course of negotiations.  In the public sector, the policy has not been to set the pattern but to follow the lead given in the private sector of employment. The Labour Court, as everybody knows, are free of any Government control and of any Ministerial direction and they also appear to follow the pattern that has been set in the private sector by free negotiation between employer and employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody can say that there is anything wrong with such a system as long as it does not lead to any abuse.  I use &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; in the context of achieving results that would be dangerous to the interests of either side.  There is nothing wrong with this system as long as it is not carelessly applied or haphazard in its effects.  Since the war, workers here as in many countries, have achieved wage increases at reasonably regular intervals. <Col N="129" /> We tend to call them wage rounds nowadays; and the level of the increase, except where it has been decided in advance between the representatives of the workers and the employers' organisation, is usually set by the first important sector of employees who negotiate a settlement.  The first such settlements can be haphazard in themselves.  On occasion, they can be set at an unduly high level by relatively small groups of workers who, by reason of a strong position they occupy in an essential industry, for example, can perhaps force employers to settle beyond what would appear to be reasonable in the public interest generally.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, a particular category of workers may in the same fashion, by their own method of negotiation, have increases set at a level which would be somewhat lower than increases <i>pro rata</i> obtained by subsequent negotiations in respect of other sectors of the working community. In the latter case, what usually happens is that those who first negotiated the comparatively low settlement will move again to have their increase equated to the increases achieved by subsequent groups of workers.  That inevitably sets off a leap-frogging trend because the employees who got the benefit of subsequent settlements will naturally try to maintain the differential they obtained.</P>
    <P>In the case of the first category I mentioned, where unusually high increases are obtained, the tendency will be for every other wage group to seek <i>pro rata</i> increases.  When this happens, it sets a dangerous pattern, not so much that anybody desires to depress wages but because everybody desires a reasonable pattern of wage increases consistent with national production.  It cannot be denied that something like that happened in 1961. I was very familiar with the emergence of the eighth round because, as the Taoiseach mentioned, I was directly concerned with it in so far as I was invited to intervene in the electricians' strike.</P>
    <P>The electricians, who were employed by private contractors and the ESB, applied for an increase.  The Labour Court recommended an increase of 4d <Col N="130" /> an hour which they regarded as consistent with increases given to comparative workers in other sectors of employment.  The electricians rejected that.  The employers offered an increase of 6d an hour subsequently; which offer was again refused.  Eventually, the electricians negotiated 7d. an hour which was 75 per cent. more than what the Labour Court regarded as an average of the increases given to other sectors of employees.  That increase was higher than many people had anticipated would be received and there is no doubt that the electricians used the very strong position they were in at the time.</P>
    <P>We all remember the debates that followed in September, 1961, when there were complaints about the danger of hospitals being without electricity, the danger of death or serious illness to people who might require operations where operation theatres required electricity, the danger of a power supply failure which would affect many industries and that might well cause the disemployment of tens of thousands of workers throughout the country.  There was also the position whereby the Irish Congress of Trade Unions advised the members of other trade unions in the ESB, and in other bodies where electricians were on strike, to proceed to work, notwithstanding the strike of the electricians.  Nevertheless, these individual members refused the directive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Nobody will deny that this set of facts existed.  Ultimately, because of their strength, the electricians were able to demand a wage increase which went as high as 75 per cent. than what was regarded by the Labour Court as a reasonable increase at that time.</P>
    <P>That sparked off what is now referred to as the eighth round even though some members of the Labour Party said it had started before that; but it had started at a lower level and it was inevitable that workers who had already secured wage increases then would seek to have their increases equated by the rate subsequently established.  That gave rise to demands and settlements of a similar nature.  Deputy Corish attempted to suggest that the average <Col N="131" /> rate negotiated as a result of the eighth round was 12/-.  He must know that the average rate in fact was 20/- to 25/- in the case of male workers and from 10/- to 15/- in the case of female workers.</P>
    <P>Nobody decries wage increases at that rate as long as productivity and a similar amount of goods to meet the wage levels operating would be produced. Now, it was in the light of that situation that the Employer-Labour Conference was first contemplated. The employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions decided, having regard to that experience, certainly in the weeks immediately following, to negotiate the possibility of having an annual conference and the Government were very pleased to see that move. While some people may have been a little disappointed with the results to date, those who were disappointed may have been expecting too much to emerge from the first meeting which was held last summer.  Since then there have been further negotiations and I would encourage the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to maintain these contacts with the employers so that a reasonable and sensible standard of labour relations may be worked out by the workers and employers.</P>
    <P>In a reference to that conference the White Paper in Paragraph 19 states:</P>
    <P>The Government propose to invite the National Employer/Labour Conference, as representing organisations of employers and labour, to discuss a method by which an objective assessment of the economic position and potentialities may be made from time to time with the object of assisting those who have responsibilities in settling wage and salary rates in private employment in establishing a more orderly relationship between income increases and the growth of national production.</P>
    <P>The Government in making that proposition do not seek to impose any particular system on workers and employers.  It would prefer to maintain what is the position heretofore; to maintain and support a sound system developed by these interests <Col N="132" /> themselves; the Government instead of proposing a revision of negotiating machinery has waited for a proposal from the Labour-Employer Conference. As I said last night, following the strike to which I have referred I conducted a review within my own Department and in consultation with other Departments of our industrial relations machinery.  As I said, I had crystalised my thinking on what alterations should be proposed but I am still awaiting the outcome of proposals to be made by the appropriate sub-committee of the Labour-Employer Conference in that respect, to assist and guide me in whatever proposals I will ultimately bring forward.  Even now the White Paper does not put forward any proposal for general adoption. There are four specific parts in that White Paper.  First of all, it calls timely attention to the critical situation that was developing; secondly it calls for short term restraint in wage demands; thirdly it promises, for its part, restraint in the public sector and fourthly, as I said, it calls on the Employer/Labour Conference for the establishment of long term means of curing the problem, that is undoubtedly with us, of haphazard increases and wage adjustments.</P>
    <P>I do not think any fair minded body of men could say that the action of the Government in refusing to bury its head in the sand is calculated to interfere with the normal machinery for regulating wage and other conditions of work, or likely to promote discord between management and workers.  Some Deputies, even Deputy Dillon, referred rather disparagingly I thought, to economists.  Economists are people employed by all types of organisations no less by Governments and if economists warn the Government of certain trends and the Government having examined that warning are convinced that certain trends are there, it is the duty of the Government to acknowledge them.  If an individual had a doctor whom he consulted regularly and received certain advice about pursuing a course, or that failing to pursue some other course that would have dire results on his health, it would be very wrong for that person, particularly if he had <Col N="133" /> other responsibilities, to ignore that advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very bad if the doctor had told him a month before that he was in the prime of life and not to have any worries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Conditions change, I suggest.  I am asking why should people be annoyed because the Government have seen fit to make a statement in the White Paper on the desirable relations that should obtain between money incomes and output.  We all know that it is not so much a matter of what is in the paypacket every week but how many goods that paypacket can buy.  If a pay packet increases, if the man had £15 a week and it is increased to £16 by reason of a wage agreement, and if the £16 purchases only the same or even less than he was able to purchase previously with the £15, then there was no effective increase given to that employee but in fact his conditions have worsened.</P>
      <P>It has been said that the Government's approach to this problem is a negative one.  If, on the other hand, the Government knowing the trends that were becoming apparent, the trends of the disparity between income and national output, took no action then not only would their policy have been negative but they would have been negligent.  I do not think the Government is so naive as to expect that anybody who is in Opposition today would not regard this as a golden opportunity for berating the Government. It would have been very easy for the Government not to have taken action such as this, not to court political displeasure but they would have been guilty of negligence in their duty to have regard for the national interest.</P>
      <P>I suggest that there was a certain amount of procrastination which led to the serious position in which we found ourselves in 1956 and early 1957 when emigration figures reached almost 95,000 a week.</P>

      <P>They are unduly high again but maybe that is one of the results of the disparity in regard to wages and output and the lack of competitiveness in our output.  Deputy Dillon in referring to that position in 1956 and 1957 sought to suggest that the Korean War was responsible for it and not Government inactivity.  The Korean War was finished in 1953 and it is hard to blame the sins of the Koreans on the economic position that arose here in 1956 and 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, it would be wrong for any Government to allow such a situation to develop again.  The Irish Government is not alone in its concern for seeing that money incomes and output keep in step.  The recent OECD Report on policies for price stabilisaation which I have here indicates what is being done in other countries.  I think the Taoiseach mentioned generally that the Governments of other countries had regard to an income policy and took certain action for much the same purpose as we have issued this White Paper; to draw attention to the necessity for closing the gap between incomes and output. In the Netherlands in 1945 a law was passed setting up a Government-appointed college of mediators to review collective bargaining agreements to determine whether or not they were consistent with the national interest. In Austria an equa-partite price and wages commission was set up composed of representatives of the Government, trade unions, commercial and industrial organisations and a consumer group.  In France, the Government has attempted, even though it <Col N="135" /> has not taken action yet, to get employers and trade unions to exercise restraint in wage determination.  That is the situation in most countries with whose economies we are familiar.  Why should it be suggested then, when the Government find a serious situation and suggests that the national Employer-Labour Conference might take account of it, that the Government are trying deliberately to depress money incomes?</P>
    <P>The Government for some years recently have been conscious of the national need to achieve a regular and substantial increase in output as one of the essential elements of the compound necessary to make us more competitive in world trade and in order to improve the living standards of our people.  To achieve this the Government have put forward certain propositions, have taken certain administrative actions and initiated certain legislation.  Deputy Corish suggested today that increased productivity could come only from the workers but the Government know that increased productivity rests with more than one sector of the industrial arm.  Management and workers have each their part to play have in increasing productivity.  I do not have to outline here all the legislative and administrative measures the Government have taken in attempting to increase our productivity.  We have our Export Promotion Board, technical assistance grants, the Productivity Committee, the Committee on Industrial Organisation and other bodies.  The sole purpose of these is to make us, in our industrial sector primarily, as far as these specific activities I mentioned are concerned, more productive so as to maintain our position in the home and world markets and to improve the standard of living of our people.</P>
    <P>Recently our people resented what was regarded as a UNO Report on the economic position in this country which referred to us as an under-developed country.  That report was clarified later and, I understand, we were referred to as a country in the course of economic development but, of course, that definition can be applied <Col N="136" /> almost to any country.  However, we were right to resent any suggestion that we are under-developed in the accepted sense internationally.  We have a good educational system, even though it may have some faults.  We have good communications, good housing, good health services and other facilities for our people.  Above all, I think we are a reasonably intelligent people, a people that can understand and accept actions by the Government if they feel that in the long run, though they may be unpalatable for the moment, those actions are in the best interests of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we are far from being a highly industrialised country.  We are geographically situated between two great democracies who enjoy a high standard of living, perhaps higher than we enjoy.  It is only natural that we cannot escape the influence of those two countries and that we should aspire to the standard of living enjoyed in them.  In many cases, we have achieved these standards but all these aspirations cannot be achieved without hard work and reasonable effort by ourselves.</P>
    <P>We cannot deny that in many sectors of our industrial economy whether at operative, management or administrative level, our output per man is not as high as it is in those highly industrialised countries.  Therefore, we must work to the situation&mdash;in fact, exceed it if possible having regard to our short run in industrial products&mdash;when our output per man is as good as it is in the factories and other economic producing units in other countries.  Because we are a small country, economic repercussions can affects us more seriously than they do the larger and more industrially advanced countries. Repercussions that might be momentary in their cases present serious problems to us.  It is only by our combined efforts whether we are on the worker, employer or administrative side, that we can overcome those problems as they arise.</P>
    <P>We often refer to the national cake. Deputy Corish referred to it today. The national cake is I suppose, synonymous with our national product.  It can be as good only as the ingredients that go into it, and these are the <Col N="137" /> individual efforts of the complex of our industrial arm here.  The mixture will be as good only as the quality of these efforts, and it will meet the needs of our people only when we all take a fair share of it.  Having shared it out we can go on to make bigger cakes to meet the needs of a bigger and better-off community as time goes on.</P>
    <P>If I might break off the metaphor, the partners in industry, the workers and employers, are entitled to their fair shares.  Profit will have to be such as not only to present a fair return but to leave sufficient for reserves for re-investment, because re-investment will generate new industry and other economic activity. Similarly wages must be adequate; and if one of those elements in the industrial partnership outruns the other the partnership which is required and its ultimate purpose will be more difficult of achievement.</P>
    <P>The Government do not wish to exercise control over wages or profits, as long as fair shares are being enjoyed.  Higher wages are good if they are accompanied by appropriate advances in national output because they increase the standard of living, they stimulate buying and generate increased trade.  Higher profits are good, if they stimulate new investment. Neither is possible unless the end product will sell either at home or abroad, and whether it is to sell at home or abroad, the product will be meeting increasing competition in the years to come.  It is not much use for an industrialist to draw handsome profits without making adequate provision for reserves, if without doing so, his machinery will have run down and his product will be all the worst for it.  It will be of little avail to workers if they receive high wages and if, by reason of those high wages or other elements, the product they make is priced out of the market and therefore cannot sell.  It will ultimately mean disemployment, on the one hand, and perhaps less purchasing power, on the other.</P>
    <P>We are approaching free trade conditions. I do not want to talk about <Col N="138" /> the Common Market in its relation to the present context of ensuring that whatever wage increases are negotiated by the workers of this country should be matched with increased output. Whatever profits our industrialists will earn also should be matched by appropriate provision for reserves and re-investment and replacement so that they on their side, with the worker, can play a bigger and more effective part in making their end product more acceptable in price to the market. With the reduction of the tariff wall&mdash; and it is being reduced brick by brick; even if we never did it unilaterally, it would be imposed on us&mdash;the necessity for restraint along these lines will become all the more apparent in the years to come.  It is not the Government's intention to impose that restraint.  I will repeat what I said earlier, that the White Paper makes a few points, first of all calling for restraint for a short term, promising restraint in the public sector for its part, and ultimately calling for a greater effort to bridge this gap that has undoubtedly shown up, the disparities, whether we like them or not, between incomes and output.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It had been my intention to confine the remarks I have to make to persons referred to in Paragraph 21 of the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  That section of the community are described as persons whose remuneration is provided directly or indirectly from public funds or whose employment arises in the provisions under statutory authority of public services.  That is a summary way of saying those sections of the community whom the Government can coerce by the power of the purse will be made the victims of the proposals in this White Paper.  The Government have no power over the trade unions. They have no power over organised labour.  They have power over the Civil Service, electricity supply workers, national teachers and other sections of the community within the range of the description I have referred to in Paragraph 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has asserted that the statements <Col N="139" /> made here by various speakers, particularly from the Labour benches, that there was a violent reaction from the publication of this White Paper, were without foundation.  In fact, as I understood him, he created the impression that the public have really taken this not merely mildly but with great interest and were really tremendously attracted by the series of economic disquisitions that are contained in the first 20 paragraphs of this White Paper.  I wonder have the Government completely lost touch with the people and with public opinion.  We have been reading about, hearing from the radio and seeing on television, the violent reactions that took place in consequence of the pay pause throughout England.</P>
    <P>I understood the Taoiseach when he was speaking this afternoon to suggest that there was no such thing as a pay pause, that this White Paper did not in fact represent a pay pause. Whether he is technically correct or not in that respect may be a matter for argument, that it is not really a pay pause because the only persons who are paused in their pay are the persons to whom I have adverted&mdash; civil servants, electricity supply workers, possibly corporation workers, teachers and various other categories of that kind.  To them, it is a pay pause and nothing else.  It may be argued that there is no pay pause imposed at the present moment on labour or working men, organised workers of any kind, but there certainly is a hint, and more than a hint, in the White Paper that if the invitation which is extended in this White Paper is not accepted, then consequences will follow of a drastic character.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he thought everybody in the country was interested in this.  With the tremendous publicity given to the British pay pause, with the disastrous results that followed from the imposition of that pay pause in England, the tremendous unemployment and discomfort and hardship of every kind for various categories, is it any wonder that when this document is introduced, whether technically it may or may not be a <Col N="140" /> pay pause, it produces immediately in the minds of the public, whatever the Minister may say, this impression that this is a pay pause.  Whether organised labour, trade unions or the Irish Congress of Trade Unions think it is a pay pause or the equivalent to one or the foreshadowing of one, there can be no doubt that among the persons on whose behalf I am speaking it is a pay pause.</P>
    <P>As I said, I intend to speak, I hope, very shortly, on behalf of those people, but I will have to make some comments on certain remarks made by the Taoiseach and repeated in a more mild degree by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in reference to the conduct of the Government they were pleased to call the Coalition Government. I should like to state the position that I take, personally, for my own part, on this White Paper.  My own conviction is that the economic conditions in this country are not sufficiently serious to have justified the upset that has undoubtedly been caused by the publication of this White Paper; that even if the conditions in the country were such as to justify this lesson in political economy being given through the White Paper to the public, the production and publication of this White Paper was not the proper method to achieve the results the Government wished to obtain and, thirdly and lastly, that even if the conditions in the country were such as to require some such action as envisaged in the White Paper and even if the production of the White Paper were desirable, the production of the White Paper would not produce the results desired by the Government and the whole manoeuvre is entirely futile and, in my view, contrary to the national interest.</P>
    <P>With the experience of the British people under the pay pause, with the hardship that was caused by that in mind, surely the public were entitled to say: &ldquo;What is the meaning of the publication of this White Paper at this stage?  What are the Government at? Are they merely concerned with economics?  Are they really concerned with giving a covert warning&mdash;and is <Col N="141" /> that the real meaning&mdash;that economic conditions in this country are not as we have been led to believe over the past 12 or 18 months by the production of White Paper after White Paper heralding and blaring forth the claims of the Government for the success of their economic programme?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an uneasiness, I believe, abroad that there is something more behind this White Paper than appears on it.  The Government seem to have a passion for White Papers.  They come out at periodic, intermittent intervals, telling the people that they never had it so good, telling the people that they now have a good economic policy, not like the last Government; that everything is going grand; trade is booming; exports are grand; the Christmas trade was very good indeed in the shops and elsewhere.  That was the advocacy of Government and the propaganda that was put out, certainly up to the very eve of the production of this White Paper.  With the people thinking that they were never so well off, believing that because Christmas trade was so good and cattle prices were good enough, and all the rest of it, things were all right, out comes the White Paper.  Is it any wonder that the query is being generally asked, &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?  Are things more serious than we were led to believe?&rdquo; Why is it that up to the date of the publication of this White Paper everything was grand, except of course the bad matter of the adverse balance of trade?  We were never so well off and everyone was going to be better off, with more industry, more employment, greater productivity and greater hope, therefore, for the sharing of workers and salaried people in the product of industry.  Now this White Paper comes out with its economic disquisitions in it and I, like Deputy Dillon, shall have a few points to make about economists also.</P>
    <P>I should think that a cynical person, one of those people who were referred to by the Taoiseach inferentially, when he made the grandiloquent expression of view that the business of the nation and the welfare of the people are too serious to permit of the exercise of Party politics&mdash;I wish <Col N="142" /> he had followed that principle when we were in trouble in the last Government&mdash;might ask the question: If the situation is of that kind, so serious as that, how does this White Paper repair the possible fissures and cracks in the economy?  Does not it lead to lack of confidence, coming immediately after the asseverations continuously made by every Minister of the Government, that we were never so well off and everything was going to be grand?  Why this sudden brake put upon all things and warnings issued?  I do suggest, therefore, that the publication of this White Paper was not the proper way to bring to the attention of the public that something serious, without telling them how serious it was, was in existence in the Irish economy.  That was not the way to do it.</P>
    <P>I have read this White Paper, 21 paragraphs of it, obviously drawn by an economist or financier, or both, or a combination of various economists and financiers.  It is all economic principles and statistics.  Having given this picture of a serious position existing in the economy that requires serious effort if the deterioration is not to continue and become worse, the Government say they have two proposals to make.  Of the 21 paragraphs there are 18 of them dealing with economic principles and there are two proposals. So that, in this situation in which the Government in this White Paper and through the Taoiseach and through the Minister for Industry and Commerce say to the country that there is a serious situation that requires immediate remedy, they have two proposals.  What are they?  They have two practical proposals to meet this serious situation.  One is to invite the National Employer-Labour Conference, as representing the organisations of employers and labour, to discuss a method by which an objective assessment of the economic position and potentialities may be made from time to time.  Their first and principal proposal to deal with this serious situation, almost amounting to an emergency, requiring that hardship should immediately come upon the various sections of the community on whose behalf I am speaking, is to <Col N="143" /> issue an invitation to a conference to have a talk.</P>

      <P>In that position, with the suggestions of the Government, the proposals in this White Paper as to the economic position of the country and the urgency of its remedy, can anybody consider that the Government can be serious in that if their most practical proposal is to invite a conference to have a talk with them and their second proposal is to catch by the throat the employees over whom they have control and whom they can coerce and make them suffer as they have made them suffer right down through the years since Fianna Fáil first took office in 1932?  Can anybody take this White Paper seriously in that set of facts?</P>
      <P>If it was a serious position, as is alleged in the White Paper and as stated and asseverated in this House by the Ministers, why did they not have the conference before they issued a White Paper?  Could not they issue that invitation and carry on with their discussions before frightening the public, before bringing a state of unease all around the country, before initiating the lack of confidence which is the worst thing possible for a Government to try to operate in?  Would it not have been easier to do that before issuing the White Paper?  That is their remedy: We will issue invitations to this National Employer-Labour Conference and we will have a talk.</P>
      <P>Can anybody take the Government seriously when that is their principal proposal to remedy what the economists and financiers say in this White Paper is a very serious position?  The balance of trade gone wrong; apparently, the workers and the salaried people in the ESB and the Government service and elsewhere getting too much money and should not get any more, and the people whose job it is to make wealth are not doing their job either because labour is getting too much money&mdash;that is the thesis in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> I have never concealed during the course of my public life my sympathy with the people on whose behalf I am speaking here tonight, or my sympathy with labour and theis essential ideals, however I may differ from them in details.</P>
    <P>From 1932, the Fianna Fáil Party, through their Government in office, have adopted the same scheme as they have adopted here.  When they came into office&mdash;there are people who have forgotten this and some who were not born when it happened&mdash;their first action was to reduce the salaries of civil servants and other public officials for no reason under the sun except that they thought that everybody was getting too much money.  During the War, the people who suffered most were the people on whose behalf I am now speaking, salaried people, workers, people in public service and those living on fixed incomes.  Nobody knows how much human misery was inflicted in those days and it is proposed now, as the second important way in which the Government can regulate this serious economic position, to make these people suffer as they made them suffer before.</P>
    <P>I want to make here tonight my strong protest against this sort of action.  We are told that there must be an equality of sacrifice.  What is that equality of sacrifice to be?  Are Ministers and Deputies who got increases recently to have a cut in their salaries?</P>

      <P>Are the farmers on whose efforts the whole country relies to be inflicted with some sort of sacrifice so that these economic principles can be put into operation? Are the industrialists and the employers to be cut in their profits in order that the workers will not get as much money as they ought to get? So long as we continue private enterprise, the incentive to increased production, which is the basis of this White Paper, must be proper and remunerative profits for capital invested.  The people who are now exhorted to cut their profits are the <Col N="145" /> people who were exhorted to save and to put their savings into the development of this country.  What are they to do if there are to be less profits from Irish industry?  How are those people whose interests I have very much at heart, the widows and others who live on fixed incomes mostly from Irish industry, to live if we are to have a standstill on these profits so that the workers will not have as much money, on the principle of equality of sacrifice?</P>
      <P>As I have said, the thesis and basis of this White Paper is increased production. Who is going to produce? Is it not the workers who produce? Where is the incentive for them to produce if their wages are to be cut?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice quibbles at my use of the word &ldquo;cut&rdquo; and perhaps he is technically correct in that quibble.  The White Paper asked for restraint and for a pause in the legitimate claims of the workers.  If the workers are entitled to make claims in equity, does that phrase not amount, in practice, to a considerable degree of cutting? The White Paper mentions persons whose remuneration is provided directly or indirectly from public funds.  What does that mean?  It means simply that they are not going to get any more money.  Some of these peoples' organisation, people in State-sponsored bodies and civil servants, have conciliation and arbitration machinery which was extracted in the teeth of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>The civil servants got their scheme in 1952.  The Government here in this House at that time, when the Minister was going to school, was defeated on a motion by me when they refused to give arbitration to the civil servants.  They went to the country on it and Deputy MacEntee stumped my constituency bringing up the bogey of what would happen if the civil servants got their arbitration scheme.

      <P>The Minister has interrupted me but I am used to interruptions and used to dealing with them effectively.  I propose to deal with what the Minister is so truculently trying to say by way of interruption. What is going to happen next is this&mdash; the civil servants are not to get increased salaries.  They have conciliation and arbitration machinery but when they go through that machinery, if it produces a certain result, they will not get it.  Is that not a cut?  Will the Minister quibble anymore on my use of the word &ldquo;cut&rdquo; as I employed it a few moments ago?  They will be allowed to put their case through this machinery but if a fair-minded and independent arbitrator decides that the civil servants are entitled to an increase, they will not get it.  That is what this White Paper says and that is what I am protesting against.  Does anybody think this thing is going to succeed where the British Tory Government, at the height of their power, did not succeed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment on the remarks of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who spoke of Deputy Dillon's disparagement of economists. I knew Deputy Dillon's views on economists and I do not share all of them. Trevelyan, who was the head of the <Col N="147" /> British Treasury during the Famine period, had emphatic economic principles laid down for him by his advisers and he followed them to the end.  He followed the economic principles accepted by the economists and financiers of the country at that time and he brought untold human misery on the starving people of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what happens very often when economists and financiers lay down these economic principles.  They sit back in their ivory towers and say that those are economic principles and it is your business as a Government to put them into operation&mdash;&ldquo;we have no concern as to what human suffering comes as a result of it.&rdquo;  I asked a question before, and I ask it again now: do the Government think this will succeed, having regard to the results that ensued on a pay pause in England?  Do they think that the labour organisations will do just what the Minister wants them to do, after a little talk over a tea table in some hotel with representatives of the Employer-Labour Conference?  Do they think they will not do what they did in England?  Would it not have been better to have done, first of all, what they say they will do in this White Paper before they issued this White Paper, mainly, try to get accommodation with labour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I worked with Labour for over six years in Government and I know they are a self-sacrificing group, a patriotic group who will do their duty, and do it to the point at which it will impose political sacrifice on themselves, as it did in the last year of my Administration. If the condition of the country requires some steps to be taken to meet the adverse balance of trade position, and meet the question as to whether wages may not outstrip production, is that not something to be talked over and put to the representatives of labour as a practicable proposition that the country requires to be put into effect by agreement, not by threats catching one section of the community and <Col N="148" /> putting a stop on their pay as a warning to other sections that, if they do not toe the line, awful results will ensue to the whole country?  That is the method that should have been adopted instead of what has been done.</P>
    <P>I have said here&mdash;I think it was on the debate during the emergency summoning of a meeting of Parliament on the Electricity Supply Board situation when a strike threatened&mdash;that what was wanted here was an advertence to the fact that we are a Christian country and our employer-labour relations should be based on an acceptance of Christian principles. We should not have our eyes upon the principles and practice of British trade unionism.  It would be a good day for this country if the Government would initiate such a policy, bringing all parties into conference and saying: &ldquo;Here is the situation.  Let us all work together to see if, having regard to the fact we are a Christian country, and have before us in the Encyclicals, and elsewhere, principles that will be far better for the establishment of sound labour-employer relations than any advertence to British trade unionism, we cannot find a basis of agreement.&rdquo; I have no doubt such an approach would be considered.</P>
    <P>Has it been considered that the time has now come when, instead of labour organisations coming into a conference and bargaining over pennies and shillings, we should have some sort of settled procedure in which to resolve differences?  Has the time come when, according to this economist adopted by the Minister for Justice, increased production is necessary to meet the economic position, and with a restraint on wages?  What is really wanted is increased production and labour, who give their sweat to effecting that production, naturally want some share in it.  Is the time not ripe when it should be considered that labour should get some command in industry, not by way of putting in trade union representatives and shop stewards on boards, or anything else, but by way of incentive for having worked harder and produced more for the benefit of the people as a whole?  Should the worker not get some bonus for that increased production?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> I had hoped, when I was in office, to get some sort of voluntary effort in that direction.  I had hoped to initiate proposals.  Unfortunately, time did not permit of my doing that which I hoped to do.  That brings me now to what the Taoiseach said and to our friend, the economist.  The Taoiseach made the pious utterances about the business of the nation and the welfare of the people being so serious as to prevent the operation of Party politics or the desire of one Party to put out another.  He says that, of course, when it suits him as Taoiseach.  In the last few years of the Administration of which I had the honour and the difficulty of being head, we had serious economics effects, the like of which had never before afflicted this country.  As I said before when the Taoiseach mentioned this matter, as he mentioned it again today, it does not matter two jackstraws to me what anybody thinks of my Administration.  It is all past history.  It will be left at that as far as I am concerned but, so long as I am in this House, I will let neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Industry and Commerce put upon the records statements of a certain kind without refuting them.</P>

Trade and production were depressed, unemployment and emigration were increased, and an atmosphere unfavourable to economic expansion was created.  This experience should be sufficient warning to avoid the need for such measures again.</P>

      <P>I cannot allow to go on the records of the House statements such as the Taoiseach made and I challenge him again to say that those people who advised him in the composition of this White Paper were not the same people as gave us advice, advice which we acted on.  We need not have acted on it: we might have decided to get other economists to advise us and we might consequently have taken the chances and let matters right themselves and let the balance of payments right itself without all those remedial measures.  We gave an undertaking during the course of the imposition of those protective duties, at a time when we were confronted with Suez, plus adverse terms of trade, that that imposition of import duties would be taken away immediately favourable economic conditions reasserted themselves. The Taoiseach and his Government, to their eternal discredit, dishonoured that undertaking approved by the then Government and by this House.</P>
      <P>That was one of their contributions to looking after the business of the nation and the welfare of the people. From these benches then, when I was sitting where the Minister for Justice is now sitting in for the Taoiseach, I remember them roaring in their benches like partisans in the French Revolution, shouting for us to get out, that they would take our places.  So they did take our places over there by going around the country misrepresenting us to the people, playing on the feelings of the unemployed who were brought out of employment because we had to take these remedial measures.  That was their contribution to the welfare of the State and the well being of the people.</P>

      <P>As to whether the economists were right or wrong, I said I did not know.  However, we took their advice, knowing that the result would be that we would be out of office.  The Labour Party made their contribution to the national well-being in the carrying out of that policy.  Be it said to their credit, they did it in the interests of the country.  They got howlings and roarings from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Now the Taoiseach proceeds to repeat that to-night.  As I said, we did not know whether they were right or wrong, but one economist has said recently they were wrong.  I read it as that anyway.</P>
      <P>In the December issue of <i>The Irish Banking Review,</i> there is an article on the Irish economy by a very distinguished economist called Dr. Alfred Kuehn.  He was until recently a research officer with the Economic Research Institute in Dublin.  At page 30, he gives an account of the economic difficulties we were in at the time&mdash; rising output, imports exceeded by far the amount necessary for current production, leading to an increase in stocks.  He goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The balance of payments predicament would have probably been less severe in the following year, because production would have risen further to meet demand and stock building would have levelled off. But, as this apparently had not been anticipated by policy makers the emergency brakes of import levies were applied; the measures effectively reduced imports in the following years; but they were also instrumental in bringing on recession.</P>
      <P>That is the view and the advice we got. You can take your choice.</P>

      <P>I took full responsibility, knowing I was going out of office as a result.  But I learned a lesson I have never forgotten and which I press upon the Deputies here considering this matter.  When you get <Col N="157" /> advice from economists, they give you the best advice they can.  They give you expert advice, excellent advice. They give you advice got as a result of their research, labour and study, and they give it to you sincerely.  But you must recollect that when they do that, they give it coldly and calmly, and I am not disparaging them by saying they give it inhumanly.  It is not their business to say what human suffering is going to result in consequence of their opinions and economic principles.  I learned that lesson and I hope the Deputies considering this will learn that lesson.  Their economic theories may be excellent and they may be acting according to their lights in giving you excellent advice, but you have to remember&mdash;as a result of experience I emphasise it&mdash;that if that advice results in human suffering and unemployment, it is no answer to the people who have to leave or see their children leave to say you are following economic principles.  That will not mean anything to them.  There will be produced, as there has been in England, a result far worse than if these economic principles had not been promulgated and acted upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear at the outset that this White Paper is the Government's White Paper and we are not seeking to hide behind any economists or official advice of any sort.  If this debate has done nothing else but procedure for the House the admission that Deputy Costello when Taoiseach accepted advice offered to him without knowing whether it was good or bad and proceeded to act on it then it will be historically very interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In publishing this White Paper the Government has done no more than its simple duty.  In a democracy like ours the Government is charged with the defence of the economy exactly in the same way as it is charged with the defence of the national territory. In pursuance of that responsibility, it must keep a constant watch on developments.  It must continually analyse the statistics and be in a position to identify trends.  It should always be able to anticipate dangers before they arise and seal off any trouble spots.  It must always endeavour to have the initiative and its <Col N="160" /> policies so framed that it controls developments rather than be dictated to by them.  To my mind, that is the difference between good and bad government in the economic field.</P>
    <P>A good Government are on top of the situation, ahead of events.  They should never allow economic difficulties to progress to the point where they no longer have the freedom to follow their own policies for the betterment of the community but are rather forced by the exigencies of the situation to adopt one expedient after another. That is the principle and that is the issue in this debate.  That is the difference between us and the Opposition. We believe that the Government must direct and guide the economy in the way they want it to go.  We have a comprehensive programme for economic development and in order to be able to put that programme into effect, we must have the economic initiative. We must be in control of events and not be controlled by them.  That is why this White Paper has been issued.</P>
    <P>Here we have a clear case of the emergence of a dangerous trend which, if it were allowed to develop, could have the effect of wrecking all our efforts to date.  In 1962, weekly earnings outstripped output per worker and if that trend were allowed to continue without check, we would undoubtedly be precipitated into an inflationary spiral.  The White Paper analyses that situation.  There is no question of apportioning blame or criticising anybody.  It is a calm, dispassionate analysis of the position.  Its analysis of the trends and its basic conclusion that in 1962 wages and salaries outstripped and ran ahead of productivity cannot be challenged by anybody.  I think nobody in this debate so far has attempted to challenge that fundamental conclusion of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The evidence of this dangerous trend is clear and incontrovertible and if this Government were to sit back, with what, to my mind, would be criminal negligence, and allow inflation to develop unchecked then they would be unworthy of their trust.  It was the duty of the Government to give a clear warning of what was happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> It should not be necessary for me to outline to the House the results of inflation.  They are well known both inside and outside the House but in view of some of the remarks which have been made, particularly by Deputy J.A. Costello, I feel I should point this out, that in an inflationary spiral and when wages start chasing goods in such spiral, the people who are hardest hit are people on salaries and wages and fixed incomes, the people to whom Deputy Costello has referred.  Businessmen and other sections of the community are very often able to cushion themselves against the worst effects of inflation but inevitably the people who are hardest hit and who can do least to protect themselves in inflationary circumstances are those who get their livelihood by means of salaries or wages or fixed incomes of some sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do nothing but wages and salaries chase goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course they do.  All incomes chase goods in an inflationary spiral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But that does not defeat my argument.  The point I am making is that in inflation, other sections of the community are very often able to cushion themselves against the worst effects of it, but the people who can rarely catch up and who are hardest hit are people on wages and salaries and fixed incomes. In a situation of this sort, it is the duty of the Government to speak out in unequivocal fashion, to point out clearly what is happening, and give the public the fullest possible information and, if possible, to point to the remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the Government have the duty to act in this way in the interests of the community as a whole but especially in the interests of those people who I have said will be hardest hit if inflation is allowed to develop unchecked, those who rely on salaries and wages for their livelihood. In this Government, all our policies are directed towards procuring a continuing <Col N="162" /> expansion of the economy so that out of the increased pool of production, we can make available to our people better living standards, better housing, better health services, better social services and better amenities for the community generally.  That is the only sound policy to pursue.  It is only out of the pool provided by increased production that we can derive these benefits to which I refer.</P>
    <P>It is possible by certain tricks and financial juggling to mortgage the future and secure temporary benefits or advantages that are not justified by increased national income.  But that &mdash;and I think most Deputies will agree with this&mdash;is only storing up trouble for the future.  The only safe way to conduct our affairs is to share out to all sections of the community the benefits of increased production when they have occurred but not before. That is, in fact, what happened during the years 1958, 1959 and 1960.  Over that period of three years, salary and wage-earners secured substantial increases in remuneration but they were covered by increased productivity.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise that during these three years substantial increases in remuneration were procured by practically all sections of the community without any objection whatever or without any criticism of any sort by any member of this Government because we wholeheartedly approved of that process.  We should have liked to have seen it continue indefinitely.  We believe that when increased production justifies it, the proper thing to do is to make the <Col N="163" /> benefits of that increase available in one form or other to wage earners, salary earners and others.</P>

      <P>Our approach to this matter is governed in this way: we know there are times when increased salaries, wages and incomes are good business, good sound economics&mdash;when they are justified by increased productivity. The increased purchasing power generated by these increases stimulates further economic advance and, as I say, that is what happened during the years 1958, 1959 and 1960.  Substantial increases in remuneration were secured which were justified by the increase in the national pool.  We also know, however, that there are times when the workings of the free enterprise economy can result in wages and salaries outstripping productivity and in those circumstances it is necessary, unless you are to get into trouble, to have restraint until such time as productivity catches up again.  That is exactly what we are looking for in this White Paper and nothing more.  The present Labour Party cannot have regard to the national interest in this matter.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear the Opposition do not care what happens. Exactly as they did in 1956, they are prepared to let inflation develop and do nothing about it.  That is the meaning of their attack on this White Paper and on the Government's plea for restraint.  If by means of this debate or otherwise they could succeed in defeating the Government in its objectives as set out in this White Paper then they would succeed in doing again what they did in 1956.  We must at least admit they are consistent in their perverseness.</P>
      <P>They are living in a fool's paradise if they think that the people do not recognise the success of this Government's policies and the achievements that have been brought about since 1957.  Does not everybody know that there are more jobs now, that they are more secure and that substantial increases in wages and salaries generally have been procured in the last few years?  If we are asking for a certain amount of restraint at this stage it is because we think it is better to have our people in jobs and ask them to have restraint than to have no jobs to put them into as was the case in 1956.</P>

We have pointed out that in one form or another free <Col N="170" /> trade is coming and we have made plans to keep the economy moving forward and to strengthen it to meet the competition we know is inevitable. The White Paper pinpoints certain features of the economy which during 1962 gave cause for disquiet.  They have been mentioned already: a slight fall in our exports, a balance of payments deficit, a slight falling off in the rate of economic growth and of course the fact that wages and salaries have outstripped output per worker.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is entirely justifiable for us to ask for a certain amount of restraint at this stage.  There is no question of hardship to anybody, no question of reducing anybody's income as Deputy John A. Costello tried to suggest.  We have at the present time a sound, expanding economy and we want to keep it that way.  There is danger that we could run into difficulties if at this stage we were to over-reach ourselves.  All the Government is asking is that the existing economy be protected.  There is nothing negative in what we are doing. We are seeking co-operation in our efforts to protect the economy.  I want to emphasise that it is an expanding economy and that what we want to protect is the very process of expansion itself.  If we are asking for restraint at this stage it is only so that our ultimate objectives of full employment and a doubled standard of living will be made all the more certain of realisation.</P>

      <P>I notice the Minister for Justice referring to the Government's White Paper as their own.  I find that it is its own confusion and I propose to explain exactly what I mean by that.  Before doing that, I want to say that this White Paper is a deliberate attempt to woo the large farming community and the industrial employers. It is very significant that in the White Paper, there is no reference to them and no urging on them as to what they should do.</P>

      <P>This White Paper is full of confusion.  As is often said in Dublin, somebody has got mixed up in the jerseys and that is exactly what has happened in this case.  We have had the Minister for Transport and Power going around pontificating, talking down to the workers, telling them what they should do and what they should not do.  It is perfectly obvious he had a sneak preview of this White Paper. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions found it necessary to hold and emergency meeting on the Saturday following its issue which, incidentally, I protest as a Deputy was in the hands of the Press before it was in the hands of members of this House.  I personally did not get it until after the Press got it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, after reading it verbatim in the morning editions of the newspapers, were placed in the position of convening an emergency meeting.  Their objection to the text of the White Paper resulted in the Taoiseach deciding to climb down and make a hurried statement.  He did an unprecedented thing in making an announcement on a Sunday.  There was a certain amount of watering down taking place, once the reaction set in.  Then we had the Minister for Finance making a statement and last night we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce. All these were frantically seeking to take the Government out of the morass they had got themselves into.  That is a clear indication to me that there was no thinking on the part of the Government&mdash;collective thinking anyhow&mdash; before they issued this White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy J.A. Costello indicating his experiences at the hands of the economists, and I <Col N="172" /> was intrigued to observe that he said that the same set of economists were the people acting in an advisory way to the present Government.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday during Question Time, Deputy McQuillan made some supplementaries and the Taoiseach then indicated that since 1957 we have had good government.  If we have had six years of good government, what is the meaning for this White Paper? Why is it there?  What is its purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if we have had six years of good government?  There is one objection I want to make to the White Paper, that is, the putting of public enterprise into second place. I regard that as a tremendous slap in the face to the people who control and work public enterprises.  I also deplore the fact that while doing that, the Government are leaving people who promote private industries, over whom we have no real control, to go to town.  The Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce can all use the expression &ldquo;restraint&rdquo;.  Indeed this afternoon the Taoiseach went a good distance in saying what he thought about the actions at times of the Federated Union of Employers, but very often in matters such as this, you will get people saying: &ldquo;I will have to say this much but you can go ahead and do what you like afterwards.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I object to most of all is the biassed nature of this White Paper, the use of State employees and the indication to anybody who has any sort of control over them that they should tread very carefully and indeed should not start anything lest they set a headline.  In other words, the 100,000 State employees can be safely described as guinea pigs.  It would be much better if instead of adopting this attitude, the Government applied their minds to serious planning.  They should have serious regard to the reports coming out now and then about the possibility of certain industries going to the wall as a result of lowering tariffs on the one <Col N="173" /> hand and inducing foreigners to set up industries here on the other.  The Government would be better occupied serving the nation better, if instead of inducing foreigners to come in to operate and exploit in some cases, we operated these industries ourselves and expanded this idea of State operation.</P>
    <P>It has already been mentioned that there had been no talk about a ninth round before the issue of this White Paper.  What is the position now? The ordinary man in the street who is a member of a trade union has every right to think again about what has been said to him at meetings of his trade union by way of advice, not to be seeking a further increase in wages. He will think, and quite rightly so; &ldquo;Perhaps I was entitled to a ninth round.  It appears very like that when we get this warning note from the Government.  What has happened to my trade union that they are not pushing and looking for this ninth round?&rdquo;  This whole thing can create tremendous difficulties for us all.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we have the situation where you have people who have not yet had the eighth round. There is a certain amount of clearing up to be done.  In some cases, they are semi-State concerns.  Are we to take it that what is to happen now is that the eighth round will not be cleared up?  Many of these things could be avoided very well had there been consultation with the organised workers and employers before the White Paper was issued.  It is very wrong to suggest that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was looking for concurrence, but there should have been consultation with both sides. Had that step been taken, we would be in a much healthier position now. Instead, we have the present speculation on the part of many people about who is right and who is wrong.</P>
    <P>That is where the Government have failed.  They made a tremendous mistake in not adverting to the good offices that were previously there by way of organised labour and organised employers.  One might say, as has been said, that no one side or section of the people deserve to be consulted, <Col N="174" /> that the nation must be consulted in matters of this kind.  The White Paper deliberately points at a section, and now we must take everybody into consideration and say that when a stand has been taken, it is about time for it to be adhered to.  This House is repeatedly disregarded.  I am worried about people talking about democracy. The Minister for Justice talked about the democratic way.  The democratic way for what?  It is about time the Government made up their mind with regard to matters of national importance that the first place in which they should make pronouncements is this House, and not at meetings of the Federated Union of Employers or even at trade union meetings.  This is either the Parliament or it is not.  It is very difficult to know, the way things are going now, when we are left wondering as to what power even the Government have got over some people they put in charge.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have found it necessary to raise questions in relation to different Departments.  Very often they have not been raised in this House because the Ceann Comhairle has said that they are not matters that can be raised in this House, that they are for the chairman of this, that or the other.  So much for the manner in which democracy is operated in this House.  I was glad to hear somebody from the Government benches at least talking about democracy, but I would like them to dwell on it and to realise that when members of no matter what Party come into this House, they expect to obtain information.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what is going to be the position of the Labour Court in this matter.  We have had a tremendous amount of speculation about the Labour Court, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce made a speech last night about it.  He indicated he was thinking of making changes.  Many other people have the same idea. Indeed, on the workers' side and on the employers' side, it has been agreed that there is room for improvement in the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>What about the confidence of the workers in the Labour Court as a result <Col N="175" /> of this White Paper?  I am a trade union official and can speak with a certain amount of knowledge on this matter.  Frequently, a trade union official advises workers to avail of the machinery of the Labour Court.  In the face of this White Paper, the travelling will be very hard because there is a direction contained in it and it does not take a man of great intelligence to know where the direction is.  Is that not a shocking state of affairs when the Government are talking in terms of greater production and the interests of the nation?</P>
    <P>The sequence of events is rather interesting, to say the least of it.  I remember the first time we made our application for entry into the Common Market.  Government representatives made a statement indicating the state of our country and explaining that it would take some time to prepare for the removal of the tariff walls.  Shortly after that, these representatives made another statement indicating that we were ready to go in and to take our full responsibilities.  The next thing was the announcement that we were an underdeveloped country.  Then we have this White Paper.  Surely that is not going to create a good picture outside.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that, in the opinion of the Labour Party, there is no such thing as a crisis in existence in this country at the moment.  It is wrong for anybody to talk in terms of a crisis.  The situation at the moment can well be overcome with reasoned thinking.  The words &ldquo;climbing down&rdquo; or &ldquo;change of attitude&rdquo; are not popular but I do believe that if the Government had the doing of it all over again, they would go about things in a different way.  I was interested and intrigued by what the Taoiseach said to-day in relation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In no uncertain way, he explained the confidence he had in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. At the same time, the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government have forgotten the part the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been playing for many years in helping <Col N="176" /> the Government to overcome problems.  It may not be known to every member of the House but it surely is well known to the Ministers of the Government that most of the time of the officials of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is spent in working on various committees set up by the Government.</P>
    <P>With that in mind, surely the attitude adopted towards those people was a wrong attitude?  I hope it is not too late but perhaps somebody will set about reconciling the position because the talks that were proceeding between employers and trade union representatives have been put aside.  They have been wrecked by this hasty action.  Perhaps on reflection, the Government will be big enough to realise the mistake they made in that regard and will invite the Congress and the Federated Union of Employers to come together to discuss this problem.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed the view that it should not be said that there is a crisis.  There are many good reasons why that should not be said. The last increase in salaries secured by the civil servants was taken care of by the money that came in from the pay-as-you-earn system of income tax.  The Budget and the Supplementary Budget also helped. That is my understanding of what I have read.  Our bank deposits are up.  It should also be borne in mind that it is not so long since the Government planned for a two per cent. increase and secured a five per cent. increase in industrial output.  The Government shouted with glee about that.  Still, we have this White Paper. I should like to know if this White Paper is a prelude to a rough Budget.  Are the Government preparing the people for a rough Budget? Are they attempting to produce conditions in which the people will say, in the event of a rough Budget: &ldquo;Things are not so bad as they might have been&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>In connection with this White Paper and its advocacy, we should not forget that many firms have boasted that they have absorbed the eighth round <Col N="177" /> of wage increases.  With regard to the suggestion of a wage pause, taking the average weekly earnings of agricultural workers, county council workers, forestry workers, and some people in the distributive trades, who are getting £6 to £8 a week, does anybody suggest that these people are well paid and should stand-easy and, whether it be the eighth, ninth, 10th or 11th round, should forget it in the interests of Ireland?  We all know that there are thousands of such persons, excluding females.  I am talking about men. Anybody can check that what I am saying is correct.  Yet the suggestion is made that these people should mark time and look for nothing more.</P>
    <P>Is there anybody in this House, particularly any member of the Government, who will have the impudence to suggest that such rates of pay can be regarded as fair, proper, reasonable and sufficient for a man or woman to live in frugal comfort?</P>
    <P>There are others working in factories and workshops who consider themselves fortunate that they are getting £9 or £10 a week.  Does any member of the Government suggest that £9 or £10 a week is enough for one to live on?  Can any member of the Government produce a formula to show how people can live and rear a family in proper surroundings on £9 or £10 a week?</P>
    <P>There is another group of workers who are described as highly-skilled and they are in the £11 and £12 a week income bracket.  They are the minority of workers.  Yet, we have a situation where, in a subtle way, we are told to stand still in the matter of wages.</P>
    <P>I hold that to afford a more acceptable way of life, there is need for a better distribution of wealth.  If one has regard to what is advocated in the White Paper, we will not get that. The Minister for Justice has said that weekly earnings have significantly outstripped production.  What about the person with £6, £8, £9, and £10 a week?  Are they to become jokes for everybody?  What of unorganised labour?  What of the people who have no trade union to represent them and who are earning low rates of pay?  Are <Col N="178" /> they to continue to be exploited?  Are the employers, under this White Paper, to say to them: &ldquo;There it is.  Do not start another round.  You are not being fair to the country&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the statements made on this matter, I would like the Minister for Transport and Power to state the number of industrial and manual workers in the State services who are earning as much as £12 and £14 a week.  If he makes a study of it, he will find that such people are largely in the minority.  Earlier today the Taoiseach made reference to a speech made by Mr. John Conroy, President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and Treasurer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. He was referring to one of Mr. Conroy's many speeches and his advocating of conferences between employers and labour.  Why did Mr. Conroy, in the past couple of weeks, find it necessary to make such a speech?  The answer is obvious.  It is because the Government have failed to bring about that which is most desirable.</P>
    <P>Seeing that the Taoiseach has such a penchant for reading the speeches of Mr. Conroy and people like him, I wonder if he would have regard to the speech made by Mr. Conroy in which he said that the industrial worker should have at least £10 a week.  Will the Government address themselves to that and issue another White Paper to the effect that that should be done?  We heard the Taoiseach say that the employers and workers in other countries expect to get guidance from their Governments. What guidance has been got from this Government in relation to wages and conditions?  I would say none.</P>
    <P>I should also like to remind this House that we are not attempting to create discord in this House or outside it.  But there is one thing sure. Prior to the last election, the Labour Party, in their submission to the people, indicated that they believed that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power there would be a wage pause. They have gone very close to it in this White Paper.  You can call it what you like but that is what is contained in paragraph 21 of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> I feel I should avail of this occasion to remind the Government that it was Selwyn Lloyd of England who first introduced the pay pause.  You know where Selwyn Lloyd has gone&mdash; he is no longer a Minister.  Macmillan was his partner and you know what is happening to Macmillan.  Even the <i>Sunday Times</i> has predicted that he is on his way out.  I think that Fianna Fáil are on their way out.  If they are sincere about this matter, the least they could have done, the proper thing to have done, was to attack prices.</P>
    <P>I have already said that we very often find employers inviting wage applications.  We often find trade union officials trying to advise workers as to what is going to happen in relation to increases in wages because of the merry-go-round.  Could we have it from the Government now that there will be a serious attack on prices and that rising prices will be fought as tenaciously as increases of wages will be resisted by employers?  Can we have an assurance from this Government that any standstill will produce better services for social welfare beneficiaries or an extension of the scope of the Health Acts?  I doubt it very much.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the idea of a wage pause should occur in 1963, 50 years after 1913, a year in which the workers will be celebrating proudly the progress made since 1913.  It is significant that restraint is being advocated in such a year.  If we are to gain the confidence of the workers, whether organised or unorganised, incentives will have to be produced for them, incentives that will make them realise that there is concern for them in this House.  It would be a real advance if we had an easement of rates, an attack on prices and an improvement in our health services.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister for Justice or any other Minister attempt to lecture the workers?  I ask that having regard to the behaviour of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Transport and Power towards workers generally.  That is an attitude they <Col N="180" /> cannot be too proud of.  Our form about these things is that everybody is a worker.  We have been obliged to listen to sneers being thrown at defenceless workers, at people who have not got the right to strike and who cannot defend themselves.  I would like to know, as a trade union official, from the Minister for Justice, what exactly are the jobs he refers to when he said that everybody knows there are more jobs and more security now than before.  I wonder if the Minister for Justice has had regard to the CIO reports and to the operations of CIE in laying off workers.  I would appeal to the Government to display a little more confidence in organisations such as Aer Lingus, CIE, the ESB and Bord na Móna.  Good work has been done by all those industries and organisations right from the top to the bottom on behalf of the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This White Paper is entitled &ldquo;Closing the Gap&rdquo;. The first essential in any discussion with regard to it is, I think, that someone, preferably the Taoiseach, or one of his Ministers, should endeavour to close the gap between the terms of the White Paper and the terms of Ministerial utterances since the White Paper was issued.  The paragraphs in this White Paper which have occasioned most comment in this debate are paragraphs 20 and 21. Paragraph 21 sets out the particular recommendations of the Government with regard to the problem which the White Paper says, in paragraph 20, exists.  The first part of the paragraph reads as follows:</P>
      <P>As a more immediate matter, the Government are convinced that it is necessary to avoid the damage to the national economy which would occur if further wage and salary or other income increases, whether in the public or the private sector, took place before national production had risen sufficiently.  General restraint is essential ....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear, I think, that anyone reading those words when this White Paper was first published was entitled to come to the conclusion that the <Col N="181" /> Government were in fact not merely advocating but were determined to implement a wage freeze and not merely a pay pause.  They were determined to implement a wage freeze. They set out in the White Paper that the Government are convinced that it is necessary to avoid the damage to the national economy which would occur if further wage and salary, or other income increases, were made whether in the private or the public sector.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 21, it is stated:</P>
    <P>In the light of the considerations set out in this White Paper, the Government deem it necessary that Departments and State-sponsored organisations should not accede for the present to any claims for increases in wages and salaries, or for changes in conditions of work having the same effect, which would arouse expectations of similar increases in other employments.</P>
    <P>The very last sentence indicates that, even if awards are made as a result of arbitration proceedings, the Government, if necessary, will see to it that those awards are not implemented. Anyone reading that was legitimately entitled to come to the conclusion that what the Government intended to do was to clamp down on any increases in wages and salaries.  We are entitled to know at this stage of the debate whether that is still the Government intention.  Is that what they mean? Are they serious about it?</P>

      <P>Let us start from the ground up.  This document is entitled <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  It sets out what the Government said was the problem.  Having devoted 18 or 19 paragraphs to stating the problem, they then come to their decisions on it. This is what they say in paragraph 20, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will have got it off by heart by the time I have finished:</P>
      <P>As a more immediate matter, the Government are convinced that it is necessary to avoid the damage to the national economy which would occur if further wage and salary or other income increases, whether in the public or private sector, took place before national production had risen sufficiently.</P>
      <P>Does that imply that there will be no increases?</P>

      <P>As far as the Government are concerned, in the public and private sectors, there are to be no further increases.  If it does not mean that, what does it mean? It says the Government are convinced of a particular thing which we now hear they have no intention of trying to implement.  I assume that if the Government think they are convinced that a particular course of action is the proper course to be taken they will proceed to take that course of action.</P>

      <P>In other words, the Government are saying that as far as State employees are concerned, there are to be no increases and that as far as others are concerned, they want general restraint as far as arbitration awards are concerned. Arbitration awards are to be put into cold storage and no increases are to take place.  But then the Taoiseach spoke and was reported in the public Press on 11th February last. According to this report, he said that the White Paper did not envisage or forecast any action to enforce a standstill in wages.  On the contrary, the Taoiseach said, the Government's desire was that there would be a steady continuing rise in real wages, in salaries and living standards generally, in line with rising national output. He said the White Paper reflects the Government's decision that another general round of wage increases, in advance of an expansion of national output, having regard to the revival of national economic progress, rising prices and rising unemployment which it would cause, would not be initiated by the Government or statutory organisations financed out of State funds.</P>
      <P>That, to my mind, was looking at the White Paper with half an eye. There is no question of the White Paper simply saying: &ldquo;Wage increases will not be initiated by the Government or by statutory organisations financed out of public funds.&rdquo; But it does say, and presumably intends, that there will be for the moment a wage freeze as far as certain sectors, at least, are concerned.</P>

      <P>Are we to take it that the Taoiseach, his higher Ministers, his Parliamentary Secretaries and his backbenchers all stand over the White Paper or do they all stand over his statement of earlier this month, or would they prefer to move on to as late as yesterday and accept the interpretation put on it by the Minister for Transport and Power who is reported in the public Press as giving his gloss to the thing:</P>
      <P>The whole spirit of the <i>Closing the Gap</i> White Paper was to encourage this up-to-date approach to the seeking of better living standards. The Government asked only for an intelligent examination of the national yearly profit by voluntary negotiation between employers and workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently the Minister for Transport and Power stopped reading the White Paper before he came to paragraphs 20 and 21.  If he did, I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would call his attention to those two paragraphs. I do not think the Government should be left in any doubt about the feeling of the people.  This is an unwanted Government.  There have been criticism of the Fine Gael Party and of Fine Gael leadership on the grounds that they have not been fully critical of the Government.  Those criticisms of the Fine Gael Party are touched off because of the impatience of the people who want to get rid of the present Government.  They want to see every Deputy in every Party in this <Col N="188" /> House doing what he can to get rid of this Government, and quickly.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach had the gall to-day to talk about irresponsibility associated with the Fine Gael Party.  He and his Party can thank their lucky stars that they had inside this House a responsible Opposition who were prepared to play their part properly as a responsible Opposition in a parliamentary democracy and who did not accept as a definition of a responsible Opposition the type of advice given in the editorial columns of a daily newspaper recently, which seemed to imply that even if the Government were doing what we believed they should do, we should prod them and prick them and criticise them.  We have not done that.  We did not do it because we believed this Government had come around to a correct point of view and had dissociated themselves from their old isolationist policy in the past.  While they were negotiating as the Government of this country on behalf of the people of this country, we were prepared to act as we felt a responsible Opposition should act, but do not let the Government feel that is a shield for them to get away with it.  As far as we are concerned, we regard this motion as a vote of no confidence in the Government.  We are inviting the Government to go to the country and to give the country an opportunity of passing judgment on their actions as a Government since they were last elected.</P>

      <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary succeeded in getting into this House, the Fianna Fáil Party campaigned up and down the country with the slogan &ldquo;Let's Get Cracking.&rdquo;  You are cracking now and the Parliamentary Secretary knows it. The Taoiseach spoke of people whistling in the dark to keep up their courage.  All he has to do now is to look over his shoulder and he will see a prime chorus of whistlers behind him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach to-day made an effort to suggest that we in the Fine Gael Party, because of our criticism of the Government with regard to the White Paper and the failure of their <Col N="189" /> policies which led to the issue of it, were in some way adopting an attitude antagonistic to the interests of the farming community.  I think back&mdash; and my political memory is somewhat longer than that of the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;to the utterances of Fianna Fáil Ministers!  I think it was the Taoiseach himself who spoke of featherbed conditions for the farmers in this country.  I think it was the present Tánaiste, as Minister for Finance in a Fianna Fáil Government, who stated that taxation rested lightly on the land.  I think it was the same Minister for Agriculture they have now who spoke of lining the ditches and hedges of the farmers' fields with inspectors and Civic Guards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to see that the policy recommended be carried out.  These are the people who, through the Taoiseach, endeavour to suggest that the Fine Gael Party are in some way antagonistic to the interests of the farmers.  I do not think the Taoiseach is doing a good day's work&mdash;certainly not for the country and not even for his own Party&mdash;if he endeavours to use this White Paper and the situation being created by it to create a division between the farming community and the industrial workers.  That is not good business, coming from the head of any Irish Government.  The Leader of my Party, Deputy Dillon, has very rightly pointed out we are too small a country to endeavour to create two nations of any kind, whether it is by political partition or by creating classes of rich and poor or sectional divisions between industrial workers and the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the odd things about this White Paper, when we consider the problem it is intended to deal with, is the fact that nowhere in it, as far as I could see, is there any mention at all of the desirability of savings to endeavour to remedy the situation which has come about.  Do the Government believe in savings?  Do they believe in doing anything to further savings?  I am not an expert on economics, but surely it is true to say that in a situation of the sort facing <Col N="190" /> the Government, where you have an imbalance of payments, one of the weapons to be used should be to foster as best we can savings amongst our people?  Why is there no mention in that White Paper about savings?  Why is the only remedy that seems appropriate to the Government the remedy of the wage freeze?  Is it because the traditional and historical Fianna Fáil panacea for all ills is a wage freeze?</P>
    <P>This White Paper was issued in the month of February.  The Taoiseach replying to the Adjournment Debate in December, 1962, addressed himself to this House only two months ago. Surely the problems suggested in the White Paper existed then?  Perhaps I might read paragraph 1 of the White Paper:</P>
    <P>The purpose of this White Paper is to draw attention to the economic dangers caused by the gap between incomes and productivity (i.e. output per head) which has developed over the past year or so....</P>
    <P>It is not something that happened to-day or yesterday, but something that developed over the past year or so. Look again at paragraph 12:</P>
    <P>The reason for concern at present is that, as indicated in earlier paragraphs, most of the features described were present in 1962....</P>
    <P>The White Paper says that this is something that has been developing for the past few years.  It was certainly there in 1962.  Two months ago, the Taoiseach addressed himself to this House.  What did he say?  I turn to columns 1469 and 1470 of the Dáil Debates for 13th December, 1962:</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon expressed concern about the adverse trade balance.  He talked about the gap that exists between the value of our visible imports and the value of our invisible exports.  It is true that the over-all picture at the end of this year, when it will be possible to determine it in February or March next year, will probably show some deficit on our external payments but, in so far as that deficit has not involved as the Deputy found out, any diminution of our external reserves, it is not a matter of great concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> December, 1962, it is not a matter for great concern: February, 1963, <i>Closing the Gap,</i> standstill, wage freeze&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In many trades, as Deputy Sherwin pointed out, and in many industrial occupations requiring particular skills there is a scarcity of workers. In many areas of the country full employment has been realised and, indeed, there are directions in which or economic progress is being retarded at this time by labour shortages.

      <P>The Taoiseach was so carried away by his own enthusiasm and by what had been achieved by Fianna Fáil Government up to December, 1962 that he looked a little into the future to see what was necessary and at Column 1472 of the Dáil Debates of 13th December he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this problem of employment and unemployment at this time, the main matters that are giving the Government concern are these two.  First to meet the housing <Col N="192" /> needs of those whom we want to attract back from England to employment here and to meet the housing needs arising from industrial expansion in particular towns....</P>
    <P>In December, 1962, two months ago, the Taoiseach was talking about attracting back workers from England.  Are they likely to be attracted by the wage freeze policy the Government now suggest in this White Paper should be operated?</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the White Paper does not at all refer to the question of savings.  I have mentioned the particular line which the Taoiseach pursued here two months ago when my reading of his speech, and I think a fair interpretation for anyone to take out of his speech of 13th December last, was that everything in the garden was lovely, everything was rosy, that we were going ahead and going to get the workers back and the big problem was to build houses for them.  So much did that speech of the Taoiseach impress the editorial writer of one of the principal provincial papers in the country, <i>The Kerryman</i> that they came out with the heading &ldquo;Never So Good&rdquo;.  They had this to say:</P>
    <P>In the course of his reply to the debate on his motion that the Dáil adjourn until January, 22, An Taoiseach is reported as saying that in many industrial occupations there was a scarcity of workers and in many areas full employment had been realised.  Indeed there were directions, he said, in which our economic progress was being retarded by labour shortage.</P>
    <P>If that statement were published anonymously, few, we venture to say, would take it as referring to this country, or for that matter to any country in these islands, Macmillan could not say it, Brookeborough could not say it; Lemass has said it.</P>
    <P>The queues at the Labour Exchanges in Britain, especially in the north, are growing longer; there is a large and hard core of unemployment in the Six Counties for years; as for the position in this <Col N="193" /> country, believe it or not, you have read Mr. Lemass's statement.  Mr. Macmillan and Lord Brookeborough have every reason to be envious of Mr. Lemass, or so it would seem they should.</P>
    <P>To their credit, if such it be, Mr. Lemass and his Ministers never fail to have the good word.  Nothing downs them.  They have never been behindhand in making things seem very much better than they are.  They are born optimists, likeable fellows until one gets bored with hearing the success story too often.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government is that this country is flying.  If anybody does not understand that modern way of saying so, it means that it is prosperous and steadily getting more prosperous.</P>
    <P>That is the impression that the Taoiseach succeded in creating in the last month of last year.  There was no question then of a wage freeze or a pay pause, no suggestion that any awards made by arbitration would be put in cold storage and not applied on the orders of the Government.  Is it suggested now by the Taoiseach and by his Ministers that they have no responsibility for bringing about the situation with which this White Paper and its recommendations are intended to deal?  Are their memories so short and do they think that the public memory is so short that we are likely to forget that, following the 1957 election, the Fianna Fáil Government deliberately increased the cost of living when they slashed and abolished food subsidies?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> I put down a question which was answered today by the Taoiseach and it is just as well to remind him and the Parliamentary Secretary of it.  I tried to find out what increases had taken place between mid-February, 1957, and mid-November, 1962.  I was told that 3½ lbs. of household flour had increased in price from&mdash;these are average increases&mdash;1/0¾ to 2/-; the 2-lb loaf of bread from 9d. to 1/4; Irish creamery butter from 3/8¼ to 4/6½; sugar from 7d. to 8¼d.  Clothing had increased in the period by 7.6 per cent; cigarettes by 25.9 per cent; tobacco by 24.7 per cent; bus fares by 27.8 per cent; rail fares by 23.5 per cent; rent inclusive of rates, 23.8 per cent.  We also had increases in things like whiskey, stout, beer, postal and telephone charges, electricity charges and even motor insurance.  All these items have been increased in price by the Government and every time there is an increase imposed by the Government, it makes the value of money less and when that happens, it is perfectly natural that people endeavour to compensate themselves for the lesser value of money by applying for wage increases.</P>

    <P>NOTE:&mdash; The figures given at (b) are confined to financial years after the 1st April 1955 as the figures available in the Department for the Rate in the £ for Health Services for years prior to and subsequent to that date are not really comparable.  The reason is that a number of health services which in years since the 1st April 1955 have been charged to the Health Services Account were in previous years charged to the Public Assistance Account.  These services included the Dispensary Medical Service, Hospital and Specialist Services for the lower income group and services for shelter and maintenance in County Homes.</P>

    <P>* In the year 1961-62 the State grants formerly paid to the County Councils and County Borough Corporations of Cork Dublin, Limerick and Waterford were paid instead to the new Unified Health Authorities set up in these areas under the Health Authorities Act, 1960.  In that year only balances of outstanding grants were paid to these four Councils and County Borough Corporations.</P>
