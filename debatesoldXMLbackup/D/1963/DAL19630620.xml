      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following Order: Nos. 3 and 5.  In accordance with the arrangements made, the House will sit today until 7.30 p.m.  It has been suggested by some Deputies that it would be desirable to allow the hours of meeting of the Dáil next week to fit in with the functions associated with the visit of President Kennedy.  I therefore propose that we should meet on Tuesday next as usual, from 3 p.m. until 10.30 p.m.; that the meeting hours on Wednesday be from 10.30 a.m. until 6 p.m. and on Thursday from 10.30 a.m. until after Questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&rdquo;That, to welcome the visit to Ireland of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the President of the United States of America, and to mark the event in a signal manner, it is expedient that a joint sitting of both Houses of the Oireachtas be held on Friday, the 28th June, 1963, in the Dáil Chamber and that the President of <Col N="1352" /> the United States of America be invited to address such joint sittings; and</P>
    <P>That a message be sent to Seanad Éireann seeking its concurrence in this Resolution.''</P>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to move this motion.  As its term indicates, it is designed to mark in a signal manner the forthcoming historic visit to Ireland of the President of the United States of America.  It is proposed in the motion that a joint sitting of both Houses of the Oireachtas be held on Friday, the 28th June, and that President Kennedy be invited to address this joint sitting.</P>
    <P>In passing this motion, Dáil Éireann will be reflecting the earnest wish of the Irish people that President Kennedy should be given the warmest of welcomes on his visit to our country.  When the resolution has been passed and the concurrence of Seanad Éireann obtained, I propose moving later the formal motion providing for the joint sitting.  I commend this motion to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cordially endorse the statement made by the Taoiseach and gladly second the motion he has proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I should also like to support the motion proposed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like on behalf of my group to say we extend a very sincere and warm welcome to President John F. Kennedy on his visit to this part of Ireland.  His visit comes at a time of grave crisis in the great country of which he is President and we all appreciate the fact that he is conferring a very signal honour on this small island by his visit at such a difficult time.  We are proud and glad of the fact that it is a President of Irish descent who will undoubtedly, in the great country of America, bring an end to segregation and thus achieve the ends for which the Civil War was fought in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We as a small nation should be proud that an Irishman is to the forefront in the United States and will bring about equality of opportunity for <Col N="1353" /> all citizens, and the sympathy and support of all the members of this House will go out to President Kennedy in his tremendous fight at the present time.  In welcoming the motion, I should like to say I feel his visit to Ireland is of tremendous significance and importance to us for a number of reasons.  I believe President Kennedy is a man who despises lackeys and crawlers of all kinds, whether they be nations or individuals, and I believe his visit here to Ireland will set the seal of approval on the Irish stand in the United Nations since we became members of that worldwide organisation.</P>
    <P>Though we may not always see eye to eye on various matters, I believe he approves of the stand of this small country and of the statements and actions of the Irish representatives over the years; that he approves also of the statement made by the present Minister for External Affairs within the past two years that Ireland, as a small nation, was proud to be uncommitted, was proud to take a part in the councils of the world without commitment to any power bloc in the United Nations.  His visit here signifies his approval of Ireland's stand in that regard.</P>
    <P>While his decision to visit Ireland is in itself to be welcomed, his decision to visit three of the four green fields of Ireland is especially to be welcomed. It would have been appreciated and understood if he visited only Dublin, considering the tremendous burdens he has to bear.  The impossibility of his visiting the fourth green field is proof of his disapproval of Partition.  His rejection of the invitation issued to him by the Premier of Great Britain is proof of his rejection of the belief that the Premier of Great Britain has any right to invite the President of the United States to visit Ireland's fourth green field.  I believe that President Kennedy is sorry that he had not the opportunity afforded to him of an invitation from an all-Ireland Government based here in Dublin to visit the fourth green field. I believe that President Kennedy believes that the partition of Ireland is more unjust and inequitable than <Col N="1354" /> even the partition of Germany and it is significant that he is going to visit the partition wall in Berlin when he goes there.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, before I conclude, that a number of Deputies have frequently spoken about Ireland's debt to America for taking Ireland's emigrants over the years.  America should be thankful to Ireland for having given her our finest sons and daughters. America can thank Ireland for having given her the Kennedy family, among other great Irish people.  We are proud that President Kennedy has reached the top but we should not forget all the other Irish people who had to leave this country over the years and we hope that those Americans of Irish descent will not forget the land of their forebears.</P>
    <P>On this motion proposed by the Taoiseach, let me say that the Taoiseach has audacity to come into this House after having given the full details of this visit to the <i>Irish Press</i> last week.  His attitude in these matters all along has shown his contempt for this House.  It means that people outside the House are given information regarding matters to come before the House before that information is given to members of the House.  It is up to the leaders of the major parties in the House to show their disapproval of the Taoiseach's attitude in this matter.  If there is to be an announcement on matters of national importance, the first place it should be announced is in this House and not in the <i>Irish Press</i> or in any other newspaper. The Taoiseach's attitude in this matter has shown contempt for the people of the country and contempt for this House.  I regret to have to say that on this occasion but it has to be said, especially in view of the fact that the Taoiseach has taken this view all along the line.  I understand that certain arrangements, which appear in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today, have been made in regard to the facilities for visitors to the House during President Kennedy's visit.</P>

We do not know what takes place there and when we put down a question about it, that question is disallowed. It is on those grounds that I ask forbearance so that we may be given some information as to what is to take place in this House.  Other Deputies who are members of the big Parties are evidently told after meetings of the Committee what has taken place.</P>

      <P>The President is receiving the freedom of the city of Cork in Cork that morning.  That <Col N="1356" /> function will be attended by a great number of Deputies and Senators in Cork and it will be practically impossible for them to arrive here and get into this building in time in the afternoon. I wonder could some air service be laid on, not at the public cost, so that those Deputies and Senators could get here in time.  To get here by road transport would be almost impossible, but if an air service could be laid on, those Deputies and Senators and other public representatives could reach the House in time.</P>

    <P>3.  To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill until the wishes of the people thereon have been ascertained by means of a general election.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputy Dr. Browne.) </P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke before the adjournment of the House last night, I said that I had had a very considerable experience as a trader and that I had closely examined the difficulties of the Government's proposals with regard to the turnover tax.  I said that this was not a device which had been produced after sufficient examination of the difficulties of its operation. It is not a skilfully measured instrument of tax gathering.  In the operation of taxation in the past, account has always been taken of any injuries which it might impose.  By relating those injuries to the context of the whole, a decision can be made that certain taxes should be imposed, even though they do impose difficulties but that those difficulties can be borne because of the luxury character of the articles selected for taxation.</P>
      <P>This turnover tax is in a different category.  It is a brutal, sledgehammer attack on all the prices of all goods&mdash; charged on everything, whether luxury or necessary, and on everybody whether impoverished, unemployed or prosperous. It is unselective, unskilful and unscientific in its frontal attack on the people's pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe nobody has examined how this thing will work.  We have commissions of many kinds but none has <Col N="1358" /> examined this.  Nobody has conducted an investigation into the global conception of this turnover tax.  I think the Minister does not know how it will work.  I believe his officers do not know how it will work.  I am pretty sure the Revenue Commissioners do not know.</P>
    <P>I am a trader.  All my life, I have been engaged in trade and I do not know how it will work but I fear it. I fear what it will impose.  I fear, selfishly, the danger to my balance sheet as a businessman.  A good year in my business gives me four per cent net profit on my turnover.  That is my livelihood.  That, I think, is the average for all reasonably well-conducted businesses in the retail trade in this country.  Therefore, it is quite obvious I cannot pay this tax.  That would leave me with one and a half per cent of my gross turnover to live on and it would be equivalent to taxing my income 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says he does not mind if the traders do not pass it on, I must only regard his observation as cynical and callous.  However, there is another thing which I fear if I cannot pay it myself&mdash;and obviously, I cannot. I fear I cannot successfully collect it from my customers without injuring my relationship with those customers. I cannot break down 240 pence in the manner required&mdash;not without reducing the tax on small sales or I can omit it altogether in many instances and at the same time, increase the tax on larger sales so as to carry the losses I have incurred on these smaller sales. If I do this, I incur the displeasure of those who are asked to pay more than 2½ per cent&mdash;but that is what the Minister suggests I should do.</P>
    <P>If the tax is 2½ per cent, why should the person who spends 20/- with me have to pay 4/- and the ten persons who spent only a few shillings with me have to pay nothing?  It would seem to me to be inequality but the Minister says: &ldquo;You pay me 2½ per cent every month and get it where you like.&rdquo; It is a bit like the marauding mediaeval overlord I mentioned last night.  It is very simple for the Minister.</P>
    <P>I must employ people to work this thing and that will add to my costs.  I must also pay tax on any of the tax <Col N="1359" /> I collect.  There is another difficulty which is quite common in the trade of which I am a member.  A great number of moderately-sized retailers in this country also do a small wholesale business.  They supply smaller shops with goods for resale.  That is common in Ireland.  It means they must now set about establishing machinery to divide those sales from their other sales.  It is a further impost on the profits I seek and hope to keep on making in my business.</P>
    <P>This tax will be collected on every thing sold in this country, on food of every kind, whether it be for the rich or the poor.  It will be collected on the milk bottle in the morning, on the tea, bread and butter and, if not butter, on the margarine.  Children's school books will have to bear it.  The shoes and stockings of the household, the ordinary clothing, will have to bear it.  The television set, of course, will have to bear it as well as the petrol.  The medicine and the necessaries for the poorest living will have to bear it. Consider coal for the fire, electric light, the butcher's bill, the fish on Friday, the sweets the child buys at the corner shop, the packet of matches, the smokes and drinks.  All will have to bear that tax.  The newspapers, I suppose, will pay it, or will they?  I cannot see that they are exempted.  I cannot see how some of this tax will be passed on to the newspapers.  I suppose the daily sale of newspapers in this country will probably be 400,000 or 500,000.  I am only guessing, but I think it will be something like that figure.  That should represent a retail sale turnover of roughly £5,000 or £6,000 every day.  The Minister should require and collect from that £5,000 or £6,000, on the terms of this Bill, £125 to £150 every day.  How will that be collected?  If £5,000 or £6,000 worth of newspapers are sold every day, and they must pay £125 to £150 tax, how will that tax be collected? What can be added to the cost of an ordinary newspaper?</P>
    <P>A great multitude of articles are sold by stores for small domestic purposes&mdash;the little household appliances, the little luxuries, like confectionery, <Col N="1360" /> cheap cosmetics, the magazines and weekly periodicals.  I do not know how they will pay it.  I do not know how many little traders will be driven out of business because they cannot collect this tax on these things and they cannot pay it to the Minister because they cannot collect it.</P>
    <P>I think this is an ill-considered and ill-advised proposal because it will not work.  I warn the Minister of that.  I have a great deal more experience of the retail trade than the Minister or the advisers of his Department.  Yesterday, the Minister praised the work of the accountants of this country.  I think any accountant would shudder at the slipshod proposals which this Bill contains.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said he had no illusions that people like taxation and would not reject it, if given the opportunity. That is quite true.  I think the people will emphatically dislike the chaos which this kind of taxation will bring. It is not tax, in the normal sense of the word, to which they would object. It is the method of collection which they would find undesirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot say to the retail trade: &ldquo;I want £10½ million: get it anywhere you like&rdquo;.  That is what he is saying.  It is not good enough.  It is a completely mediaeval conception of fund-raising by this State. I believe the law must be precise.  This is a completely imprecise proposal.</P>
    <P>If the law is to be precise, specified articles should be taxed at source to raise the amount the Minister requires and provision could be made not to add profits to the tax on such goods but to send them through the distributing channels until they got to the retailers counter with only net tax added to cost.  The trade would put up with that.  They would grumble but they would accept it.  The people would grumble but they would probably accept the net result.  However, the trade will not accept that there is to be a loose, free-for-all, in which retailers will decide that as Mrs. Murphy will not pay any tax on 1/2d. worth of goods, Mrs. Murphy, junior, will pay tax on 15/- worth and pay a higher rate of tax to compensate for the loss of tax on the smaller sale.  That seems an <Col N="1361" /> eminently commonsense view of the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not know who estimated that this tax would yield £10½ million.  On the basis of retail sales, the figures would run to £13 or £14 million, and that, without any change in the percentage. Does the Minister think that in future he or any of his successors will be able to resist the temptation to add one per cent or two per cent to this form of taxation when the organisation for collecting it is running, however incompetently? Whether Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael sit over there in future, this tax in its present form must go.  It must be replaced by a tax which courageously defines and lists the articles bearing the tax.  That would create a fabric of taxation that might be crushing and very widespread, but the burden would at least be clear in its purpose and effect and would not be befogged by a lazy ministerial instruction to traders to pass it on and carry it where they like. That is not the way the State should operate.  That is what the people of Dublin told the Minister last week in the by-election and I think it is what the people of the country would tell the Government, if they had the opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never yet seen a Budget which did not result in opposition to whatever form of tax was decided on for the collection of the money.  We would have the self-same cry if it were proposed to put a couple of pence on the pint, on whiskey or on tobacco.  Up to now, the main sources of tax revenue have been drink, tobacco and petrol.  I consider this is a fair measure under which everyone pays a little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About a fortnight ago, I had a rather strange experience when I went into a local public house one evening. It was packed.  The owner of the house immediately attacked me on the turnover tax.  I said I was prepared to leave it to the jury, the jury being her packed public house.  I told them what the position was.  I said: &ldquo;Most of you are working now in decent employment. Money has to be found for <Col N="1362" /> industry to provide more employment for our people.  Is there any man listening to me here who would not be willing to pay 6d. in the £ out of his wages to give employment to the poor devil who has no work?  If there is, let him put up his hand.&rdquo; Not a single hand went up.  I told them we had to find a few million pounds to modernise the plant at Irish Steel and to increase the employment there.  I told them: &ldquo;I am in hunting a couple of farmers to get cheques off them to provide a new industry in the town of Midleton.&rdquo; Five of these factories are going up.  The employment in the factories themselves will be 2,000 and on the land, from 15,000 to 20,000. The Government contribution to that will roughly be £1½ million.  When I asked them if any man would grudge paying 6d. in the £ to provide that employment, not one hand went up.</P>
    <P>This talk by Deputy Barry is pure nonsense.  The Licensed Association meet and decide to raise the price of the pint or put 2d. or 3d. on whiskey. There is no humming or hawing.  On it goes, and there is no noise from anybody. When speaking on the Budget, I gave instances of what was happening. You can go into the large drapery shops in Cork today and buy a dozen of eggs at from 9d. to 1/- less than that shop paid for them.  You can buy butter there at 3/11 a 1b., which cost the shops 4/4 to buy.  Why?  Because the other articles they are selling carry with them a profit of roughly 50 per cent, and in the case of British drapery goods, it is 63 per cent.  That is one of the reasons why you have this anxiety in Dublin to sell English goods.</P>
    <P>I hear a lot of talk about the Dublin North East by-election.  I take about as much notice of that as if we had a ballot box above on the Lee Road in Cork, that is, the mental hospital.  I would place about the same value on both.  I say that as one who has survived a lot of elections.  The main prop to get Fianna Fáil out in the election of 1948 was that £9 million was going to be spent on a new Dáil.  I tried to find some foundation for that when the election was over.  All I could find was this, at column 1027 of the official Reports of 25th May, 1945:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> I think it is a terrible mistake for us to shy away from undertaking great enterprises in the immediate future because they appear to cost a lot.  This is a time when we should mobilise credit and use it boldly and resolve, if necessary, to repay it over the next 100 years.  The extension of credit should not deter us from embarking on bold schemes at the present time, always provided that they are good schemes.  As a start in that direction, one good thing would be to build a new Oireachtas, and it would prove to be an economy in the long run.  We are eternally patching and tinkering with these buildings in order to make them adequate to fulfil the functions of an efficient Parliament.  It is common knowledge that half the Deputies cannot find accommodation in which to write a letter.  Even the Ministers' rooms are inadequate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of thing that put out Fianna Fáil at that general election, but the only individual who made that statement was the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon.  He went on:</P>
      <P>The permanent officials are obliged to sit in cramped quarters up at the top and their teeth are made to chatter with the noise of the machinery in the basement, because we are trying to dislodge a beetle through the medium of a vacuum cleaner in the roof.</P>
      <P>I have seen an election won on that kind of thing.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were accused of squan-dermania. When I read Deputy Dillon's suggestion that we should mobilise credit and use it boldly and resolve, if necessary, to pay it back over the next 100 years, I looked to see whether he had carried out that policy during the three-and-a-half years he was Minister for Agriculture. This is what I found, as reported at column 168 of the Dáil Report of 23rd April, 1952:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> Mr. Corry asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the total amount of State borrowing (a) in each of the years 1947-48 to 1951-52, inclusive; (b) in the years 1932-33 to 1947-48, inclusive, and (c) in the years 1923-24 to 1931-32, inclusive.</P>
    <P>Here is the answer:</P>
    <P>The net amounts borrowed for Exchequer purposes in the years mentioned by the Deputy were as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  1947-48, £5,004,000;</P>
    <P>1948-49, £8,951,500;</P>
    <P>1949-50, £20,539,000;</P>
    <P>1950-51, £21,686,000;</P>
    <P>1951-52, £38,938,900;</P>
    <P>(b)  1932-33 to 1947-48, inclusive &mdash;£51,316,400;</P>
    <P>(c)  1923-24 to 1931-32, inclusive &mdash;£29,326,800.</P>
    <P>That was £98 million borrowed to run the nation for three and a half years. That was portion of the price of what was familiarly known as the &ldquo;Johnny Costello pint&rdquo;.  I also asked the Minister on the same date the amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy relate all this to the Budget proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating what happened in previous Budgets where the people were relieved of taxation considered necessary to run the country for the year, and the results, and who paid it.  In this case, I asked the Minister if he would state the amount payable and paid in interest and sinking fund in the financial year 1947-48 and the total amount payable in interest and sinking fund in the financial year 1952-53.  The reply was that in 1947-48 the total amount payable was £4,224,334 and in 1952-53, that jumped to £10,080,400.  When those gentlemen were gone, the Fianna Fáil Government coming after them had to raise that amount from the people.  That is the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entitled to ask now how they intend to get the money.  I said previously that there was a little difference between the Parties.  We believe that when money is borrowed, you should <Col N="1365" /> get, through revenue each year, the principal and interest to repay it.  Fine Gael believe in borrowing to pay the interest on what they already owe.  That is the difference between the two Parties in regard to financial matters. We are entitled to know what is their policy.  How do they propose to get this money?  Whom will they tax for it?</P>

      <P>Speaking with a full sense of responsibility as chairman of the largest agricultural organisation in the country, if I am to take the line of policy suggested by the published statements of the Leader of the Opposition, I do not think anybody, farmer or labourer, would vote for them in support of that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that when a Deputy definitely proposes the abolition of what I might call the most profitable industry our farmers have today, the beet industry, and alludes to it as a daft scheme, that must be taken as policy.  Deputy Dillon said:</P>
      <P>Is there any Deputy who would argue with me that the community is getting better value in the maintenance of that daft scheme at a cost of £3 million per annum than it would get if we were in a position to raise the family allowance in every poor house from 2/6 to 7/-? Every farmer in this country who has four children in his house could receive for the benefit of these children 14/- per week in lieu of the 5/-he is now getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only basis on which I can judge the policy of Fine Gael in regard <Col N="1366" /> to beet.  That was the statement of their Leader here on 6th June, 1946.</P>
    <P>He became Minister for Agriculture two years afterwards.  We had gone to the trouble, in co-operation with the Irish Sugar Company, of carrying out costings on over 400 farms and on those costings, the farmer was paid for the production of beet just as at present.  But the first lead we got from the Fine Gael Government at that time was a letter to the directors of the Sugar Company which said that the Government had been far too generous to the farming community and that they could not for a moment agree to any increase in the price of beet in the coming season.  That was signed by the then Deputy Morrissey, Minister for Industry and Commerce, and agreed to, of course, by the Minister for Agriculture.  In the following year, there was an immediate reduction in the acreage of beet and the Irish people had to import 75,000 tons of foreign sugar which, landed here, cost £12 per ton more than the best Irish sugar.  That was practically £1 million more they had to pay for the foreign sugar than they would have paid for Irish sugar.  That was followed on this policy and this statement by the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>That was his attitude.  Now that industry has spread out into another branch, a branch that is taking very well with the farming community, giving them a further opportunity of increasing their incomes in growing a crop that will pay them, as well as giving an enormous amount of employment. Is that the way Deputy Dillon would suggest to get the couple of million pounds he would require if he were over here for the next 12 months.  Scrapping the beet factories and disemploying the men?  What hope is there for agriculture if that is the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition?  What hope have we of carrying on the factories into which the shareholders have put their money?  The factories are ready to go ahead.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what the position would be, if there were a change of Government in the morning.  The last time we had a change one industry <Col N="1367" /> in my constituency in Haulbowline immediately felt the blast.  The blast was a fairly severe one.  They were not allowed to buy billets to produce good steel.  They were not even allowed to produce first-grade scrap on the instructions of Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Norton.  Third-rate scrap was considered good enough. Things went so far that the general manager of the company threw up his job and walked out.  The steel produced there came up here and was rejected by a Dublin merchant. The number of workers in the industry was reduced by over 230 in the 3½ years that that Government were in office.  That was the position adopted by that Government in order to find money.  They were not allowed to buy billets.  They were not even allowed to buy railway rails.</P>
    <P>These are the things at which we have to look; these are the things we have to consider.  The position all round was practically the same.  Take the dairy farmers.  The attitude of the Leader of the Opposition towards dairying is an extraordinary one. Here is his statement:</P>
    <P>We are subsidising butter production to the tune of £2 million per annum.  How long will that go on?  Do we expect butter to get dearer in the markets of the world? Do we expect a time in the early future when the price of butter will become so adjusted that it will be possible to suspend this subsidy or do we intend to continue producing milk for conversion into butter at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £2 million a year?  I want to go on record most emphatically that I think such a policy is sheer insanity and is purely pursued for the purpose of maintaining prestige and incompetence in the office of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>That was the statement of the Leader of the Opposition on that particular aspect of our agriculture.  When he became Minister for Agriculture, the first shot he fired was to adjust the price of milk by telling the farmers, who were then getting ¼ a gallon, that they would get &ldquo;one bob&rdquo; a <Col N="1368" /> gallon for the next five years, and were they prepared to produce it at that?  That was his attitude towards the agricultural community.  I do not believe it has changed.  I have seen nothing go on record since that statement was made by the Leader of the Opposition that would show any change in his attitude in regard to agriculture.  He was going to save another £2 million there.  You have £3 million saved by closing the beet factories and £2 million saved on the dairy farmers, making £5 million altogether&mdash;£5 million of the £10 million for which Deputy Barry is looking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not looking for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He went even further. The first job they did after they became a Government was to reduce the price of wheat, followed by a reduction of £4 a ton on the price of feeding barley.  Whatever about the feeding barley, I was certainly not surprised at his attitude in regard to wheat.  I laugh now when I hear Deputy Dillon looking for a price for wheat.  Here is his statement of 18th June, 1947, at column 2050 of Volume 106 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>...for the first time since the emergency, we had the enthralling, stimulating and surprising experience of eating bread made out of Irish wheat.  Before you ate it you had to hold it out in your hands, squeeze the water out of it, then tease it out and make up your mind whether it was a handful of boot polish or a handful of bread.  If it was boot polish you put it on your boots or shoes and if it was bread you tried to masticate it if you were fit.</P>
      <P>That was the statement of the Leader of the Opposition on bread made from Irish wheat.  What hope had the farmer growing wheat of any kind of a fair deal from that leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard this so often from the Deputy that I am beginning to think it is his own statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the policy laid down for agriculture by the Leader <Col N="1369" /> of the Opposition.  Apparently that is the manner in which the greater portion of this money will be found by them.  We are entitled to know.  We are entitled to have some definite statement for the protection of the wheat growers and the beet growers of this country.  We are entitled to have some definite statement with regard to the position of the milk producers.  These are the statements we are entitled to have from the Opposition, something from which they will not run away if the miracle ever happens and they succeed again in crossing the floor of this House.</P>
      <P>These are serious matters.  One comes along and finds that in the year 1963 we are still paying £6 million odd per year principal and interest for the £98 million borrowed by those gentlemen to run this country for 3½ years.  I will not deal now with what happened when the people gave them a second chance.  We saw the excitement and the fright during that period. We saw everything dropped.  I have been a member of the Cork County Council for close on 40 years and I remember that the grant money that should have come was not forthcoming. They had no money to pay anything. They had a clear majority in this House at that time.  Still they cleared out after three years.  Why? Now they want another chance.  They want it, if you please, on the result of the North-East Dublin election and I have given my opinion on those electors already and will not take it any further.</P>
      <P>As one who knew his father in this House, I am glad to see Deputy Belton here but, of course, I would prefer to see one of our own.  It is the luck of the game.  If Fine Gael succeeded in bluffing the people for three weeks, they were lucky.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see how this tax works out. Let us see the result of the first year of its operation and how many moans there will be.  As I told the Minister for Finance when speaking on the Budget, I will guarantee here and now that 80 per cent of Deputy Barry's class, the shopkeepers, will be looking for income tax relief next April on the two and a half per cent which they <Col N="1370" /> will not have passed on, and he knows that just as well as I do.  They will be looking for income tax relief on it as an extra cost.  That is how they stand. Those are the facts as I see them.</P>
    <P>We have succeeded in turning the scale as far as employment is concerned. It has cost money.  You cannot provide employment here for men who formerly had to seek employment in England without the State stepping in and being pretty generous in regard to manufacturers who provide that employment.  We have done that and are doing it.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, when I asked the ordinary workers whether or not they were prepared to pay sixpence in the £ in order to provide employment for the unfortunate fellow who has no work, I could not get one out of over 60 in the room to put up his hand against it.  Is there a Deputy on the other side of the House who, if we said we wanted to get this money by putting sixpence on the glass of whiskey, would not rush into the lobby against it, making as much noise about it as they are doing now?  If we said we would get it by putting a tax on tobacco there would be the same result. If we said we would put an extra tax on petrol, I do not know what they would do.</P>
    <P>These are the facts in regard to this matter and I do not wish to delay the House further in regard to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that we are not opposed to the imposition of the necessary taxation to raise sufficient revenue to meet essential national expenditure but we are opposed to reckless and indiscriminate expenditure without securing value for the money spent or deciding, in the case of either capital or current expenditure, a correct and appropriate order of priorities.  Every rational person recognises that essential State services must be maintained. These refer to the ordinary current expenditure by the State Departments or State social benefits such as social welfare, health and other services.  But, we are opposed to spending merely for the sake of spending without due regard being paid <Col N="1371" /> to the purposes for which the money is spent, the type of work being undertaken and which involves heavy demands on the community to raise the funds to meet the expenditure.</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill centres almost entirely on the proposal contained in Part VI, which provides for the turnover tax.  I want to make it clear that we are not opposed to improved social services.  In fact, on each of the occasions that we were in office improved social services and health services were provided.  Indeed, it has often been remarked that every time there is a change of Government old age pensions are increased.  What I want to ensure is that when social welfare beneficiaries are given increases these monetary increases will not be nullified or reduced by a rise in the cost of living.  The difference between our approach to this matter and the approach of Fianna Fáil is that under Fianna Fáil there has been a very steep and continuous rise in the cost of living which has offset any monetary increase in the benefits paid to old age pensioners, widows and orphans and the recipients of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  This is bad social policy and bad economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want at this stage to examine the various views that have been published concerning the proposal to introduce a purchase or sales tax.  This matter, as Deputies will recollect, was considered by the Commission on Income Taxation and it is well to recall what the Commission recommended.  It is equally important in considering that to remember that this proposal, which is not the one enshrined in the turnover tax, but the proposal included in the recommendation of the Majority Report of the Commission on Income Taxation, was carried by a majority of only one vote.  So far as I can find, there were six members of the Commission in favour of a purchase tax and five against it.  Having considered the matter and having expressed their views in the Report, the majority eventually came to the conclusion included in the recommendation made <Col N="1372" /> in Paragraph 115 on Page 50 of the Third Report, in which it is said:</P>
    <P>We accordingly recommend the introduction of a purchase tax at a rate or rates of between 7½ and 15 per cent on a base of £65/67 millions wholesale value, but in any event excluding&mdash;</P>
    <P>and the exclusions are important&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  goods essential for agricultural production,</P>
    <P>(b)  goods essential for industrial manufacture,</P>
    <P>(c)  exports, agricultural and industrial,</P>
    <P>(d)  food, particularly essential food,</P>
    <P>(e)  fuel,</P>
    <P>(f)  newspapers and books,</P>
    <P>(g)  household non - durable goods,</P>
    <P>(h)  goods already subject to heavy customs and excise duties, e.g. tobacco,</P>
    <P>(i)  works of art, and goods that are primarily of a cultural nature.</P>
    <P>They go on&mdash;and, indeed, when you come to this part, you see how innocent these men were of the economic facts of life&mdash;</P>
    <P>We recommend that the purchase tax be a part-substitute for income tax and that the revenue from it be used to reduce the rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>Of course, there has been no proposal in the Budget to reduce income tax and I want to refer the House to the views expressed by Professor Meenan in an Addendum to the Minority Report:</P>
    <P>Finally I cannot believe for a moment that the implied bargain of a reduction in the standard rate of income tax to five shillings in return for a limited purchase tax would be regarded as inviolable.  Some day or other the standard rate would begin to inch upwards again and the final result would not be a redistribution of taxation but a new tax.</P>
    <P>In addition to the views expressed in the Minority Report, the views of three economists are quoted.  They are three <Col N="1373" /> persons from different universities, all of whom were invited by the Commission to give their views on the tax.  The Rev. W. Paschal Larkin, O.F.M.Cap., Professor of Economics, University College, Cork, said:</P>
    <P>The expediency of a general purchase tax is very controversial. Its suitability for this country is very questionable owing to our low per capita income, and our rather static consumption habits.  Even in England ...there is a strong campaign for further substantial reductions in purchase tax, and its ultimate abolition.</P>
    <P>Professor G.A. Duncan, Professor of Political Economy, University of Dublin, said:</P>
    <P>All (sales or purchase) taxes possess three qualities in common:</P>
    <P>(i)  They are excise duties, falling with greater or less inequity according to their technical construction;</P>
    <P>(ii)  They are regressive, since, to raise revenue in significant amounts, they must fall on articles of common consumption;</P>
    <P>(iii)  They impose vast amounts of paper-work and accounting on traders, and consequently predispose to evasion. </P>
    <P>I doubt if sales, purchase or turnover taxes have had a happy history anywhere, except as excises at wholesale level expressed specifically on easily traceable commodities&mdash;and then their produce is somewhat inflexible.</P>
    <P>Mr. David O'Mahony, Lecturer in Economics, University College, Cork, said:</P>
    <P>A purchase tax would tend to raise the cost of living and thus stimulate demands for increases in money incomes, which would in turn increase costs and thus impair our competitive position.</P>
    <P>The Report says:</P>
    <P>It will be noted that none of these three economists expresses himself in favour of a purchase tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> There is even more compelling evidence in the memo submitted by the Revenue Commissioners to the Income Tax Commission and dated 27th August, 1957.  It says:</P>
    <P>Theoretically the retail stage is the ideal level, i.e. the tax would be charged on the actual price at which the commodity is sold to the final consumer.  In practice however, because of the huge number of traders who would be brought within the tax net, a tax at the retail level would be costly and difficult of administration, and taxation at an earlier level is to be preferred.  A tax at the wholesale level would seem to be feasible in this country. It would not be unduly expensive to administer and would be preferable to taxation at the manufacturing level.</P>
    <P>The Capital Investment Advisory Committee in their Third Report stress the importance of encouraging enterprise by changes in taxation and increasing tax incentives for the investment of savings at home, for the investment at home of past savings now held overseas and for the attraction of foreign capital.</P>
    <P>All those views expressed by the Revenue Commissioners and the three economists rejected and condemned a purchase tax or a sales tax, and they would have been in stronger opposition to a turnover tax which was not confined to a limited number of commodities. All these views rejected it on different grounds.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is in conflict with the views expressed in <i>Economic Development</i> where it is stated on page 22&mdash; and it was published with Government authority and approval in 1958:</P>
    <P>Indeed, the limit of taxable capacity has been reached in some directions and it is difficult to see any method by which additional revenue on a substantial scale could be raised without injurious effects on employment and on economic activity in general.  A general purchase tax, for instance, would have an immediate reaction on sales of Irish products and would probably, in the end, have inflationary effects on wages and salaries and the cost of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> It went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is desirable that taxes on spending should bear most heavily on less essential imports as this helps to ensure the retention at home of as much as possible of the stimulating effect of capital formation on employment.</P>
    <P>All those views expressed after serious consideration by economists and the Revenue Commissioners, who had the accumulated experience of the various proposals as well as practical experience of the difficulties involved in raising revenue, were opposed to a purchase tax, and not merely a purchase tax on a limited range of commodities and, with the exception of the majority report which was carried by one vote only, all the people who were appointed on the Income Tax Commission were opposed to it.  The three economists I have mentioned rejected it and gave reasons for rejecting it.</P>
    <P>There is an even more compelling argument which I quoted previously but I think it is important to refer to it again.  I quote now from a speech made by the Taoiseach and reported in the Official Report of 17th May, 1956, at column 621, volume 157.  He said:</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that most people who have written upon the theory of public finance subscribe to the view that it is desirable that the number of separate taxes should be kept as few as possible, that the State should rely for the bulk of its revenue on a few main taxes and should not try to multiply the number of separate taxes.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>There is an obvious reason for that.  It is undesirable that the hand of the tax-gatherer should be brought into business.  The number of businesses subject to the regulation which is necessarily involved in the collection of taxes should be kept to a minimum.  Government intervention for tax-raising purposes in any business always results in waste and is a cause of higher costs as well as of higher prices.  Furthermore, it is obvious to expect that the smaller the yield from any tax the <Col N="1376" /> higher will be the proportion of that yield absorbed in collection expenses. And, the wider the number of taxes, the greater the prospect of successful evasion by individuals.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that when that speech was made by the Taoiseach, the commodities subject to taxes were what we in this country regarded as the traditional tax revenue commodities: beer, tobacco, petrol, income tax, surtax and perhaps a few others.  Compared with the proposal enshrined in this Bill, they were infinitesimal in number compared with the limitless range of commodities affected by this measure.</P>
    <P>One of the objections which was expressed not merely by the trade concerned but by all those who have written or spoken on this matter is the indiscriminate nature of the tax. In fact, I notice from the booklet which was published&mdash;and I gather from discussions with trade representatives&mdash; that this is to be a free for all.  This booklet on the turnover tax says at page 7:</P>
    <P>There may be special problems for retailers dealing in pre-packaged goods and commodities sold in small quantities at standard prices.  These problems are capable of solution by adjustment of quantities and prices and the Minister for Finance is actively seeking the co-operation of the trading interests concerned in the matter.  Slight changes in standard prices or quantities may, therefore, be expected but each retailer will continue to be free to decide the prices he will charge.</P>
    <P>I remember a few years ago, when the obligation to sell bread by weight was removed, the vociferous criticism by the present Government when in Opposition, the criticism that people were being sold goods below a certain weight.  Since then we have had here a Prices Bill which has been consigned to the archives and we also have the Fair Trade Commission.  The Fair Trade Commission regulations as well as the legislation make it obligatory on traders not to enter into any agreement with wholesalers to fix prices or to agree on any restrictive practices. Any suggestion similar to that contained <Col N="1377" /> in this booklet would be contrary to the principles of the Fair Trade Commission.  We must decide now is it proposed to jettison the policy behind the Fair Trade Commission, to jettison the general agreement not only in this House but throughout the country that fair trading rules should operate because the proposal in this booklet and the indications given at discussions which these traders have had is that they can make some arrangement and some adjustment in weight.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is in any country that has not a decimal system a satisfactory method available for operating a purchase tax.  Sweden is a country in which there are comparable taxes but in Sweden there is a suitable small value coin available because of the decimal system but in this country under the present sterling system it is impossible for traders selling goods to operate this tax.  It is relatively easy to suggest that, where people pay a grocery bill at the end of the week, the bill can be totted up and the two-and-a-half per cent marked on it but the average individual does not confine his purchases to one purchase at the end of the week.  Every household finds that it has to buy certain commodities at different times and in different quantities and so far as small sales of essential foodstuffs are concerned this tax will press at the same rate on those commodities as it will press on a television set or some other electrical gadget that is not in general use or essential.</P>
    <P>One of the strong recommendations in the majority report in this connection, objectionable and all as it may have been, had a far less objectionable basis and was not by any means as comprehensive as this one and it was only carried by a majority of one vote. I do not believe a major tax structure of this nature should be introduced in this country or in any other country on the mere chance vote of one person on a commission of this sort.  However, that recommendation excluded essential food and fuel.  I need not recite the other commodities that were excluded but all these representations <Col N="1378" /> were based on the assumption that food and fuel would be excluded.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have spoken in the course of this debate have adverted to the impossibility of operating this tax on any sort of a fair basis because of the fact that there is no unit of currency small enough in general use to operate the tax equitably.  I believe the views expressed in the leading article of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 18th June are correct.  The article reads:</P>
    <P>Let us take a random example, say, cigarettes.  The retailer has to pay tax on the cigarettes he sells. He does not have to recoup it from the customer who buys cigarettes; he may instead put the cigarette tax on the bread which he also stocks. The shop next door, however, may choose to put the cigarette tax on cereals.  Up the road may be a shop which simply increases cigarette prices while the supermarket round the corner will not put up the prices of any commodity, but simply add 6d. in the £ to the customer's total bill.  The result will be that in the same neighbourhood cigarettes, cereals and bread will be selling for widely different prices in each shop ... The confusion is made no easier by the fact that the retailer must pay tax on his sales of cereals and bread as well as on cigarettes.</P>
    <P>That precisely sets out the possible consequences, although it is more than likely that bread or any other essential commodity will be sold at the same price because of the obvious trading disadvantages but it must be remembered that this tax taxes at the same level and at the same rate as non-essentials, essential food, clothing and fuel. One inevitable result of this and the arguments in favour of the fact that the cost of living will rise do not require to be requoted.  They have been expressed by the present Taoiseach when in Opposition.  They have been expressed by economists who have their views considered by the Commission on Income Taxation.  They have been expressed in every recommendation, either minority or majority, of the Commission on Income Taxation.  However, if any practical evidence is needed, the <Col N="1379" /> Retail Grocers and Allied Trade Associations have been notified by the trade union catering for the workers that once this tax goes on they will seek wage and salary adjustments to offset the effect.  If that applies to one category of employee, does it not apply to all?  Is it not inevitable that the same pattern of reaction will spread to other trade unions?</P>
    <P>With that result, how is there any basis for the suggestions contained in the Government White Paper, Closing the Gap?  The Government in that White Paper said:</P>
    <P>The Government are convinced that it is necessary to avoid the damage to the national economy which would occur if further wage, salary or other income increases, whether in the public or private sector, took place before national production had risen sufficiently.</P>
    <P>One of the objections to this tax contained in the memorandum submitted by the Revenue Commissioners was that it would affect Irish industry, that it would affect Irish industry equally with the goods sold from industrialists abroad.  One of the objections was that it would lessen competitiveness and capacity.  The Minority Report of the Commission on Income Tax states:</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed us that &ldquo;a sales tax must be viewed primarily as a device to bring within the tax net the products of Irish industry&rdquo;.  Their memorandum goes on to point out that, by comparison with Britain, &ldquo;there is less diversity and buoyancy here, less certainty of export outlets, and therefore greater sensitivity of industry to any adverse influences on the home demand for its products&rdquo;.  For these reasons we believe that it would be very unwise to hamper our industries by the imposition of a purchase tax.</P>
    <P>The purchase tax recommended was far less embracing and comprehensive than the turnover tax enshrined in this Bill.  One of the arguments advanced by Government spokesmen is that this is necessary for social purposes and to <Col N="1380" /> improve social welfare benefits.  In order to advance that case and give it greater authority, the Taoiseach has recently started to quote the Papal Encyclicals, <i>Mater et Magistra</i> and <i>Pacem in Terris.</i> Even in this week of Ascot fashions, I find it difficult to see the Papal Encyclicals as a suitable mantle for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I want to look for a moment to see how we are considering social priorities and the way in which effective action has been taken.  Social priorities do not stop at, nor are they confined to, social welfare services and the health services. Quite recently, we had the serious effects of the adverse weather in the collapse of houses in Dublin.  No one suggests that the Government were responsible for that.  Unfortunately, these events did occur, but what the Government could have done was to keep up the building rate which was operating before they came into office so that some of these people would have been taken out of those buildings.</P>
    <P>It has become one of the easiest untruths for Fianna Fáil to propagate to say that fewer houses were being built and that there was some delay in the housing programme.  The following are figures published in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1962 published last month. I want to quote figures for houses built in both rural and urban areas in 1956 and 1957, for part of which period we were in office.  In the rural areas, 1,648 houses were built by the local authorities in 1956, and in the urban areas, 2,363 houses were built.  In 1957, in the rural areas, there were 1,617 and in the urban areas, there were 3,167.  The total number of houses built with State aid in 1956 was 9,837 and in 1957, 10,969.  We come then to 1961/62 and we find for the rural areas in 1961,627 houses were built and in the urban areas, 836.  In 1962, 455 houses were built in the rural areas and 783 in the urban areas, a total of 5,798 for 1961 and 5,626 for 1962&mdash; in one case slightly over half, and in the other, approximately half, the number built in 1956/57.  If there has been any delay in rehousing people from the slums or unfit dwellings, the responsibility lies heavily on the present Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> Then we come to employment.  In local authority housing schemes in 1956, there were 6,045 employed and in 1957, the number had dropped to 3,500.  In 1961, the last year for which figures are available, the number was 1,694.  I believe we should have a proper order of social priorities but they are not confined merely to monetary benefits.  One of the most urgent tasks&mdash;and I referred to this on the Budget debate&mdash;is to get an agreed capital development programme because at the same time as that drop in housing occurred, we saw in Dublin the erection of extensive buildings, public offices and State companies.  I know the Government have no responsibility for private building and we all welcome as much building as possible but there should be an adequate system of priorities. Shortly before the houses collapsed in Dublin recently, we had three vast luxurious hotels opened in one week. Where public money is involved, and in these cases public capital expenditure is involved to the extent that some State companies participated in the undertakings, there should be a proper system of priorities.  A first charge should be the needs of our people, particularly housing and hospital accommodation.  Other building should then be put in an orderly queue.</P>
    <P>When this Government were elected, they claimed that over a five-year period, they had plans to provide additional jobs for those anxious to secure work.  I do not want to weary the House by repeating the proposals in the speech made by the then Deputy Lemass, but I do want to compare the results of our period of office and the present period.  The following are figures taken from the <i>Economic Statistics Issued Prior to the Budget.</i> If we take the total number in employment, we find that in 1962, it was 1,068,000 and in 1956, 1,127,000.  At the same time as that drop occurred, we had a continued substantial rise in emigration which most people agree was not less than 300,000 over the past six years.  So that not merely have we not maintained the employment that previously existed but emigration is continuing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> Equally significant is the fact that today it costs between £50 million and £60 million more to run the State than it did in 1956-57.  The audited expenditure on public services as published in the Book of Estimates showed that it was £109,456,420 and in 1962-63, it had gone to £153,987,980.  The estimated figure for 1963-64 is £167,036,460.  The country is entitled to know how it is that with fewer people in employment and with a continued rate of emigration, it costs £50 million or £60 million more now than it did six years ago to provide fewer people with essential services and with fewer people at work, fewer houses been built by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that people believe there is something wrong with the economic administration of this State and the policy operated by the Government? We do not say there has not been in the meantime a change in the value of money.  To some extent, the value of money has tumbled and this would account for an increase in the cost of administering State services, but can anyone suggest the drop is sufficient to warrant an increase in State expenditure of from £50 million to £60 million?</P>
    <P>One of the points made in the course of a speech by the Taoiseach to some Fianna Fáil committee in Mount Street last week was that Fianna Fáil policy was not widely understood and he suggested that Fine Gael were to blame. I believe the contrary is true, that it is precisely because the people understood the nature and extent of this Budget proposal&mdash;remember that on every platform throughout the recent by-election campaign the cry was that the money had to come from somewhere&mdash;that there was such an overwhelming reaction.  It is no function or responsibility of the Opposition to do what the Taoiseach said.  In the first place, they have not got the means of information, they have not got the knowledge, they have not got the financial statistics&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition have not this information available and <Col N="1383" /> the Taoiseach, when in Opposition, repeatedly said it was no function of the Opposition to provide a programme or to indicate the way in which the Government should raise the money. It would be impossible, from the resources available to the Opposition. It is precisely because the Government policy was understood that it was rejected.  Since the by-elections in Louth and East Cork in 1954, or the by-elections in Wicklow and North Cork in 1953, no more emphatic rejection of Fianna Fáil policy was ever expressed than in the recent by-election in Dublin.  It is easy for Deputy Corry to say he paid no attention to it, but for the benefit of Deputies who do not understand the type of constituency involved, I would explain that it is a large constituency, embracing a large cross-section of the community&mdash;workers, white collar employees, shopkeepers, trade unionists and residential as well as business and industrial property owners.  In that constituency, where Fianna Fáil won three out of the five seats at the general election, there was an overwhelming change of opinion.  Not merely did Fine Gael increase their poll but the Fianna Fáil poll dropped.  To give some indication of what the ordinary Fianna Fáil supporter and worker &mdash; I have no doubt they are getting fewer&mdash;thought, the defeated candidate said: &ldquo;Our horse was carrying too much weight.&rdquo; It was not a bad description but what Fianna Fáil want now is to put the same weight on every individual in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the people have reacted against.  Remember the opposition to this tax and its implications is not some device or some trumped-up effort by the Opposition to show its significance or its effects.  Traders throughout the country, many of them, in the past, Fianna Fáil supporters, trade organisations, business groups, have come together and expressed not merely their opposition but their view that it is impractical, inequitable, unfair and discriminatory in the sense that it operates to the same extent on the lower-paid sections as it does on the better-off sections of the community, <Col N="1384" /> that it applies equally to the 21b. loaf, to the lb. of butter and the television set or some other non-essential commodity.</P>
    <P>People understood precisely what this tax meant in a way in which it would be difficult for any political organisation, certainly without the services of a Party newspaper, to get across.  The people rejected by an overwhelming vote any suggestions of illusory social benefits, and they were illusory because there is no use in giving out money in increases to old age pensioners and other social welfare classes and putting on with the other hand a tax on food and fuel.  I have not much faith in the recommendations of the limited purchase tax suggested by the Majority Report of a recent committee, although I do not question their <i>bona fides</i> or anxiety to provide a remedy, but even in that report the suggestion of a tax on food or fuel was rejected.</P>
    <P>One of the objections is not that this Budget taxes commodities not already taxed but that, in addition, it taxes commodities already bearing their share, commodities such as beer, spirits, tobacco and petrol.  Spirits and tobacco might be regarded as non-essentials, but petrol affects the cost of production, affects the cost of distribution and, to a very considerable extent, this new tax will affect the cost of transport.</P>
    <P>As well as the tax on these commodities, this Bill will also impose a tax which I criticised during the Budget debate&mdash;the tax on betting.  People unfamiliar with the manner in which the bloodstock industry operates may feel that if people want to bet, they should pay tax on it.  First of all, they are taxed already.  There is a tax on bets in starting price offices; there is a tax imposed by the Racing Board on course bets with bookmakers; and there is a tax by the Racing Board in respect of bets placed with the totalisator.</P>
    <P>My main reason for opposing this is that the bloodstock or racing industry in this country provides first-class employment.  It is an industry spread throughout the rural areas, providing excellent male employment.  In addition, a most valuable export trade, <Col N="1385" /> without subsidy, is established through this industry which has attracted to this country buyers from abroad as well as visitors to our racecourses.  That industry is maintained in a variety of ways.  One of these is that the Racing Board get, through a levy on course bets, revenue with which to pay for stakes as well as the carriage of horses to meetings.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of this proposal is to add 2½ per cent to the already heavy tax on this industry.  Last year, the Racing Board contributed a sum of £250,000 in stakes.  As well, it contributed £50,000 towards the carriage of horses to meetings&mdash;a total of £300,000 in round figures.  Stakes were augmented by contributions from the executives of individual racecourses. Despite all that, and to some people it seems a considerable contribution, many executives have found that it is inadequate to attract big entries and the proper type of horse.  Many people have sought to run their horses in Britain and France because of the high stakes offered in these countries.  In order to supplement the assistance given by the Racing Board, a number of executives have operated sponsored races in the past few years.  Many public-spirited and sporting-minded companies, such as the Irish Sweep, Messrs.  Guinness, Messrs. Jameson, Power and other big companies, and some not so big, have combined to sponsor in some cases, or in other cases have individually sponsored, races, all with the design to assist this industry.</P>
    <P>At present course betting is taxed through the levy, the totalisator tax and SP betting.  All these are hit heavily by the tax.  Now, on top of this existing tax, additional taxation must be borne of a very heavy and penal character.  It is a fact that despite the expansion in money incomes in the past 15 or 16 years, the total sum bet has remained consistently constant. There has been a switch on occasion between the tote and SP or course betting but the amount of money in bets has maintained a constant pattern and for that reason I believe that these proposals are against the interests of the bloodstock industry <Col N="1386" /> Some years ago, when a tax was put on for a year, many people expressed opposition to it.  That tax was only for a year but this tax is forever, and I believe it is badly conceived and is against the interests of the bloodstock industry and the national interests as well.</P>
    <P>One of the matters raised during the discussions on the Finance Bill in previous years is the need to increase the allowance for income tax purposes in respect of unearned income.  I have repeatedly raised this matter, in common with other Deputies, and I want to refer to it again.  In this country, the position is that the maximum unearned income allowance is £600. In Britain, the allowance up to recently was £800 and I think it was raised last year, or the year before, by a further £100.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to this for two reasons.  One of the objections to this turnover tax is that it is indiscriminate in its application.  It applies to everyone, to the less well off as well as to those better able to pay.  Quite a number of retired personnel, in addition to their pensions, which they have earned over the years, are also existing on some income derived from accumulated taxed savings.  These savings are generally in some form of investment. Occasionally they may be in house property but generally they are in shares in industrial companies or some other form of investment.</P>
    <P>These people have, by thrift and their own exertions, accumulated these savings during their working lives. While they were accumulating them, they were charged the regular rate of income tax on the basis of earned income.  Now they are in retirement. Say a man and his wife have a combined pension of £600.  On top of that, they have accumulated past savings and invested them to bring in an income of £200 a year.  Therefore, they have a total income of £800.  Because of the present limit of £600, fixed when the cost of living was lower and the value of money was higher, they are only allowed the unearned income allowance of £600 and have to pay in respect of <Col N="1387" /> the other £200 at the unearned income rate.</P>
    <P>The reason this matter presses particularly heavily on these people is that, because of their total income, they are outside the scope of the ordinary social welfare benefits.  They cannot get a medical card or anything of that kind and, because of their age, they are excluded from the benefits of the voluntary health scheme.  Anyone who is on pension now was over age for inclusion in the voluntary health scheme.  They have fallen between both stools.  They are not entitled to a medical card or to social welfare benefits and they are excluded from membership of the voluntary health organisation.</P>
    <P>This limit of £600 presses very heavily on what we should regard as a very decent element in the community, an element who, by their own exertions, save money for the future, an element who are contributing in their own small way to the State capital programme by investing in ESB loans, in national loans or in private industrial undertakings.  They have, by their own exertions, accumulated past savings and they now find that if they had spent their money in the past, they would probably have been ultimately better off because they would now be entitled to some social welfare benefits and would not be obliged to pay income tax at the unearned income rate.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is a very strong case for increasing the present allowance from £600 to £800 or £900.  It has been raised twice in Britain since it was raised here, first, to £800 and lately, to £900.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to mislead the Minister or the House. The £200 is subject to the unearned income allowance.  Because of their thrift, they are excluded from social welfare benefits and because of their age, from voluntary health benefits.</P>
      <P>There is another matter I wish to refer to, that is, the clause of the Bill dealing with relief for sporting bodies and athletic bodies.  There is general approval of those proposals but I have had representations from the Aviation Club which has made representations to the Minister to the effect that the Bill is not clear as to whether the club will come within these exemptions.  I mention it because the club already pays and has been assessed for tax purposes in the sum of approximately £800 a year in respect of the revenue derived from flying displays.</P>
      <P>As the Minister and the House are aware, private flying is already subject to tax in the sense that they pay tax on petrol for use in private sport flying. The total tax which the club pays amounts in its estimate to about £1,500 a year.  It may be that it is intended to exempt the club at this stage but obviously the revenue from it from the point of view of the State is not considerable.  In fact, it is negligible.  This club has done very considerable work in promoting interest in flying and aviation.  Naturally, with present day costs, it is very difficult for a club of that nature to exist and I suggest the Minister should consider including it in the exemptions granted in Section 2 of the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to conclude by expressing the view which I expressed at the beginning, that we are opposed to this Bill primarily because of the turnover tax.  It is contrary to what was recommended by the Income Tax Commission where a purchase tax was recommended, provided it was accompanied by a reduction in income tax. We are opposed to this Bill because we believe this tax is inequitable and unfair in its application.  We oppose it in the circumstances in which it has been introduced, in the circumstances in which a modified purchase tax was recommended by a bare majority in <Col N="1389" /> the report and&mdash;this is a very valid circumstance&mdash;in the circumstance in which this is a minority Government. On the first occasion the public had an opportunity of expressing their opinion through the ballot box since the last general election, they emphatically repudiated this tax as neither in the national interest nor in the interest of the individual citizen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is essentially a political debate promoted by the desire of Opposition Parties to extract the maximum Party advantage from the tax proposals put forward by the Government in the Budget which are an integral, indeed, an essential, part of the Government's whole social and economic policy.  I do not object to that.  Political debates are appropriate in the Dáil so long as nobody pretends they are anything more&mdash;so long as there is no suggestion that the Dáil is being presented with alternative policies or alternative tax proposals.</P>
      <P>May I say that for such a well-publicised debate, it has turned out the dullest and the most boring of the session?  If Deputies opposite really believe they are likely to succeed in putting the Government out of office as a result of the debate, I wish they would pay us the compliment of showing more interest in it.</P>

      <P>Every comprehensive programme submitted to any Parliament by any Government must involve a balance of advantages and disadvantages&mdash;a certain amount of take for every element of give. Deputies opposite, of course, are dealing only with the less popular aspects of the Government's policy, ignoring or giving only lip-service to the social and economic objectives which that policy is designed to realise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to get this policy understood, <Col N="1390" /> Deputy Cosgrave says that our policy is sufficiently understood.  I do not think that is so.  Certainly, I want to remove from it all the ambiguities with which he clouded the policy of his Party.  He told us they are in favour of taxation in general but not in particular. He told us they are in favour of higher Government spending in general but not in practice.  He told us they are in favour of improved social services, provided they do not cost any money.  That type of ambiguous nonsense is not good enough for the electorate and certainly it is not good enough to persuade the Dáil to vote for a change of Government.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude, clearly and precisely expressed&mdash;that is how we want it.  We want no misunderstanding, no absence of clarity, no lack of precision.  We believe that if the benefits of the economic progress achieved by the policy of the Government are to be distributed fairly amongst the people generally &mdash; not merely in improved social welfare arrangements but in better educational facilities, extended health services, higher housing standards, the various public services and amenities which contribute to better living for the people&mdash;it can be achieved only by Government action and effective Government action must include tax arrangements which will enable Government expenditure on these services to be increased and increased year after year at least in proportion to the growth of national income.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is true, as the Labour Party tried to suggest, that the extension of the Government's social programme can be financed solely by direct taxation, that is, the taxation of personal incomes or company profits. I believe that if we were to attempt to do that, we would place the burden upon too small a section of our population and that the effect would be to operate to slow down or to stop the whole process of economic growth upon which social betterment depends.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a programme of social and economic progress supported by a sound system of taxation, then that system of taxation must be <Col N="1391" /> broadly based: that is the term we use and it is the most accurate we can devise.  It cannot be financed by taxes upon tobacco and alcoholic drink alone.  These taxes are far too uncertain as a source of revenue, far too liable to fluctuate by reference to circumstances which have no relationship to the economic programme of the country.</P>
    <P>If the policy of making sure that economic progress is automatically and adequately translated into better living conditions for the people is to be made effective, then a wider system of taxation must be instituted.  Most people accept this.  I have discussed the Government's proposals with representatives of all classes of our community up and down the country. I find no reluctance to face up to the fact that some more widely-based system of taxation must be devised and that a turnover tax or a sales tax or some other system of taxation relating to retail sales had to come, if not this year then at some time.</P>
    <P>Because most of everybody's income is spent in retail purchases, a system of taxation which is related to retail sales is by far the most effective in ensuring that the State revenue will increase in line with national resources and also that all will contribute to the economic and social progress of the country in proportion to their means. Of the various forms of taxation related to retail sales which could be devised or which have been tried out in other countries, the turnover tax&mdash; the one we have adopted&mdash;appears to be the easiest and cheapest to operate in Irish circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is a precise and clear definition of the Government's position.  If the other Parties in this House would be equally clear, then at least the net differences in our point of view would be understood.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, there has been an attempt in their amendment to the Second Reading motion to define their position.  I do not think their position is very logical or very realistic but they have, by so doing, helped to emphasise the negative attitude of Fine Gael, to draw a greater degree <Col N="1392" /> of public attention to their evasion of the policy issues confronting the Government and the country, to their entire lack of economic and social objectives and to their irresponsible and demagogic attitude in all this discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has already explained to the House that the Government were concerned to make sure that the new tax would not fall or would fall very lightly, on those people who could not afford to increase their present contributions to the public services. That is why this tax is linked with higher children's allowances.  How many Deputies who spoke about the tax have related it to this proposal to increase children's allowances?  By means of these allowance, we are making sure that the families of wage earners with children will have their incomes increased by amounts equal to or greater than the higher costs they may have to meet.  We have increased also the old age pension and other social welfare payments by amounts which are greater than the additional costs resulting from the tax could mean for their recipients.</P>
    <P>I will not make much of that, because I think it is very likely we would have proposed increases in the old age pension and other social welfare payments this year in any circumstances. At any rate, it is possible to estimate as far as almost half of the people are concerned&mdash;and that is the half with the lower incomes&mdash;they will be no worse off as a result of the introduction of the turnover tax, and they will be no worse off because the Government have taken measures to ensure that will be so.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are trying to foster the illusion that it is possible to finance economic and social programmes by income taxation alone, trying to propagate the viewpoint that the rest of the community are entitled to expect a greater increase in Government outlay for their benefit without making any contribution towards it.  I believe that policy is impracticable in its financial implications and undesirable in its moral implications. I do not question the genuineness of the Labour Party's desire to support <Col N="1393" /> the social improvements the Government have in mind to bring about, but I question both their sincerity and political wisdom when they try to propagate the wrong belief that people can get these benefits without making a contribution towards them.</P>
    <P>Our experience here in recent years should have driven home to us the truth that social progress does not automatically follow on economic progress.  Social progress has to be organised, and if the benefits of economic progress are to be fairly distributed among the population, that has to be organised also, and organised by the Government.  Economic progress, as we know and as we have proved, requires both planning and effort.  There is no plan which human ingenuity can devise which would make it possible without effort.  Social progress implies the willingness of all people to give up some part of their economic gains for community purposes&mdash;to meet the social obligations of the nation.  Deputy Cosgrave can scoff at the idea of Fianna Fáil adopting this policy in relation to the Papal Encyclicals.  We are not ashamed of it.</P>

Deputy Cosgrave referred to this organisation called RGDATA which is trying to work up a political agitation against the proposals for a turnover tax.  I can say that more than any other man in public life I helped to establish that organisation, to secure its acceptance by traders and to give it the status which it ultimately attained.  They owe me nothing on that account, but I thought they would behave in a situation such as this like all the other retail trade organisations which are sending their representatives to the Minister for Finance and discussing with him in a reasonable and intelligent way the Government's proposals, trying to ensure through these discussions that the proposals will be made to operate effectively and smoothly.</P>

      <P>Taxation must be an integral part of any system of government and if the taxation proposals which the Government have produced to support the comprehensive programme which we have enunciated are abandoned, the programme must also be abandoned.  I have already told the House that we are now working upon the second phase of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> that the first part of that work is now almost completed and that we hope to publish the results in the form of a Government Paper in the course of the next few weeks.  In preparing this Programme, we shall set out the objectives for national effort as we have assessed them, for the rest of the present decade, and it is intended, as I have explained, to follow up this general outline of objectives by discussions with the major organisations representing economic interests, with a view to the preparation and publication before the end of the year of a more detailed programme for their achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has shown how effective a positive integrated statement of objectives can be.  It has helped to propagate a climate of purpose and confidence in which all action becomes effective.  It is the experience of the working of that first Programme which has convinced the Government that national economic progress and the social improvements which economic progress makes possible can best be promoted by positive planning.  It has also convinced <Col N="1398" /> us of the important role of Government enterprise and State investment in the national economic advance.  If considerations of penny-pinching, cheeseparing economy and the avoidance of expenditure because of the political problems of tax adjustments are to be the determinants of progress, then all progress will grind to a halt.</P>
    <P>I should have thought there were some Deputies sitting opposite who had learned that lesson.  All members of the Dáil who served with, or supported, the first Coalition Government should certainly have learned it, if they are ever capable of learning anything. They came into office with the intention of cutting down on all the developments which the previous Fianna Fáil Government had planned for the post-war period, slashing all around them indiscriminately.  They came into office with the intention of closing down Shannon Airport.  Indeed, some Deputies were trying to cause some public concern about this matter recently&mdash;about the future of Shannon Airport.  Did they not realise that the only prominent man in Irish public life who ever advocated the closing down of Shannon Airport was the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dillon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In my opinion it would be much better to spend the most of our future appropriations on Collinstown. Whatever future this country may have as a centre of air navigation, it would be near Collinstown.</P>
      <P>He went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland as an intermediate stage upon the world traffic lines is a thing of the past.  It will be with <Col N="1399" /> the greatest difficulty that we shall remain on the aerial map at all.

I have no doubt that to say that at this stage will be regarded by some people as something like high treason: &ldquo;Is it not an awful thing to say.

From the very beginning of our effort to build up the industrial life of this country, to develop our industrial arm, we met the bitter, undeviating, relentless opposition of the Fine Gael Party.  By every device of intimidation, by organised blackguarding of the people who undertook to engage in industrial development, they tried to stop it.  Of course, many of the things they opposed then they claim now to have invented or thought of first, but their whole history of that period from its initiation has been directed by the belief that the Irish people are not fit for self-government, are not capable of organising themselves to produce here a degree of development, a level of civilisation as high as exists anywhere else.  Their lack of faith in the Irish people still persists, and their <Col N="1402" /> determination to stop the progress which the Fianna Fáil Government have initiated is inspired by their dislike of seeing the success which has attended our plans.  They are hoping now they will be able to create sufficient public uncertainty as to the future, sufficient lack of progress in the implementation of the Government's programme in the Dáil to prevent it realising the benefits which, all the indications are, it is certain to produce.</P>
      <P>For our part, we are going ahead now with the second Programme, which we expect to be as successful in stimulating national morale and introducing positive benefits for the country as was the first.  We are going to draw up as reasonable an estimate as is possible of the maximum increase which is attainable in total national production, and then to work whole-heartedly for its fulfilment.  Our second Programme will be more comprehensive than the first and we will set our targets somewhat higher, but it will be founded on the same principles as the first Programme.  Nothing will be possible in economic or social progress unless the Irish people are prepared to assist in it, to agree that the Government should on their behalf allocate from the growing pool of national resources through taxation whatever finances are needed to sustain it.  A plan alone is not enough.  It must be backed by courage and determination and pursued consistently.  It must particularly be financed, and financed from our own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, a sound Programme must be comprehensive.  Reference was made here to salaries, wages and incomes generally.  The Government's aim in regard to wages, salaries and incomes generally is, I think, becoming better understood.  I hope it will be even clearer to everybody very soon beyond the possibility of further misrepresentation. It is not designed to produce a wages standstill, as Deputy Dillon thought fit to allege.  On the contrary, our purpose is to make sure that wages will periodically and generally be increased in line with national production by a process which will minimise industrial strife and at the same time, <Col N="1403" /> make sure that the wage and salary earners participate in improving national conditions in a way and to an extent which will represent real gains to them, a real enhancement of the buying power of their earnings without the danger of rising prices negativing the increase or unemployment resulting from depressed exports or lower home market sales.</P>
    <P>We think that from time to time responsible people representing trade unions and representing employers should sit round a table to review the national circumstances and to measure the improvements in national production as a preliminary to the negotiation of national agreements for wage and salary adjustments and publish their conclusions for the guidance of those undertaking these negotiations. We think that the conclusions reached in such reviews should be made generally applicable by their voluntary acceptance and should determine the outcome of more detailed agreements to be negotiated at trade level as well as guiding the recommendations of the Labour Court and of all arbitration operations.  We do not mind very much the form of the consultative machinery to be set up, so long as it is effective in ensuring the application of the principle that adjustments of wages and salaries should be related to national circumstances and so related to the national circumstances as to make feasible increases which will not have adverse consequences on prices or employment.</P>
    <P>We believe that this is something that can be judged by reasonable men in a spirit of concern for the overall interests of the community and in a desire to promote the maximum rate of economic growth, not by the haphazard and unregulated methods of the past which could lead us into a period of not merely industrial conflict but economic depression which, if it once began, it might not be within our power either to control or to stop.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions issued recently a statement which did very much to clear the air.  It expressed their desire to see set up a National <Col N="1404" /> Economic Council and it stated certain principles which, as I have informed them, are in concurrence with the Government's views.  So far as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are concerned, therefore, there seems no reason why they should not be able to work with the Government to achieve the objectives stated in their document, the objectives of realising and maintaining full employment at adequate wages, operating on the basis of freely negotiated agreements designed, where possible, so to distribute the benefit of greater national resources available for wage increases as to afford proportionately greater gains to the more lowly-paid workers.</P>
    <P>As has been announced, I have communicated the Government's proposals in this regard to the Federated Union of Employers and the other employers' organisations co-operating with them, and to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I understand that it will be next month before the discussions on the Government's proposals which we have invited may be possible. It will be understood that until they have taken place, the Government must exercise their weight and influence to prevent any disruption of the situation which would prejudice the chances of these discussions being fruitful.  The Government have no illusions about the difficulty of bringing into being a system for periodic upward adjustment of wages and salaries on a free and voluntary basis which will prove workable and generally acceptable.  I believe it is our duty to try to do it and that it will be of enormous benefit to the wage earners, if we can succeed.  Indeed, some such system is essential to the successful operation of any plan for economic expansion.  Those who, like the Government, believe in planning for progress must wish for the success of our efforts.</P>
    <P>If the Government are defeated upon the Finance Bill, there will be a general election forthwith.  I confess that I like elections.  I like the personal challenge which they present.  I like the excitement.  I like even the uncertainty. When Opposition Parties start calling for an election, every personal feeling <Col N="1405" /> of mine prompts me to accommodate them but I have given the Dáil and I have given the country an undertaking that I will not ask for a dissolution, unless the Government are defeated in the Dáil.  I have said that the Government's plans, which include the publication and the launching of the second development programme, are based on the assumption that the present Dáil will last its full normal term.  That undertaking which I gave on my re-election as Taoiseach after the election in 1961 was, indeed, welcomed by many members of the Fine Gael Party who saw in the result of that election the possibility of some justification for the arguments which we had used in the constitution plebiscite, some support for the belief that there was danger in our system of elections which would tend to produce instability in Government.  While I believe that these arguments were sound, it is my intention to ensure so long as I am Taoiseach, that the country will be spared the danger of that instability and the adverse economic consequences that could arise from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said also that the Government's programme would not be modified or weakened in any way to avoid the risk of a Dáil defeat.  I said that we would proceed with our programme in all its aspects in exactly the same way as if the 1961 election had given us an overall Dáil majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever criticism the Opposition may offer of Government policy, they cannot say it is a time-serving one. They cannot allege that we are avoiding doing anything which we think it is right to do in order to escape creating political difficulties for ourselves. We see the nation's economic and social progress as necessitating higher outlay by the Government on both current and capital accounts.  We have proposed, and have backed our proposals with taxation arrangements which make them possible, a comprehensive plan of development.  We might, we know, have brought an easement of political criticism by avoiding <Col N="1406" /> these things, by sitting back and doing nothing.  We were not prepared to pay the price of a sacrifice of the national interest for the purpose of securing that avoidance of political risk or political criticism.</P>
    <P>Unless the Government are defeated in the Dáil, there will not be a general election until the autumn of 1966.  If we are defeated and we go to the people, it will be with this proposition, that there is no way that we can devise by which national progress can be got on the cheap.  There is no country in the world which is prepared to dole out charity to us, even if we would wish to take it.  There is no source by which development can be financed except the wealth we create by our own productive efforts.  If our people want to stop progress in order to avoid meeting the cost of it, if they want to do without better services in education, health, housing or social welfare, and so on, rather than pay for them, then they cannot be denied that right.  I do not believe they want that policy.  I believe that they will reject any Party that advocates it.  That is why Fine Gael, who want that policy, who believe in this cheeseparing type of economy, who want to stop progress because they have no confidence in the Irish people, will not spell out their real intentions but try to cover them up with the ambiguities which we have witnessed in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>When the issue is put to the people, it will be our concern to see that these ambiguities and these evasions will not be permitted.  We will smoke out into the open the real intentions of Fine Gael and reveal them to the people in all their unattractive nakedness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just listened to a very petulant, worried, blustering and frightened man.  We have listened to the type of man well known to certain sections of our people who makes sure that somebody is holding his arms when he says: &ldquo;I love it; let me at him.&rdquo; He talks about a general election but he is making sure, in so far as he can, that the people will not be allowed to pass <Col N="1407" /> judgment on himself, his Party or his policy.</P>
      <P>What is holding him back?  He says, a statement which he made here when he was elected Taoiseach.  At that time, he had not come to the House with new taxation proposals that had never before been put to the people.  At that time, the country was still ringing with Fianna Fáil speeches guaranteeing to the people that they recognised that the level of taxation was already too high.  There was no suggestion at the last election, or following it, that a new form of taxation applying to the entire retail trade would become part and parcel of the taxation armoury of Fianna Fáil.  That is what we have to consider in this debate.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that whether this turnover tax is good or bad, it is clear, and demonstrably clear, that the people are against it.  Who are the Irish people?  Are they the man who has just sat down and the people who clapped him?  Are they the lords and masters of the country?  Do they think they can think for the people?  Do they arrogate to themselves the right to say: &ldquo;We will consult our hearts and decide what is right for the country&rdquo;?  Are the people outside entitled to no say in the manner in which their country should be governed?  If that is the Fianna Fáil, or the Taoiseach's definition of democracy, I should like to know where the country is going.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made a speech, reported in the papers on 13th June, in which he referred to political demagoguery.  I should like to know what he means by that term.  Certainly, his speech here today seemed to me to be a practical demonstration of political demagoguery.  It was not a practical demonstration of political democracy.  The political democracy that is talked about from time to time by all political Parties is supposed to indicate that any major decision affecting the people and the country, should not be made without clear evidence that it is backed and supported by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This tax is opposed by the people <Col N="1408" /> from every part of the country, north, south, east and west, by every means available to them.  The workers, traders, shopkeepers, farmers, business people big and small, organised and unorganised, have indicated that they are against this manner of raising money, not to mention the vote of the people in the largest constituency in the country, in a free election.  The kind of speech we have just heard from the Taoiseach was presented to the people as the Government's case, and the people in that constituency, in a surprisingly high vote for a by-election, decided emphatically, by a two to one majority, that they did not want this tax, that they did not want this policy, that they did not want that Party and that they did not want the Government who suggested that course.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, I should like to ask where we are going in this country.  The Taoiseach says that if the Second Reading of the Finance Bill is defeated, there will be a general election.  Thanks for nothing.  Of course, there will be a general election, because it would demonstrate that even in this House, where vested interests dictate playing for safety, he would have ceased to have the confidence of the Dáil itself.  Of course there would be a general election.  If it transpires in this debate that one Deputy will maintain that Government in office and, by a majority of one, the expressed views of our people, big and small, rich and poor, the workers, business people, farmers and shopkeepers up and down the country, are to be set at nought, will that be a practical demonstration of democracy?</P>

Now, having got into office, it is, apparently, their concern so far as possible to prevent democracy from operating.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said that if the Finance Bill is defeated there will be a general election.  I believe it will be defeated.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Where are they?  A Select Committee of the House is sitting, composed of members of my side of the House and of the Labour Party, trying to work out for the Fianna Fáil Minister for <Col N="1410" /> Health a health policy, while we have the lowest quality health services of any country in Western Europe.  The Taoiseach talks about another £10 million or £11 million being necessary in the interests of social justice, and says that we are extending our health services.  Those health services will be extended, I am certain, only if the Fianna Fáil Government go out of office.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was prepared to say this morning that the Fine Gael Party lack economic and social objectives. It is not now, and it was not last week, or last month, or last year, that we made our policy clear in regard to health services and matters of that kind.  They are crystal-clear and are demonstrably right.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to you, Sir, that since Deputy Leneghan has come into this House, he has done nothing but consistently lower our standards and I would suggest that in the interests of the decorum of this House, he be requested to keep quiet or leave the Chamber.</P>
      <P>A sharp turn to the left may have been a convenient phrase used by the Taoiseach on 24th April, 1963, prior to the by-election in North-East Dublin when in some peculiar mental process of his own he contrived to hope that his candidate might be elected, realising that it would be impossible to contemplate that he would be elected on the first count but hoping he might be elected by the second preferences of the Labour candidate.</P>
      <P>The people who supported the Labour Party in North-East Dublin and, I believe, elsewhere throughout the country did not take very seriously the statement that Fianna Fáil proposed to go to the left, whether sharply, quickly or slowly because they bore in mind that the Fianna Fáil Party appear to advocate in speech one course but in action to do something diametrically opposite.  I have no doubt that they recollected that since 1957 when Fianna Fáil came back into office, there has been a consistent attack on the living standards of ordinary working people in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk in this debate about the imposition of the turnover tax on food and essential articles of that kind.  Let it not be forgotten that in 1957 this Government wiped out the subsidies on food, on bread and butter and thereby imposed a tax felt particularly by every worker's family throughout the State.  That was a foolish policy at the time.  Subsidies were apart from their social impact and social benefit, a definite aid towards production and <Col N="1412" /> towards development of our export trade but Fianna Fáil proceeded to abolish them.  That was their second assault on the living standards of the workers.  They had previously operated, perhaps, from the best of motives, a wages standstill policy and at the beginning of this year, a second attempt was made to bring about wages control. That was contained in the Government's White Paper advocating a pay pause and entitled <i>Closing the Gap.</i></P>
    <P>The reaction to that White Paper was instantaneous, violent and determined and, of course, faced with that reaction the Leader of the Government dropped it as if it were a hot potato and proceeded to go around saying this White Paper did not mean what it said.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate Deputy Coughlan's remarks.  I want to deal with the Budget Statement. I believe that when the Minister for Finance introduced his Budget here and made his Budget speech, he thought he was being very clever.  The Government congratulated themselves that this was a cute Budget; it did not appear to do much.  The turnover tax of 6d. in the £ did not matter.  They were taxing nothing, as they said.  No tax was going on anything.  As I said, even the <i>Evening Herald</i> of that day had little photographs of whiskey, stout, cars, and so on, and the caption &ldquo;No increase in Tax.&rdquo; Everything was lovely until people started to think and when people start to think about Fianna Fáil, they proceed to move against them.  The people began to think and to see&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that behind the verbiage of the Budget Statement was a new assault on the ordinary small people, on the workers and the workers' wives who shopped not for luxury articles but groceries, food, butter, bread and all the things for the family.  Every small shopkeeper struggling to maintain an existence as the tide of emigration proceeds to withdraw from the west to the east, the small shopkeeper in the decaying villages and towns in the country, having examined this Budget, began to see the real threat to his existence.  Then of course we had some ministerial tacking.  Fianna Fáil were out in full sail and suddenly a storm blew up and they tried desperately to tack.  A statement was made immediately by the Minister for Justice trying to assure the ordinary workers about to vote in Dublin North-East that there was no taxation on anything and <Col N="1415" /> not to worry.  Then a statement was made by the Minister for Finance to the retailers: &ldquo;You can pass on the tax.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, there were two voices.  The tacking was going on.  There were assurances given: &ldquo;It will not be as bad as you think; let us put it on and you will see.&rdquo; I have no doubt that if with dignity and decorum they could have withdrawn the tax proposed at that time, they would have withdrawn it.</P>

      <P>It was contained in the Budget Statement and they had to go through with it.  What is the result?   Never before in this House was there a Budget Statement which so obviously had not been thought out because when the Budget debate was over, we said to the Government: &ldquo;Now, let us see the Finance Bill.&rdquo; Of course that was a different matter.  They had not got a Finance Bill.  One week after another passed until some five or six weeks had passed after the Budget debate had been concluded and then we eventually got the Finance Bill.  I have no doubt that all that time the Government were busily engaged trying to see in what way they could get away from their turnover tax.</P>

      <P>In the by-election, Fianna Fáil hoped the people would vote in blinkers but the Irish people do not do that.  They are growing up and see through the dodgings of Fianna Fáil.  Why was the Finance Bill not circulated before the people voted in Dublin North-East?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;before the by-election&rdquo;.  That was some weeks after the Budget.  We know that the reason was that as long as the Finance <Col N="1416" /> Bill had not been circulated, the Minister for Justice was able to say one thing and the Minister for Finance another.  It was hoped that people would go into the ballot boxes in blinkers and not be able to see precisely what was involved.  That did not pay off.  Eventually this Bill, time beginning to run out, had to be circulated and they had to put down in black and white what their proposals were.  It is possible now for us to see them, to talk about them and eventually to vote on them.</P>
      <P>We know every effort was made in this Bill to try to make this tax appear as reasonable as possible.  There was to be an exemption given to small shopkeepers from registering but not from the tax.  They could not do that. The pill is coated with as much sugar as possible but the harm is being done and the Minister and every member of Fianna Fáil are aware of it.  They have grievously outraged the people, grievously outraged the conscience of the country by proposing and going ahead with something which is contrary to the expressed will of the people. I do not believe that that will avail the Government very much.  I believe that democracy will have its say.  I cannot see this Dáil, which has had a chequered but a fine history since 1922, which existed and functioned before Fianna Fáil came into it and which will exist and function long after Fianna Fáil have disappeared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;being made the personal appendage of any group of frightened politicians and if on the vote next Tuesday, the Government get through by the vote of one Independent, two Independents or three Independents, or whatever it may be, or if they get through by tradition and convention in the voting, for how long do you think that will last?  The people will wait quietly and patiently outside but inevitably there will be another day and another trial and eventually the Government will have to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious situation; it is a serious time and a serious juncture. Would it not be better for the <Col N="1417" /> Taoiseach&mdash;instead of acting like somebody trying to take off his coat and making sure that he is held back &mdash;for his Party and the country, if in a dignified and proper manner, he consulted the people on this tax.</P>
    <P>There are thousands and thousands of little shopkeepers up and down the country, who I suppose do not count in the eyes of the Taoiseach or the Government, little people with a small weekly turnover, who are frightened and worried that they are going to be put out of business.  I know a small village in my constituency where there are six shops, three of them with bar licences, three without them.  All six are in the grocery trade.  The three publicans have met and decided they will carry the 2½ per cent. tax with their bar trade.  The other three cannot do that, and what will inevitably happen is that whatever local trade there is will gravitate towards the three mixed premises where the turnover tax will not go on to the grocery items.  Inevitably, three little tumbledown shops that had at least given a small income to three families, will disappear.  I am certain you can multiply that up and down the country.</P>
    <P>Do not let us say this does not matter, that this is a Government decision.  Do not let us arrogate to ourselves, as I fear Fianna Fáil are endeavouring to do, the right to decide for the people what should be done in a case like this.  If the tax were a clear-cut one, if it were to prove beneficial and meritorious in the long run, the Government would not be afraid of it, but in this case would it not be far better to let the people so decide?  It would be the sound thing, the healthier thing for the country, particularly with the new problems arising in Europe and affecting this country, with the Common Market negotiations at an end, to have a new Dáil and a new Government.  I believe we will have it sooner or later, and let the Deputy who runs away for safety from this debate not forget there will be a raging torrent outside that will sweep him and his likes away with it.</P>

      <P>I rise to speak on <Col N="1418" /> this Bill having taken the trouble to interview the people not only in my constituency but in the outlying areas as well.  I am convinced from my investigation that the Minister's attitude when introducing this Budget was a very cowardly one.  He was afraid to say straight out: &ldquo;I am putting a tax on the bread, the butter, the sugar you eat to ensure survival.&rdquo; He was afraid to say to the many workers in his Department who get a miserable £6 or £6 10s. a week that their cost of living would rise by 2½ per cent.  When I look around me here, I find only one member of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Minister himself, in those benches.  It convinces me that they are afraid to face the facts either in this House or when they go back to their constituents. There is every reason why they should be so fearful.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Corry's story about being in a publichouse in Midleton last week.  He said there were 60 people there and when he asked them if they were prepared to make this sacrifice of 6d. in the £ to ensure the improvement of their land, not one of them put up his hand to say he was not.  Deputy Corry forgot to tell us who the 60 people were, whether it was he who rounded them into the public house, or how far had the entertainment gone&mdash;to what depth of their bloodstream had the whiskey he had poured into them gone.  That is why no hand went up to tell Deputy Corry that his Minister for Finance had made a mistake and that his Party were for the highroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the Minister's action is chaos and confusion in the retail trade.  I heard the Taoiseach a few moments ago denounce a particular branch of the retail trade because they did not go to the Minister for Finance to discuss their case.  These people have been making their case: they went to the Revenue Commissioners to make the best case possible.  I despise the Taoiseach's action in waving this threat over a body of hardworking men.  I can tell him that the more threats he issues the more we will come back at him with counter-threats. We are not one bit afraid of the Taoiseach.  He should know that <Col N="1419" /> after the Dublin by-election.  Deputy Corry said he would think more of the votes of mental hospital patients in Cork than of the Dublin electors.</P>

      <P>I say that if you had a by-election in every constituency in Ireland today the same trend would be there.  I am prepared to wager a fair sum the result would be the same, if not worse, for Fianna Fáil. There is little doubt there will be chaos in the retail trade where you have so many people trying to make a living in huckster shops in side streets on a four per cent profit on negligible turnover.  They are told in this Bill: &ldquo;Go find the money; I must have it, and it is your business to find it.&rdquo; This is the working man's Minister, this man who will tax the small shopkeeper out of existence to the advantage of the millionaires who come in from England to set up their multiple stores.  It is the death-knell of the family shopkeeper.  How is he to collect 2½ per cent on <i>Comic Cuts</i> or <i>Beano?</i> It is all very well to say the sweet manufacturers, the chocolate manufacturers, will cut down their prices so as to obviate the necessity to collect this turnover tax.  Are we now to have deputations from the wine, beer and spirit trade to the brewers and distillers to have the potency of their products reduced still further?</P>
      <P>Members of local authorities and of health authorities in particular know the widespread fear of increased rates because of the prospective rise in the price of foodstuffs.  We are also going to be faced with increased rates because increases in wages will have to be given by local authorities to meet the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget was introduced without any sense of foresight as to the results.  We are told that agricultural produce will not come under the 2½ per cent tax when sold direct from the farmer.  Does the Minister realise that in the city from which I come, and I am sure this applies, to every <Col N="1420" /> other town in Ireland, we hold markets two or three times a week?  The farmers and their wives come into these markets and sell their produce from their carts in the streets.  The small shopkeepers come to these markets, buy the stuff and resell it. They have to put the 2½ per cent to that.  The woman who buys it in the markets does not have to pay that tax and will it not be the natural thing for all these women to flood the market and buy all their needs there? That is where the small shopkeeper is being axed again by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that the retailers can opt if they are under a certain figure each week.  The Revenue Commissioners will accept certified returns from people who have £500 a week and over.  What about the small shopkeepers who pay on sheets, to use the Revenue Commissioners' language?  The person who pays on sheets has not the monthly return which is recognised by the Revenue Commissioners.  He goes to the wholesaler and pays down the 2½ per cent. Some of those goods are perishable and may have to be thrown out.  How is that person going to claim back from the Revenue Commissioners the 2½ per cent that he has already paid? The Minister has not a clue.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that monthly returns will be furnished by the shopkeepers. I have some experience of the workings of the Revenue Commissioners and I want to ask the Minister in what way are they going to check on the shopkeepers.  Are the inspectors going to come in, as they have done on many occasions in the past, and raid a shop?  Not alone have they done that but they have torn up the floor-boards of shops in an effort to find out if any evasions were going on.  Will the Minister give the same power to the Revenue Commissioners under this Bill that he has given them on other occasions?  Are the private affairs of every man's business to be exposed to the Revenue Commissioners and are these details to be discussed in their offices and discussed outside them?</P>
    <P>Is it to happen, as has happened, that figures in the offices of the Revenue Commissioners are to be <Col N="1421" /> made available to the prospective purchasers of businesses?  I know a prospective purchaser of a business who went into the office of the Revenue Commissioners and asked what was the turnover of that business and it was given to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the statement and it is true.  It has happened in my own business, in the betting business. When a man is selling a business, a prospective purchaser can go to the Revenue Commissioners and ask what amount of tax was paid by that business and it will be given to him. Will tactics similar to the taking up of floorboards be employed in the case of the unfortunate retail traders?  Will the inspectors have the authority to open a man's cash register and tell him that he has taken so much money that day?  Will they have the power to search a man's stock, to spend half a day in his premises and waste his time?  That is what they do in a betting office.  They come in, spend half the day and waste your time and you have to give over to them the space that you want for your own business.  Is this to operate with the retail trade?  The Minister has not a clue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a young family and they are expensive enough at times.  What is the Minister going to do about the cost of schoolbooks?  Has it occurred to him that every Longman's Latin grammar will have this 2½ per cent put on to it?  The cost of primary and secondary education has gone high enough without another 2½ per cent being put on to schoolbooks.  It is not <Col N="1422" /> my business to tell the Minister where he will get money&mdash;that is his business and the business of his officials&mdash;but I feel that the introduction of this tax is only the jumping-off ground.  I have seen it happen in my business as a bookmaker when they started off with the 2½ per cent tax and the following November it was increased to 12½ per cent.</P>
    <P>We already have a tax on betting that the betting public cannot afford to pay.  Representations to that effect have been made by the responsible bodies who run the bloodstock industry in this country.  They are giving good employment, attracting tourists and developing a first-class export market in both bloodstock and greyhounds. The Minister has slapped on a 2½ per cent tax and, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out earlier today, it can ill-afford to carry it.</P>
    <P>Let me point out to the Minister one significant fact.  If he had been well-advised and if he had taken the time to consider how things are operated in other countries, he would look around and, instead of putting a tax on the purchases of poor people and increasing the cost of living, and increasing the demand for wages which will follow, find that there are certain articles of luxury imported into this country.  It is not my business to tell him this but, as he has gone so far, I will remind him of what happens.</P>
    <P>We are the only country in Europe to my knowledge that allows in beer and spirits without carrying a duty or tax.  Our beers are exported to other countries.  In France, they carry a 40 per cent import duty.  In Germany, it is 27.2 per cent; in Italy, it is 39 per cent.  In Switzerland, it is 4/- to the gallon, which is a fair percentage.  In Belgium, it is approximately 40 per cent and in the Netherlands it is 40 per cent.  Here are we in Ireland allowing in foreign beers and spirits without a farthing tax and allowing them to compete against the products we can manufacture here in the country creating direct and indirect employment as a result.</P>
    <P>Yet, the Minister blindly turned his back to that fact.  It is not my business. I am not the Minister for Finance. <Col N="1423" /> Neither are the Labour Party in Government.  But, holy heavens, a Department threatened with intelligence would have seen the revenue derived from that source but not one step has been taken to secure it.  We will tax the unfortunate widow and the unfortunate orphan.  We will make school fees dearer.  We will make bread and butter dearer.  We will make the boots and stockings dearer.  We will increase all those prices but we will allow German, French and Swiss lager and Scotch whisky and French burgundy to come in here without import tax: they pay their excise duty.</P>
    <P>I am wondering whether this Budget has been the act of sane people. I am wondering if these people have been bereft of intelligence.  The people of Ireland are thinking likewise and they have proved it and they will do so again tomorrow or the day after if they are asked to and get the opportunity. We in the Labour Party welcome many aspects of this Budget.  We want to increase social services.  We know money must be found but let us find it from the people who can give it.  Let the Mercedes car people and the mink coat people give it to us but not the unfortunate person living on £6 a week and trying to rear a family. Why make them pay the same as the man with the Mercedes car?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil say they are the poor man's Party and the working man's Party.  Such hypocrisy I never listened to as I heard from the Taoiseach today. You would imagine we were living in Tír na nÓg.  You would imagine everything in the garden was rosy.  Let the Taoiseach talk to the man in the street and to the wife trying to keep a family and they will tell him what they think of this turnover tax.  They are the people who will give him his answer. There is no point in these dreams and romanticisms which come when they suit us.  Let us not insult our brains and our intelligence by trying to make believe that we are all right, that the country is grand, that everything is being done and that everyone is working.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced many Budgets in his time.  I am not here so <Col N="1424" /> very long but I want to tell him this. It is a piece of advice from a fellow who knows.  The Minister has put a nail in the coffin and he has sounded the death-knell of the small shopkeeper. For that reason, and that reason only, he will surely pay the cost the day he lets the people of Ireland decide whether his action was right or wrong.</P>

      <P>I am a pretty good while coming to this House now and a more unpopular Budget, principally due to the turnover tax, has not been introduced in my time or, I think, even before that.  I cannot understand how the Minister for Finance arrived at this idea of a purchase tax. Some Deputies blame officials in the Department of Finance or in the Revenue Commissioners but the Minister introduced the tax in this House and he is responsible to the House for it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan brought home to me two hypocrisies of the present Fianna Fáil Party.  One is their claim that they are the republican Party.

      <P>They say they are the poor man's Party.  Since I came here in 1943, and even before that, they have consistently scourged the poor man.  They started off with the Economic War in 1933.  The small farmer and the working man were practically pushed from this country. In 1947, they aimed at removing the food subsidies.  They were promptly thrown out of office at the following General Election.  When they came back in 1951 they took a slice off the food subsidies which amounted to increasing the tax on the poor.  They were thrown out of office again in 1954 and when they came back in 1957 they completed the job.  They took off every single penny of food subsidies, totalling about £13 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> The inter-Party Government, despite all the abuse and deliberate lies told about them in propaganda, and so on, at elections, found £13 million to keep the poor person's and the working man's food cheap.  We kept the price down&mdash;and I am proud of it.  If we never did anything else but that, I am very proud of it.</P>
    <P>Look back and see how the wheel has turned full circle.  Let us remember the time when we were paying £13 million when food was much cheaper and when the £13 million had much more value and let us consider the price of food now.  We have arrived at the other extreme.  We are now taxing food so that a person will eat less and spend more.  It is a silly proceeding.</P>
    <P>I think the decent thing for the Government to do, seeing the storm of protest that has been raised against the turnover tax, particularly on food, is to withdraw the Finance Bill and also the turnover tax or, if they are determined to go ahead with it, they should get out at once and not wait until the vote in this House.  They are trying to force through something that has aroused the indignation of everybody.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with any speaker than with what Deputy Coughlan said about foreign beers and spirits.  He mentioned that it is not the business of any Deputy to say how money should be found but I should just like to go this far.  He says that drink is coming in here untaxed in competition with our own breweries and distilleries.  That is one source from which the Government could find some of their proposed £10 million they will get out of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Many luxury goods are coming into this country and people wealthy enough to pay for luxury goods would not, I think, object to paying a little more tax as well.  We have only to look across the water at England. There is one thing they have done which we could do.  Since the war, they have put a purchase tax on luxury goods.  If the Government wanted money here, as well as the <Col N="1426" /> question of drink mentioned by Deputy Coughlan, they could raise all the money they wanted by taxing luxury goods.  We did the equivalent of that when the prosperity we brought about from 1954 to 1957 caused the people to spend a bit too wildly.  The balance of trade was upset by the money we put into circulation.  We had to do something to check it, so we put on the equivalent of a purchase tax on luxury goods.  Fianna Fáil, then in opposition, backed it; but the strange thing is that the very moment they came into office in 1957, they removed it.  It is quite clear what happened.  A lot of people believe&mdash; so do I&mdash;that there was a sell-out in the election of 1957 that put votes and money in Fianna Fáil's way.  I have no proof of it, of course, because those things are done behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>The Government are compelling every shopkeeper to be a tax-collector. The Minister has told the shopkeepers to take this 2½ per cent off their turnover and collect it any way they like. It reminds me of the system that obtained under the old Roman law at the time of Our Lord when the governors of subjugated provinces sold the taxes to tax-collectors and let them squeeze blood money out of the unfortunate people.  These tax-collectors went around like the land bailiffs in our grandfather's time and collected as much as they liked.  What the Minister is saying is this: &ldquo;I want 2½ per cent tax on turnover from you. You can charge ten per cent, if you like, to the customers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister says that competition will keep matters right, but it is significant there is no safeguard in the Bill.  I know they will not, but suppose the shopkeepers got together tomorrow and said: &ldquo;We will charge 2½ per cent to the customers for the Minister for Finance and charge another 2½ per cent for ourselves.  We will make a good thing out of it.&rdquo; While it is unlikely to happen, it is a possibility that should not be lost sight of.  The ordinary purchaser is not safeguarded from such an eventuality. I said previously on the Budget that the Government have no legal authority <Col N="1427" /> to compel shopkeepers to pay this 2½ per cent tax.  They are turning them into tax-collectors, unpaid servants of the State.  I believe the shopkeepers in my part of the country will band together and refuse to pay it.  I believe that ultimately all the shopkeepers throughout the country will refuse to pay it.</P>
    <P>Recently I was talking to a small shopkeeper, who I thought was doing a fairly thriving business.  He is a married man with five children.  He has a shop in a good position and he is a good businessman.  He amazed me by telling me that after 15 years all he has saved is £500.  Neither he nor his wife drinks or smokes.  In the 15 years, he has not taken a holiday. His wife may have taken a few days by the seaside each year.  He is a thrifty, careful and honest man.  These are the &ldquo;wealthy&rdquo; people who are going to be fleeced by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The small shopkeeper will be literally wiped out of business by this tax. Many of them do a casual business. I can see the shopkeeper in a good line of business, where people pay every week or every month, totting up the amounts in the books at the end of the week or month and adding 2½ per cent to the whole lot.  But I am thinking of the other type of shopkeeper who does a floating trade, who sells sweets, cigarettes and ice cream to people who only call once a week or only once in their lives passing through.  They will have to put on a heavy tax.</P>
    <P>In every town, there are small shopkeepers who supply the wives of working people and wage earners with small commodities.  Maybe it is only a loaf or two of bread, a half-lb. of tea, a couple of lbs. of sugar or two ounces of tobacco for the man of the house.  The tax on these items, if they put it on, will be much more than 2½ per cent.  In some cases, it will be five per cent or even ten per cent. When a woman comes in for a half lb. of tea or a couple of lbs. of sugar, how is the shopkeeper to calculate the tax?  It will be impossible to calculate <Col N="1428" /> the tax on some of these small items. If the shopkeepers eventually decide to pay the tax, they will have to save themselves.  The customer who will suffer is the wife of the small farmer, trying to rear a family and make a few pounds go far, or the wife of the working man in the town.  These people will be blistered out of existence. The Government are taxing the very necessaries of life for them at a time when they can badly afford it.</P>
    <P>One question I should like to ask is&mdash; although I am not making any suggestion&mdash;why rope in all the shopkeepers who do a retail trade?  All of them buy their stuff in bulk from wholesalers or factories.  If it is necessary to impose the tax at all, why not do it in the same way as drink, tobacco and petrol are taxed and impose the tax as near as possible to the source of production?  That would have been the sensible way of doing it.</P>
    <P>This is definitely one of the worst blows struck at the poor people since I came into this House.  It means that many people, who up to now have not thought of emigrating, will be driven to the emigrant ship, along with the thousands who have had to go through lack of employment.  The decent thing for the Government to do is to withdraw this tax or else, without waiting for a vote of the House, ask the people of the country what they think about it. This is too big a step for any one man or small group to take, in view of the protests against it.  The people should have an opportunity of voting on it before it goes any further.</P>

      <P>I understand that An Bord Gráin have requested purchasers to provide sacks in sound condition and capable of holding two cwt., that is, 224 lbs. of wheat.  This request was made in the interests of purchasers, in order to prevent losses through spillage and to facilitate them in the checking of the quantity delivered.  This is a matter concerning the day-to-day operations of the Board in which the question of my approval or otherwise does not arise.</P>

Would he consider further consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or in the absence of that, suggest to An Bord Gráin that where bags of this dimension are to be used. mechanical handling equipment should be installed in the stores?</P>

      <P>With the permission <Col N="1439" /> of An Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 together.  The Equitable Insurance Company Limited was licensed on 27th March, 1948, under section 12 (11) (b) of the Insurance Act, 1936.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to other questions on 28th May and 12th June, the returns submitted by this company since it commenced business were in order and insolvency was not indicated until the returns for the year ended 30th June, 1962, came to hand.  Consequently, the question of taking action under section 20 or section 46 did not arise until these latest returns were received.  A notice under section 20 was, in fact, issued to the company on 9th May, 1963.  I was satisfied, from an examination of the returns for 1962, that the company was insolvent and it was not necessary, therefore, to invoke my powers under section 46.  Any proceedings under section 46 would have delayed the presentation of my petition to the High Court to have the company wound up compulsorily.</P>

Does he feel that, where the event has shown that an insurance company has proved insolvent, to the great loss of a number of individuals in the country, there is something wrong in that the Minister&mdash;I speak now, of course, of the Minister of the Department and the Department behind him&mdash;did not detect at some stage in the several returns submitted to him the quality of one investment, which constituted the bulk of the assets of the company and which now apparently, it transpires, have no value at all.  Surely the Minister feels some obligation on him to tell the House how it came to pass that, exercising his powers under the Act, that fact never transpired or was never brought to his attention?</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that this company was originally licensed on 23rd March, 1948, as I stated in reply to the original question; that the accounts were submitted to six or seven successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce, including myself; that these accounts were duly audited, as I have stated; that they were examined in the Department on each occasion that they were presented within the statutory time <Col N="1441" /> limit involved; and that on their face they showed that this company was solvent and there was no reason to believe, from the presentation or appearance of these accounts, that the company was otherwise than solvent; that I proceeded on the basis that the duly audited accounts were in fact true accounts and it was only when I received the ultimate accounts three days after the end of the statutory period that it was then shown, on examination, that the company was not solvent and I proceeded immediately to exercise my power under the Act.</P>

      <P>If the Minister were in a position to say to the House that the asset referred to, which is approximately worth £83,000, was in fact valueless from the time of the first registration and that there was no change in the status of the asset down through the years, would he not agree that that would greatly change the situation, but if it is in fact the case that at one stage that asset had a value and subsequently became worthless but continued to appear as a substantial asset in the balance sheet of the company, that there does appear to be some failure of vigilance on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in not exercising his functions which were conferred upon him by this House to provide against exactly such a contingency as has in fact arisen and which he exercises for the protection, not of the insurance company, but of the unfortunate people who may have claims against it?</P>

      <P>The most material aspect of these accounts which convinced me and my officers that the company was insolvent was the appearance for the first time on the face of the accounts of an inordinate loss in marine insurance which was not shown in any of the previous accounts.  Without any regard to the value of the asset of the Tower Insurance Company as shown on the balance sheet, it was clear from the loss shown this year as a result of marine insurance that the company was insolvent and it was on that basis I immediately proceeded.  As far as the assets of the Tower Insurance Company are <Col N="1442" /> concerned, that would be a matter for the liquidator to evaluate and to draw on if any assets are found to be available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose these assets turn out to be utterly valueless, does the Minister feel he has no responsibility for allowing a situation to mature in which the liquidator turns to the largest asset in the liquidated companys balance sheet and discovers in the course of liquidation that the asset is worthless and that the insurance company in fact has been insolvent for a very long time and that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had adverted to that absence of value in the Tower Insurance asset, he would have detected the insolvency far sooner than in fact he has?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that an applicant for unemployment assistance in any part of the country can have means sufficiently high to entitle him to payment of unemployment assistance at the rate of only 1/- a week.  Such a minimum rate of payment arises because of the provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Acts relating to the abatement of the maximum rates of assistance in accordance with means of the applicant as calculated under the Acts. Under those provisions, the maximum scheduled rates are applicable to persons who either have no means or means not exceeding (a) 2/- a week in the case of a person without a dependant, or (b) 5/- a week in the case of a person with a dependant.  Where the means exceed 2/- or 5/- a week, as appropriate, the maximum rate of unemployment assistance applicable to the class of the applicant is reduced by 1/- a week for every 1/- or part of a 1/-by which the weekly means exceed 2/- or 5/- as the case may be.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of attendance at the local office of applicants for unemployment assistance, I have dealt fully with this subject in the course of my replies to a number of previous questions put down by the Deputy and I consider that there is nothing which I can usefully add to the information already given or to the views I have already expressed.</P>

      <P>The peak hours normally are from 10 a.m. to 12 noon and 2.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. but are liable to be extended beyond these periods at weekends and on special occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will recognise that I put this quesion down to help him.  If the public would co-operate with him by refraining from relatively unimportant calls during these peak hours, will the Minister undertake to expand to the limit of his capacity the personnel attending to trunk calls immediately on the conclusion of these peak periods so that those who had the good manners to wait themselves will not suffer these enormous delays?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>During the day, it may be possible to co-operate by withdrawing staff from non-operating duties, and that is being done.  It is not really a question of staff but a question of increasing the circuits on trunk routes.  The Dublin exchange provides assistance to all other manual exchanges as necessary, as well as catering for Dublin subscribers requiring manually-operated trunk and local calls.  The circuits on the trunk routes are being extended and a substantial number of them will be in use in the next two weeks.  There should, therefore, be a considerable improvement after the two weeks but I would prefer not to issue a statement in relation to peak hours until I see the effect which the completion of this will produce. What the issue of such a statement might do is to divert the peak hour to other hours, but that would not be of any material benefit either to the Post Office or to subcribers.</P>

What drives people up the wall altogether is to dial 10 and get no answer. I have relatively frequently in recent weeks dialled 10 and listened to the bell ring 30 or 40 times without effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on the Vote on Account and on the Budget, the Fine Gael Party were asked by us what reduction or economies they would effect in the Book of Estimates.  Apart from stating that Government expenditure was too high, they did not make a solitary suggestion as to what reductions could be made.  Therefore, it is only fair that we should be in the position to state that the Fine Gael Party find it impossible to effect any economy in the Book of Estimates as it is at present before the House.  We can add to these estimates, then, the costs of the various promises which Deputy Dillon has made over the past couple of months.  At the Fine Gael Árd Fheis, he promised a health service which, according to a reply received in this <Col N="1460" /> House, by Deputy Burke from the Minister for Health, would cost £30 million.  He also promised interest-free loans for farmers, which, according to a reply to Deputy Burke by the Minister for Agriculture, would cost approximately £7 million.  Since then, he has stated at a Fine Gael Party meeting that he would reintroduce the Local Authorities (Works) Act which would cost a further considerable sum and, on top of all this, he has stated he would, if returned to power, remove the turnover tax.  This leaves us with the very important question as to where the Fine Gael Party would get the money to pay for the running of the country and to pay for all these extras which have been promised by the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;All this and Heaven, too&rdquo; attitude of the Fine Gael Party may have been all right up to the present but now that they have put down in this House a very important motion, which, if carried, would cause the defeat of the Government and result in a general election, they must go further and state where the money to run the country would come from if they were returned to power and where the money could be got to pay for this extra expenditure proposed by their leader.  It is not enough now to say it is no function of the Opposition to state where they will raise the money, because at a time such as this and on a very important motion such as this, I feel that the people are entitled to know where each Party stand, not only what the Party state they will do but also how the Party intend putting their policy into effect.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government have, in their Book of Estimates, shown the country what they intend to do during the coming year and in their Budget Statement and in the Finance Bill, they have shown how they intend collecting the money to put this policy into effect.  The Fine Gael Party have told the people of the many things they will do but when it comes to pointing out how they would put these into effect, what taxes they would levy, they come to a full stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has already been stated by members of the Fine Gael Party that <Col N="1461" /> it is no function of theirs to state what taxes would be levied by them.  Lest this be stated again, as I have no doubt it probably will be, the Fine Gael Deputies ought to take into consideration the fact that it is not only members of the Fianna Fáil Party here who are asking them how they would put this policy into effect&mdash; that, in fact, in leading articles in every one of the national newspapers, Deputy Dillon has been severely criticised for not stating how he intends to implement the programme which he has adumbrated.  He has still failed to do this.  I have no doubt that the people will interpret just exactly what this means&mdash;that whatever taxes he has up his sleeve he has no intention of letting the people know what they are until in the most unlikely event he is elected to Government. I have no doubt that the people will not buy a pig in a poke.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Labour Party are concerned, they have voted with the Government on the Vote on Account and by so doing, they have supported Government expenditure.  As they said in their motion, they are willing to support any reasonable taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Except the turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, this is too simple and too naive an approach. What kind of tax would they be likely to support?  What would a reasonable tax consist of?  I have no doubt that no matter what tax this Government brought in, the Labour Party would find some excuse for voting against it.  As I said in my speech on the Budget, I cannot understand why the Labour Party should be so far out of line with what appears to be the basic thinking of Labour Parties in Europe, such as the Labour Party in Sweden which was responsible for introducing a turnover tax and in fact wherever a turnover tax was introduced in West European countries, it was introduced by a Labour Party.  I can only come to the conclusion that the Labour Party here are more concerned with a short-term popularity programme than with the future of the economy of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> It is clear from the attitude of the Opposition Parties that they accept that it is not possible to make a reduction in the Estimates as they are before the House.  It is clear from the Fine Gael Party's attitude because they have not suggested, or are unable to suggest, any reductions in the estimated expenditure and also from the fact that they have proposed many new schemes which they say they will carry out if they are elected to power and it is also true from the Labour point of view because Labour voted with the Government on the Vote on Account.  Therefore, the question now arises as to where the money is to come from if Parties come into power who decide they will abolish the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>What are the alternatives?  It is generally accepted in the House and in the country that it is not possible any longer to get the necessary amount of money from increases in the taxes on cigarettes or liquor or petrol.  We are faced here with the law of diminishing returns.  It is generally accepted, I think, that to increase the price of any of these articles would not bring in very much more money than we are getting from them already.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody has openly stated he would be in favour of increasing income tax, although there were some veiled hints from some of the Opposition.  The only other suggestion as to an alternative is one that has been rather broadly hinted at by members of the Opposition: a tax on luxury and semi-luxury goods.  This type of policy has a very popular ring. To cloud the issue further with regard to this type of tax, Deputy Corish again resurrected his Jaguars and fur coats&mdash;I suppose to give the impression that this was the type of luxury his Party were thinking about.  I have no doubt when he made that statement he could hear people saying he was perfectly right.  I have no doubt he would be right, were we able to get sufficient money from a tax of that kind.  But Deputy Corish knows perfectly well that if we were to confine ourselves to these articles, the income would be negligible.  So that, in fact, when we <Col N="1463" /> speak of tax on luxuries and semi-luxuries, as well as putting a tax on Jaguars and fur coats, we would, also, have to bring within the tax net a very wide range of goods if we were to come anywhere near getting sufficient money from this tax to meet our requirements.</P>
    <P>We would have to draw into the net goods such as clothes, except of the very cheapest kinds; furniture, except again the cheaper types.  We would have to tax all types of electrical goods, and so on.  Secondly, we would have to put on these goods a tax large enough to provide an amount of money similar to that which would be gathered from the turnover tax.  It has been estimated that the tax necessary in such circumstances would be approximately 25 per cent.  If we were to do this, we would have, in effect, a tax system such as the purchase tax in Britain&mdash;a tax which has damaged some of Britain's industries almost beyond repair and which the British themselves are most anxious to get rid of and have replaced by a turnover tax.</P>
    <P>However, we do not have to leave home to see the effects of putting a tax on semi-luxuries.  In 1956, the Coalition put levies on raw materials which priced goods produced by Irish firms out of the home market and brought about wholesale unemployment.  One industry which comes to mind in my constituency was severely hit by these levies.  The tax on raw materials put up the price of the finished article and led to the employment in that industry being reduced to approximately 200. When we came to power and removed the levies, the number employed in that factory rose and today there are about 900 employed there.  Not a single article made in that factory could escape the tax suggested for luxury goods.  If a tax of 25 per cent were put on each article manufactured there, we would have a return to the 1956 position and wholesale unemployment, because of inability to sell the goods at the increased prices.</P>
    <P>This would apply, in part, to every industry in my constituency.  As I said, it is a highly industrialised constituency, <Col N="1464" /> and it is my duty to see to it that a tax which would throw a very large number out of employment is avoided.  In my first year here, in 1957, I noted the hardships and misfortune attendant on unemployment.  It was indelibly impressed on my mind and I decided to endeavour to see to it that Government policy would provide as many jobs as possible and would not allow what happened in 1956 to occur again.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the workers in my constituency should be made aware of the very grave dangers that would face them if this suggested alternative were put into operation. This talk of a tax on luxury and semi-luxury goods appears reasonable, but it has dire consequences so far as employment is concerned.  I am not speaking of something which might happen but of something which without doubt would happen.  We would have exactly the same set of circumstances as we had in 1956 and 1957.  During the past two years, the industries in my constituency have developed a very worthwhile export trade, helped by their sales on the home market.  If anything were to happen to those home market sales, if the goods were priced out of the home market by having to add 25 per cent to the price, it would undermine their export markets.  We would have the same result as they had in Britain with the purchase tax.</P>
    <P>The increase in taxation is required to help expand the economy, and that means providing more jobs.  I should like to look at my constituency again on this point.  We have three factories being built in Drogheda at present and a fourth factory is about to commence. In the northern part of the constituency, we also have proposed industrial expansion.  This is proof positive of the success of Fianna Fáil policy there.  This is the type of success people are willing to further.  Even those who are in safe and permanent employment themselves are anxious about the future of their children and that more jobs will be available for them when they grow up.  I have no doubt that they will be willing to pay for this. Nobody with the interests of our <Col N="1465" /> children and the unemployed at heart can object.</P>
    <P>To revert to the question of possible reductions in the Estimates, I note as reported in today's paper, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, that Deputy Donegan stated here that one thing a Fine Gael Party would not do if they came to power was to spend £5 million on airplanes. I shall not go into detail in regard to this matter, except to remind the House of the havoc wrought by the first Coalition when they sold the transatlantic planes and prevented us from being one of the first on what is now our best-paying route.  I should like, however, to comment on the manner in which the Fine Gael Party try to be all things to all men.  I wonder how many Fine Gael Deputies from Limerick would support this statement?  It is not a month since we had a furious hubbub from a Fine Gael Deputy from Limerick, Deputy O'Donnell, in relation to Shannon Airport, who stated that the Government were doing nothing to try to keep that airport open.  Now we have another member of that Party criticising the Government on their efforts to help in providing competitive planes on the transatlantic route, which are an essential for keeping Shannon Airport open.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I wonder if Deputy Donegan would agree with the contention of Deputy Sweetman that £2 million of Government money was wasted in Dundalk, money which had been used to try to secure the employment of 1,000 men in the DEW there and to save the economy of the town. It all goes back to this question of being all things to all men.  It appears necessary in Fine Gael circles when they wish to attack the Government on an awkward topic, to get a Deputy from Louth to speak about Shannon and a Deputy from Kildare to speak about the Dundalk Engineering Works, so that the finger of scorn cannot be pointed at the Deputy of that particular area.</P>
    <P>In putting on this new tax, the Fianna Fáil Government concerned themselves, as usual, with the poorer sections of the community, with those who are dependent on social welfare and unable to fend for themselves.  By <Col N="1466" /> increasing the various social benefits, particularly children's allowances, the Government have succeeded in cushioning the sick and unemployed and the family from the effects of this tax.  Despite what has been said by many speakers on the opposite side, I repeat that these social welfare adjustments will cushion the weaker sections of the community against this tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said that the percentage of national income devoted to social welfare is now less than in 1957. He has said that on a number of occasions but the answer is that there are fewer people unemployed now than in 1957 and consequently there is less money needed for unemployment benefit and assistance.  He also said that we assumed the amount of money for children's allowances was adequate.  We assumed no such thing. We are always most anxious that all social benefits should increase and not only that, but when possible, we have on many occasions increased them. Fianna Fáil introduced the children's allowances and only Fianna Fáil ever increased them.  During the office of the two Coalitions, not a farthing was given towards increasing children's allowances.  Therefore, it is peculiar to find a Deputy who was a member of the Government at that time now criticising children's allowances as inadequate. Further increases in these allowances will depend on the growth of national income.  We were anxious to ensure that raw materials generally should not be taxed and we saw to it that purchases by farmers for further production would be exempt.  I think it is well to repeat that.</P>
    <P>The concession which the Minister has granted to those whose turnover is less than £500 to decide for themselves whether to register or not will be appreciated because while the tax must still be paid, it will remove from some 25,000 to 30,000 people the responsibility of having to collect the tax.</P>
    <P>We are anxious as always that the economy should continue to expand and more jobs become available.  When the people have an opportunity of <Col N="1467" /> considering all the aspects of this turnover tax in a calmer atmosphere, I believe they will appreciate the reasons for it.  My constituency with its expanded industry with its new factories being built there is an example of what we want to see continued.  We never want to see the country return to the conditions of 1956.</P>

      <P>Go down to the bar and you will hear it every night. I do not want to go down in history in any historical novel, but in dealing with this matter we should start at the foundation.  I am not so young as not to remember when the first decent foundation was laid in this country and that was at the first entrance of Fianna Fáil to power.  I go back to my constituency to demonstrate.  Up to 1933, with the exception of a few big shots who were only usurpers of our land and territory, there were very few people with a decent house in which to live.  There were no roads, no work, no schools into which we could allow our children and we were certainly in a sorry mess.</P>
      <P>Today that is completely changed and in my constituency we have perhaps the best houses in Ireland.  We have a certain amount of work, good schools and the whole position has changed.  The only occasions on which a halt was called to that march of progress were the occasions on which, what they call the inter-Party but which I prefer to call the bunkum Governments, were in operation, from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957. In that period in my constituency all work halted.  We could get no housing grants.  Today in that constituency we are erecting a huge factory in Ballina: we have the most modern power station in Europe.  We have the colossal Moy drainage scheme, the Grassmeal Company and the peatland Experimental Station at Glenamoy, and we have large forest and fishery development schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition stated <Col N="1469" /> the grassmeal project initiated by the Fianna Fáil Government purely a form of spite against the present Senator Lindsay.  In the course of his longwinded speech, he clearly indicated that if he were returned to power, which God forbid, he would remove that industry in the same way as he removed industries on a former occasion. That industry is giving much needed employment in Mayo.  I am sure no one in Erris doubts Deputy Dillon now because in 1954 the first action taken was to close down every single industry which existed in North Mayo.  I can assure Deputy Dillon that he and others like him are most unlikely to get a future mandate from the people of North Mayo to implement more of that kind of nonsense, putting the people back into poverty and destitution.  The fact that some member of Deputy Dillon's family was not taken to very kindly by the people of Mayo is no reason why Deputy Dillon should walk rough-shod over the people of that county now.  To-day we have sources of employment.  We have employment given in a very fair and reasonable way.  Let us look into the past methods of giving employment.</P>

      <P>Of course, a great many things have been said that are <Col N="1470" /> not relevant to the Finance Bill.  A good deal of play has been made with the turnover tax.  I would ask those who oppose it to state specifically what their alternative is for raising the necessary finances.  So far, they have given no alternative.  One Deputy goes outside of this House and says he would spend £100 million more.  He has not indicated the means whereby he would get that money.  Under the turnover tax, a section of the community who have been effectively dodging the regulations of the Revenue Commissioners for years will in future be roped in.  Publicans are tax gatherers all their lives but no one has ever protested on their behalf.  It is extraordinary that people should come in here to try to justify those who are making higher profits than publicans being exempt from the tax net, advocating that they should make no returns of any description and should continue, as they have been doing for years, to dodge paying taxes, thereby making the burden of taxation all the heavier on other sections of the community. If I am to believe what I hear, this £6,000 must cover a great many of them.  Surely these shopkeepers will be in no different position from that in which they would be, were the Government to tax specific articles?  This tax will actually put the small shopkeeper in a much better position than his financially stronger competitor, and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scare about the banks is a lot of bunkum.  The banks are well able to look after themselves.  I do not think we need worry about them.  It has been stated, too, by certain people here that the Irish are not able to govern themselves.  Certain Deputies do not appear to have any respect for the ordinary common Irishman at all.  The fact is Irish people live quite successfully in foreign countries; they have proved themselves good and progressive citizens.  They are fully capable of measuring up to the requirements of the Governments of these countries.  I believe they are equally capable in their own country, despite the aspersions cast upon them by members of the Opposition here.  I deprecate these aspersions.  One would think this was <Col N="1471" /> a nation of parasites.  It is unfair that people should come in here and cast such aspersions on Irish workers.</P>
    <P>I do not believe our people are worrying about this 6d in the £. Honest, hardworking people need certainly not worry about it.  The élite sections of the commercial community who have got away with murder under the tax code for years back may have cause to worry.  I urge these people to accept their responsibilities and live in honesty and security here, or else cease their activities, and let honest men take over.  There are plenty of substitutes for them.  They cannot have it both ways.  They must know that unless money is in circulation, they will go out of business. We do not want to return to the situation that existed in 1956 when it was a case of &ldquo;May God help us; may God help them; may God help whoever will come after.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Progress costs money.  Money does not grow in the ground.  Are we to heed the prattlings of the Opposition and stay the onward march of progress, and stagnate, or are we to be realistic in our approach?  Are we to continue along the well-charted course towards better times?  We must go forward.  I believe the people will be prepared to march and to make progress.  There is only one Party in this House, in my opinion, who ever made any progress, that is, the present Government Party.  We know the ridiculous promises made by other Governments.  We saw how those promises went up in smoke.  These present tactics are obviously just the ridiculous utterances of those who are incapable of shouldering responsibility. They are catchcries to mislead the people, if the people can be misled. I do not think they can be misled at this stage and I am not going to be influenced by the decision in North-East Dublin where only half the people voted and I expect most of those were taken out in ambulances. At one time voters were taken out of the graveyard; in this case, ambulances were used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask these people who have made the fantastic promises that have been made at various meetings in the country over the past few months where they will get the extra millions.  Where will they find the money?  Would they state specifically where they will collect the money?  If they do not state that, in all fairness to everybody, they should cut out this nonsensical campaign in which they have been indulging for so long.  Would they place taxation totally on drink and tobacco, or are they so foolish as not to know that drink and tobacco are just as essential to many people as milk and butter are to others?  Deputy Dillon may laugh at that but if he takes the votes of the general public, he will find that I am right.  I remember reading in a paper on one occasion where a Deputy on one side of the House said that he understood that most children were reared on new milk but judging by the activities of some of the interrupters, it was obvious that they had been reared on vinegar. He may have been right.  If those people were reared on vinegar, the vinegar was just as difficult to get for them as the new milk was for others.</P>
      <P>What was regarded as a luxury 20 years ago is no longer a luxury.  It is no use saying that it is.  Our standards of living have completely changed.  We must march with the times.  A man who will come in here and draw up a Bill whereby certain articles are taxed is not being realistic, honest or fair to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole case for extra taxation and Government policy has been completely misrepresented.  The people who are carrying on the ballyhoo are not the poor by any means but the rich and their pseudo-eloquent disseminators of unrealistic political theories in this House.  Many Deputies have not a clue as to what they are talking about.  Many Deputies do not speak to their constituents except during election campaigns when they are forced to do so.  Many Deputies are completely out of touch with <Col N="1473" /> reality and do not even live in their constituencies and believe that the things that are suitable in one constituency are ideal in another.  They are not.  A man who does not live in his constituency should have his head examined.  He should be kicked out.</P>
    <P>Anybody who remembers the 1954-1957 chaotic times must be of opinion, unless he has a short memory or no memory at all, that any person possessed of common sense would prefer to pay a considerable amount and to live in security than to dodge the column in regard to taxation, as has been going on, and to have over his head, apart altogether from the question of emigration, the cold hand of retrogression and stagnation which was the position during that period.</P>
    <P>It is easy to get up and criticise the Government but not a single person here has yet stated where the money needed will come from.  It would seem as if all the members of the Opposition have been elected purely and simply by shopkeepers.  I doubt it.  In my constituency, which is not by any means the most affluent, I have heard no grumbles from anyone except a few shopkeepers.  When they asked me to a meeting, I said that certainly I would be delighted to go to the meeting but that along with the shopkeepers and the publicans, the public must also attend.  I said that I would bring with me to that meeting three advertisements by Todco, The Golden Goose and another supermarket.  I said that if they would explain to me how the prices advertised could be charged by those people and they could still make a very sound profit, I would be on their side.  Needless to say, I was not taken to the meeting.</P>

Those people who are so sure of themselves the calumniators of the Government, <Col N="1474" /> are the very people despised by Irish voters when it came to a chance of returning them to this House.</P>
      <P>There is no use in anyone in this House talking about minority Governments because except during the periods that Fianna Fáil formed the Government with their own Party, there has been no Government in this country formed by one Party since the State was founded.</P>

Surely your memories are not so short that you do not remember the Farmers' Party, Clann na Poblachta, Labour Party, the NPD, who changed their name, like yourselves?  You are trying to cod the people but you cannot cod me.  You have the effrontery to come in here and talk about minority Governments.  Will you name one occasion on which Fine Gael or their predecessor, Cumann na nGaedhael, formed a Government on their own without the support of other Parties?  Is there any man who can answer that question?  Of course there is not.  It is unadulterated humbug that you are going on with.

I would want to be very daft and have a very short memory if I were to heed the type of hypocrisy which those people who try to calumniate the Government are now carrying on.  Anything constructive <Col N="1475" /> which was done in this country was undoutedly done by the Party now in power and it is absolutely futile for people to denigrate or ridicule those people who tried to improve the country.</P>
      <P>The two cases are there.  The concrete facts are on the one side while on the other, there is nothing but theory and nonsense.  We have only to look across the country to see it.  Let the people who do not see it come to my constituency and I will very quickly show it to them; I will show them what has been done since 1956. We should take no notice of this intimidation from the Fine Gael Party. There is nobody in the Labour Party, so I do not mention them.  I am glad to say that, drink or no drink, we have not been swung over.  We are not prepared to sell our souls for either power or notoriety.  At least I am not.  Others may be, but I do not speak for them. I place this country and its people above all personal ambition.</P>
      <P>If those in Fine Gael prophesy the results of the next election as accurately as the last, I am not worrying too much.  I expect there are administrators here who are prepared to sell the country but as far as I can see, they are not on the Government side. It is a sad day and a poor reflection on the state of our political standing in this country that so many are prepared to ignore our glorious past and jeopardise our political and economic future for the extra piece of silver that has been added to the proverbial 30.  I do not think this 6d. in the £ tax will be an influencing factor in the political future of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to point out that I was sent here by the people of Dublin North-East, having campaigned on a platform, the main plank of which was the abolition of this turnover tax.  Into that by-election, Fianna Fáil poured more money than did the other three candidates together.  The answer from the people was one vote out of every three. In the last general election, they had one vote in every two.  Surely this <Col N="1476" /> must show the Government the feelings of the people of the country? Dublin North-East is the largest constituency in the country and we now know the feelings of the people there.</P>
      <P>First of all, I submit it is morally wrong to tax rich and poor at the same level.  It is likewise unfair to ask traders to put something on one article and nothing on another.  The only fair conditions in which a tax of this kind could be administered would be under a decimal coinage system, which we have not got here. The big worry about any new tax is, first of all, how much extra it takes out of the average worker's pay packet; secondly, will it affect production and exports; and thirdly, will it lead to unemployment?</P>
      <P>In the explanatory memorandum, the Minister says the tax will be at a reduced rate for the first £1,000 and that the full tax will not be payable until the turnover reaches £2,600.  Of course he is misleading the people. The full effect of this tax will be felt straight away on every £100 of turnover. The importer, the manufacturer, the wholesaler and retailer will have to pay 2½ per cent tax on their replacements and on repairs to machinery. Therefore, these people will have to increase their charges and when it comes to the retailer, he must add on three per cent at least in order to maintain his present level of profits.</P>
      <P>Coming to the worker, if his spending power is drastically cut, he must demand higher wages.  That has been the position here for years.  Earlier in the debate, it was admitted from the Fianna Fáil benches and elsewhere that 80 per cent of the retailers are small men, many of whom do not get a proper income from their businesses. Therefore, in order to keep up with the standards of living that have been achieved, through increased wages, many of them will be forced to add not 2½ per cent but as much as seven per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that certain rents would not be taxed.  He forgot, however, to say that the purchase of new houses will be taxed and that in fact it will bear the full 2½ per cent.  I estimate <Col N="1477" /> that 80 per cent of the revenue from this new tax will come from food and the grocers will be the main collectors.  It can therefore be called a wiping out of profits tax because it will have the effect of completely eradicating profits, particularly in the drapery trade which is so susceptible to weather conditions.  In a bad year, drapers will have to increase prices by as much as ten per cent to wipe out the average effect of this tax.  In effect, the tax will ruin small Irish traders who will have to make way for the big foreign concerns.  It is an increase in taxation and there is no similar increase in any other country in Europe.  For this reason, this tax reduces the impetus of our export drive and cuts across what the Minister has done to assist that drive by way of tax concessions.</P>
    <P>From all the talk there has been about corporation profits tax, many people think that this is a country of millionaires, but there may be ten, 20, 30 or 40 companies who merit this tax. There are few Government-sponsored companies who merit it but the majority of companies in this country are controlled by one person or by a group of people who barely get a good living from them and plough back whatever is left over.  As long as I have had an interest in business, the Government have always encouraged the growth of limited companies and the creation of capital rather than the bringing in of foreign capital.  Now the Government have increased the corporation profits tax and retrospective payments are to be asked for. People who have paid their dividends will now have to try to get that dividend back.  Two or three years hence, there will be very little money left in these companies.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the corporation profits tax will bring in £3 million approximately and that the sales tax will bring in £10½ million.  Rents and fares are put at £1 million, various services at £2 million and health services at something over £4 million. That is a total of £6 million which leaves £8½ million.  We are told that that is to be applied to the expansion of our economy, but, to my mind, <Col N="1478" /> at a time when there is little difference between expansion and inflation.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have stated that there is no pay pause but, nevertheless, wages are not increasing. Surely the taking of 5/- a week out of a pay packet of £10 is a pay pause? Under this tax, money is being taken from the workers.  There is only one good thing that I can see about it, that is, that it will be the end of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Each year, we are afforded an opportunity in this very important debate to assess Government policy.  I have listened to the speakers in this debate from the beginning and, apart from the Taoiseach who had to defend his policy, the other Government speakers could have said all they had to say in five minutes.  The Taoiseach was well supported by the Fianna Fáil backbenchers but when he left the House, his backbenchers followed him into the corridor for fear they might have to listen to the story from this side of the House.  The backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party have done a great disservice to the Taoiseach and the Cabinet in that they have failed to inform them of the reaction to the Budget throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to deal with the sales tax in a constructive manner.  It is quite <Col N="1479" /> obvious to me that the taxes proposed in the Budget must eventually filter through to the consumer.  Following on that, there must, of necessity, come a rise in the cost of living.  As a result of the rise in the cost of living, our capacity to export must be affected. At a time when we should be gearing ourselves to meet the competition of European countries, this must have a drastic effect.  This 2½ per cent tax is going to decrease the purchasing power of the worker and to reduce his wages.  Whether we are professional men, businessmen or ordinary workers, we all depend for our livelihood on the rewards which flow from our efforts and the blow contained in this sales tax is that the purchasing power of our earnings will be reduced by a minimum of 2½ per cent.  I believe that that will ultimately become five per cent or 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>No effort has been made by the Government to vindicate these proposals. Speeches have been made and pamphlets have been issued, but, to my mind, the best comment that could be passed on this sales tax was recorded in the Dublin North-East constituency where a majority of two to one of the electorate voted to reject it.  I think Deputy Belton will concede that, apart from his personal popularity in the constituency, the main issue at stake was the acceptance or non-acceptance of this sales tax.</P>
    <P>The Government tell us that the consumer will not have to pay anything and we have had Fianna Fáil Deputies coming into the House since the Budget was introduced and saying that the Fine Gael Party have not said what they would do if they were in office.  There is no moral or other obligation upon the Leader of the Opposition or the Opposition Party to tell the Government how to run their business.  That is their privilege and their responsibility.  I want to reaffirm what our Leader, Deputy Dillon, said.  If we are returned to power the sales tax will be abolished. There are other ways and means of collecting taxes than the sales tax.</P>

Were it not that Cumann na nGaedheal founded the Shannon Scheme, they would never have dreamt of rural electrification in Ireland today. Not one word was mentioned about that, by Government speakers.</P>
      <P>Another thing mentioned was the Moy drainage.  You had been 20 years in Government in this House before you decided to drain the Moy.

In fact, passed by Ballina Railway Station on my way to Dublin on Tuesday morning. Without exaggeration, I saw about 400 to 500 people boarding the train to go to Scotland and elsewhere to try to eke out an existence.

It is no thanks to Fianna Fáil that there is an industry in Ballina and it is no thanks to Deputy Calleary, either.</P>

      <P>The people of Ballina including Deputy Calleary and me, who were also subscribers, put up over £40,000 to establish that industry.  An Irishman, a Sligoman from my neighbouring county, who made good in England, invested another £40,000 in that industry.  Be it said for the record that all the Government gave us back <Col N="1483" /> in the form of a grant was what they collected over the years from the people of Ballina in the form of taxation. Deputy Calleary should know that when the Government first sent down their grant to Ballina, they did not offer a full grant to an undeveloped area such as North Mayo.  However, I went to the Department and said: &ldquo;If we do not get a 100 per cent grant in Ballina I shall raise it publicly and in the Dáil.&rdquo; I am glad to say that they changed their mind and gave Ballina a 100 per cent grant but it was not their intention to do so.</P>

      <P>Deputy Calleary was not at the meeting at all the night the committee was formed.  It might be well for that to be reported, too&mdash;just throw it in for good luck.  To conclude my contribution, I want to protest in the strongest terms possible on behalf of the traders of Charlestown, Swinford, <Col N="1484" /> Foxford, Ballina, Killala, Belmullet and Crossmolina against this turnover tax.  Deputy Calleary said the people in North Mayo would not mind paying it.  They tell me they do.  I did not go out to any crossroads to protest. I am simply making use of my constitutional right to protest on behalf of the traders of North Mayo here in Dáil Éireann.  The farmers marched in Mayo before, when they were overtaxed in rates.  I would not be surprised if the traders are compelled to march. Could I even at this eleventh hour appeal to the Minister to modify the Budget?  He would be doing good for the country and for himself.  He would be doing something to maintain the Fianna Fáil seat in North Mayo, which otherwise, I am afraid, will be lost.  I would ask the Minister to consult his backbenchers, men like Deputy Dolan.  Ask Deputy Dolan what is the reaction in Cavan.  I am sure he will find they have &ldquo;reactors&rdquo; there.</P>
      <P>There should be great buoyancy in Government revenue if this tax is imposed. Surely then the Minister must concede that a miserable halfcrown is no compensation for the poor old age pensioner?  The Minister will have excess revenue next year, because he has told us he will get £7 million or £8 million, and all Governments underestimate. I would appeal therefore to the Minister to increase the pension by 5/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>When taxes are introduced, especially new ones, to keep the country going, nobody likes them. Here is a tax which is small and broadly-based.  This year, the Minister had to find £67 million.  If he had turned to the old taxes on cigarettes and drink, it would have meant a very high tax on some of these commodities. If he had taxed luxury goods, it might have meant £10 on a television set, £100 on a car and so on.  The Opposition are calling for a tax on luxury goods, but, if it were put into operation, we could not hope to keep the same number of people employed in industry.  People intending to buy these articles would wait until they had some more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Realising that, the Minister imposed <Col N="1485" /> a broadly-based tax that will not be felt to any great extent.  Two and a half per cent represents only 6d. in the £.  A mountain is being made out of this tax.  A working man who spends £10 a week on his household will have to pay an extra 5/-.  It is said that this tax will not be covered by the children's allowances.  A shilling increase in children's allowances is the equivalent of £2.  I know of no family who spend £2 on a child every week, unless they are in a very high income group.  We would all like to give more to the old age pensioner, but we must face realities and have regard to what it would cost.  The extra 2/6d. they are getting more than covers the two and a half per cent tax.  Social Welfare benefits are being increased over and above the two and a half per cent.  We have consistently given an increase to social welfare recipients for the past six years.  Even if the prices of all commodities are increased, which I do not believe will happen, we will still have the old 6/11d. and 19/11d. in the different shops.</P>
    <P>When we returned to office six years ago, there was a feeling that the country was beaten, and unemployment had gone over the 90,000 figure.  The first thing we did was to devise a five-year plan for economic expansion. That is the only way we can hope to provide work for our people.  The more money in circulation, the better for the country.  People are enabled to buy the necessaries of life, as well as some of the luxuries.  All over the world, the number of people on the land is decreasing.  I believe this is due in part to the number of children remaining on in secondary and vocational schools until they are 15, 16 or 18, instead of leaving school at 14. Around 70 per cent of the children are going to school now up to 15 and 16.</P>
    <P>Where can you look for employment for these people but to industry.  You cannot provide it on the land.  A factory can employ 200 or 300 people. How much land would you require to employ that number?  It would run into thousands of acres.  Employment must be provided either in factories or in the building industry.  That was our <Col N="1486" /> idea in economic expansion.  It has gained momentum in the past five years and we have seen the results. National income has been consistently increasing; there is more employment and we have more than achieved the target set.  This morning, the Taoiseach told us that the new five year plan will be issued in a few weeks.  We must keep moving and unless we go forward, we go backward.  We feel Ireland is going forward and we are planning to continue that trend.  That needs money and the Minister has found that this broadly based 2½ per cent. tax will give sufficient money without overburdening anybody.</P>
    <P>If we do not go ahead but cut down here and there, what would we have? Our national income would fall and the shopkeepers who are the main opposition to this tax because, to some extent, it is directed towards them, would feel the pinch if economic expansion did not increase.  Last year, the increase in the retail trade was seven per cent and it also increased in the previous year. Shopkeepers like to see a turnover increase.  They remember in 1956 when the people were unemployed, there was little money circulating.  Therefore, they they are prepared to pay the tax, although they do not say so, rather than have recession.  We had tremendous opposition to another Bill last year but once it passed, we heard no more about it.  This will be much the same.  The Minister has eased the burden on the shopkeeper to some extent by providing that if the turnover is less than £50, they will pay only 5/-tax well under 2½ per cent.  They need not keep books and may pay in the form of stamps.  If the turnover is £100, they pay 17/6.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was proposed, many shopkeepers felt they would not be able to keep books but now they need not register if their turnover is less than £500 a month.  That covers a big number of shopkeepers.  They can pay 2½ per cent to the wholesaler or, if they wish, they may register and pay it themselves.  They have the option. There is now nothing to compel the small shopkeeper to keep books.  I knew one man who was saying that it would cost about £22 for him to get <Col N="1487" /> an auditor but he will come under this concession and will not have to register. He can pay the wholesaler and have no worry.  He will be free to apply the increases as he likes.</P>
    <P>Not all commodities will increase in price.  One manufacturing firm last week sent out a letter stating they were providing for an extra profit on their commodities to cover the 2½ per cent.  A shopkeeper is a businessman and will know what can be increased. When the Minister put an extra penny on cigarettes last year, he got no extra revenue.  Naturally, the shopkeeper will think twice before increasing the price of cigarettes.  Butter is protected because we have a situation in which we are eating 48 lbs. of butter per head, an extremely high consumption which many countries would like to achieve. Next highest is England with 38 lbs. An increase in the price of butter could easily turn a section of the people over to margarine at a lower price and not greatly different in taste.  At the International Conference of Agricultural Producers, the President, a Dutchman, said he would like to know how Ireland was able to achieve such a high butter consumption.</P>
    <P>Already 90 per cent of the retail traders pay income tax and their income is known to the Revenue authorities.  They have been keeping books and it will not mean much extra to them to deal with this 2½ per cent turnover tax which will only apply to cash sales.  They will be able to decide what articles can provide the tax.  If some associations did more to see how the tax could be implemented and prices agreed in some cases or the quantities reduced in others, they would do much more good than by going about the country protesting.</P>
    <P>If a law is passed, it must be accepted, and naturally this Bill will be passed like any other.  People have until November to work out the operation of the tax.  Even on the box of matches, it will work out right if you take one or two matches out of each box.  That will cover the 2½ per cent, leaving the price unchanged.  While some items will go up, there will not be a big difference in price when the <Col N="1488" /> Bill becomes law and people get down to seeing how it can be implemented.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> one sees factories and extensions to factories going up everywhere. The grant scheme is encouraging industrialists to modernise and expand.  These new factories will create new jobs.  Indeed, quite a number of our people have been returning from England and even from America.  They find conditions here as good and the pay likewise as good as in these other countries.</P>
    <P>Money is, of course, needed to establish these factories.  Thirty years ago, we were depending solely on agricultural exports.  Today we have the three prongs of industry, agriculture and tourism bringing in roughly the same amount of money each year.  If two of these prongs were removed, what would be our plight?</P>

      <P>Expansion requires money: a good business firm always ploughs back some of its profits.  A farmer likewise ploughs back some of his profits into his land to improve the land and its fertility and to leave it in a little richer condition than that in which it was handed on to him by his father.  Economic expansion will bring in more money.  It will give an opportunity of improved social welfare benefits.  Will anybody contend that we should not help the unemployed, the sick, the aged, the widow?  From November, the first child will be in receipt of an allowance.  Some have asked why not give the increased benefits immediately.  We should like to do that but we must wait until we have the money.  The increases will come three months later than usual this year because the pattern in the past was to give the increases from the month of August.  It was not possible to give them earlier than that because legislation had to be introduced. This year the tax will come into operation in November and, therefore, in November we will have the money to provide the increased benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> There has not been any comment on education.  The sum provided for education has gone up to £21 million this year.  There has been a marked increase in the numbers of children going on to vocational and secondary schools.  The increase is roughly 70 per cent.  Parents like to give their children a better education and a better chance in life than they may have enjoyed themselves.  The unskilled men in Bord na Móna&mdash;some of them have graduated into drivers &mdash; have sent their children to vocational schools.  Quite a number of these children are now apprentice fitters and electricians. Some of them who have finished their apprenticeship are earning £11, £12 and £13 a week, perhaps, a bit more with overtime.  They are earning far more than their fathers did before them at the same age.</P>
    <P>These young men will, when they marry and have families, want to give their children a better education still. They will want their children to have secondary education and possibly go on to university.  As I understand 70 per cent of the younger people are all either in professions or else white collar workers.  That is the pattern, too, in Cork and other cities.  We should like to have the same facilities in the rural areas.  We cannot ask for universities but we can have more secondary and vocational schools. Secondary schools are being built at the moment at Maynooth and Kilcock. One will be a secondary top and the other a completely new school.  It is prefabricated.  Building started early this year and the school will open in September.  There is a vocational school in Killucan.  Another is to be built at Tyrrellspass.  There is a new vocational school in Kildare.  Education is no load to carry and it is a way of keeping the child of 14 or 15 out of mischief.  At that age, he is not able for much manual work.  With a little more education, he is equipped to better his position in the future.</P>
    <P>For new industries, qualified personnel are required.  Criticism has often been expressed of the policy of bringing in foreigners.  It must be remembered that they have the markets <Col N="1490" /> and the technical know-how, and can link with their large sales organisation. We have not had the experience and naturally must encourage foreign industrialists to establish industries here. Every other country in Europe is doing the same thing.  Substantial grants are given to persons to establish factories in this country.  Technicians and apprentices are required to operate the factories.  They can be trained through the vocational schools and the universities. In years to come the factory management will be Irish.  Such factories provide us with the opportunity of competing for European markets. The plant and machinery in them is of the most up-to-date kind.  It is a difficult matter to modernise old factories. We have the advantage of starting with new factories, new machinery and new techniques, which will increase our competitiveness in Europe.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, it was suggested that it was only big concerns that would survive in Europe but it would now appear that factories of the size that would employ 200 or 300 persons can be much more competitive.  In such factories there is personal contact between management and labour.  The very large manufacturing concerns such as Fiat in Milan and Fords of Dagenham are continually in trouble in regard to management-labour relations. The smaller concern is much more flexible and there is much closer liaison between floor and management. I was impressed on the occasion of a tour to the Shannon Industrial Zone to find that factories are being built on a reasonably small scale and that the management-labour relations are very good.  One American concern there is engaged in manufacturing parts for the satellites that are going up.</P>

      <P>It takes money to provide grants for industries and in order to get the necessary money taxation must be imposed.  I am giving an idea of the factories which have been established in Shannon and which are providing employment for 1,200 people.  In 1959, there was nothing but marshland there.  In the American firm to which I have referred, the foreman was expected to report to the management every Monday morning and to give a detailed statement about any problems affecting the employees.  The personal problems of the employees may affect output in the factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  We must ensure that our industries can compete in foreign markets.  Exports have been encouraged by such means as income tax concessions.  The Minister mentioned last February that he was going to impose a purchase tax which would be broadly-based.  We have heard very little about that.  Some people thought that new cars would be affected and there were increased sales of cars during the spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed turnover tax will bear equally on all the people.  Recently, there was an increase in the price of milk to the creameries, which cost £1,200,000.  That has to be paid for. Nobody will deny that the cost of milk production has risen in the past ten years.  The farmer must get his share of the national cake.  More money is required if we are to expand our economy and we must consider how that money can be secured.  Nothing should be allowed to interrupt the general flow of improvements and the general increase in productivity that has being going on.  Once such things are interrupted, it is difficult to get them moving again.  It is not as easy <Col N="1492" /> as switching the engine of a car on and off.  We saw the difficulties in 1957 when we came back into power and it took well over a year to get the country moving again.  Naturally, we are anxious to see that such a situation does not recur.  Because of that, the Minister found that the safest and easiest method was to introduce this turnover tax.  It must be remembered that it will be one of the cheapest taxes to collect and will cost only about one per cent.  Ninety per cent of the retail trade are already keeping books so that they will not have any extra books to keep.  Therefore, practically all of the money will go to the Revenue Commissioners and will be used to provide the extra £4 million required for social welfare.  We feel that this tax is one which will cause the least disruption of the national economy and still provide the money needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the discussion on the turnover tax began, I have heard many apologies from Fianna Fáil and other speakers but I must say that Deputy Crinion has beaten them all.  For instance, he says that the grocer who is selling more matches can, to bring the price of the matches within the ambit of this tax, do so by taking two matches out of every box. That conjures up a picture of some 20,000 to 30,000 grocers each taking two matches out of every box in order to enforce the tax.  This asinine idea as advanced by Deputy Crinion&mdash;I say, with all respect to him, that it is asinine &mdash;is indicative of the fact that the Government find themselves at sixes and sevens about this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious to me that this proposal to impose a 2½ per cent tax on retail goods, with certain exceptions, was introduced without due consideration and proper reference to the implications it must have.  There is an obvious revolt&mdash;a revolt of the bourgeoisie, if you like, but there is a middle-class shopkeeper revolt &mdash; against this tax. Many of the people who are revolting so vocally and sending telegrams, to the benefit of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, are Fianna Fáil supporters, who, I have no doubt, will <Col N="1493" /> remain Fianna Fáil supporters, even if and when an election comes which I hope will be when the Dáil runs its whole course and not one day before that.  But these people who are revolting have a case.  How is the medium operative in any line of business, selling any common or garden article used by the people, who has a staff of five or six, or perhaps one or two, or even 20 or 30 people, to keep monthly records of his turnover?  How is he to administer it and how is he to have the money paid and proper accounts kept without employing additional staff?  That in itself is not a bad thing and I am in favour of it, but some of these people are working on a fractional profit.</P>
    <P>Small shopkeepers who mainly depend on groceries are living very near the line.  With bad debts and extended credit, they find life a battle. The gross profit in such cases would not be much more than 5 per cent.  Is such a person to employ additional staff to arrange for the collection of the tax, and cut down his own profit? Is it not obvious he will not do that and that he will put it on to the consumer? Who is the consumer?  He is the ordinary man on the street who has to work hard for an average wage of £10 or £12 a week.</P>
    <P>If some of the shopkeepers carry out their threat that they will not enforce this tax, what are the penalties and how are the Government to force them to do it?  Must we visualise an army of inspectors going through their records? I cannot see it working and that is why I said previously that it is quite obvious that this tax was not given the consideration it should have received. In fact, it is rumoured that when the idea of a sales tax was first mentioned by the Taoiseach earlier this year as a portent of things to come, the general idea then, even among the Government Party and their supporters, was that the tax would apply to a limited range of articles which did not include essentials of life and did not include food.  Now we find that the tax includes the essentials which even the poorest sections must buy.</P>
    <P>We are told that the old age pensioner <Col N="1494" /> will benefit by the tax.  To what extent?  Somebody boasted that he would make 10d. a week, that he would get 2/6d. and the tax would take 1/8d. thus leaving him 10d.  That was the boast of the Government Party.  That is something we should be ashamed to mention.  A sum of 2/6d. in relation to the old age pensioners is something we should be sick and tired of mentioning in this House because we have exhibited the greatest collective meanness in our dealings with these people of any Parliament in the free world. The manner in which these people have been treated is disgraceful and every year you have the miserable 2/6d., or something along those lines, being given to them, and politicians boast about it.  They boast about it in this House as if it were not the shame I believe it to be and, in my view, everybody in this House believes it to be.</P>
    <P>We are to have a vote on this and use has been made of that by the principal Opposition to suggest that there should be an election.  Personally, I disagree utterly with what Deputy Sweetman is reported to have said yesterday, that there were many people in this country demanding an election. I am in contact with as many people as Deputy Sweetman and I hear no demand for an immediate election.  I want to add to that, in case there is any doubt about my feelings in this matter, that I would regard Deputy Sweetman's appointment as Minister for Finance as a national disaster of the greatest magnitude.</P>
    <P>A protest must be made against this tax because it will mean a wage reduction for the workers in every sphere.  Not alone will it be passed on in the form of increased prices but there will be unscrupulous people who will profiteer on this tax and increase prices beyond what is necessary to meet the tax.  The persons who will pay this tax are the ordinary workers, the ordinary housewives of Ballyfermot and Walkinstown and the workingclass areas of the city and country, the farm labourers and road workers and the people in the social welfare classes. I believe it will mean for those people an effective reduction in the purchasing <Col N="1495" /> power of their wages of from eight to ten shillings a week.  That is my summation of the position.</P>
    <P>Because of that and in order to ensure that my attitude is clearly understood, I am going to vote against the Government on the question of this tax.  I do not want that vote against the Government to be taken as an indication that I am wishful to see the return to office of the principal Opposition Party.  I am not any more enamoured of them than I am of the existing Government.  There is clear evidence on all sides that the young people and many of the older people are coming to a realisation of the fact that their true interests can no longer be catered for by Parties who have the 19th century conception of political matters and that they have not been looked after effectively in the political situation that has been allowed to exist in this country for far too long, a situation in which political differences, in the main, are nothing more than personal animosities or differences between individuals and the pursuit of power on both sides.</P>
    <P>Any difference there might be between them would be a slight social advance which Fianna Fáil have over Fine Gael.  The people are gradually coming to realise that their interests lie in the general direction of the Labour representatives.  Even the Taoiseach has recently talked about the move to the left.</P>

In voting against the Finance Bill, I want to make clear that I do so in order to express, on behalf of the people of my constituency, their opposition to this move on the part of the Government which must mean an increase in the cost of living.  I cannot see why the Government did not take heed of the public outcry which has arisen against this tax and amend these proposals in <Col N="1496" /> such a manner as to ensure that the shopkeepers will not be made into tax gatherers but that the tax will be collected, if necessary, at source.</P>
      <P>The farmers have been granted exemption from this tax to a large extent.  They are an important political entity and no Party who wish to remain in power can afford to offend them because they are so large a unit in the political situation.  However, foodstuffs should also have been exempted from this tax because a tax on foodstuffs is something that the people will feel very gravely.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask what steps are being taken to prevent profiteering. What apparatus could possibly be conceived to ensure that there will not be profiteering other than some colossal, Gestapo-type mass examination of the accounts of all shopkeepers?  This is the flaw in this business and it seems to me that for a Party with a long tradition of political agility, Fianna Fáil have blundered badly and in a very elephantine manner.</P>
      <P>I do not think the vote will produce the defeat of the Government but, if it does, the present Administration are in for a severe setback when they go to the country.  I am not voting against the Bill for the purpose of securing that end.  I am one who wants to see some Dáil lasting to its full term.  Anyone who has fought several general elections, as I have, knows what a general election is.  Nobody dislikes a general election as much as a politician and comments have been made in the Press that there is nothing a politician fears more.  I will say that while I do not fear a general election, there is nothing everybody in this House dislikes more than a general election.  There is no demand in the country at the present time for a general election but if that situation comes about, then the Government have only themselves to blame because they have acted in a very foolish way in bringing in this tax in the way they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suffered for a half an hour listening to Deputy Crinion, who is a decent man but hard to take.  He was able to relate education to this Bill through the geniality of the Chair, which is always very fair.  He talked about <Col N="1497" /> education as it affects Dublin city but we all know that when a Deputy is at a loss for something to say, it is always well to bring in Dublin.  Deputy Crinion talked about education and said that in one area which was brought into existence 30 or more years ago, there was now the proud boast that over 70 per cent of the children leaving the schools went into the professional or white collar occupations.  That, to my mind, is an attitude of mind that should be discouraged. The professions and white collar occupations, by and large, are the least productive of all.  What we should bring about is the encouragement of the trade craftsman, the manual worker, because these are the real productive workers.</P>
    <P>I shall not pursue that line because the Chair might say it is not in order, but in the dim, distant future, anybody reading the Dáil Debates will not get the idea that I contributed to this obscurantist, 19th century foolish notion that there is something wrong with the skilled, the manual worker.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> One cannot but wonder whether Deputy Crinion is as simple or naive as he appears to be.  If he is, he has my sympathy.  His suggestion, as a method of implementing the 2½ per cent turnover tax, of removing two matches from every box sold over the counter must be very heartening to the Minister for Finance, and a Party with such elegant back-benchers must surely look forward to the forthcoming general election with tremendous confidence.  He also brushed aside the turnover tax as being just a little tax, a mere sixpence in the £.  Deputy Crinion happens to be a wealthy man, I believe.  If tomorrow morning the Land Commission moved in to divide his land, Deputy Crinion would have a different tune.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Sixpence in the £ is something to be reckoned with by the poorer sections of the community who have only a few pounds to spend.  It is extraordinary <Col N="1498" /> the different types of interpretation which have been placed on this tax.  During the recent by-election in Dublin North-East, the various Fianna Fáil propagandists interpreted it in two different ways.  If they happened to be talking to a housewife on her doorstep, they told her this tax was of no significance to her, that the shopkeepers would have to carry it. When they went to the shopkeeper, they said: &ldquo;Why does it bother you? The consumers will have to carry it,&rdquo; trying, in effect, to have the best of two worlds.</P>
      <P>I want to digress for a moment to another aspect of this Finance Bill.  Up to the present, the matter under discussion has been the turnover tax exclusively.  Of course, it is the kernel, the most important aspect of this Bill, but there is one other aspect to which I should like to draw attention.  It is the question of the banks being required to make returns of everybody's dividends, if these dividends amount to £15 or over.  There seems to be an epidemic of high morality invading the Fianna Fáil Party recently, and a virus like that, in such a new medium, can be calamitous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason offered for this section in the Bill is that it is designed to uncover tax evaders.  There are tax evaders; there have been and there will be tax evaders.  They have been in this country and in every country in the world and they will always be there.  One cannot, of course, lock horns with the Minister when he states his concern is to uncover tax evaders, but one must suspect the Minister in his methods, if he looks for information which one may think is unnecessary.  The preservation of the confidential nature of banking business is an important matter in our society.  Traditionally here, our farming community, our country people, have to put their money into the local bank, because, unlike their counter-parts in other countries, they are not sufficiently well-up in investment know-how to deal in trusts, shares and stocks.  The opportunity for investment has always been limited here.  The practice has been to place the money in the bank and our <Col N="1499" /> country people have, down through the years, tended to be secretive about these transactions; in fact, they would not let their left hand know what their right hand was doing in banking business.  It is a serious matter to upset the confidential nature of transactions of that nature.</P>
    <P>This matter could be considerably ameliorated if the Minister had thought fit to introduce certain exemptions. I will mention four instances for his consideration and these refer in general to sections of the community who, by the nature of their occupations and service, are not in a position in any practical measure to become tax evaders.  First of all, there are our Civil Service and our local government officials.  Why must the Minister go into the bank to find out when a higher civil servant has, through his years of labour, accumulated the not terribly considerable sum of £1,500?  He would be a very poor type of civil servant, unless he was a spendthrift, who in his senior years could not accumulate £1,500.  Why does the Minister want to know it?  He could never evade income tax.  His returns are made automatically.  Possibly his taxable money is deductible at source.</P>
    <P>Then you have people on PAYE. Their income is vouched by their employers and is taken from them periodically.  These are people who, in general, are not tax evaders and are in no position to become tax evaders.  If any of these people arrive in the happy position of exceeding over £1,500 per year&mdash;I suppose few of them will&mdash;why does the Minister want to know it?  These people cannot be tax evaders.  If he is trying to introduce the regulation to uncover tax evaders, why not exempt this section of the community?</P>
    <P>Again, take the farming community. In this country, the farmers do not, in effect, pay income tax under Schedule D.  A very small percentage may have to pay on three-fifths of their valuation, which is readily vouchable. Farmers who engage exclusively in <Col N="1500" /> husbandry cannot become tax evaders in any worthwhile sense.  Why does the Minister want to know what every farmer has in the bank?  Why does he want a list of every farmer who has a deposit of £1,500 and upwards, a deposit which may have been there for three generations, which may be there for various purposes&mdash;to buy land for his sons or to educate members of his family?</P>
    <P>There are a number of people who all have strictly vouchable incomes. For example, bank officials, business managers and so on.  If such a person accumulates over many years the large sum, in the Minister's mind, of £1,500, and has a bank dividend of £15 a year, the Minister wants to know it.  Why?  He cannot be a tax evader. Yet, under the global pretence of looking for tax evaders, he is trying to get information from these four sections of the community, thereby disturbing something fundamental in our society, the confidential nature of banking business.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Taoiseach today gave us a very impassioned performance.  As an exhibition of outraged virtue, I doubt if it has been bettered by Miss Christine Keeler in a recent legal tangle with Mr. Gordon.  He told us many things.  We had the usual talk about increased productivity, gross national product, tying up income and wages to production and so on&mdash;the usual Micawber outlook that prosperity is around the corner.  He also told us that about half of the population will not have their position worsened by this turnover tax.  When the Taoiseach admits that about half of our population will not have their position worsened, I suppose we may conclude that in the Taoiseach's mind half the population will have their position worsened.</P>
      <P>His chief bitterness was directed towards RGDATA.  He accused them of now becoming a political Party.  It seems that in the Taoiseach's mind and heart no free society or free organisation in the country has the right to protect, to meet, to organise or even to march.</P>

Of course, this is meant as a reassurance to the uncommitted one or two Independents who are now wavering as to whether they will vote with or against the Government.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has issued an explanatory booklet dealing with the turnover tax.  In it he states that this tax shall be, in effect, less than 2½ per cent for turnovers up to £2,650 per month and shall not be greater <Col N="1503" /> than .07 per cent above 2½ per cent for figures above that.  That sounds to me like some little mathematical formula produced by the civil servants in the Revenue Commissioners.  I doubt if the Minister bothered his head to work out a mathematical formula of these dimensions.</P>
    <P>The truth is that this 2½ per cent tax will, in effect, in practical operation, become a four or five per cent turnover tax.  It is also reasonably true to state that in many cases it will be a 50 per cent tax on profit, particularly in the case of groceries and provisions and the retail of food commodities where the existing margin of profit is accepted by everybody to be quite small.</P>
    <P>Certain foods and services have been exempted from the turnover tax.  I do not thank the Minister for exempting them because they could not reasonably be included.  He has exempted exports, the produce of farmers and fishermen.  He has exempted farm requisites, such as seeds, fertilisers, animal food and machinery for farmers and for fishermen.  These are essential for production and would, I think, be exempt anywhere under any income tax code.  He has exempted sand, cement and live animals but practically everything, apart from that, is subject to a turnover tax.  Food, drink, tobacco, furniture except office furniture, pottery, glasses, cutlery and cooking utensils, domestic kitchen equipment, clocks and watches, personal and cosmetic articles, motor vehicles, sports goods, musical instruments, radio, television, gramophones and records will also be subject to a turnover tax, only if the registered dealer is a dealer in these goods.</P>
    <P>The Minister has exempted certain services.  When this matter was being discussed during the Budget, the Minister seemed a little confused as to what items to cover.  I now find that under exempted services we have State and local authority services and hospital services; agricultural, industrial and commercial services; professional and educational services; nursing home services and building services; transport services, including car hire.  I am a little confused here.  I do <Col N="1504" /> not understand the full position.  Reading the Bill, one gets the impression that car-hire is included in the turnover tax.  One gets the impression, reading the explanatory booklet, that it is excluded.  I should like the Minister to clarify that point.  Perhaps I have not read it very intelligently.  I thought there seemed to be a conflict between one and the other.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister has made one alteration in the proposals since his Budget speech.  He has introduced exemption from accountability.  I understand, however, that traders will not be exempt from registration.  Traders up to £6,000 per year turnover will be exempt from accountability and the Minister said that would cover 25,000 to 30,000 of them.  There are about 40,000 traders in the country, of whom 58 per cent are under the £500 turnover figure.  The Minister's figure is probably correct and roughly half the traders will be able to ask for exemption from accountability but, I understand, not from registration, and they will still be open to the full impact of Revenue investigation in that they must prove eligibility for exemption from accountability.  They may have a small advantage over the other half of their number in that the 2½ per cent will be calculated on the wholesale prices of what they buy.  They may have also the advantage that they will not need to keep monthly turnover accounts, but apart from that, the tax will still be collected on sales.  The Minister may lose a fraction over the change but I do not know if he has improved the Bill by doing this or made confusion worse confounded.</P>
      <P>Section 48 (1) of the Bill reads:</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners shall set up and maintain a register of persons who may become or who are accountable for tax and shall allot a registration number...</P>

    <P>The Minister for Finance is prepared on request to arrange for consultations with any party concerned who may have suggestions for variations in the general procedures described to meet the circumstances of particular classes of business.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been criticised for being somewhat incompletely briefed at the time of the Budget.  Surely at this. stage sufficient time has elapsed for the Department of Finance to have carried out all these consultations?

    <P>We are told that the tax will be calculated somewhat after this fashion: it will be payment monthly on the total gross receipts, plus estimated personal drawings, that is, drawings for goods and services for personal use, less exempt sales and less sales to other registered traders.  The point to which I would draw particular attention there is the word &ldquo;estimated&rdquo;.  Once the word &ldquo;estimated&rdquo; is introduced, one immediately conceives an agreement having to be arrived at between the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners. Estimated personal drawings, such as requirements for a man's household, are difficult items to vouch for. The trader's accounts will be audited, but no auditor can live with him to vouch that he uses so much or so little of a particular commodity.  Consequently, the whole pattern of investigation of income, a pattern with which we are all so familiar, will now be visited upon every citizen in our society who happens to be a trader.</P>
    <P>He will be compelled to employ an accredited auditor, spending a considerable sum of money in the process. The auditor will prepare his accounts. He will talk to the inspector of taxes on the telephone.  He will visit him in his office.  The trader will question <Col N="1508" /> the assessment and the matter will go for appeal before one of the Special Commissioners.  The Commissioner may make a minor adjustment.  All these traders will have to fight assessments largely based upon guesswork on the part of the inspector of taxes. A trader may be in the position that public speeches made by him as a member of RGDATA may be produced as evidence against him.</P>
    <P>Finally, he will have the right of appeal to a judge of the circuit court. His case will be heard <i>in camera.</i> No members of the public or the Press will be admitted.  A judge, without any knowledge of accountancy, will try to do justice to his case.  He will be regarded as guilty under the income tax code until he is proved innocent. He may be subjected to an oath, although the income tax inspector, or his assistant, will not be obliged to take an oath.  The judge, who may know the law, who may even know income tax law, but who is not an accountant and who is not in this country provided with accountancy advice, will make a judgment dividing the difference. If the trader still feels aggrieved, for no other reason than that he is in receipt of an income which is not strictly vouchable, and refuses to pay, his goods can be seized by the Revenue Commissioners; he can be sent to jail, but that jail sentence will not purge his indebtedness.  That will be the position facing every trader in the country once this turnover tax is passed and traders are registered under the Bill which will shortly be before this House.</P>
    <P>The Government have a moral obligation, I think, to go to the country on the question of this tax.  This is a fundamental change in taxation methods.  It is a radical change in fiscal policy.  It has other objectionable features.  There are certain reasons, quite substantial reasons, why the Government should seriously consider putting this issue before the electorate. First and foremost, it is an indiscriminate tax, indiscriminate in its application as regards the capacity of the taxpayer to pay.  It is a tax levied equally on the man with the expensive motor car and the inmate in the <Col N="1509" /> county home.  The latter must wear clothes; he must eat food.  Food will provide 50 per cent. of the revenue from this tax.  This is, indeed, a strange departure in policy in this country.</P>
    <P>When the inter-Party Government were in power, £9 million, £10 million or £11 million were devoted annually to subsidisation of food.  Now Fianna Fáil propose to introduce a tax to bring in £10 million, £5 million of which will come from food.  At the same time, we are spending £3½ million to ask people outside this country to eat our butter.  It is difficult to reconcile these two policies.  It is difficult to feel satisfied that we must tax our own people for eating our food and must subsidise foreigners for eating it.  As Deputy Dillon would say, it all sounds a little daft.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he does not give a damn what shopkeepers charge the consumers, provided he gets his 2½ per cent tax.  In that respect, again, we are departing from past policy position, for there was a time here when we had in operation a Fair Trade Commission under which there was some measure of control of prices after the war.  The Minister now entirely depends on trading competition. I agree with him that competition is an excellent thing and goes far to keep prices at a reasonable level, but when you have agitation starting and organisations planning together, there is always the risk, and every Government must face up to it, that there may be price fixing.  As Deputy Dunne says, there is no doubt about it that some traders, a small minority, I hope, will do a nice bit of profiteering under the umbrella of this tax, but this does not bother the Minister, so long as he gets his 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>My fourth reason for believing that it is sufficiently important to ask the Minister to go to the country about it is that it increases the cost of living. If it increases the cost of living, it must therefore be regarded as inflationary. In so far as money is being mopped up &mdash;there may be anti-inflation, in fact, in it&mdash;but if the general trend will be, as I fear, inflationary, then it will depress still further and make more <Col N="1510" /> difficult the export of goods from this country and we are already in a position of declining exports.</P>
    <P>My fifth reason for believing that a general election is called for on this issue is the result of the North-East Dublin by-election.  I will be told that by-elections are often a poor guide to public sentiment but this by-election was wellnigh a landslide.  It was a complete reversal in the largest constituency in the country for Fianna Fáil and the Fianna Fáil policy and it was fought&mdash;let there be no doubt about it&mdash;on this turnover tax.  All the literature I saw and, I am sure, all the speeches made, dealt largely with the question of the turnover tax.  If the Government are sensitive to public opinion, unless they have become hide-bound and indifferent, they have constitutional obligations in that regard; they have no option but to go to the people and ask for a mandate for this turnover tax.</P>
    <P>There is a sixth reason why there should be a general election on this issue.  This Government are a minority Government.  There is nothing wrong about that.  Throughout the years, about one-half of the Governments in this House have been Governments of minority Parties but a Government who have to exist upon the vote and on the sufferance of a half-tormented crackpot whom we have seen in operation in this House today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will conclude by asking the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and all members on the opposite side of this House to make up their minds to put this issue to a general election now rather than wait until a later stage when they will be forced to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that there are major issues involved in the consideration of this Finance Bill and that we have been treated to a discussion which has degenerated further and further into making small debating points.  I would probably have to plead guilty to that when I am finished myself because it is one of those things: when somebody opposite makes a debating point, one tends to make another one back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not lose sight of what is involved here for the future of this country.  It is perfectly clear to everybody that the revenue of the Government&mdash;whatever <Col N="1512" /> Government are in power&mdash;has, in recent years, depended to a most dangerous and unhealthy extent on three or four items, and that any change in the tastes of the people could cause the bankruptcy of the country, if we were to continue to allow our whole system of taxation to be based as it has been based heretofore.  Therefore, it seems obvious that it is the duty of whatever Government are in power to devise a method of taxation which will not be so vulnerable.  We may differ on the method of taxation we provide, but I do not think it can be seriously contested that some new system of taxation is required.</P>
    <P>In considering a new form of taxation, it should be clear that you must try to devise a system which will have a broad base, because if you have a system with a narrow base, you confine your new taxation system to a small section of the community.  Further, the rate of taxation would be so considerable as to lead, perhaps, to grave dislocation.  One of the advantages involved in the scheme proposed by the Government is that it is so broadly-based that the actual imposition of taxation on individuals&mdash;with certain exceptions, with which I shall deal in a moment&mdash;is negligible.</P>
    <P>There are certain sections of the community on which the imposition of this taxation will not be negligible, that is, the poorer sections of the community. The Government have put forward proposals in this Bill to assist not only the poorer sections of the community but almost half the population in such a way that they will almost certainly obtain as much as, or more than, they will have to pay out on foot of this new taxation.  I suggest to members of the Opposition that that is a rational and a fair approach.  It is one that tries to meet the obligations of the Government to the country, without being unfair to any section of the community.</P>
    <P>The Government have, as they have announced, further schemes for the expansion of education.  We want to extend our social services.  None of us is satisfied with them and there are many other schemes which are, I would <Col N="1513" /> say, urgently required.  Indeed, all Parties in the House say they want the social services extended.  In my short time as a member of the House, I have noticed that when almost any question comes up, the main theme of all the Opposition Parties is that not enough is provided.  It is when it comes to finding the money for these schemes that, politically speaking, we separate the men from the boys.  We find those who are sufficiently responsible to be considered capable of forming a Government, or an alternative Government, and we find those who are so irresponsible as to make it ludicrous to consider them as offering an alternative Government.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to Fine Gael that they are being rather shortsighted in their approach to this matter.  The people are not so foolish as to think that a Party can advocate increased expenditure on almost every item and oppose the Government's proposals for providing that increased expenditure and, at the same time, offering not even the remotest suggestion as to how they could do it.  That kind of thing does not present the public image of a Party capable of providing an alternative to the Government.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that in a full year the turnover tax will bring in some £10½ million.  That is not a small sum, and if we add to it a very conservative estimate of the cost of the various schemes which are being advocated by Deputy Dillon and his colleagues, we realise that Fine Gael visualise expenditure, at a minimum, of £50 million. That is a very conservative estimate. It must occur to anyone with reasonable intelligence that if a Party advocate that kind of expenditure, they must have given some thought to the problem of how the money will be found.  One assumes that there is sufficient responsibility in the ranks of Fine Gael to make them approach the matter in that manner.</P>
    <P>I can visualise the Fine Gael Party considering this problem.  They have three courses open to them.  They can cut down on expenditure, increase taxation or, as is more likely, do both. We have repeatedly asked the Fine <Col N="1514" /> Gael Party to tell the House and the people what their proposals are in this regard.  They have consistently refused to tell us and have said it is not the duty of the Opposition to suggest schemes of taxation.</P>

      <P>I suggest that, in fairness to the Fine Gael Party, one must assume they have given thought to this, that they have some general idea of how this money will be raised.  I am asking them to tell the country how they would raise it.  If they are not prepared to do that, they cannot blame us for drawing the conclusion that the proposals they have in mind would be so unpopular that they simply would not have a hope of being elected.  The alternative to that suggestion is that they have not thought about it at all. That would be even worse, and I am not assuming that, but I would invite subsequent Fine Gael speakers to let us in on this secret.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party at least in dealing with this did make one general suggestion.  They said we ought to confine this tax to luxuries.  While I do not think they have thought out what that means, what it means, in effect, is that we would be back to the situation in which the levies were imposed in 1956.</P>

If you say you will not make this a broadly-based tax, that you will put it only on luxuries, it must be borne in mind that we have not enough luxuries to stand a tax of £10½ million but even if we had, the rate of tax would be so enormous that it would put hundreds, <Col N="1517" /> if not thousands, of people out of work. That is the effect of imposing very large rates of taxation, whether you call them levies or taxes.  I would suggest that the Labour Party would do well to ponder on these results before they advocate this kind of taxation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not unduly worried by the interruptions but perhaps I might endeavour to enlighten my colleagues opposite on this question of the taxation of food.  We are all concerned with this question of taxes on essential foodstuffs.  None of us likes this idea, but if you want to be honest, you must consider what are the alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in regard to the proposals before the House, I am not arguing that this tax must go on any essential foodstuffs at all.  What I am saying is that it will not go on to all essential foodstuffs and it will not go on at 2½ per cent for reasons which have been gone into ad nauseam and which I do not intend to repeat.  What I do ask the Opposition to consider is this: if they say we should not tax these essential foodstuffs, have they any idea as to where we shall find the alternative? Are we to increase the rate and instead of having 2½ per cent, to make it five per cent or ten per cent on other items?  If that is advocated, the stage will be reached at which there will be the same economic effect as was suffered <Col N="1518" /> when the levies were imposed. People will be put out of employment and the shopkeepers who are worried about this will be even more worried. This is not something in regard to which you can draw a line and say it must be done this way or that way. All the implications must be studied. No method of imposing taxation is attractive.  The fairest one must be found, the one that will serve the best interests of the economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne was the next speaker after Deputy Crinion and he referred to what Deputy Crinion said in regard to the sale of a box of matches and as to how the turnover tax would be applied to a box of matches.  I was not here when Deputy Crinion spoke but from what Deputy Dunne said, I think I know what Deputy Crinion said.  He said it could be done by taking two matches out of the box. In actual fact, the proportion could be got by taking out one match.  Deputy Dunne visualised all the shopkeepers taking out thousands upon thousands of matches and the whole thing seemed to him asinine.  I must say that, as he visualised it, it was asinine but the fact of the matter is that this happened before when there were increases in cost.  The manufacturers of matches reduced the number of matches in the box.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Cod.  The box cost more than the matches and the smaller the number of matches, the greater the cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Donegan does not believe what I say, perhaps he will believe the evidence of his own eyes. If he looks at the number of matches in a box compared with five years ago, he will see there are fewer matches in it now.  This kind of thing can be done by arrangement, without causing any dislocation to the shopkeeper.  I am sure Deputy Crinion mentioned this as an example of the kind of thing that can be done to make this tax work smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are undoubtedly difficulties. There will always be difficulties in matters of this kind but unnecessary difficulties should not be created.  In <Col N="1519" /> the short term, it may appear that there are political dividends to be got by seeing that difficulties are created. I suggest that in the long term that may not be so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned one of his objections to this tax was that the rate could be so easily raised.  He referred to the fact that when this tax was introduced in Sweden, it was four per cent and that it was now six per cent. That is an objection which can be raised against any tax.  Once it is in operation, it is always possible for the Minister to raise it.  In fact, there is a temptation to the Minister to raise an existing tax.  For that reason, the Minister must have hesitated for a long time before he thought of embarking on a new scheme of taxation because it does involve lots of administrative difficulties but that is an objection which can be made to any tax.</P>
    <P>I see that Deputy Dillon has returned and perhaps I might refresh his memory in regard to a debate some time ago in this House on the White Paper, <i>Closing the Gap</i>, in which I, speaking at that time, said Deputy Dillon made a case that this was unfair because it asked that there be restraint in regard to wages and salaries and not in regard to profits.  Deputy Dillon replying, referred to what I said and made quite a point of it.  In fact, he alleged that I had made the best possible case against the White Paper.  He did, I think, misrepresent me somewhat. I want to recall this to him and to draw attention to the provision in this Bill in regard to profits.  I want to remind him of what he and his colleagues have been saying in regard to this Bill, in regard to what is now being done and the additional taxation on profits.  I would ask him not to blow hot and cold on these items.</P>
    <P>If he wants to take the line that we should be restraining profits, that is all right, but he should not be complaining one day that profits are not restrained and another day complaining that we are restraining them and taxing them and making it impossible for people to make profits.  In fact, if <Col N="1520" /> one were to believe Fine Gael, we are going to put most people out of business. I want to refer to a matter mentioned by Deputy Sweetman.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman and one of his colleagues, and perhaps more, referred to the by-election in Dublin North-East.  He said that Deputy Colley, Deputy Timmons&mdash; and he may have said the Minister for Justice&mdash;were understandably anxious to ensure that there should not be a general election because of the results in Dublin North-East.  Well, now, I suppose, like all Deputies, I am not anxious to have a general election but I can assure Deputy Sweetman that I am not too fearful about it either because I believe that if the country is given a choice between a Fianna Fáil Government and a Fine Gael or Coalition Government, it will not necessarily hesitate in its choice.  I also believe, and this has been said by Fine Gael speakers <i>ad nauseam</i>, that the issue in the by-election was the turnover tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can anybody give us an example of an electorate in a general election or a by-election coldly and calmly going in to vote for an additional tax?  It is almost like asking them to vote coldly and calmly to go to war.  Whatever Fine Gael may say, the general feeling of the public is that the by-election figures do not bear the interpretation which Fine Gael understandably tried to put on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> Deputy Sweetman referred to a previous by-election in that constituency and said that it had been stated that by-elections are notoriously inaccurate and that Governments tend to lose by-elections.  I think he said that the inter-Party Government won the by-election in that constituency in 1956.  I looked up the figures for that by-election and I found that between 1954 and 1956, the time of the previous general election, Fine Gael lost 10,000 votes.  In calculating that, I have included only those people who were supporters of the Party. There were a number of candidates who had never got into Dáil Éireann and therefore one could not say what they would have done.  I ignored all those and took only inter-Party supporters and found they lost 10,000 votes in those two years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman pointed out that Fianna Fáil first preferences had gone down by 6,500 in the last by-election, which was approximately correct.  He suggested that in these circumstances the Government had no option but to get out and that the people did not want them.  I ask what did Deputy Sweetman do when he found that his Government had lost 10,000 votes?</P>

      <P>Deputy S. Dunne is not known as a very ardent supporter of this Government but there are some people here who will have heard the Deputy say that although he intends to vote against the Government on the turnover tax, he does not believe that the country wants this Government to change or that it wants a general election and that all the people he has been talking to made it quite clear that they do not want a general election or a change of Government.  That is not coming from a Fianna Fáil member or supporter and I suggest that it reflects much more accurately the true position than what we have been hearing from Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest, for those people who are worried about how this tax will operate, that like every other tax, it will have some rough edges which will have to be smoothed out, but like every other tax it will be found, when it has been operating for some time, that the Government will be quite prepared, I have no doubt, to review the position reasonably and any anomalies that have appeared will be dealt with as they always are on occasions such as this.  All the various flights of imagination we have had on this proposed tax have produced singularly few anomalies. Some in fact have already been <Col N="1523" /> dealt with but undoubtedly others will appear later and will, I am quite sure, be dealt with.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would suggest that the people should remember what happened not so long ago.  The general feeling is this: &ldquo;We do not like the turnover tax because we do not like being taxed but we would much rather, if put to the test, have a tax than no turnover.&rdquo; They feel confident that if they do not have the present Government in power, there is a danger that there will be no turnover.  I suggest that shopkeepers, workers and employers of all kinds who have not considered it in this way would do well to do so.  I would suggest also that the Fine Gael Party would do well to consider the likely results of people thinking like that and not be too precipitate in case they might force a general election and might regret it.</P>

      <P>They also thought it was a good idea not to wear tall hats when going to meet British Ministers and to slaughter the calves, but those are not the ideas that we will put before the people.  The people fell for those ideas but they did not fall for the turnover tax in North-East Dublin.  I heard a Deputy make an extraordinary statement when Deputy Browne was speaking.  He said things were never better in the west of Ireland.  I heard another Deputy say that you would not see a bicycle outside a church or in a market town in this country because everybody now had a motor car.  It is very difficult to put up a case for one's constituency when such statements are made in this House.</P>
      <P>The reaction to this Budget is not good and, unless, like the ostrich, we have our heads stuck in the sand, we should realise that by now.  It is sometimes popular to blame a Government for all the ills that befall a people at a particular time but it is not for such reasons that I have criticisms to offer. It is for the reason of the effects this Finance Bill will have on the people of my constituency.  I cannot see, and I doubt if anybody else can, the reason for those new taxes on essentials, especially the essentials of the poorer classes of our people, food, clothing and fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that the Fianna Fáil Party have a mania for going after those essentials in order to collect money in the easy way, without any reference to the capacity of the people to pay.  Not many years ago they attacked these essentials by removing the food subsidies.  In doing so, they raked in about £9 million and they had that money, which the last inter-Party Government had not got. Together with that, they had other sources such as the income from the Prize Bonds which has now reached a substantial figure.  That scheme was <Col N="1525" /> sponsored by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that the cost of living has soared by about 25 points since 1956 or 1957, it would seem from this new turnover tax that it is the deliberate policy of the Government to force the cost of living still higher.  A question was asked today if there would be a tax on coffins and the answer was &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I should like now to ask if there is a tax on a cradle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>A cradle is essential and a coffin is essential and between the cradle and the coffin, you must have the essentials of food, fuel and clothing.  All the essentials are taxed now and the sad part about it is that the poor person is taxed just the same as the rich person.  The net has been thrown very wide indeed and its meshes are so very fine that even the poorest cannot escape.</P>
      <P>How will this tax affect my constituency? We have 17,000 holdings there, 13,000 of which are under £21 valuation.  The people in the area are made up chiefly of small farmers and, as we know, in the small farms of the west, there are large families.  These large families must be fed and clothed. Consequently, I can see more than a fair share of this new burden falling on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said already, in the final analysis, this tax will make a tax gatherer out of every shopkeeper, even though a pamphlet issued today assures us to the contrary.  When the Budget proposals were issued I was confused, as were many others as far as I can gather, and despite the fact that the floodgates of confusion were opened then, I do not think this pamphlet to which I have referred has done anything to close them.  This turnover tax will finish the small traders, because according to present indications they will have to enter into murderous price-cutting competition with the supermarts and self-service shops.  According to my reading of the <Col N="1526" /> Bill, more self-service shops will spring up in order to reduce their overheads and there will be wholesale cutting out of small traders.  We must also take into consideration here the dwindling population through increasing emigration from the west.</P>

      <P>There is another aspect I have not mentioned.  This Bill will undoubtedly cause an increase in rates.  Rates in my constituency, and generally throughout the country, are becoming an intolerable burden.  In fact, they are intolerable already in my constituency where the people have never been given a chance to improve their economy, where the land is bad, where the roads are poor and emigration high.  In that regard, I should like now to quote some figures for Deputy Booth's benefit.  I attended a meeting in Charlestown about a fortnight ago concerning the economy of small farmers in the west and an effort to stem emigration.</P>

This tax makes the burden still more intolerable. Last year, the Minister recognised the gravity of the situation and gave some relief but that relief has all been taken away in the recent Budget. People had expected some relief in respect of health services but instead they have got a financial instrument which will only increase the charges by local authorities for these services.</P>
